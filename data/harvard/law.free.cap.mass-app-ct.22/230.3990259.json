The first complaint charged (see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also \u00a7 53<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) that the defendant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>February <em>4, </em>1985, in Brockton, \u201cdid unlawfully solicit or receive compensation for soliciting for a prostitute.\u201d A second complaint charged (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53) that on February 21, 1985, also in Brockton, the defendant was \u201ca common night-walker, habitually walking in the streets in the night-time for the purpose of prostitution.\u201d The defendant was convicted of both charges at a bench trial in the Brockton District Court and sentenced to two concurrent one-month terms in a house of correction. She appealed to the jury session of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">There she filed a motion to dismiss the complaints alleging discriminatory enforcement of the relevant statutes (see notes 1 and 2, <em>supra). </em>This motion was accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant and also by an affidavit of the defendant\u2019s counsel. The defendant\u2019s affidavit asserted that, when she was arrested, no male person was arrested with her on either charge, and that \u201cthe practice of the Brockton [pjolice [department is to arrest female prostitutes and to decline to arrest male customers and male prostitutes.\u201d Attached to her affidavit were four pages of lists of arrests by the Brockton police for prostitution, for soliciting prostitution, and for being a common nightwalker, showing the results set out in the margin, for a period of about one year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A District Court judge (not the judge who had presided at the defendant\u2019s bench trials) held an evidentiary hearing on June 14, 1985. No opposing affidavits, filed in behalf of the prosecution, appear in the record appendix. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a)(2) and(3), 378Mass. 871-872(1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">One Brockton police detective, called by the defendant, testified<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> about the department\u2019s typical methods of surveillance of female suspects on certain streets in Brockton. These methods involve observation of (a) males in motor vehicles being waved at by females on the street, (b) the female entering the vehicle and driving off with the male, and (c) both returning after an interval, and then (d) a repetition of the process with a different male. The detective testified that, in such circumstances, \u201cordinarily\u201d the police do not arrest the driver of the vehicle, or \u201cradio ahead to another unit\u201d to make an arrest. In cases where the vehicle is followed, and a \u201csexual act is [found] going on,\u201d only the female is arrested. This defendant, when the detective arrested her on February 4, 1985, was performing fellatio on the male then in the vehicle. The male was not arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Defense counsel in an attempt further to show discrimination inquired about a later arrest of another alleged female night-walker. Upon objection the judge praised the \u201ccandid and forthright\u201d testimony of the detective, and said that the officer has \u201cindicated that they\u2019re searching for female nightwalkers.\u201d In answer to an inquiry by the judge whether it was department policy not to arrest the male on prostitution related charges, the detective replied, \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a male arrested . . . since we\u2019ve been working on the prostitution area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">As to the offense of being a nightwalker charged as taking place on February 21, 1985, the detective testified that they saw \u201cseveral males leaving with\u201d the defendant \u201cat different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>times.\u201d Not one of these males was arrested. On one occasion they \u201cdid radio ahead that the car in which . . . [the defendant] was a passenger was to be stopped.\u201d This was done. The male operator of the vehicle was not arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor received one answer that when the detective made an arrest on \u201ca soliciting charge and there\u2019s a male present . . . it\u2019s . . . general policy that you don\u2019t arrest the male.\u201d The detective stated the basic reason for the policy was that complaints from area citizens related \u201cmainly [to] the girls,\u201d and that the women arrested are known to the police, whereas the males are not \u201cfamiliar\u201d to the police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">1. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, 374 </em>Mass. 5,15,19-22 (1977), decided, of course, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 53A in 1983, the Supreme Judicial Court dealt under the earlier statutory law with somewhat the same situation now presented. The opinion (at 15) refers to \u201c[prostitution\u201d as comprising \u201cconduct of all persons, male and female, who engage in sexual activity as a business,\u201d and c. 272, \u00a7 53, as applying \u201cto male prostitutes as well as female prostitutes.\u201d It went on (at 16) to suggest that \u201ceven if the prostitution provision [of \u00a7 53] were held to apply only to women, it would not be considered discriminatory since there are other [statutory and common law] crimes which in essence charge males with the same offense under different wording.\u201d See, e.g., G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35; but see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, 366 </em>Mass. 298, 300-302 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The opinion (at 16) then stated that the term \u201cprostitution\u201d did not \u201cinclude the conduct of persons who hire . . . another to engage in sexual activity.\u201d It, on that account, did not accept the contention (by the female defendants in the cases then considered) that \u00a7 53 as thus defined \u201cunconstitutionally criminalizes female conduct but not male conduct\u201d in violation of art. 106 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>monwealth, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), adopted in 1976. The decision stated \u201cthat \u00a7 53 was designed to attack merely one phase of a problem,\u201d citing <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955). As to discriminatory enforcement, the <em>King </em>opinion (at 17) said that the then defendants\u2019 contention (in the opinion of a majority of the court) \u201cfails because they [the' female prostitute defendants] presented no evidence to show that their customers were not arrested and prosecuted\u201d and, particularly (at 18) \u201cwhen there is no statutory provision for the prosecution of the customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">After further discussion of art. 106 of the Amendments, the opinion concluded (at 19), \u201c[A] female charged with prostitution or night walking would be entitled to a dismissal of the charges with prejudice on an appropriate showing that the police department or the prosecutor\u2019s office followed an unjustifiable policy of selective enforcement against female prostitutes and not male prostitutes\u201d (subject to n.ll which pointed out that prosecution of males need not charge prostitution, but may charge related crimes).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The author of the <em>King </em>opinion (in a separate opinion) pointed out (at 23) that he would broaden the opinion to assert, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>74 Wis. 2d 169 (1976), \u201cthat unlawful discrimination in enforcement can be proved by a showing that the police department or prosecutor\u2019s office followed an unjustifiable policy of prosecuting prostitutes and not their customers,\u201d which could be treated as sex-based on \u201ca showing that most prostitutes are women and most customers are males.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">2. After the <em>King </em>case, 374 Mass. 5, was decided, the views expressed in the separate opinion in that case were given support by the 1983 statute, now found in c. 272, \u00a7 53A (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>The broad form of \u00a7 53A provided the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>criminalization of acts of the prostitute\u2019s customers which was thought to be absent in the <em>King </em>case. We think that the somewhat \u201carchaic\u201d language of \u00a7 53, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 598-599 (1975), must now be read together with the clear words of \u00a7 53A in determining the present legislative intention. The evidence and uncontroverted affidavits (already summarized), before the judge on the motion to dismiss, abundantly supplied the proof of intentional discrimination between the female prostitute and her male customers, treated as lacking in the <em>King </em>case, 374 Mass, at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">3. We are of opinion that the judge correctly concluded that the proof made before him warranted dismissal of the complaints because they were the product of an \u201carbitrary or unequal application of impartial laws.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>376 Mass. 885, 894 (1978). There it was said (at 894, citations omitted): \u201cBecause we presume that criminal prosecutions are undertaken in good faith, without intent to discriminate, the defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating selective enforcement.... [T]o meet this burden, the defendant must present evidence which raises at least a reasonable inference of impermissible discrimination .... The defendant must show [1] that a broader class of persons than those prosecuted has violated the law ... [2] that failure to prosecute was either consistent or deliberate . . . and [3] that the decision not to prosecute was based on an impermissible classification such as race, religion, or <em>sex\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). We think each of the three mentioned requisites of the defendant\u2019s proof was satisfied by the material before the trial judge. See the requirement of \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d under the State ERA mentioned in <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 666 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The opinion (in the <em>Franklin </em>case) then continued (at 895); \u201cWe stated as dictum in [the] <em>King </em>[case] and now we hold that once a defendant has raised a reasonable inference of selective prosecution, the Commonwealth must rebut that inference or suffer dismissal of the underlying complaint. At that point, and where it appears that the government is in ready possession of the facts, it is not unreasonable to require the</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>government to come forward with evidence and to make its records and evidence available.\u201d This the prosecution did not do in the present cases and thus nothing was before the judge (or now is before us even by affidavit) which controverts the essentially uncontradicted proof of police practices on which the judge relied. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 233 (1983), where, after reviewing significantly conflicting testimony about enforcement in Lynn of the Sunday closing laws, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s evidence fails to raise a reasonable inference that any decision not to prosecute its competitors was based on a police policy not to enforce the laws unless a competitor complained.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing complaints affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-14\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53A, inserted by St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 2, reads: \u201cAny person who engages, agrees to engage, or offers to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee, or any person who pays, agrees to pay or offers to pay another person to engage in sexual conduct, or to agree to engage in sexual conduct with another natural person may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by both such f\u00edne and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-15\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 1, reads: \u201cCommon night walkers, common street walkers, both male and female, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>common railers and brawlers, persons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior . . . and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"> Arrests by Brockton police for prostitution and related offenses June 6, 1984, to May 10, 1985, were compiled (by a process described in the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney) from police department computer records.
