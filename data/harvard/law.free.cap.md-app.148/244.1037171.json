In this zoning case, the Board, adopting a decision by a Zoning Hearing Examiner, rejected an interpretation of the deceptively innocuous phrase \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d by the Harford County development regulations sought by Bel Air Realty Associates Limited Partnership in connection with Bel Air\u2019s intent to develop a subdivision that qualifies for classification of \u201cconventional with open space.\u201d For the reasons that follow, our interpretation of the phrase \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d necessitates the reversal of the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Bel Air Realty owns a 24.7 acre parcel of land (\u201cProperty\u201d) that is located in Harford County and situated just north of the town of Bel Air, near the intersection of Business U.S. Route 1, known as Conowingo Road, and the U.S. Route 1 \u201cBel Air\u201d bypass. The Property lies adjacent to a development named the \u201cHickory Overlook\u201d subdivision. Both properties were originally zoned \u201cORI\u201d (Office, Research, Industrial). On April 18, 1995, a zoning hearing examiner reclassified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>both projects from \u201cORI\u201d to \u201cR-3\u201d (residential). Bel Air Realty, in its efforts to develop the parcel, arranged with the Hickory Overlook developer to use a main road in the latter subdivision, Overlook Way, to access Business Route 1. The northern boundary of the Property abuts the Route 1 Bypass, but frontage access to this highway was denied by the Maryland State Highway Administration. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1977, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-620(c) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Bel Air continues to pursue development of the Property in question, and now seeks approval from the Harford County Department of Planning and Zoning to develop its Property as a \u201cconventional with open space (COS)\u201d subdivision under Section 267-46 of the Harford County Zoning Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a designation would enable it to develop the Property at a greater density than that permitted for conventional R-3 development alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">To this end, Bel Air requested that the Department provide an \u201cinterpretation\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that its project satisfied the prerequisites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>for COS approval. Specifically, the Department was asked to decide whether the Property would be deemed to be \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d to Business Route 1 for purposes of satisfying the Section 267-46B(4)(b) requirement for such access. In the alternative, Bel Air sought a variance from the requirements for a COS development.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">A hearing on Bel Air\u2019s application for an interpretation was convened before a Zoning Hearing Examiner on June 12, 19, and 26, 2000. On September 21, the hearing examiner issued her decision, concluding that the project was not \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d to Business Route 1, thus ruling that it would not qualify for development with COS status. Bel Air\u2019s request for a variance from the requirements of Section 267-46B(4)(b) was withdrawn at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On December 5, 2000, the Harford County Council, sitting as the Board of Appeals, ratified and adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s decision in all respects. Bel Air filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Harford County. Maryland Rule. 7-201. <em>See </em>Harford County Code, \u00a7 A274-6. On September 13, 2001, the circuit court reversed the Board\u2019s decision and remanded this matter for further proceedings. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The salient and dispositive issue in this appeal is whether Bel Air\u2019s project is \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d from at least one \u201cexisting or planned arterial or collector road[ <em>viz. </em>Business Route 1, as a matter of law. If the answer to this is \u201cyes,\u201d then the circuit court correctly overturned the Board\u2019s conclusion to the contrary. Appellant People\u2019s Counsel contends that the court was wrong, and urges that we vacate the court\u2019s order and uphold the Board. In assigning error to the circuit court\u2019s decision, appellant further avers that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ignored the longstanding interpretation of the Zoning Code by the Department of Planning and Zoning, the agency charged with its administration and enforcement. Bel Air Realty urges that we affirm. It challenges the administrative interpretations of the Zoning Code, and points out inconsistencies in the Department\u2019s application of this rule as one factor that undermines its validity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">PERTINENT FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The parties more or less agree that this appeal raises a purely legal question. Nevertheless, being careful never to express ourselves more clearly than we are able to think, we will rehearse those facts which may be pertinent to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Craig Ward, a consulting civil engineer and urban land planner, and qualified as an expert in these fields, testified on behalf of Bel Air Realty. He had been a consultant for the developer, and had \u201cbeen involved\u201d with this property since 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In 1995, both the Hickory Overlook property and Bel Air property were reclassified from ORI to R-3. Ward recalled that the Bel Air Realty and Hickory Overlook projects had always been linked by the Department of Planning and Zoning, and testified that, at the least, the development of these two subdivisions would be coordinated.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Ward chronicled the unsuccessful attempts by developers to obtain access for the property to the U.S. Route 1 Bypass. Having failed to gain access to Route 1, Bel Air Realty\u2019s project could only reach the Route 1 alternative \u2014 the original, or \u201cold,\u201d U.S. Route 1 known as \u201cBusiness Route 1\u201d \u2014 over Overlook Way, a 36-feet wide paved roadway through the Hickory Overlook development. Ward testified that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sign characteristics for a primary \u201cresidential road,\u201d such as Overlook Way, and an \u201carterial road\u201d and \u201ccollector road\u201d are the same. He further opined that Overlook Way would provide direct access between minor residential roads and collectors, thus fulfilling the \u201cdirect access\u201d requirement of Section 267-46B(4)(b). Ward stressed that Overlook Way had been designed to provide access to the Bel Air development.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Ward described three other developments in Harford County \u2014 Spenceola, Deer Spring and Woodland Run \u2014 which, he opined, have access characteristics that are similar to Bel Air Realty\u2019s property, in that they, too, are separated from qualifying roads by intervening properties. These developments have each been classified as COS. Ward explained that if the Bel Air property did not attain COS approval, it would only be developed into a community with single family detached lots\u2014 not the optimal use of this land. He stressed that the infrastructure had been planned for multi-family use;</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Lee Cunningham, an expert in the fields of land use and transportation planning, agreed.with Ward\u2019s assertion that Overlook Way renders the Bel Air property \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d to Business Route 1. Cunningham thought that the Code imposed no requirement that a COS development, such as that proposed by Bel Air Realty, actually abut or front on an arterial road to have direct access thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Anthony McClune presented the views of the Department of Planning and Zoning. McClune, manager of the Department\u2019s Division of Land Use Management, testified that a conventional with open space development would be subject to the \u201cSpecial Development design criteria within the [Zoning] Code.\u201d He emphasized that a \u201cproject\u201d must be directly accessible from a collector or arterial road as a predicate for COS qualification. McClune stressed that this requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>meant that a project\u2019s access to a qualifying roadway be \u201cimmediate,\u201d and not through another existing project, such as Hickory Overlook.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">McClune explained that the \u201cdirect access\u201d requirement would prevent ingress to a high-density project, such as the COS development sought here, through a lower-density project such as Hickory Overlook:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">We believe the intention of that Section of the Code was to basically make sure that the higher density projects that have more flexibility in housing types would basically be able to be immediately accessible to the collector or arterial road and not have these projects ... access through existing established communities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">He testified that Overlook Way is neither an arterial nor a collector road, but is, and was designed to be, a \u201clocal road,\u201d which is intended to \u201ccollect!] and distribute traffic within subdivisions and provide direct access to individual land uses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">McClune described Hickory Overlook as a COS development with frontage on U.S. Route 1 and internal streets. He added that Bel Air\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdirect access\u201d would allow any \u201cproject\u201d to meet the threshold requirement for direct access for a COS, provided it had <em>any </em>access to a local road. <em>Id. </em>McClune concluded that, \u201cfor projects to go COS they must be immediately accessible to the arterial road. Frontage on [a] primary residential road does not grant the ability for a COS project.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>McClune was vigorously cross-examined about three projects that appeared not to have satisfied the \u201cdirect access\u201d requirement, but which were nevertheless approved for COS development: Spenceola, Deer Creek, and Woodland Run. McClune explained that these projects were connected, or incorporated, in some manner to a larger development, with common ownership or unified planning, and were approved as part of a larger development, or \u201cconcept plan,\u201d which larger development qualified because it abutted on an arterial or collector road.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">McClune explained the Department\u2019s position in terms of land use planning, opining that [hjigher density projects basically should be located so that basically there is a road network that gets them out to an arterial or collector road.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">I don\u2019t think it would be good land use planning to have lower density developments with local roads going through them and somewhere in the back higher density developments basically accessing through them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Additional facts as may be necessary for the resolution of the issue on appeal will be set forth in our Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Initially, we address the matter of our jurisdiction. The circuit court\u2019s reversal of the Board\u2019s decision, and accompanying remand for further administrative proceedings, constitutes a final appealable order. In <em>People\u2019s Counsel for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Baltimore County v. Country Ridge Shopping Center, Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 580, 799 A.2d 425 (2002), Judge Moylan encountered the question of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction under similar circumstances, and reiterated that a circuit court\u2019s remand to an administrative agency for further proceedings satisfies the \u201cfinal order\u201d predicate because the circuit court\u2019s remand \u201c \u2018terminates the judicial proceeding!.]\u2019 \u201d 144 Md.App. at 591, 799 A.2d at 432 (quoting <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 6, 432 A.2d 1319, 1323 (1981)). This appeal is timely. We therefore have jurisdiction over the circuit court\u2019s order. Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301, 12-308 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">II. Decisions Below</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The hearing examiner accepted the Department\u2019s interpretation of Section 276-46B(4)(b), as presented by the hearing testimony of Anthony McClune, Manager, Division of Land Use Management, Department of Planning and Zoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Mr. McClune noted, in accord with the dictionary (and common sense) meaning of \u201cdirect\u201d, that the Department also looks to see if the project, taken as a whole, has direct (i.e. \u201cimmediate\u201d, \u201cthe shortest way\u201d, \u201cwith nothing or no one between\u201d! ]) access to a collector or arterial roadway. The facts here are clear, the subject property does not have such direct access. In fact, the State Highway Administration denied the property direct access to Business Route 1. The Hickory Overlook subdivision is between the subject property and Business Route 1. The subject property is not part of the Hickory Overlook project and therefore, the subject property cannot be considered to be directly accessible to Business Route 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In concluding that direct access to Business Route 1 had not been achieved in this instance, the hearing examiner referred to the definition of \u201cdirect\u201d as set forth in <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(2d College ed.1976), to ascertain that the commonly accepted meaning of \u201cdirect\u201d included \u201cnothing or no one between; immediate; close, firsthand.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The hearing examiner was not converted by the developer\u2019s argument that direct access to Business Route 1 was achieved because Overlook Way was \u201cunobstructed.\u201d Nor was she persuaded by Bel Air\u2019s reliance on the Zoning Code\u2019s definition of \u201cPrimary Residential Road,\u201d as Overlook Way is characterized, as a way which provides \u201cdirect access between minor residential roads and collectors.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The hearing examiner further concluded that an acceptance of Bel Air\u2019s argument would effectively entitle any project to COS classification as long as it could reach an arterial or connector roadway through an adjoining subdivision. She reasoned that this approach would thus \u201crender the requirement of \u2018direct\u2019 accessibility ... superfluous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On Bel Air\u2019s appeal, the circuit court reversed the Board\u2019s decision, rejecting the view that \u201cdirect access\u201d required a project to abut or front on an artery or collector road. The circuit court noted that the Code does not define<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the phrase \u201cdirectly accessible,\u201d but concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Applying the principles of statutory construction ... there can be no doubt that [Bel Air\u2019s] property has direct access to Route 1 across Overlook Way. Overlook Way is a county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>road. Overlook Way is not obstructed in any way. The county\u2019s own definition of access describes it as an unobstructed way or means of approach to provide entry to or exit from a property. Overlook Way indeed provides entry to and exit from Appellant\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">The position that a property can only be directly accessible if it abuts the road contradicts the definition of road, arterial road, collector road and local road in Section 267-4 of the Zoning Code. For example, road is \u201c... intended for motor vehicle traffic and provides a princip[al] means of access to property.\u201d Local road is \u201ca road which collects and distributes traffic within the subdivisions and provides direct access to individual land uses. Local roads may include primary and minor residential roads as well as business/industrial roads.\u201d Similar definitions are used for collector and arterial roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The circuit court also observed, somewhat critically, that the Department\u2019s intent to limit the flow of traffic from higher density projects through a lower density subdivision, to prevent \u201cstacking\u201d of subdivisions, was inconsistent with its policy of granting exceptions in cases where the projects were combined for approval in a unified concept plan. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. The treatment of these projects by the Department of Planning and Zoning detracted from the authority of its view that \u201cdirect access\u201d meant access to a qualifying road from an adjacent property.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In the final analysis, the court found \u201cas a matter of law, that the Zoning Hearing Examiner\u2019s legal conclusion as to the meaning of the term directly accessible was in error.\u201d It ruled instead that the Bel Air project is \u201cdirectly accessible to Route 1 over a public road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">On the People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s appeal from the circuit court\u2019s order, we review the Board\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>relying on the \u201csame statutory standards as [did] the circuit court.\u201d <em>Maryland Division of Labor and Industry v. Triangle General Contractors, Inc., </em>366 Md. 407, 416, 784 A.2d 534, 539 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>(2001). <em>See Country Ridge, </em>144 Md.App. at 591, 799 A.2d at 432 (reviewing court effectively looks through circuit court\u2019s action toward decision by Board of Appeals); <em>accord, Heard v. Foxshire Associates, LLC, </em>145 Md.App. 695, 699, 806 A.2d 348, 350 (2002) (appellate court reviews issues as did circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence based on the record as a whole and whether the Board\u2019s decision accords with applicable law. <em>See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999); <em>Eller Media Company v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>141 Md.App. 76, 83-84, 784 A.2d 614, 618 (2001). <em>See also Blakehurst Life Care Community v. Baltimore County, </em>146 Md.App. 509, 517, 807 A.2d 179, 184 (2002). In conducting our review, we are limited to the record developed before the agency. <em>See Erb v. Maryland Dept. of the Envi</em>r<em>onment, </em>110 Md.App. 246, 266, 676 A.2d 1017, 1028 (1996). In <em>Eger v. Stone, </em>253 Md. 533, 253 A.2d 372 (1969), the Court of Appeals emphasized, with respect to judicial review of agency determinations of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">We have made it quite clear that if the issue before the administrative body is \u201cfairly debatable\u201d, that is, that its determination involved testimony from which a reasonable man could come to different conclusions, the courts will not substitute their judgment for that of the \u2022 administrative body, in the absence of an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use without the payment of just compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">253 Md. at 542, 253 A.2d at 377. <em>See also White v. North, </em>356 Md. 31, 44, 736 A.2d 1072, 1079-80 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Our standard of review subsumes the concept of judicial restraint. In conducting our review, we defer to those findings of the Board that are supported by the record and consider the Board\u2019s decision as <em>prima facie </em>correct and presumptively valid. <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">With respect to statutory interpretation, we will likewise defer in the appropriate case to an agency\u2019s interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tation and application of its organic statute. <em>See id. </em>Thus, our scope of review is rather circumscribed. <em>Eastern Outdoor Advertising Co. v.

Agencies are too often chided for maladroit interpretations. We will apply the same principles of statutory construction to the Harford County Code as are required in the interpretation of any statute or regulation. <em>See Young v. Anne Arundel County, </em>146 Md.App. 526, 573, 807 A.2d 651, 679 (2002) (citing <em>Howard Research and Development Corp. v. Concerned Citizens for the Columbia Concept, </em>297 Md. 357, 364, 466 A.2d 31, 34 (1983)). Because this appeal requires us to construe the language of the Zoning Code, \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of [statutory construction] is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent.\u201d <em>The Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>371 Md. 243, 252, 808 A.2d 795, 800 (2002). <em>See Marriott Employees Federal Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>346 Md. 437, 444, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997). In order to ascertain the Council\u2019s intent, we begin with the pertinent language of the Zoning Code, and ordinarily will not venture beyond its clear and explicit terms. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">We owe no deference when the agency\u2019s conclusions are premised on an error of law. <em>See Alviani v. Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 109, 775 A.2d 1234, 1242 (2001). <em>Cf. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 118, 771 A.2d 1051, 1057 (2001) (citations omitted) (completely subject to review; some deference accorded). \u201cIn such a case the Court\u2019s review \u2018is expansive, that is, the appellate court may substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harford County, Maryland v. McDonough, </em>74 Md.App. 119, 122, 536 A.2d 724, 725 (1988) (quoting <em>Gray v. Anne Arundel County, </em>73 Md.App. 301, 309, 533 A.2d 1325, 1329 (1987)). But the administrator\u2019s \u201cexpertise should be taken into consideration and its decision should be afforded appropriate deference in our analysis of whether it was \u2018premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 173, 783 A.2d 169, 178 (2001) (quoting <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380). <em>See State Ethics </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Commission v.

Reading the zoning code as a whole, appellant maintains that a project whose required access must pass through another subdivision to reach a qualifying road does not have \u201cdirect access\u201d thereto. Citing the definition of the term \u201caccess\u201d at Section 267.4 as an \u201c[ujnobstructed way or means of approach,\u201d in combination with the dictionary<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> meaning of the term \u201cdirect\u201d (\u201cnothing or no one in between; immediate; close, firsthand\u201d), appellant asserts that the Bel Air project fails to measure up to the standard. Appellant further contends that the circuit court ignored the \u201clong-standing\u201d interpretation of Section 267-46 by the Department of Planning and Zoning, the agency charged with its administration, urging that the Department has consistently \u201cinterpreted the statute in a uniform fashion, one consistent with its suggested interpretation in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Bel Air retorts that the Board\u2019s reliance on McClune\u2019s testimony to hold that the Bel Air property is not directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>accessible to Route 1 is misplaced. It denigrates McClune\u2019s failure to support Ms interpretation of Section 267-47B(4)(b) with legislative history, and points out that McClune\u2019s testimony conflicts with prior interpretations of the Code by the Department of Planning and Zoning. Bel Air Realty criticizes the Hearing Examiner\u2019s failure to consider that Overlook Way is a \u201cPrimary Residential Road,\u201d which by definition \u201c[provides direct access between minor residential roads and collection and minimal direct driveway access to abutting properties.\u201d <em>See </em>Zoning Code \u00a7 267-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Bel Air relies on the unambiguous definition of \u201caccess\u201d in the Code to support its position that Overlook Way \u201caffords an unobstructed way or means of approach to provide entry to or exit from the Subject Property.\u201d <em>See </em>Section 267-4. Bel Air, like a contemporary Cassandra, predicts that the Department\u2019s view will effectively add surplusage to the Code under its interpretation of Section 267-46B(4)(b). Prediction, however, is very difficult, especially about the future. Bel Air reasons that, because the County Council has specified a \u201cfrontage requirement\u201d for other types of developments, such as shopping centers, schools, camps and mobile home parks, then Section 267-46B(4)(b) would likewise contain specific language imposing a \u201cfrontage\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The developer also asserts that language in the Zoning Code requiring that certain uses have access \u201cfrom\u201d an arterial or collector road indicates that the County Council, had it intended to impose in the same legislation a \u201cfrontage\u201d prerequisite for a COS project to be \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d to a qualifying road, would have used the same language in its enactment of the Zoning Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We are not persuaded by Bel Air\u2019s reliance on other provisions of the Zoning Code to dictate an interpretation of Section 267-46B(4)(b). For example, we see no inconsistency between the <em>explicit </em>frontage requirements for certain shopping centers (300 feet, Section 267-47B(l)), mobile home parks (200 feet, Section 267 \u2014 48C( 1)(b)), camps (200 feet, Section 267-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>53F(2)(b)), or schools (300 feet, Section 267-53C(7)(a)[2]), and the \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d criterion for COS developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">We have carefully reviewed Bel Air\u2019s argument with respect to the access language for special exceptions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and agree that it has force. Nevertheless, we are not convinced that the access standards for certain special exception institutions would dictate the interpretation sought by Bel Air in this case. We note that the County Council amended the accessibility criterion for housing for the elderly and for \u201cContinuing Care Retirement Communities\u201d specifically to allow such communities to meet the \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d standard when such access is obtained only by a residential road. <em>See </em>Sections 267-49B(4)(b), 267-49.l.A(4). Under the circumstances here, this is a clear indication of the legislature\u2019s view of the meaning of the phrase \u201cdirectly accessible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We disagree with the circuit court\u2019s determination that the decision of the Board cannot be sustained. The Zoning Code explicitly dictates that the project be <em>directly </em>accessible. The circuit court and Bel Air Realty effectively maintain that \u201caccess\u201d alone satisfies this requirement, because the court\u2019s holding is based on the fact that \u201cOverlook Way is certainly an unobstructed means of approach to provide entry to or exit from [the] property.\u201d But this approach virtually conflates the phrase \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d into the definition of \u201caccess.\u201d In interpreting legislation, a tribunal must \u201c \u2018giv[e] effect to all of [its] parts ... rendering no part of the law surplusage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 106, 803 A.2d 518, 522 (2002) (quoting <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 252, 753 A.2d 501, 508 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In short, we conclude that the adverb \u201cdirectly\u201d qualifies the adjective \u201caccessible\u201d to some extent and does so in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>manner that effectuates the interpretation set forth by the Board of Appeals and the Department of Planning and Zoning. We find persuasive the analysis by the North Carolina Supreme Court in <em>Penny v. City of Durham, </em>249 N.C. 596, 107 S.E.2d 72 (1959). In <em>Penny, </em>the plaintiffs, certain residents of Durham, challenged a proposed shopping center planned for their immediate area. The commercial parcel on which the shopping center was to be placed was separated from the residents\u2019 homes both by an avenue and a \u201cbuffer strip\u201d that was owned by the same developer and which fronted on the avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The future of the shopping center project depended on the developer\u2019s success in obtaining a rezoning of the parcel from residential to commercial. The rezoning was approved by the Durham City Council by a simple majority vote. The homeowners challenged the approval, asserting that the Council\u2019s action was lawless. They maintained that because the owners of twenty percent or more of lots which were \u201cdirectly opposite\u201d to the proposed shopping center had lodged written protests to the shopping center project, the necessary ordinance had to be passed by more than the simple majority which had approved the rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The North Carolina Supreme Court rejected the homeowners\u2019 argument. Delving into the ordinary meanings of the pertinent terms \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201copposite,\u201d and relying on <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, </em>Second Edition, the court ruled that the proposed shopping center was not \u201cdirectly opposite\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 residential area, notwithstanding the fact that the same developer owned the buffer strip that bordered on the roadway that was common both to its land and the homes of the protestants. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">[Ojppositc ... is qualified by the word \u201cdirectly,\u201d and some meaning must be given to the word \u201cdirectly\u201d when used conjunctively with the word \u201copposite.\u201d To express it another way, the legislature would not have used the word \u201cdirectly\u201d as a mere redundancy; it was intended to modify, limit or enlarge the word \u201copposite.\u201d It seems to us that the only definitions of \u201cdirectly\u201d that would, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>circumstances in this case, really modify \u201copposite\u201d are: \u201cwithout anything intervening; next in order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><em>Penny, </em>249 N.C. at 600, 107 S.E.2d at 75-76. <em>See generally, </em>Grant Gilmore &amp; Charles L.

Ory, </em>89 Ill.App.3d 1118, 45 Ill.Dec. 356, 412 N.E.2d 707 (1980), the interpretation of the phrase \u201cdirect access\u201d by a state highway department held considerable force in applying that language in a prosecution for a traffic offense. In that case, a motorist was charged with speeding in an \u201curban district.\u201d He sought the reversal of his conviction because the stretch of highway where the alleged offense occurred did not qualify as an \u201curban district,\u201d because the housing density did not meet the standards for that classification. The distinction was important, for, as noted by the Illinois Appellate Court, \u201c[i]f the zone [were] not an \u2018urban district,\u2019 the posted limit [would be] below the minimum permitted by statute and therefore invalid and unenforceable.\u201d 89 Ill.App.3d at 1118, 45 Ill.Dec. 356, 412 N.E.2d at 708. Although the road was found to be contiguous to a densely populated subdivision, only a few structures actually bordered on the subject road. Relying on an interpretation by the Illinois Department of Transportation to the effect that structures counted in establishing an \u201curban district\u201d should include only those that have direct access to the highway, the homes in the subdivision \u201cwhich have no direct access\u201d to the road in question \u201cshould not have been considered by the trial court for the purpose of denominating that roadway as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u2018urban district [even though the subdivision contained other structures that were joined to another road].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1119, 45 Ill.Dec. 356, 412 N.E.2d at 709.

Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>575 N.E.2d 33 (Ind.App. 1991), an automobile rental business, Avis, sought to place a \u201cpole sign\u201d on its property in Indianapolis. It needed a zoning variance to do so, and its request for this was administratively denied. One requirement for the placement of the sign was that there would be \u201cdirect access\u201d to the business. The planning department had determined that the business did not have \u201cdirect access\u201d to surrounding roads because the Avis property entrance and exits were subject to cross-easements in favor of abutting property owners, also freestanding businesses. The Board of Zoning Appeals agreed, but the Indiana trial court and Court of Appeals did not, and the courts ruled that the existence of an easement did not cut off direct access in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court, referring to the definition of the term \u201caccess\u201d in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(5th ed.1979) \u201cto include the right vested in the owner of land which adjoins a road or other highway to go and return from his own land to the highway without obstruction[,]\u201d concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Applying the common, ordinary definition of \u201cdirect access\u201d to the facts before us, the mere existence of a use-easement in itself does not obstruct the ingress or egress onto Avis\u2019 property. The trial court therefore properly reversed the Board\u2019s determination that there was no direct access to and from Avis\u2019 property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\"><em>Id., </em>575 N.E.2d at 36-37. <em>See generally BIK Associates v.

To accept Bel Air Realty\u2019s view, we believe that the Board would have been constrained to read the term \u201cdirect-ly\u201d out of the Zoning Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Finally, we believe that Bel Air\u2019s reliance on the definition of \u201cPrimary Residential Road,\u201d Section 267-4, as a buttress for its position, is misplaced. The Zoning Code defines \u201cPrimary Residential Road\u201d as one that \u201c[pjrovides direct access between minor residential roads and collectors and minimal direct driveway access to abutting properties.\u201d But that same definition dictates that such a road \u201ccarr[y] a <em>limited </em>amount of traffic.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To permit a primary road to handle traffic from Bel Air Realty\u2019s project through Hickory Overlook to Business Route 1 would appear to this Court to contradict the letter and spirit of the definition of a \u201cResidential Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>Administrative Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AdC\">We also conclude that, even if the phrase \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d were ambiguous to the point of obscuring the evident meaning of the statute, and the intent of the County Council, the administrative interpretation of the \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d requirement, as applied by the Department of Planning and Zoning, voiced through the testimony of Mr. McClune, and sanctioned by the Board of Appeals, trumps the testimony of Bel Air Realty\u2019s experts and its interpretation to the contrary. Again, we must respect the expertise of the agency. <em>See Adamson v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 266-67, 753 A.2d 501, 516 (2000). The Court of Appeals has outlined several factors that inform our review of administrative interpretations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">The consistent and long-standing construction given a statute by the agency charged with administering it is entitled to great deference, <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307, 1315 (1986), as the agency is likely to have expertise and practical experience with the statute\u2019s subject matter. <em>See, e.g., Sinai Hosp. v. Dept. of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 46, 522 A.2d 382, 391 (1987); 2B N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, \u00a7 49.05, at 17 (5th ed.1993). The weight given an agency\u2019s construction of a statute depends on several factors \u2014 the duration and consistency of the administrative practice, the degree to which the agency\u2019s construction was made known to the public, and the degree to which the Legislature was aware of the administrative construction when it reenacted the relevant statutory language. <em>Magan v. Medical Mutual, </em>331 Md. 535, 546, 629 A.2d 626, 632 (1993). Other important considerations include \u201cthe extent to which the agency engaged in a process of reasoned elaboration in formulating its interpretation\u201d and \u201cthe nature of the process through which the agency arrived at its interpretation,\u201d with greater weight placed on those agency interpretations that are the product of adversarial proceedings or formal rules promulgation. <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec., </em>305 Md. at 161-62, 501 A.2d at 1315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Marriott Employees Federal Credit Union, </em>346 Md. at 445-46, 697 A.2d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We are convinced that the Department\u2019s interpretation is a persuasive articulation of the \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d language of Section 267-46B(4)(b). Again, the expertise of the Department of Planning and Zoning must be taken into account. <em>See Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68-69, 729 A.2d at 381; <em>Angelini v. Harford County, </em>144 Md.App. 369, 374, 798 A.2d 26, 29 (2002). Although Bel Air contests the weight to be accorded Mr. McClune\u2019s testimony, challenging the Department\u2019s allowance of exceptions for three development projects, we note that the Department\u2019s representative emphasized that he had become Chief of the Development Review Section in 1990, and had reviewed all concept plans since that time, including \u201cseveral dozen\u201d COS developments. This is evidence of a consistent application of the criteria for COS development. Further, the Department h\u00e1d discussed its view as to the nature of the \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d requirement with the County Council when that body amended the direct access requirements for continuing care and elder care institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Even if we were to concur with the circuit court\u2019s view that the application of this policy was inconsistent in the Department\u2019s approval of the Spenceola, Deer Spring, and Woodland projects, we would not accept the view, proffered by Bel Air Realty and adopted by the circuit court, that this inconsistency detracts from the validity of the administrative construction of the Zoning Code. In the final analysis, however, we find McClune\u2019s explanations of the approval processes for these developments to be persuasive, and not out of line with the Department\u2019s overall view that \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d means what has been proffered by the administrators in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We are also in agreement with the prudential concerns that the Department seeks to avoid the pitfalls that are caused by poor planning, in this case a \u201cstacking\u201d of developments, and agree with a noted commentator that \u201c[t]he power to regulate the subdivision of land has been employed, in conjunction with zoning authority, to control the pace and <em>sequence of develop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>ment.\u201d 4 </em>Kenneth H.

The concept concentrates on restricting the number of direct accesses to major surface streets, providing reasonable indirect access, effectively designing driveways, and enforcing safe and efficient spacing and location of driveways. A variety of techniques are available for achieving access control. They include geometric design considerations, such as medians and channelized islands that prohibit certain turning movements; consolidation actions, such as joint use of driveways and service roads; and others, such as removal and relocation of existing access and the introduction of auxiliary lanes for left and right turns. If these types of improvements are implemented correctly, we can expect significant dividends in terms of smoother vehicle flow, reduced delay, and fewer crashes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Ronald K.

In its brief, Bel Air emphasizes that Overlook Way \u201cmeets the 1982 definition of a \u2018Collector Road,\u2019 \u201d and points out that Overlook would have been classified as a collector road under the earlier standards. Regardless, Overlook Way is currently classified as a residential road, and does not constitute a collector road under the current Zoning Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. McClune gave, as a prime example of the legislative meaning of the \"directly accessible\u201d requirement, the case of Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC). This type of community is a \"special development\u201d project which also required \"direct access\u201d from an arterial or collector road. <em>See </em>Harford County Zoning Code \u00a7 267-49.1. In that instance, the County Council amended the Code to relax the accessibility requirement so that it could be satisfied by direct access not only to arterial and collector roads, but also to primary residential roads. <em>Id.., </em>as amended by Council Bill 98-36. According to McClune, this demonstrates that the Council, should it have intended a project to be \"directly accessible\u201d to a residential road such as Overlook Way, would have so provided in the Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">. McClune said that a \"concept plan\u201d is the initial review of a project, and is subject to revision. He recalled that Bel Air Realty had not to date submitted a concept plan for the subject property. As to the three \"anomalous\u201d projects that had met with Department approval, Spenceola, Deer Spring, and Woodland, McClune explained that Spenceola and Woodland were eventually developed as part of a unified concept plan that had been amended to incorporate them. Deer Spring originally accessed a road through an intervening business development, but it also was incorporated into a single project. They became part of an overall scheme which was then approved by the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. \"Primary Residential Road\u201d is defined in the Zoning Code as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">A major local road distributing and collecting traffic within larger residential subdivisions or neighborhoods, and performing the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">A.

The court likewise consulted a dictionary, in this instance <em>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(edition not noted), to obtain a definition of the term \"direct\u201d as \"[i]n a direct manner, without delay, to follow a straight course proceeding from one point to another.\u201d However, one knows the intended meaning of a word only when one knows how the word is used in context. Knowing the dictionary definition of a word may not convince but only confuse. For example, in the phrase \"ship flounders,\u201d what does the author intend to communicate? Is the phrase a newspaper headline? Or perhaps an order to a fish monger?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">. The parties\u2019 reliance on dictionaries to offer their respective interpretations of the phrase \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d is a prudent method of determining the meaning of ordinary language that populates most statutes.
