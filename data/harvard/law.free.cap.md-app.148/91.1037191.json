In this case, the arbitrator sanctioned the offending attorney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by making him jointly responsible with his client for a portion of the award of fees and costs his client was ordered to pay, as the non-prevailing party in the proceeding below. In deciding this issue and others presented by the parties, we shall take this opportunity to illumine the role and powers of the arbitrator under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">This case arose from an employment dispute. Appellant, MCR of America, Inc., (\u201cMCR\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> fired its marketing director, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>appellee J. William Greene, for purportedly violating his employment contract. The propriety of that termination was ultimately submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Following what were apparently unnecessarily contentious proceedings, the arbitrator found that MCR had not breached its agreement with Greene by terminating his employment. She then ordered Greene, as the non-prevailing party on the principal issue before her, to reimburse MCR for all arbitration \u201cfees and expenses\u201d as well as attorney\u2019s fees incurred by MCR in defending against Greene\u2019s breach of contract claim. But MCR\u2019s victory was not complete nor Greene\u2019s defeat total. On his claim for unpaid wages, the arbitrator ordered MCR to pay Greene $2,676.92.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Then turning to Greene\u2019s counsel, whose \u201cvexatious conduct\u201d the arbitrator believed had unnecessarily complicated and prolonged the proceedings, she declared that he was \u201cjointly responsible\u201d with his client for a portion of the arbitration and legal fees to be paid to MCR. While the award of arbitration fees and expenses was upheld by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, the award of legal fees was not. Cross-appeals to this Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Before this Court, MCR challenges the circuit court\u2019s vacation of the arbitrator\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees while Greene contests the court\u2019s affirmance of the arbitrator\u2019s award of fees and costs to MCR. Specifically, MCR presents two issues, which can be restated as one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">On cross-appeal, Greene presents the following issues, which we have set forth below largely as they appear in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in confirming all fees and costs awarded pursuant to MCR\u2019s motion for sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">A. Whether the arbitrator was without authority to consider an award of sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>B. Whether the award of fees/expenses based upon documents provided by MCR to the arbitrator ex parte following the close of the hearing constitutes misconduct, bias, prejudice, and denial of due process such that the award must be vacated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">C. Whether the arbitrator was without authority to extend personal liability of the award to Greene\u2019s counsel who was not a party to the arbitration or to the agreement requiring the parties to submit to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in refusing to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s vacation of the arbitrator\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees but reverse its confirmance of the arbitrator\u2019s award of fees and expenses. In all other respects, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">MCR is engaged in the credit reporting business. It provides credit and investigative reports to businesses in the home mortgage industry. Hoping to expand that business, MCR hired Greene to be its marketing director and executive vice-president.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The terms of Greene\u2019s employment were memorialized in a written agreement between the parties. Paragraph 6 of that agreement, entitled \u201cBreach,\u201d states that the parties shall \u201cby mutual agreement, develop written performance criteria including achievable goals regarding steps for the growth, expansion or diversification of the Corporation.\u201d Under that paragraph, if Greene fails \u201cto render services or accomplish the criteria or goals\u201d agreed to by the parties or \u201cto perform any material covenant or condition\u201d of the agreement, MCR may terminate the agreement. Paragraph 8 of the agreement, entitled \u201cTermination,\u201d permits MCR to terminate Greene\u2019s employment \u201cfor justifiable cause\u201d which includes \u201cany disclosure by [Greene] to any person, firm or corporation ... of any confidential information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Both paragraphs contain arbitration provisions. Paragraph 6(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">In the event of a dispute between the Corporation and the Employee as to a termination of this agreement, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties. The fees and expenses of any such action shall be bourne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">And Paragraph 8(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">In the event of a dispute between the board of directors and the employee as to the existence of justifiable cause, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties. The fees and expenses of any such action shall be bourne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In sum, Paragraph 6(b) requires that disputes \u201cas to a termination\u201d be arbitrated while Paragraph 8(b) requires that disputes \u201cas to the existence of justifiable cause\u201d be arbitrated. Both arbitration provisions state that \u201cthe fees and expenses of any such action shall be bourne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered.\u201d That language was the basis upon which the arbitrator awarded MCR fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Greene began working for MCR on May 15,1996. But over the next five months, MCR\u2019s business did not grow as planned. Consequently, among other cost-cutting measures, MCR reduced Greene\u2019s salary by fifty-three percent. That reduction, MCR informed Greene, was to \u201cbring [his] salary down\u201d to the level of the salaries of other employees, which had been reduced because of MCR\u2019s economic difficulties. Unfortunately, Greene discussed his salary reduction with the owner of a credit reporting company that MCR was attempting to purchase. The disclosure of that information, MCR claims, created questions as to its financial viability.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>After learning of that disclosure, MCR terminated Greene\u2019s employment. In a letter to Greene, dated October 25, 1996, MCR informed Greene that he was being terminated for \u201cfailure to perform\u201d under paragraph 6 of the agreement and for \u201cjustifiable cause\u201d under Paragraph 8(a) of that agreement for disclosing confidential information about his salary reduction to a competitor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On June 8, 1997, Greene filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Howard County against MCR, alleging breach of contract and a violation of Labor and Employment (\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7 3 507.1 of the Maryland Code Annotated (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that complaint, he \u201csought recovery of the unpaid portion of his salary, as well as monetary reimbursement of lost fringe benefits, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d In response, MCR filed a petition to compel arbitration and to stay the action pending before the circuit court, pursuant to Paragraphs 6(b) and 8(b) of Greene\u2019s employment agreement. The circuit court denied that petition, whereupon MCR noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">After argument, this Court issued an unreported opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that opinion, we observed that the parties\u2019 employment agreement \u201cmandates arbitration for disputes regarding Termination of [the] agreement\u2019 and the \u2018existence of justifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>cause\u2019 for termination.\u201d We declared that because Greene\u2019s \u201cclaims for monetary damages are inextricably linked to his termination,\u201d the subject matter of the parties\u2019 dispute was within the scope of the arbitration provisions of their agreement. Accordingly, we reversed the circuit court\u2019s order and remanded this case to that court with instructions to grant MCR\u2019s petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Thereafter, Greene filed a Statement of Claim with the American Arbitration Association, seeking, among other things, unpaid wages and damages for breach of contract. Greene also sought \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees ... pre-judgment interest and the costs of [the] action, including the submission fee and all hearing fees.\u201d In reply, MCR filed an answer and a counterclaim for fraudulent misrepresentation, alleging that Greene misrepresented his \u201cqualifications, abilities, and commitment\u201d to MCR. As Greene did, MCR requested \u201cthe costs of the arbitration and all proceedings and attorneys\u2019 fees incident thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In mid-July of 1999, a hearing was held before an arbitrator provided by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d). Following that hearing, the AAA case manager, by letter dated July 20, 1999, informed the parties that \u201c[p]ost-hearing briefs [were] to be filed on or before August 13, 1999.\u201d The letter further stated that \u201c[u]pon the filing of final briefs ... the arbitrator [would] declare the hearings closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">On August 20, 1999, one week after the letter\u2019s August 13, 1999 deadline, MCR filed a \u201cMotion for Sanctions\u201d with the Arbitrator. That motion claimed that \u201cthroughout the presentation of his case and the cross examination of Claimant\u2019s witnesses\u201d Greene\u2019s attorney, among other things, \u201cwas argumentative in the extreme, constantly interfering with the examination of witnesses, and making repetitious arguments unrelated to the objection he was making\u201d during discovery and the presentation of his case. His conduct and lack of preparation, the motion alleged, had \u201cunduly prolonged\u201d discovery and the arbitration hearing. It therefore requested reimbursement for counsel fees and other fees and costs it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>incurred as a result of his behavior. No bills were submitted with that motion. Later, however, MCR sent copies of its legal bills to the arbitrator but not, apparently, to Greene-at least not until after the arbitrator had rendered her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">That decision awarded Greene $2,676.92 in unpaid wages pursuant to LE \u00a7 3-507.1 but it rejected both Greene\u2019s breach of contract claim and MCR\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation counterclaim. It further awarded MCR \u201cits reasonable arbitration fees, including attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred by MCR to defend Greene\u2019s contract actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">After finding that MCR\u2019s total attorney\u2019s fees in the arbitration proceedings were $64,640.00 and determining that $45,000.00 of those fees were expended by MCR in defending Greene\u2019s contract claim, the decision declared that Greene \u201cshall pay or reimburse to MCR: (i) American Arbitration Association administrative fees and expenses ..., (ii) Arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses, (iii) MCR\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $45,000, [and] (iv) MCR\u2019s expenses in the amount of 8,479.66.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Then, noting that \u201c[throughout the ensuing arbitration, Greene\u2019s counsel ... was variously obstructive, uncivil, pedantic, disrespectful of witnesses and his colleagues at the bar, and disparaging of the process of arbitration\u201d and that his \u201credundant objections (to relevancy) and his vexatious pattern of examination of witnesses wasted considerable time and multiplied the costs of these proceedings,\u201d the arbitrator ordered Greene and his counsel to pay MCR, \u201c$8,500.00 of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by and awarded to MCR, and ... $8,500.00 of the Arbitrator\u2019s fees incurred by and owed to the Arbitrator.\u201d In awarding these amounts to MCR, the arbitrator stated that she was relying on the National Rules for the Resolution of Arbitration Disputes and \u201cthe Maryland State Bar Association Code of Civility, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Maryland Rule 1-341, among other guidelines and authorities describing counsel\u2019s sanctionable conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Challenging that decision, Greene filed a \u201cRequest for Modification of Award.\u201d In that request, Greene asserted that MCR\u2019s failure to send him copies of MCR\u2019s bills for attorneys\u2019 fees until after the arbitrator had issued her decision had denied him the opportunity, in violation of Rule 25 of the AAA Rules, to \u201cexamine such documents or other evidence or to lodge appropriate objections, if any.\u201d Had he been given that opportunity, appellant claims that he would have been able to object to the fees \u201con several grounds, including, but not limited to, the amount of time [MCR\u2019s] counsel actually billed on the case, the hourly rates charged by [MCR\u2019s] counsel, and the reasonableness of the same, the appropriateness of double billing for [MCR\u2019s] two attorneys, whether the bills represented actual bills submitted to [MCR], and the allocation of fees and expenses as determined by the Arbitrator, etc.\u201d He therefore requested that the award of attorneys fees and other fees and costs be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Denying that request, the arbitrator stated she would \u201cnot redetermine the merits of any claim already decided.... \u201d She added, however, \u201cbecause [Greene] apparently had not been timely provided with certain of [MCR\u2019s] submissions or fees calculations which accompanied the parties\u2019 post-hearing brief, the arbitrator would entertain a request for modification if necessary to correct a computational error that might appear to Claimant upon reviewing the [MCR\u2019s] submission.\u201d There is no indication in the record that Greene responded to that offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Finally, because Greene\u2019s request for modification \u201cidentifie[d] no clerical, typographical, technical or computational error in the arbitrator\u2019s calculation of certain attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred by and awarded to MCR\u201d and \u201c[b]ecause [Greene] elected not to question the related computations (such as attorney hours spent on the case, hourly rates, double-billing, actual fee bills, and/or allocation of fees to particular claims)\u201d in his request for modification, the arbitrator declared that \u201cno modification shall follow pursuant to [AAA] Rule 85.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>After his request for modification was denied by the arbitrator, Greene filed a \u201cMotion to Vacate Arbitrator\u2019s Award\u201d in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. In ruling on that motion, the circuit court found no \u201csupport [for] a finding that the award was procured by fraud, corruption, or undue means,\u201d and declared that Greene had \u201csupplied the Court with no facts or evidence to support a finding of evident partiality by the arbitrator.\u201d It further found that there was \u201cno contractual or statutory basis for the awarding of attorney [sic] fees\u201d to MCR. Maryland Rule 1-341, the court explained, does not apply \u201cto actions outside State courts, such as arbitration hearings.\u201d Moreover, even if it did apply, there was \u201cno explicit finding by the arbitrator that there was an abuse of the judicial process by filing or defending actions and proceedings without substantial justification or in bad faith,\u201d as that rule requires. The court then vacated that part of the arbitrator\u2019s award granting attorney\u2019s fees to MCR but then, notwithstanding its findings, confirmed the award \u201c[i]n all other respects, including all fees and costs awarded pursuant to the Motion for Sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Thereafter, the parties filed cross motions to alter or amend the judgment, which the circuit court denied. MCR then noted this appeal, whereupon Greene filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">MCR contends that the circuit court erred in vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. Citing Maryland statutory and common law standards for vacating such an award, MCR claims that \u201cGreene adduced not a scintilla of evidence of corruption, fraud, undue means or evident partiality by the Arbitrator, or mistake of law or fact\u201d and that the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>made no finding that the arbitrator\u2019s award was based on a \u201ccompletely irrational interpretation of the contract.\u201d Consequently, MCR claims, the court \u201chad no authority to vacate the award\u201d of attorney\u2019s fees under either Maryland\u2019s Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cArbitration Act\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 through 3-234 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) of the Maryland Code Annotated (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), or Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">But there are other grounds for vacating an arbitration award. The Arbitration Act also provides that an award shall be vacated if \u201c[t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-224(b)(3). And that is what occurred here. In vacating the attorney\u2019s fee award, the circuit court found, and we believe correctly so, that there was no contractual or statutory basis upon which to make such an award and thus the arbitrator exceeded her powers in making that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The parties\u2019 agreement states only that \u201c[t]he fees and expenses of any [arbitration] action shall be borne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered.\u201d No mention is made of attorney\u2019s fees, and, under such circumstances, the Court of Appeals has declared, the power to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwill not be presumed.\u201d <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 124, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001). Moreover, the Arbitration Act plainly disfavors awarding such fees: it stresses that \u201c[u]nless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award may not include counsel fees.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-221(b). Given the failure of the contract to expressly provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and the Arbitration Act\u2019s prohibition against an arbitral<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> award of attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of authorizing contractual language, the circuit court was correct in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>there was \u201cno contractual or statutory basis for awarding attorney fees to ... MCR of America, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">MCR\u2019s counters, however, that the parties\u2019 agreement must provide for attorney\u2019s fees because both sides requested an award of such fees in their pleadings. This argument is unpersuasive. Attorneys routinely request such fees in pleadings they file even when there is only the slightest chance that such fees will be awarded. And once one side has requested them, it is inevitable that the other side will follow suit. Such requests are made with Pavlovian consistency and hence should play no interpretive role.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">But even if the award was in error, once the award is made, can it be vacated under the prevailing standard of review? MCR thinks not. Citing <em>OS Corp. v. Samuel A. Kroll, Inc., </em>29 Md.App. 406, 348 A.2d 870 (1975), MCR claims that once the arbitrator has awarded attorney\u2019s fees, as occurred here, that award cannot be vacated, even if arbitrary, unless there is a finding that the award was based on a \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d interpretation of the arbitration contract. Because no such finding was made by the court below, MCR insists that the award of attorney\u2019s fees must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">That claim, however, collapses upon careful inspection: it is founded upon both a misconstruction of <em>OS Corp. </em>and a misapplication of the \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard. The \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard may be an appropriate standard for reviewing arbitral interpretations of substantive provisions of a contract, but it is not an appropriate standard for reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s definition of his or her own powers, particularly when that definition is purportedly at odds with the underlying arbitration contract and disfavored by the Arbitration Act. Nor does <em>OS Corp. </em>suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\"><em>OS Corp. </em>involved a construction dispute that was submitted to arbitration under the Arbitration Act. In that case, this Court held that, \u201cwhen reviewing the fruits of an arbitrator\u2019s award, a judge may withhold only such as were tainted by improbity or based on a completely irrational interpretation of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408-09, 348 A.2d 870. Hence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard was bom, a standard, we note, that has not, to date, been adopted by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The arbitration award in <em>O-S Corp. </em>was an award for wages, fees, and overhead costs, allegedly owed under a construction contract to a building contractor. The issue in that case was not the arbitrator\u2019s power to make the award at issue, as in this case, but whether the arbitrator\u2019s award was based on a \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d interpretation of the construction contract. The two cases thus present different issues and, we believe, require different results. Indeed, it is one thing to grant the arbitrator broader discretion than a court of law has to interpret a contract, even though it is less reviewable, but quite another to invest the arbitrator with the same discretion when it comes to defining its own powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard was not reviewed by the Court of Appeals until <em>Stephen L. Messersmith, Inc. v. Barclay Townhouse Associates, </em>313 Md. 652, 547 A.2d 1048 (1988). In that case, Barclay, a developer, entered into a contract with Messersmith, a drywall contractor, to do the drywall and metal stud work for a project that Barclay was constructing. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 547 A.2d 1048. A dispute arose, and Messersmith filed a petition to arbitrate the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Claiming \u201cthat no written agreement to arbitrate existed,\u201d Barclay and other interested parties challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitrators. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 547 A.2d 1048. Nonetheless, the arbitrators determined that they did in fact have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>jurisdiction over the case and entered an award in favor of Messersmith. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 547 A.2d 1048. In response, Barclay filed a petition to vacate the award \u201con the basis that it had never agreed to submit to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 547 A.2d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Denying that petition, the circuit court held that the arbitrators\u2019 decision was not completely irrational, and therefore that it had no grounds on which to vacate the award under CJP \u00a7 3-244(b)(5). That section states that a court shall vacate an arbitration award if \u201c[t]here was no arbitration agreement as described in \u00a7 3-206, the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under \u00a7 3-208, and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Ultimately, this Court reversed that decision, reasoning that, \u201c[bjecause an arbitrator has no power to act in the absence of an agreement to arbitrate, the \u2018completely irrational\u2019 standard of review used for reviewing arbitration awards on the merits is totally inappropriate.\u201d <em>Barclay Townhouse Associates v. Stephen L. Messersmith, Inc., </em>67 Md.App. 493, 497, 508 A.2d 507 (1986). The Court of Appeals agreed. It declared \u201cthat the proper procedure for reviewing cases arising under \u00a7 3-224(b)(5) is to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 664, 508 A.2d 507. The Court reasoned that while a deferential standard of review \u201cis appropriate [] where the parties indisputably agree to submit to arbitration,\u201d if \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s very authority to adjudicate the dispute is chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>lenged, such obedience to the arbitrators\u2019 assertion of jurisdiction is clearly inapt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 508 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">This same reasoning applies to specific issues before the arbitrator, particularly where the arbitrator\u2019s definition of its powers is at odds with the arbitration contract and disfavored by the Arbitration Act, as here. Under such circumstances, there is no reason to distinguish between cases, in general, and issues, in particular, for purposes of review. We therefore shall review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether the arbitrator had the right to award attorney's fees to MCR.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The National Rules for Arbitration Disputes (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) were incorporated by the parties into their agreement. AAA Rule 34(e) states that an \u201carbitrator shall have the authority to provide for the reimbursement of representative fees, in whole or in part, as part of the remedy, in accordance with applicable law.\u201d The \u201capplicable law\u201d here, however, is the Arbitration Act, and, as pointed out, that act disfavors the recovery of counsel fees \u201c[u]nless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-221(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Moreover, the parties\u2019 employment agreement provides that \u201cfees and expenses\u201d of arbitration \u201cshall be bourne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered,\u201d but, as noted earlier, no mention is made of attorney\u2019s fees. And there is no reason to infer from that language that it encompasses anything more than the fees and expenses of the arbitrator. As the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate does not provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in vacating that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Also, we are not unmindful of the growing concern over the use of arbitration contracts to compel consumers and prospective employees to waive, in effect, important constitutional and statutory rights or be denied, in the case of consumers, needed goods and services, and, in the case of prospective employees, desirable employment. <em>See, e.g., </em>Senator Russell D. Feingold, <em>Mandatory Arbitration: What Process Is Due?, </em>39 Harv. J. on Legis., 281 (2002); Larry J. Pittman, <em>The Federal </em>Arbitra&gt;<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>tion Act: The Supreme Court\u2019s Erroneous Statutory Interpretation, Stare Decisis, and a Proposal for Change, </em>53 Ala. L.Rev., 789 (2002). This concern is not unfounded. The use of arbitration to resolve employment disputes and consumer complaints is growing at a startling pace.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> What was once considered just a voluntary alternative means of resolving disputes quickly and inexpensively, has the potential, as one commentator has observed, to become \u201ca tool for the powerful to exert authority over the less powerful.\u201d Feingold, <em>supra </em>at 284. To deal with that concern, some states have enacted statutes prohibiting the use of arbitration to resolve disputes arising out of employment and consumer contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 508 A.2d 507. The validity of such statutes of course is now in question given the continued vitality of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1,104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984). <em>See Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Saint Clair Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001); <em>Allied-Brace Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Dobson, </em>513 U.S. 265, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995). In <em>Southland, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FAA preempts any state law that limits the availability of arbitration. Nonetheless, the concern remains.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">And it is that concern which renders us reluctant to find authority for an arbitrator to award attorney\u2019s fees when none has expressly be given by contract or granted by statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Indeed, it is not hard to foresee how provisions awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party would make the risks of arbitration simply too great for any consumer or employee to seriously consider it. Unfortunately, such provisions have the potential for transforming what was to be an inexpensive and accessible means of seeking redress into a formidable obstacle to, seeking any relief at all.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Greene contends that the circuit court erred in confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award of, in the words of that court, \u201call fees and costs pursuant to MCR\u2019s Motion for Sanctions.\u201d In making that award, the arbitrator principally relied on Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the AAA Rules, and Maryland Rule 1-341. That reliance, according to Greene, was misplaced and, for the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Before we address those reasons, however, we must first clarify the nature of the court\u2019s ruling and thus the issue now before us. The \u201cfees and costs\u201d of which the court speaks, are, we assume, the arbitration fees and costs, owed by Greene alone, as the non-prevailing party, or owed by Greene and his attorney, as sanctions; they presumably do not include the legal fees owed by Greene and his attorney as sanctions. That is because when the circuit court vacated the general award of attorney\u2019s fees, which Greene alone was ordered to pay, it by implication vacated the award of attorney\u2019s fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>which Greene and his attorney were ordered to pay as sanctions. That sum, $8,500, was not in addition to the general award of $45,000 in attorney\u2019s fees that Greene was to pay MCR, as the non-prevailing party, but a portion of it to be paid by Greene and his attorney, as sanctions. If the general award is vacated, it follows that so is that portion of it that was to be paid as sanctions by Greene and his attorney. And indeed there is no other way to read this language without rendering the circuit court\u2019s decision internally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In support of his claim that the court erred in not vacating that award \u2014 which, as we just discussed, applies only to the portion of that award which still stands, namely, the arbitrator\u2019s fees and costs \u2014 Greene advances four arguments. First, he asserts that the arbitrator had no authority to award sanctions pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341 because that rule applies only to court proceedings, and that even if the Rule applies to arbitration proceedings, the sanctions award should have been vacated because the arbitrator failed to make explicit findings of \u201cbad faith\u201d or lack of \u201csubstantial justification.\u201d Md. Rule 1-341. Second, Greene claims that, in awarding sanctions, the arbitrator should not have relied on Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because the federal rules did not apply to the arbitration proceeding. Third, Greene maintains that \u201cthe arbitrator was without authority to extend personal liability of the award to Greene\u2019s counsel who was not a party to the arbitration or to the agreement requiring the parties to submit to arbitration.\u201d And fourth, Greene claims that attorney\u2019s bills provided to the arbitrator <em>ex parte </em>and that the motion for sanctions, which was received by the arbitrator after the close of the hearings, constituted \u201cmisconduct, bias, prejudice, and [a] denial of due process such that the award must be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In determining whether the arbitrator had the authority to sanction Greene\u2019s counsel, we note that private arbitration \u201cis a matter of contract,\u201d <em>Gold Coast Mall, Inc. v. Larmar Corp., </em>298 Md. 96, 103, 468 A.2d 91 (1983), and that an \u201carbitrator f] derives his or her power from the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>agreement itself.\u201d <em>Barclay Townhouse Associates, </em>67 Md. App. at 497, 508 A.2d 507. Accordingly, \u201c[a]n arbitration agreement cannot impose obligations on persons who are not a party to it and do not agree to its terms.\u201d <em>Curtis G. Testerman Co. v. Buck, </em>340 Md. 569, 579-80, 667 A.2d 649 (1995); <em>see also Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Associates Limited, </em>346 Md. 122, 127, 695 A.2d 153 (1997). And therefore, because Greene\u2019s counsel was neither a party to the arbitration agreement nor the arbitration proceedings themselves, the arbitrator had no authority to assess arbitration fees against him personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Although not precisely on point, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Curtis G. Testerman </em>Co., <em>supra, </em>lends support to this conclusion. There, the Court of Appeals addressed the issue of \u201c[w]hether one who is neither a party to the arbitration agreement nor a signatory of the underlying contract can be bound by an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Testerman, </em>340 Md. at 574, 667 A.2d 649. The Court found that \u201cTesterman clearly signed the contract as an agent for a disclosed principal,\u201d and thus was \u201cnot bound by the arbitration clause in the contract as an agent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 667 A.2d 649. \u201c[T]he only way that Testerman [could have been] compelled to arbitrate,\u201d the Court continued, was \u201cif an agreement to arbitrate exist[ed] between the Bucks and Testerman in his individual capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 667 A.2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Testerman </em>is applicable here. Just as the arbitrator in <em>Testerman </em>had no jurisdiction over Curtis Testerman because he was not a party to the arbitration agreement, only the representative of a party, the arbitrator in this matter had no authority to make Greene\u2019s counsel, as a representative of Greene, responsible for any portion of its award, as sanctions or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">But it is more than the weight of contrary case law that tempers our enthusiasm for approving the power of arbitrators to sanction counsel for misconduct. Our reluctance is born of a recognition that, under prevailing standards of judicial review, the arbitrator\u2019s power to sanction, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>established, will largely escape judicial review. While we review the judicial imposition of sanctions on an attorney under a clearly erroneous and an abuse of discretion standard, <em>Inlet Associates v. Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc., </em>324 Md. 254, 267-68, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991), we are constrained to review the arbitral imposition of the same sanctions under the narrower standard of the Arbitration Act. Under that act, we can review the imposition of sanctions by an arbitrator but only for mistake, CJP \u00a7 3-228(b)(1),(3), or for fraud, corruption, or the denial of due process, CJP \u00a7 3-224(b). We are therefore not inclined to accept a broadening of the powers of an arbitrator while our authority to review the exercise of those powers remains narrow. To hold otherwise would grant arbitrators greater power to sanction attorneys by awarding arbitration or attorney\u2019s fees than the courts presently enjoy, because the power of arbitrators to do so is less reviewable. That would be an unfortunate result, given that arbitrators are not judges and arbitrations are not trials. If arbitrators\u2019 powers are to be so expanded, it should be done expressly by rule or statute, not inferentially by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We further note that the three principal authorities relied upon by the arbitrator in awarding sanctions-Federal Rule 11, AAA Rules, and Maryland Rule 1-341-do not provide the basis for such an award here. Maryland Rule 1-341 only applies to conduct committed \u201cin bad faith and without substantial justification\u201d and in the course of \u201cmaintaining or defending [a] proceeding.\u201d Assuming that Rule 1-341 applies to the conduct at issue here, the arbitrator failed to make the \u201cexplicit findings of fact\u201d required by that rule. <em>Zdravkovich v. Bell Atlantic-Tricon Leasing, Corp., </em>323 Md. 200, 592 A.2d 498 (1991). Having failed to do so, the arbitrator had no authority to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Nor does Federal Rule 11 provide authority for the arbitrator\u2019s award of sanctions. It addresses conduct that is not at issue here, namely, the presentation to the court of \u201ca pleading, written motion, or other paper\u201d for an improper purpose or which has no evidentiary support or is not warranted by existing law or any reasonable extension thereof. FRCP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>11(b). In this case, the arbitrator did not impose sanctions for any of those reasons. She did not find that Greene\u2019s conduct was \u201cvexatious\u201d because of any pleading, motion, or other writing that he had presented. Rather, she imposed sanctions because she found that \u201cthroughout the ensuing arbitration, [Greene\u2019s counsel] ... was variously obstructive, uncivil, pedantic, disrespectful of witnesses and his colleagues at the bar, and discouraging of the process of arbitration\u201d and that his \u201cobjections (to relevance) and his vexatious pattern of examination of witnesses wasted considerable time and multiplied the costs of [the] proceedings.\u201d Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s award of sanctions was based upon the attorney\u2019s conduct during arbitration but had nothing to do with the \u201csigning, filing, submitting, or later advocating a pleading, written motion or other paper.\u201d Accordingly, Federal Rule 11 provided no authority for the arbitrator\u2019s sanctions award. <em>See </em>FRCP 11, Notes of Advisory Committee on 1993 amendments (stating that \u201c[t]he rule applies only to assertions contained in papers filed with or submitted to the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">And finally, AAA Rule 34(d) states that an \u201carbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any remedy or relief that would have been available to the parties had the matter been heard in a court.\u201d That rule was incorporated into the parties\u2019 agreement. But it does not mention sanctions, and it is simply too vague and ambiguous for us to conclude that it granted the arbitrator the right to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We conclude this portion of the opinion by returning to the language used by the circuit court in confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award of sanctions. In the words of that court, it confirmed \u201call fees and costs awarded pursuant to the Motion for Sanctions.\u201d For the reasons outlined earlier in this opinion, we believe the court was referring only to the \u201carbitration fees and costs\u201d portion of the sanctions award and not the \u201clegal fees and costs\u201d portion of that award. But if it did intend to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award of legal fees, that award cannot stand as it was made under circumstances that denied both Greene and his attorney due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>It is undisputed that copies of MCR\u2019s legal bills were forwarded to the arbitrator, but not to Greene or his attorney, until after the arbitrator awarded MCR its legal fees based on those bills. MCR concedes that Greene was not provided with copies of its legal bills until the arbitrator had ruled on its motion, but it maintains that this was done inadvertently. MCR also maintains that the error was \u201cpromptly corrected ... as soon as it was brought to [its attorneys\u2019] attention.\u201d It further asserts that, in any event, Greene, upon receiving copies of these bills, had an opportunity to challenge them in his Request for Modification of Award, but chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A court may \u201cset aside an [arbitration] award where \u2018the proceedings lacked fundamental fairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parks v. Sombke, </em>127 Md.App. 245, 254, 732 A.2d 907 (1999)(quoting <em>Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire Dept. Inc., v. Button &amp; Goode, Inc., </em>242 Md. 509, 517, 219 A.2d 801 (1966)). Moreover, \u201cConstitutional due process is applicable to the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees for litigation misconduct.\u201d <em>Needle v. White, Mindel, Clarke and Hill, </em>81 Md.App. 463, 480, 568 A.2d 856 (1990). \u201cFair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record should be provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These principles are no less applicable in private arbitration proceedings. <em>Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel Congregation, </em>115 Md.App. 460, 475, 694 A.2d 107 (1997) (stating that a court may exercise its power to vacate an arbitration award when a \u201cdenial of due process has tainted the legitimacy of the award\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 31, 720 A.2d 912 (1998); <em>Kovacs v. Kovacs, </em>98 Md.App. 289, 304-05, 633 A.2d 425 (1993)(\u201c[I]f arbitration proceedings do not conform to notions of basic fairness or due process, the court would be justified in refusing to confirm an award.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Greene did file a \u201cRequest to Modify the Award.\u201d In that request, Greene argued, among other things, that he was not provided with an opportunity to examine and object to the bills. He then asserted that he could have objected to the bills on several grounds, \u201cincluding, but not limited to, the amount of time [MCR\u2019s] counsel allegedly billed on the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the hourly rates charged by [MCR\u2019s] counsel and the reasonableness of same, the appropriateness of double billing for [MCR\u2019s] two attorneys, whether the bills represented actual bills submitted, and the allocation of fees and expenses as determined by the Arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In disposing of that request, however, the arbitrator stated that she could not \u201credetermine the merits of any claim already decided.\u201d She further asserted that under Rule 35, she could only modify the award to correct \u201cclerical, typographical, technical or computational errors.\u201d We further note that under the Arbitration Act, an arbitrator may modify an award only for clarification on the following three grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">I. There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">II. The arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">III. The award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">CJP \u00a7 3 \u2014 222(c)(1) and \u00a7 3-223(b)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Because of the narrow grounds upon which an arbitrator can modify an arbitration award, Greene did not have the opportunity to challenge the award in his \u201cRequest for Modification.\u201d As the arbitrator pointed out, he was limited to only addressing \u201ccomputational errors.\u201d Having been initially denied the opportunity to oppose appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and then the opportunity to challenging the ensuing award of such fees, except for computational errors, Greene and his attorney, we conclude, were denied due process of law as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees as sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Greene contends that the arbitrator was \u201cpartial\u201d and engaged in misconduct by \u201cexceed[ing] her authority\u201d and arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>trating his statutory wage claim and MCR\u2019s counterclaim for fraudulent misrepresentation. He further claims that several \u201ccritical findings of the arbitrator\u2019s Decision and Award were without any rational basis in law or fact\u201d and \u201cclearly rise to the level of gross mistake.\u201d And finally, he maintains that the arbitrator should have awarded him \u201cfees and expenses\u201d because he prevailed on two out of the three issues decided by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">When alleging partiality, \u201c[t]he moving party must prove facts sufficient to permit an inference that there was indeed partiality by an arbitrator.\u201d <em>Graceman v. Goldstein, </em>93 Md.App. 658, 666, 613 A.2d 1049 (1992)(citing <em>Wyndham v. Haines, </em>305 Md. 269, 279, 503 A.2d 719 (1986)). \u201cA party asserting that error was committed by an arbitration panel bears the burden of showing, by the record, that the error occurred.\u201d <em>Kovacs, </em>98 Md.App. at 303, 633 A.2d 425. \u201cMere allegations and arguments contesting the validity of an award, unsubstantiated by the record, are insufficient to meet that burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the moving party\u2019s burden, we note, \u201cis a heavy one.\u201d <em>Baltimore Teachers Union, American Federation of Teachers, Local 340, AFL CIO v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>108 Md.App. 167, 182, 671 A.2d 80 (1996) . Moreover, \u201c \u2018[a] mere error in the laws or failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand or apply the law will not justify judicial intervention, and the courts\u2019 function in confirming or vacating a commercial award is severely limited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southern Maryland Hosp. Center v. Edward M. Crough, Inc., </em>48 Md.App. 401, 407, 427 A.2d 1051 (1981)(quoting <em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, </em>405 F.2d 1123, 1127 (3rd Cir.1969)). A court \u201cshall not vacate the award or refuse to confirm the award on the ground that a court of law or equity could not or would not grant the same relief.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-224(c). Unless an award is made \u201cin manifest disregard of the law\u201d it will not be disturbed, as \u201c[t]he goal in arbitration is to make an arbitration award the end, rather than the commencement, of litigation.\u201d <em>Birkey Design Group, Inc. v. Egle Nursing Home, Inc., </em>113 Md.App. 261, 269, 687 A.2d 256 (1997) .</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>With respect to Greene\u2019s contention that the statutory wage claim was not arbitrable, we note that this Court has previously decided that issue in the first appeal of this case. We decline to revisit it under the doctrine of the law of the case. The \u201claw of the case refers to the principle that issues once decided in a case that recur in later stages of the same case are not to be redetermined.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 549, 557 n. 3, 602 A.2d 212 (1992). We decided that Greene\u2019s statutory wage claim was arbitrable in <em>MCR of America d/b/a Mortgage Credit Reports, Inc. v. J. William Greene, </em>No. 135, Sept. Term 1998. In that appeal, we reviewed the circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel arbitration. In this appeal, we are reviewing the circuit court\u2019s partial denial of a motion to vacate the arbitration award. Thus, this is a \u201clater staged of the same case,\u201d and we shall not redetermine the issue. Greene\u2019s statutory wage claim was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Greene also contends that the arbitrator exceeded her authority in deciding MCR\u2019s counterclaim, and that in doing so, \u201cdemonstrat[ed] her partiality and misconduct which tainted the entire proceedings.\u201d Greene\u2019s argument is curious, because the arbitrator found in his favor on the counterclaim. We shall nonetheless consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">One of the two arbitration provisions of the parties\u2019 agreement is Paragraph 6 of that agreement. It provides that the parties are to develop jointly for Greene \u201cwritten performance criteria including <em>achievable goals </em>regarding steps for the growth, expansion or diversification\u201d of MCR. (Emphasis added). But it warns that Greene\u2019s failure to achieve the performance criteria developed, or his failure .to \u201cperform any material covenant or condition\u201d of the agreement, unless \u201cby reason of illness, injury or accident ... shall be deemed a default\u201d under the agreement. According to Paragraph 6, following a waiting period, MCR is entitled to \u201cterminate [the] Agreement\u201d if Greene has not remedied the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Paragraph 6 provides that if a dispute arises \u201cas to the termination of [the] agreement, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration.\u201d In other words, any dispute over termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>nation of the agreement for Greene\u2019s failure to achieve performance goals or \u201cperform any material covenant or condition\u201d of the agreement is arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">MCR\u2019s counterclaim for fraudulent misrepresentation was based on Greene\u2019s alleged misrepresentations during employment negotiations as to his \u201cqualifications, abilities, and commitment\u201d to MCR. These claims are intertwined with Paragraph 6 of the parties\u2019 employment agreement. The arbitration clause in Paragraph 6 provides that a dispute over termination of the agreement shall be resolved in arbitration. The agreement could be terminated for Greene\u2019s failure to achieve performance goals or \u201cperform any material covenant or condition\u201d of the agreement. That the parties were to establish performance goals by mutual agreement and in \u201cgood faith\u201d was certainly a \u201cmaterial covenant or condition\u201d of the agreement, and any alleged misrepresentation by Greene as to his qualifications and abilities necessarily implicates his obligation to negotiate in good faith with MCR in setting performance goals. Thus, MCR\u2019s counterclaim was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Greene contends that \u201ccritical findings of the arbitrator\u2019s Decision and Award were without any rational basis in law or fact\u201d and \u201cclearly rise to the level of gross mistake.\u201d Specifically, he attacks the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that sufficient \u201cdefault notice was given to Greene,\u201d alleging that the evidence upon which she based that finding was insufficient. He also claims that the arbitrator \u201cillogically\u201d found that Greene\u2019s disclosure of his salary reduction violated Paragraph 7 of the parties\u2019 agreement. He further asserts that if that disclosure occurred, it was a result of \u201cMCR\u2019s breach of the Agreement by fraudulently seeking to invoke paragraph 7 of the agreement based on its false assertions of company-wide salary reductions.\u201d He argues that \u201c[i]n light of MCR\u2019s fraudulent conduct, MCR is estopped from invoking the provisions of paragraph 8 to its benefit.\u201d Finally, Greene asserts that the arbitrator \u201clost all sense of neutrality when she accepted MCR\u2019s late filing of a Motion for Sanctions and received, <em>ex parte, </em>bills supporting the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>As we have previously addressed Greene\u2019s assertions as to the late and <em>ex parte </em>submission of documents, we need not do so now. Greene\u2019s remaining arguments require us to review the merits of the arbitration award. That, we generally shall not do. <em>International Association of Firefighters, Local 1619 v.

Our review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision reveals no such disregard of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We also find \u00fanpersuasive Greene\u2019s contention that the arbitrator should have awarded him \u201cfees and expenses\u201d because he prevailed in two of the three issues before the arbitrator. The arbitration provisions in the parties\u2019 agreement state that \u201cfees and expenses ... shall be bourne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, the arbitrator was authorized to award costs to the prevailing party. But here there is an issue as to who actually was the \u201cprevailing\u201d party. Greene maintains that, because the decision was rendered in his favor on two of the three issues before the arbitrator, he was entitled to \u201cfees.\u201d But he points out that he \u201creceived no award and MCR received an award constituting approximately 70% of its attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">It is unclear, however, whether Greene contends that, since the arbitrator decided two issues in his favor, he should have been awarded \u201cfees\u201d with respect to those issues, or whether Greene is claiming that since he prevailed on two out of three issues, he was entitled to an award of \u201cfees\u201d and MCR was not. Either way, we find no merit to Greene\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">To resolve this question, we return to the language of the parties\u2019 agreement. The agreement states that \u201cfees and expenses ... shall be bourne solely by the party against whom the decision is rendered.\u201d It impliedly leaves to the arbitrator\u2019s discretion as to which party prevailed. In this instance, the arbitrator apparently concluded, with some justification, that the principal issue before her was Greene\u2019s breach of contract claim and that most of the time, money, and energy of the parties was spent in litigating that issue. Indeed, the validity of Greene\u2019s back wages claim was conceded by MCR before the proceedings began. We see no reason to disturb the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">JUDGMENT VACATING ARBITRATOR\u2019S AWARD OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES IS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">JUDGMENT CONFIRMING ARBITRATOR\u2019S AWARD OF SANCTIONS AGAINST GREENE AND GREENE\u2019S COUNSEL IS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-14\">.
