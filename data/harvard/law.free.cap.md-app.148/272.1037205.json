We hold that such certainty is not required. We also decide the propriety of the court\u2019s denial of a mid-trial continuance request that came in the midst of a tragic national occurrence \u2014 the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack upon our country. We hold that the judge exercised proper discretion in denying a continuance and thereby allowing the jury, as it had requested, to deliberate and render its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">This appeal stems from the decision of a Baltimore County jury on review of two orders of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) denying benefits to appellee, Kevin R. Ludemann (\u201cClaimant\u201d). Claimant had sustained accidental injuries to his back on two occasions arising out of and during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Appellee\u2019s employer, Applied Industrial Technologies, and its insurer, Pacific Employers Insurance Company, which we collectively refer to as \u201cApplied Industrial,\u201d noted this appeal. Applied Industrial presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">I. Did the circuit court err in allowing Claimant to amend the dates of his alleged accidents at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">II. Was the verdict sheet flawed in that it failed to specify the dates of the alleged work-related incidents, and in describing the allegedly work-related incidents as \u201caccidents?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">III. Did the circuit court err in permitting the jury to deliberate and render a verdict in light of the tragic events of September 11, 2001?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The evidence offered at trial disclosed that Claimant began working for Applied Industrial or its subsidiary, Dees Fluid and Power, upon his graduation from high school approximately twenty-nine years earlier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the last eleven of those years, he has worked as a service center manager and as a mechanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">For several years, Claimant has been authorized to complete piecework projects in his home for one of Applied Industrial\u2019s clients, B. Stuart Bauer. Claimant testified at trial that, in October 1998, while performing one of these projects in his home, he injured his back in attempting to place two boxes on the floor. The combined weight of the boxes was approximately seventy-five pounds. Claimant did not immediately seek medical treatment. A few days later, however, he sought treatment from his family physician, Bradford L. Ebright, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Dr. Ebright opined that Claimant was suffering from either a muscle spasm, muscle sprain, or pinched nerve, and recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>mended physical therapy. After two physical therapy visits, Claimant was referred by Dr. Ebright to Kenneth J. Murray, M.D., a neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Dr. Murray treated Claimant with medication and recommended bed rest. Following this visit, Claimant informed Dr. Murray that his condition was much improved. Approximately five months after the accident, Claimant was released from the care of Dr. Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In November 1999, thirteen months after the first injury, Claimant again injured his back. He testified that while working on Applied Industrial\u2019s property, he lost his footing on the oily floor and fell onto his left side. Claimant again was treated by Dr. Murray. After some time passed, Dr. Murray, in consultation with other surgeons, recommended that Claimant undergo surgery to alleviate the pain and pressure in his back. Claimant underwent two surgeries to his back, the first occurring in May 2000 and the second in November 2000. He eventually returned to work, but was restricted to light duty and limited lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">On June 12, 2000, approximately one month after his first surgery, Claimant filed two claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Claimant listed October 18, 1998 and November 5, 1999 as the accidental injury dates. On November 3, 2000, the Commission held an evidentiary hearing on both claims. At the hearing, Claimant admitted that he was unsure of the exact date of the October injury, and \u201cuse[d] the 18th [of October] as a nearest point of recollection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Claimant\u2019s counsel then informed the Commission that Claimant wished to amend his claim to state that the injury occurred on October 16, 1998. Applied Industrial promptly objected. The Commission implicitly denied the amendment request, stating: \u201cI\u2019m not that worried about the date of the accident. I\u2019m more concerned about the merits and the substance of the case. I don\u2019t know that the date is a big issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Five days later, the Commission issued its orders denying both claims. The orders are identically worded save for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>claim numbers, dates alleged in the separate claims, and Claimant\u2019s average weekly wage at the relevant times. The orders state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Hearing was held in the above claim at Baltimore, Maryland on November 3, 2000 on the following issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Did the employee sustain an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">The Commission finds on the issue presented that the claimant did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment as alleged to have occurred on [October 18, 1998] [November 5, 1999]; and the Commission has concluded to disallow the claim filed herein. Average weekly wage \u2014 [$953.35] [$1000.34].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">It is, therefore, this 8th day of NOVEMBER, 2000 by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ORDERED that the claim filed in the above case by the above-named claimant, against the above-named employer and the above-named insurer, be and the same is hereby disallowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Claimant thereafter petitioned the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for judicial review of the two Commission rulings. The case came on for a jury trial on September 10, 2001, and concluded with a verdict the next day. At trial, Claimant challenged the Commission\u2019s decision, contending that on both occasions he suffered an accidental injury in and during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Claimant testified, much as he had at the Commission hearing, that he \u201cgave the best date that [he] knew of\u2019 regarding the dates on which the accidents occurred. He now believed, however, that the first accident occurred on October 8, 1998, not October 18th as the benefits claim form stated, or October 16th as was his testimony before the Commission. Claimant explained that he was eventually able to identify the injury as having occurred on October 8th by calculating back from the dates on which he visited the doctor and recalling that he was not at work on October 18th, per his doctor\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Claimant testified that the second accident occurred on November 8, 1999, and not on November 5th as he had stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>on the claim form. Claimant explained this date adjustment by recalling that he had substantially completed a \u201cpump rebuild\u201d for a client on a Friday, leaving the weekend for continued work if necessary. The following Monday morning, November 8th, he was injured while testing that pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">At the close of Claimant\u2019s case, Applied Industrial made a motion for judgment. Applied Industrial argued that because Claimant was unable to establish the specific dates of the alleged accidental injuries, judgment should be entered in Applied Industrial\u2019s favor. In opposition, Claimant argued that the record reflected his acknowledgment of a date discrepancy and, inasmuch as the Commission had stated that it was not concerned with the inexactness of the accident dates, the motion for judgment should be denied. The court denied the motion, agreeing with Claimant that inconsistent dates were \u201cnot the thrust of the Work[ers\u2019] Comp\u2019s decision.\u201d The court further stated: \u201cI\u2019m not worrying about the dates. [The Commission\u2019s] concern was whether or not there was an accidental injury ... which is the same question that the jury has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">At the close of all the evidence, Applied Industrial renewed its motion for judgment, arguing the same grounds as before. The court denied this motion, reiterating that \u201cthe issue is did the employee sustain an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of [his] employment, and the question is whether it was, whether that occurred on two different days. And, in other words, it\u2019s, it\u2019s putting form before substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In light of the tragic events occurring that day (September 11, 2001) in the Washington D.C. area, New York, and Pennsylvania, the court, after an off-the-record discussion, polled the six-member jury concerning whether it wished to hear instructions and closing arguments by counsel, and begin deliberating.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All six jurors indicated their desire to continue with the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>After the court completed its instructions, Applied Industrial objected to the verdict sheet, arguing that it was prejudicial to Applied Industrial because it left \u201cwide open\u201d whether Claimant had an accidental injury at any time during any given month. The verdict sheet read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">1. Was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission correct in its orders that the Claimant did not suffer an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">A. First accident: yes_no_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">B. Second accident: yes_no_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Before the court ruled on this objection, Applied Industrial also objected, for the first time, to the court\u2019s decision allowing the jury to begin deliberating. Counsel stated: \u201cI believe in light of the circumstances that are going on in the country right now ... this could be a rush to judgment.\u201d The court overruled both objections, and closing arguments commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The jury retired and, nearly an hour later, returned with a verdict. Before the court clerk called for the verdict, the court made part of the record a message signed by all of the jurors, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">The jury\u2019s decision to move forward reflects our determination in view of today\u2019s tragic events to carry out the business with which we are charged. We intend to do that with deliberate and careful attention in the interest of fairness to all the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The jury foreman then read the verdict, finding that the Commission was not correct in determining that Claimant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>not suffered two accidental injuries arising out of and during the course of his employment. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Before reaching the specific issues presented in this case, we briefly summarize the means by which judicial review of a Commission decision is obtained. A party aggrieved by a decision of the Commission may appeal to the circuit court. Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2002 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 9-737 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d). The General Assembly has set forth in LE \u00a7 9-745 the procedure for conducting appellate proceedings in the circuit court. There are \u201ctwo alternative modalities\u201d that an appeal from the Commission may take. <em>S.B. Thomas, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>114 Md.App. 357, 364, 689 A.2d 1301 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">One is pursuant to Labor and Employment Art. \u00a7 9-745(e), which replicates the routine appeal process from administrative agency decisions generally. According to that modality, the circuit court reviews the Commission\u2019s action on the record and determines whether the Commission 1) acted within its power and 2) correctly construed the law and facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">The other and more unusual modality is that spelled out by \u00a7 9-745(d), which provides for what is essentially a trial <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-9\"><em>Id. </em>A trial that is essentially <em>de novo </em>is unlike the procedure applicable to many other administrative law bodies, where appeal to the circuit court is usually determined on the record made at the agency hearing. <em>General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 88-89, 555 A.2d 542 (1989). At trial, the parties may rely on the same or different evidence than was presented to the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 555 A.2d 542. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>same time, the Commission\u2019s decision is not treated as if it had never occurred. \u201cIt is, rather, the case that the presumptively correct outcome of that adjudication is admissible as an item of evidence and is the proper subject of a jury instruction.\u201d <em>S.B. Thomas, Inc., </em>114 Md.App. at 866, 689 A.2d 1301 (citing <em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, Inc., </em>334 Md. 480, 486-87, 639 A.2d 701 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The Court of Appeals long ago described the appellate court\u2019s standard of review of these essentially <em>de novo </em>trials: <em>Talley v. Dept. of Correction, </em>230 Md. 22, 29, 185 A.2d 352 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">With this legal framework in mind, we turn to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">We first address the circuit court\u2019s denial of Applied Industrial\u2019s motion for judgment. Applied Industrial\u2019s argument is premised on the fact that Claimant\u2019s trial testimony concerning the dates of his two injuries varied not only from his testimony before the Commission, but from the dates identified in his benefits claims. More specifically, Applied Industrial argues that: (1) in failing to identify the specific dates of the accidents, Claimant did not meet his burden of proving that he sustained an accidental injury in the course of employment; (2) Claimant was required to raise the \u201cnew\u201d dates of the accidents before the Commission and, not having done so, was precluded from presenting them to the jury; (3) Claimant\u2019s failure to specify particular accident dates prejudiced Applied Industrial\u2019s \u201cright to investigate\u201d; and (4) allowing Claimant to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits without identifying the specific accident dates leaves the benefit system open to fraud and abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), a compensable \u201c[accidental personal injury\u201d includes- \u201can accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-101(b)(l) of the Labor and Employment Article. If an employee incurs an accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>injury, then his employer must provide compensation for the injury pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-501.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The mere occurrence of an accident does not suffice for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 9, 690 A.2d 990 (1997). Rather, the Act compensates \u201conly those injuries that are occupationally-related, and not those perils common to all mankind or to which the public is generally exposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen a claimant seeks compensation for an accidental personal injury under LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-101(b)(l) and 9-501, he or she must demonstrate that it both arose out of <em>and </em>in the course of the employment. These two conditions precedent are not synonymous; both must be proven in order to bring the claim within the operation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Applied Industrial does not contest that Claimant\u2019s accidental injury arose out of his employment, nor does Applied Industrial attack, as such, the sufficiency of the evidence that Claimant\u2019s injury occurred in the course of employment. The attack is more specific, and is grounded on the argument that an accidental injury is compensable <em>only </em>when the exact accident date is known and has been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">As support for this position, Applied Industrial relies on <em>Miller v. Coles, </em>232 Md. 522, 194 A.2d 614 (1963). There, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Court of Appeals was called upon to determine whether an accidental injury arose out of and in the course of employment. In deciding the issue, the Court stated that the phrase \u201cin the course of\u2019 refers to the \u201c \u2018time, place, and circumstances under which an injury occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 194 A.2d 614 (quoting <em>Hill v. Liberty Motor &amp; Engineering Corp., </em>185 Md. 596, 605, 45 A.2d 467 (1946)). This statement is certainly correct. But we do not see how it suggests that proof of the exact date of the accidental injury is required for the injury to be compensable, as Applied Industrial contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">To the contrary, the case law clarifies that the \u201ctime, place and circumstances of the accident in relation to employment\u201d requires simply \u201c \u2018that the injury be shown to have arisen <em>within the time and space boundaries of the employment, </em>and in the course of an activity whose purpose is related to the employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wade, </em>345 Md. at 11, 690 A.2d 990 (quoting 1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 14.00 (1996) (current \u00a7 12.01) (2002)). \u201cAn injury arises \u2018in the course of employment\u2019 when it occurs: (1) within the period of employment, (2) at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties, and (3) while he is fulfilling those duties or engaged in doing something incident thereto.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Smith, </em>144 Md.App, 548, 558, 799 A.2d 406 (2002); <em>see also Knoche v. Cox, </em>282 Md. 447, 454, 385 A.2d 1179 (1978). Said differently, \u201can injury is in the course of employment when it occurs during the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>345 Md. at 11, 690 A.2d 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">To be sure, a claimant\u2019s ability to prove the occurrence of an accidental injury may be made more difficult by either the claimant\u2019s inability to identify the exact date on which an alleged accidental injury occurred, or a variance between the date alleged in the claim and either the claimant\u2019s subsequent testimony or other evidence offered. But this is not to say that proof of an accidental injury necessitates proof of the date on which that injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cIn pleadings under a compensation act, calling things by wrong names, or bringing a petition under a wrong title, or making other harmless mistakes as to details such as dates, are immaterial if the intention of the pleading is clear.\u201d 7 Arthur LARSON &amp; LEX K. LARSON, WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION LAW \u00a7 124.04[2] (2002). Moreover, \u201c[a]s to variance between pleadings and proof, wide latitude is allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 124.04[5], Applied Industrial does not contend on appeal that Claimant was not an employee at the relevant times\u2014 October 1998 and November 1999 \u2014 or that he was not performing work-related tasks. That Claimant vacillated as to exactly when the injuries occurred was a matter of weight for the jury to consider in determining whether he had sustained his burden of proving the alleged accidental injuries. We therefore reject Applied Industrial\u2019s argument that Claimant failed to prove the occurrence of the accidental injuries simply because his trial testimony concerning the dates on which the accidents occurred differed from the dates he identified in his claims for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Again relying on the discrepancy between the dates Claimant put before the Commission and those he put before the jury, Applied Industrial separately argues that its motion for judgment should have been granted because the Commission\u2019s role as the \u201ctribunal of first instance\u201d was usurped by the court\u2019s allowing the jury to consider \u201cessentially ... a new claim.\u201d The jury did not consider new claims; the claims were precisely those considered by the Commission. The Commission was well aware that Claimant was unsure of the dates on which the accidents occurred and advised the parties that the lack of specificity in the dates was not of concern to the Commission in its decision. As the Commissioner stated: \u201cI\u2019m not that worried about the date of the accident. I\u2019m more concerned about the merits and the substance of the case. I don\u2019t know that the date is a big issue.\u201d The circuit court likewise viewed the variance in the dates as a matter of \u201cform,\u201d not \u201csubstance,\u201d and repeated that inconsistent dates \u201cwere not the thrust\u201d of the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Applied Industrial also asserts that the inexactness of dates prejudiced its investigation of Claimant\u2019s initial claim for benefits, and that allowing Claimant to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits without identifying the specific dates leaves the benefit system open to fraud and abuse. Claimant responds that these issues are not preserved for review on appeal. We agree. Applied Industrial did not present either argument in support of its motions for judgment or, for that matter, at any other time during the trial. Applied Industrial\u2019s failure to raise these arguments at trial precludes their being raised now. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In sum, the court did not err in denying Applied Industrial\u2019s motion for judgment. The jury had before it legally sufficient evidence to support its finding that Claimant was twice accidentally injured and that the injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. We shall not disturb the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Applied Industrial also assigns error to the court\u2019s refusal to sustain its objection to the verdict sheet. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Maryland Rule 2-522(c) gives the court the authority to design submissions to the jury and to format the jury\u2019s findings. Consequently, a court\u2019s use of a particular format will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 525, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">We have reviewed the verdict sheet and conclude that it is not \u201csuggestive of a particular result\u201d simply because the verdict sheet used the term \u201caccident,\u201d as Applied Industrial asserts. The verdict sheet asked the jury to decide whether the Commission was correct in determining that Claimant did not sustain the two alleged accidental injuries in the course of his employment. The use of the word accident did not suggest the answer to the question that was before the jury. This is all the more true given that the occurrence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>accidents themselves was never called into serious question; instead, it was the timing and circumstances under which they occurred that the jury had to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Applied Industrial also submits that the accident dates listed on Claimant\u2019s benefits claim forms should have been added at the end of the verdict sheet to avoid potential jury confusion. The verdict sheet was not confusing on its face, nor is there any indication in the record that the jury was in fact confused. The jury was asked to determine only if the Commission was correct in determining that Claimant did not sustain compensable injuries. The verdict sheet so directed the jury to this task. There was no abuse of discretion by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Finally, Applied Industrial contends that the court abused its discretion in permitting the jury to deliberate and render a verdict after having just learned of the terrorist attack that had occurred that morning. Applied Industrial further contends that \u201cno reasonable juror could possibly have concentrated on the complex issues\u201d involved in the case under these circumstances. In essence, Applied Industrial argues that the court should have ordered a mid-trial continuance. Claimant responds that Applied Industrial failed to preserve this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">It is not enough, for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, that an objection be made. The objection must be timely. <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 540, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (failure to make timely or appropriate objections constitutes waiver); <em>Lohss and Sprenkle v. State, </em>272 Md. 113, 119, 321 A.2d 534 (1974) (party who fails to object when trial court still has power to correct error cannot complain on appeal). In this case, Applied Industrial delayed objecting until after the jury had been polled and advised the court of its desire to proceed. Indeed, it was not until after the court accepted the jury\u2019s decision and gave the jury its instructions that Applied Industrial lodged its objection. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>might have been preferable had Applied Industrial raised its concern when the matter was discussed initially. Yet, Applied Industrial did interpose an objection to the jury\u2019s being allowed to deliberate before those deliberations began. Under these circumstances, the issue is preserved for our review. <em>In re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. 26, 35-36, 797 A.2d 39 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Somewhat surprisingly, we have found no reported decisions involving the conduct of trials that were ongoing as the September 11th tragedy unfolded. Nevertheless, while the events of that day were unique in their significance and effect, we adhere to settled principles, of appellate review as we assess the propriety of the court\u2019s decision in this case not to continue trial as it neared its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Under these principles, the course and conduct of trial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and its decisions in this regard will not be reversed absent abuse. <em>Cf. Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 413, 326 A.2d 707 (1974) (\u201cThe conduct of the trial must of necessity rest largely in the control and discretion of the presiding judge and an appellate court should in no case interfere with that judgment unless there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the complaining party.\u201d). Whether to grant a mid-trial continuance is among those decisions left to the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Butkus v. McClendon, </em>259 Md. 170, 175, 269 A.2d 427 (1970); <em>see also Wilson v. State, </em>345 Md. 437, 450-51, 693 A.2d 344 (1997) (stating that trial courts are \u201cvested with a significant amount of discretion\u201d in determining whether to grant a mid-trial continuance, and may consider the convenience of the court, the jury, or witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In this case, the court, presumably after discussion with counsel, decided to poll the jurors to ascertain their desire to proceed with the trial despite the events of that morning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The jury was polled and all members indicated by a show of hands that they wished to continue the trial to conclusion. The court\u2019s decision permitting the jury to do so was well-considered and, given the jury\u2019s express desire to continue, was a proper exercise of discretion under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We mention as a final matter the jury\u2019s note addressing this issue. That note expressed, quite eloquently, that the jurors had agreed to continue with the final phases of the trial, and were determined to \u201ccarry out the business with which [they] were charged ... with deliberate and careful attention in the interest of fairness to all parties.\u201d There is every indication that the jurors did precisely that; we applaud them for their admirable response to this important duty of citizenship in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-13\">.
