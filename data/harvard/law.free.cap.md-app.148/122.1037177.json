That request was denied and this appeal followed, in which a single question is presented for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I. WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT WAS LEGALLY CORRECT IN DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S REQUEST FOR A HEARING BOARD COMPRISED OF MEMBERS FROM ANOTHER AGENCY.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the circuit court erred by denying appellant the relief that he requested. We shall therefore remand for further proceedings before a hearing board comprised of law enforcement officers who are not members of the BCPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Appellant began his employment with the Department on October 7, 1993. On September 6, 2001, he was charged with five departmental violations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all of which arose out of an incident that occurred on September 4, 2000, while he was on patrol in Central District and while officers of the BCPD\u2019s Internal Affairs Integrity Unit (\u201cIAIU\u201d) were conducting a random undercover sting operation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IAIU officers placed what appeared to be a package of crack cocaine on a bench in a park located on Presstman Street, made calls to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>BCPD about the package, and waited to observe the officers who responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Although the parties dispute what transpired when appellant arrived,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was indicted for perjury and misconduct in office. The criminal charges received extensive publicity, including thirty-three newspaper articles that appeared in the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>between October 5, 2000 and September 12, 2001.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, a break-in that occurred at the IAIU\u2019s office in December of 2000 generated intensive media speculation that this crime was related to appellant\u2019s case. On January 24, 2001, the State dismissed all criminal charges against appellant. After the dismissal of appellant\u2019s criminal charges, the Commissioner expressed the Department\u2019s disappointment with the decision not to prosecute appellant, and an intense political battle ensued between the Mayor and the State\u2019s Attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its January 25, 2001 edition, the <em>Balti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>more Sun </em>reported that the Commissioner had \u201cheld a news conference the day Sewell was arrested, Oct. 4, using the case to prove he was serious about targeting corruption.\u201d This article reprinted the Commissioner\u2019s previous characterization of appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct as \u201ca horrible breach of the public trust,\u201d and quoted the Commissioner as stating that, \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s decision not to move forward with his [appellant\u2019s] case, but defer to their judgment in doing so,\u201d [and that the decision to drop the criminal case] \u201cwill certainly not deter the efforts of the ... Department in its commitment to root out corrupt police officers and to restore the integrity of the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On October 17, 2001, appellant\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the Department\u2019s Chief Legal Advisor, citing the public comments made by the Commissioner and the Mayor, and requesting that the officers who would serve on appellant\u2019s hearing board be selected from another law enforcement agency. On October 23, 2001, the Chief Legal Officer denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Judicial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On October 29, 2001, appellant filed with the circuit court a Petition to Show Cause, requesting that the circuit court order that the members of the hearing board in appellant\u2019s case be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>selected from another law enforcement agency. The petition asserted that appellant would not be able to have a fair hearing because of the public comments made by the Mayor and the Commissioner. During the hearing on that petition, appellant\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">What I\u2019m concerned about is when you have a three-member panel made up from the members of the ... Department ranking from major, lieutenant and someone of equal rank, which would be a police agent, when their boss and his boss have already come out and said he\u2019s guilty, I don\u2019t believe he can get a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">Whether intentionally or unintentionally these members have been with the police department, would like to get promoted within their police department, would like to get positions they would enjoy within their police department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The circuit court responded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">I understand your point. Let\u2019s assume that the wiser course might be for the commissioner to exercise his discretion in the fashion you seek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">What \u2014 in the statute what is there to require that he do so by my order? What gives me, empowers me to force him to exercise his discretion? I can say that your position is a wise one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The circuit court ultimately denied appellant\u2019s petition, stating: \u201cWell, I think that your cause here is not an unwise one, but I don\u2019t think I have the statutory authority to do, or the case law authority to do what you\u2019re proposing given the repercussions.\u201d The circuit court filed an order that concluded: \u201cBecause there is neither precedent nor law permitting a court to require the Commissioner to exercise his statutory discretion in a particular way, the Petition will be Denied.\u201d Appellant filed a notice of appeal on November 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Appellant\u2019s administrative hearing began on November 1, 2001. As a preliminary matter, appellant\u2019s counsel moved that the members of the hearing board recuse themselves b\u00e9cause of the pre-hearing publicity and the negative comments made by the Commissioner and the Mayor. The Department\u2019s counsel argued that the circuit court had already ruled on this issue. The hearing board\u2019s Chairperson denied appellant\u2019s request, stating that no BCPD member had put any pressure on him or on the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The hearing board proceeded to decide the merits of the administrative charges brought against appellant, and ultimately found appellant guilty of all five charges. The board also recommended that appellant\u2019s employment be terminated as a result of each guilty finding. On December 11, 2001, the Commissioner approved the board\u2019s recommendation, and terminated appellant\u2019s employment with the BCPD. Appellant filed a Petition for Judicial Review of that decision, but the circuit court has. stayed that proceeding pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (\u201cLEOBR\u201d), Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734D was enacted by the General Assembly \u201c \u2018to guarantee that certain procedural safeguards be offered to police officers during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mass Transit Admin. v. Hayden, </em>141 Md.App. 100, 107, 784 A.2d 627 (2001) (quoting <em>Abbott v. Administrative Hearing Bd., </em>33 Md.App. 681, 366 A.2d 756, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 727 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">An officer who is aggrieved of a right protected by the LEOBR may petition the circuit court pursuant to the Md. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 734, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">Any law enforcement officer who is denied any right afforded by this subtitle may apply at any time prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>commencement of the hearing before the hearing board, either individually or through his certified or recognized employee organization, to the circuit court of the county where he is regularly employed for any order directing the law enforcement agency to show cause why the right should not be afforded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 734 is to enforce the accused officer\u2019s rights under the Act, not to restrict the agency\u2019s legitimate right to discipline errant officers.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Anderson, </em>73 Md.App. 604, 616, 535 A.2d 955 (1988). Officers have used a \u201c \u00a7 734 proceeding\u201d to seek relief from alleged deprivations of a variety of rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The LEOBR defines \u201chearing board\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmH\">A board which is authorized by the chief to hold a hearing on a complaint against a law enforcement officer and which consists of not less than three members, except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, all to be appointed by the chief and selected from law enforcement officers within that agency, <em>or law enforcement officers of another agency with the appt\"oval of the chief of the other agency, and who have had no part in the investigation or interrogation of the law enforcement officer. </em>At least one member of the hearing board shall be of the same rank as the law enforcement officer against whom the complaint has been filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 727(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We must first decide whether the circuit court had the authority to order that the hearing board be comprised of members from a law enforcement agency other than the BCPD. Because the LEOBR does not specifically address this issue, we must apply the canons of statutory interpretation \u201cto discern and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>FOP, Montgomery County Lodge No. 35 v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 173-74, 680 A.2d 1052 (1996).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Mass Transit Admin. v. Hayden, </em>141 Md.App. 100, 784 A.2d 627 (2001), an officer facing administrative charges requested that a hearing board issue a summons to an officer who was subsequently appointed chair of the hearing board. When the board denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>request, the officer sought judicial relief pursuant to \u00a7 734. While appellant\u2019s \u00a7 734 proceeding was pending in the circuit court, (1) the board heard the officer\u2019s case, and rendered a recommendation, and (2) the police chief adopted that recommendation, suspending the officer. Thereafter, the circuit court decided the merits of the \u00a7 734 proceeding, concluded that the officer had the right under the LEOBR to the issuance of a summons, and therefore vacated the police chiefs disciplinary order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">This Court affirmed, concluding that (1) although not expressly stated in the LEOBR, \u00a7 734 grants the circuit court the authority to vacate an administrative decision that resulted from an improper denial of an officer\u2019s procedural rights, and (2) \u201ctt]o moot a section 734 action because it is not resolved before the administrative hearing that it challenges would defeat the \u2018pre-hearing review\u2019 purpose of that statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 784 A.2d 627. In the case at bar, because a law enforcement officer facing departmental charges has the right to an impartial hearing board, the circuit court had the authority to determine whether this is a case in which the hearing board must be composed of members of another law enforcement agency. The circuit court erred in concluding that it did not have the authority to grant appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Appellant argues that his due process rights <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were violated when he was deprived of an impartial hearing board consisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of members of a law enforcement agency other than the BCPD.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with that argument. The Court of Appeals has repeatedly stated that procedural due process in an administrative hearing requires that the agency performing an adjudicatory function observe the basic principles of fairness. <em>Coleman v. Anne Arundel Police Department, </em>369 Md. 108, 142, 797 A.2d 770 (2002); <em>Gigeous v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 509, 769 A.2d 912 (2001); <em>Regan v. State Bd. of Chiropractic Exam\u2019rs, </em>355 Md. 397, 408, 735 A.2d 991 (1999); <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 559, 625 A.2d 914 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Court of Appeals has stated that in an administrative proceeding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201c[d]ue process ... is not a rigid concept____\u2018[it] is flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts [v. Total Health Care, Inc.], </em>349 Md. [499] at 509, 709 A.2d [142] at 147 [1998] (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 416, 474 A.2d 191, 203 (1984)). We explained that \u201cin determining what process is due, the Court will balance the private and government interests affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted). In this regard, we apply the following balancing test developed by the Supreme Court in <em>Mathews [v. Eldridge </em>], 424 U.S. [319] at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 [ (1976) ], to assist us in our endeavor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">Identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest,, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Coleman, supra, </em>369 Md. at 142-43, 797 A.2d 770. Section 727(d)(1)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> specifically allows a hearing board to be composed of \u201claw enforcement officers of another agency with the approval of the chief of the other agency.\u201d It is obvious that the deliberate selection of a hearing board that is biased against an officer would constitute a violation of the procedural safeguards required by the due process clause. From our application of the <em>Mathews </em>test to the facts of the case at bar, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s right to due process was violated by the selection of a hearing board comprised of BCPD officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">This is a case in which there is great value in selecting a hearing board comprised of members from another law enforcement agency. No reasonable person would challenge the proposition that, whatever the outcome, the fact that the hearing board is comprised of members from another agency would bolster public confidence in the board\u2019s decision. There can be no doubt that an overwhelming majority of BCPD officers wish to continue working for the Department, wish to be promoted and/or avoid being assigned to undesirable duties. Given the intense publicity about the statements made by the Commissioner and by the Mayor who appointed him, it is much more likely so than not so that any BCPD officer chosen to serve on appellant\u2019s hearing board would be inclined to find against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The Department does not have a particularly strong interest in trying appellant before members of the BCPD. While it is obvious that the Department has an interest in rooting out corrupt officers, all police forces share this interest. The cost of utilizing members from another agency would be minimal. This procedure would simply involve a request to another agency, and approval by that agency\u2019s chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u201cIt is elementary that \u2018a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weiss v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 163, 178, 114 S.Ct. 752, 127 L.Ed.2d 1 (1994) (quoting <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955)). \u201cIrrespective of whether a defendant be guilty or innocent, under our system of law, he or she is entitled to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Curry v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 250, 259, 458 A.2d 474 (1983). \u201cA necessary component of a fair trial is an impartial judge.\u201d <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 532, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the context of a motion for recusal filed in an administrative proceeding, the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">In determining whether there is either actual bias or an appearance of impropriety on the part of a decision maker in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, we begin with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>presumption of impartiality. As Judge Bell observed for the Court in <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 107, 622 A.2d 737, 741 (1993),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cThere is a strong presumption in Maryland ... and elsewhere ... that judges are impartial participants in the legal process, whose duty to preside when qualified is as strong as their duty to refrain from presiding when not qualified .... The recusal decision, therefore, is discretionary ... and the exercise of that discretion will not be overturned except for abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">The Court in <em>Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107-108, 622 A.2d at 741, went on to discuss \u201cthe proper test to be applied\u201d in determining whether there is an \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d and quoted from <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 86, 581 A.2d 1, 9 (1990), where the Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201c \u2018The test to be applied is an objective one which assumes that a reasonable person <em>knows and understands all the relevant facts. ... </em>We disagree with our dissenting colleague\u2019s statement that recusal based on an appearance of impropriety ... \u201crequires us to judge the situation from the viewpoint of the reasonable person, and not from a purely legalistic perspective.\u201d Like all legal issues, judges determine appearance of impropriety \u2014 not by what a straw poll of the only partly informed man-in-the-street would show\u2014 but by examining the record facts and the law, and deciding whether a reasonable person knowing and understanding all the relevant facts would recuse the judge.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>In Re Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., </em>861 F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1102, 109 S.Ct. 2458, 104 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1989)). <em>See also, e.g., Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 468, 578 A.2d 745, 759 (1990) (\u201cUsing an objective standard precludes the necessity of delving into the subjective mindset of the challenged judge\u201d); <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 253, 533 A.2d 916, 920 (1987) (\u201cThe test generally used in the application of [the] standard is an objective one \u2014 whether a reasonable member of the public knowing all the circumstances would be led to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Regan, supra, </em>355 Md. at 411, 735 A.2d 991. The United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. To this end no man can be a judge in his own case and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome. That interest cannot be defined with precision. Circumstances and relationships must be considered. This Court has said, however, that <em>\u201cevery procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge ... not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.\u201d Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 532, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749. Such a stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties. <em>But to perform its high function in the best way \u201cjustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d Offutt v.

From those public statements made and the facts of this case, it is highly probable that any Baltimore City Police Officer would find against appellant if chosen to serve on his hearing board. The appearance of justice was simply not satisfied by the selection of a hearing board comprised of BCPD officers. Appellant is therefore entitled to a new hearing before a board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>comprised of law enforcement officers who are not members of the BCPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">JUDGMENT DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S PETITION REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ENTRY OF AN ORDER THAT VACATES THE DEPARTMENT\u2019S ORDER TERMINATING APPELLANT\u2019S EMPLOYMENT AND THAT REMANDS APPELLANT\u2019S DEPARTMENTAL CHARGES TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\">.

The IAIU was created by the Police Commissioner to eliminate \"dirty\u201d police officers from the police force. The charges against appellant were among the first to be filed by the IAIU.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b149-5\">. Appellant\u2019s version is as follows. While on patrol, he heard the communications relating to drug activity in the park, and he responded to that location in his patrol vehicle. He observed a suspect in the park who fit the description of the suspect described in the broadcast. The suspect was kneeling near a bench and appeared to be holding a plastic bag. When he saw appellant, the suspect fled. At this point, appellant exited his vehicle and searched for drugs. When another officer found the drugs, appellant informed that officer that he had observed the suspect flee. Appellant later responded to a burglary call in the area, and he arrested the burglary suspect leaving a building. Because appellant recognized the burglary suspect as the person who fled from the area of the park bench, he charged the suspect, Frederick McCoy (\"McCoy\u201d), with burglary and possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.
