The order reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>1. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Ancillary Relief in Aid of Enforcement is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">2. Defendant Forward shall issue stock certificates to the Plaintiff Curt\u00edan R. McNeily for 44 percent of the stock of Business Information Network, Inc. and to Mark Burnett for 5 percent of the stock of Business Information Network, Inc. in accordance with their stock interests as determined by the judgment recorded in this court and entered in <em>Business Information Network, Inc. et al. v. David R. Forward, </em>Case No. CAL 94-25360, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">3. Defendant Forward shall bring the stock register of BIN into conformity with the judgment entered in <em>Business Information Network, Inc. et al. v. David R. Forward, </em>Case No. CAL 94-25360, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">4. Defendant Forward is enjoined from any disposition of the property subject to the judgment or from any disposition of the documents representing an interest in such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Under the provisions of section 12-303(1), 3(i) and (v) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1998 RepLVoL), the above interlocutory order was immediately appealable, even though no final judgment was entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties against whom the order was direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ed, Catalyst Equity Corporation and David R. Forward, filed an appeal from the foregoing order and raise the following question:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>viz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">Did the circuit court for Montgomery County err in granting appellees\u2019 motion for ancillary relief in aid of enforcement of a Prince George\u2019s County judgment, where no judgment was entered in Prince George\u2019s County?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The resolution of the sole issue raised in this appeal concerns procedural matters that took place in three cases, one in Prince George\u2019s County and two in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">A. <em>The Prince George\u2019s County Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In December 1994, a lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County by Business Information Network, Inc. (\u201cBIN\u201d); Mark Burnett; Curt\u00edan McNeily; Curt\u00edan McNeily as a receiver for P.C. Consultants, Inc. (\u201cPCI\u201d); Curt\u00edan McNeily and Mark Burnett as shareholders of BIN; and BIN as a nominal plaintiff. The individual plaintiffs were all shareholders \u2014 or former shareholders \u2014 of BIN. The defendants in that lawsuit were David Forward; his wife, Maryann; and the law firm of Ginsberg, Feldman and Press, Chartered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(\u201cGFB\u201d). The Prince George\u2019s County complaint contained seven counts, including one alleging legal malpractice against GFB. Prior to trial, the claim against GFB was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On November 2, 1995, plaintiffs filed a \u201cFirst Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Damages.\u201d In Counts I, II, and III, the plaintiffs asked the court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">[djeclare that McNeily is the lawful owner of at least forty-four percent (44%) of BIN stock and that Burnett is the lawful owner of at least five percent (5%) of BIN stock ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The parties filed multiple pretrial motions in the period between 1994 and 1998. Resolution of those motions delayed the start of the jury trial until November 30, 1998. The jury thereafter found for the plaintiffs on some, but not all, issues by answering a number of questions set forth on a special verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The jury found that David Forward had breached the fiduciary duty he owed to certain of the plaintiffs in several ways. The jury also found that Mr. Forward had breached a contract with Messrs. Burnett and McNeily and had converted to his own use certain shares of their stock. The jury awarded damages to the various plaintiffs that cumulatively totaled over four million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">On the special verdict sheet, the jury was asked to name the current shareholders of BIN and their percentage interest. Evidently, that question was posed so that the court could declare the rights of the parties as requested in Counts I \u2014 III. The jury answered that question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\"><em>David R. Forward % </em>51</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\"><em>Curt\u00edan R. McNeily % </em>44</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\"><em>Mark Burnett </em>% _5</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">On January 19, 1999, the trial judge, Honorable Darlene Perry, pursuant to the answers to other questions set forth on the special verdict sheet, entered judgment against David Forward: (1) in favor of Mark Burnett in the amount of $324,888; (2) in favor of Curt\u00edan McNeily in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>$1,000,000; (3) in favor of BIN in the amount of $812,888; and (4) in favor of PCI Receiver in the amount of $2,630,480. Punitive damages of $5,000 and $10,000 were awarded to Mark Burnett and Curt\u00edan McNeily, respectively \u2014 also against David Forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Three days after the jury\u2019s monetary awards were reduced to separate judgments, plaintiffs filed a motion for an accounting and declaratory judgment. In regard to their request for declaratory judgment, the motion read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Plaintiffs have moved the court for ... a judgment declaring that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">1. The books and records of [BIN] reflect that Curt\u00edan R. McNeily is the rightful owner of 44 percent, and Mark C. Burnett is the rightful owner of 5 percent of the stock of [BIN] and that certificates of stock be issued to reflect the ownership percentages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">2. The June 20, 1997 transfer of at least 49 percent of [BIN] stock to Catalyst Equity Corporation of New Mexico is null and void;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">3. Since December 4, 1989, two lawful members of the [BIN] Board of Directors are and have been Mark Burnett and Brian Boland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">4. Curt\u00edan R. McNeily and Mark C. Burnett are entitled to elect two of the Directors to [BIN].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">5. David R. Forward, because of his malicious tortious conduct, is forever barred from acting as an officer, director or employee of [BIN][o]r benefitting in any manner from the judgment in favor of [BIN].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\"><em>Declaratory Judgment by the Court is necessary to effect complete and equitable implementation of the jury verdict </em>and to prevent defendant David R. Forward from profiting from his own wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\">For the reasons set forth above, the Court should enter a judgment declaring the rights of the plaintiffs under the Agreement to Associate in the form attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>On the same day that the motion for an accounting and a declaratory judgment was filed, January 22, 1999, David Forward filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), for a new trial, or (alternatively) for a \u201cRevision of the Verdict.\u201d A hearing on Forward\u2019s post-trial motions was held on January 26, 1999. At the beginning of that hearing, counsel for plaintiffs reminded Judge Perry that plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a declaratory judgment and an accounting was pending. Nevertheless, in the lengthy hearing that followed, neither the declaratory judgment motion nor the motion for an accounting was again mentioned. No one reminded Judge Perry that three counts of the first amended complaint had asked for a declaratory judgment in favor of certain of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Judge Perry\u2019s written order disposing of Forward\u2019s post-trial motions was filed on February 3, 1999. The order, in part, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">This court had an opportunity to view the reactions of the jurors and to read their facial expressions, reactions and mannerisms during the course of this trial. Their ill-will toward the defendant, Forward, was apparent. It was more than obvious to this court that the verdicts they returned were the product of bias and in total disregard of the evidence and the court\u2019s instructions. Even if the verdicts were legally proper, justice alone <em>would require that a new trial be granted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">All matters reserved for ruling at the end of the evidence in this trial are granted in favor of the defendants for the reasons raised by the defendants during the trial and as set forth in this opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">Accordingly, the Clerk of the court will enter a docket entry that the motion notwithstanding the verdict is granted, and that any and all verdicts are stricken and reduced to zero. The jury found for the defendant [David Forward] in that he did not expend BIN resources for personal gain and that he did not unlawfully and intentionally and wrongfully destroy BIN business opportunities, causing BIN to lose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>revenues. The jury also found for the defendant, Mary Ann Forward. On the issue of damages for breach of contract, the jury awarded no damages to PCI/McNeily. Those verdicts are in accord with the evidence and instructions, and will not be disputed. The jury found that Forward was a 51% shareholder of BIN, Burnett a 5% shareholder, and McNeily a 44% shareholder. While leaving the parties in a doomed marriage the finding is at least based upon evidence and will not be set aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">The Clerk of the Court will enter a docket entry setting forth the preceding paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">On February 16, 1999, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of, or to alter or amend, the order entered on February 3, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Two days later, plaintiffs filed a line with the court pointing out that their motion for accounting and declaratory judgment was still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">On March 4,1999, a hearing was held on \u201cpending motions.\u201d All motions were taken under advisement. Judge Perry filed, on March 16, 1999, an \u201cAmended Order Granting Partial Judgment Notwithstanding [the] Verdict.\u201d The text of the order filed March 16, 1999, is the same as the order filed February 3, 1999, except: (1) the insertion, at page 3 of the amended order, of the word, \u201cconclusion\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) deletion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>sentence, \u201cEven if the verdicts were legally proper, justice alone would require that a new trial be granted\u201d; (3) addition of a sentence reading, \u201cThe Motion for New Trial is denied\u201d; (4) deletion of the sentence, \u201cAccordingly, the [cjlerk of the court will enter a docket entry that the motion notwithstanding the verdict is granted, and that any and all verdicts are stricken and reduced to zero\u201d and replacing that sentence with one reading: \u201cAccordingly, the [cjlerk of the court will enter docket entries as follows: All rulings on motions to dismiss for the defendants which were reserved during the trial are granted in favor of the defendants\u201d; (5) deletion of the clause \u201c[wjhile leaving the parties in a doomed marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Judge Perry\u2019s amended order did not mention plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for declaratory judgment set forth in their amended complaint, nor the motion for declaratory judgment and an accounting. Nevertheless, an appeal to this Court was filed by the plaintiffs. Thereafter, Mr. Forward filed a cross-appeal in which he contended that the jury\u2019s finding that David Forward, McNeily, and Burnett owned, respectively, 51 percent, 44 percent, and 5 percent of BIN should be reversed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">When the case was before a panel of this Court on appeal, none of the parties pointed out the fact that there were still unresolved matters pending in the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the panel did not discover the problem on its own. On September 20, 2000, this Court filed an unreported opinion in which it affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">B. <em>The First Montgomery Court Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On March 24, 1999 \u2014 which was slightly more than one week after Judge Perry filed her amended order granting a partial motion for JNOV, Curt\u00edan R. McNeily and Mark D. Burnett filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against David Forward. Attached to the complaint was the portion of the verdict sheet in the Prince George\u2019s County action that reflected the jury\u2019s finding that Burnett and McNeily owned 49 percent of BIN and Forward owned the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The Montgomery County complaint alleged that votes were cast for the BIN board of directors at a meeting of BIN stockholders held on February 18, 1999. According to the complaint, David Forward voted his shares for himself, Joanna Pineda, and Cynthia Hayes; Burnett and McNeily voted for themselves and Forward for the board; Forward then declared that his slate \u2014 himself, Pineda, and Hayes \u2014 had won. Messrs. Burnett and McNeily alleged that Forward\u2019s failure to vote for them violated a November 30, 1989, voting trust agreement that incorporated an agreement to associate\u2014 which the parties had previously executed. Plaintiffs asked for the following declaratory relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>A. A declaration ... that Curt\u00edan R. McNeily owns forty-four percent of Business Information Network, Inc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">B. A declaration ... that Mark D. Burnett owns five percent of Business Information Network, Inc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">C. A declaration ... that Mark D. Burnett and Curt\u00edan R. McNeily are directors of [BIN] and have been such since at least February 18, 1999 as a result of the voting trust agreement contained in the Agreement to Associates; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On September 16, 1999, the circuit court granted the defendants partial summary judgment as to the portion of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint requesting the court to declare that Burnett and McNeily \u201care and have been\u201d directors of BIN since February 18,1999. The ground for the court\u2019s ruling was that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint for declaratory (and other) relief on January 25, 2001. The first amended complaint deleted plaintiffs\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment as to their ownership of 49 percent of BIN\u2019s stock but reiterated their request for a declaratory judgment that they had the right to elect two of BIN\u2019s directors. Among other things, the amended complaint also added Catalyst Equity Corporation as an additional defendant and asserted that in June 1997 Forward \u201cpurported to transfer\u201d 100 percent of the outstanding shares in BIN to Catalyst Equity. The first amended complaint also alleged that plaintiffs had theretofore been adjudged (in the Prince George\u2019s County litigation) to be 49 percent stockholders of BIN. Count II alleged breach of fiduciary duty (by Forward) to the plaintiffs; Count III requested BIN\u2019s dissolution; Count IV prayed for an accounting from Forward of BIN\u2019s assets; Count V asked that a constructive trust be placed upon BIN\u2019s assets; Count VI alleged a conspiracy to divert BIN\u2019s assets; and Count VII requested that Forward disgorge monies he received from BIN as a result of unauthorized expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on February 26, 2001, naming David Forward as a defendant individually and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>doing business as NetStrategies2000 and NewHomesAmerica.com.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the first and second amended complaints. The motion was denied on May 2, 2001. Thereafter, the defendants filed an answer to the second amended complaint, in which they raised various defenses, including <em>res judicata </em>and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On July 27, 2001, plaintiffs filed a motion for ancillary relief in aid of enforcement of Judge Perry\u2019s March 1999 order. That motion, as previously stated, was granted on November 16, 2001. The major terms of that ancillary order are set forth <em>supra </em>at Page 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">C. <em>The Second Montgomery County Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On July 25, 2001, the same plaintiffs who filed the first Montgomery County case, filed Case No. 223416. That case was opened for the purpose of filing the docket entries from the Prince George\u2019s case. On November 16, 2001 \u2014 the same date as the Montgomery County interlocutory order was filed \u2014 a Montgomery County circuit court judge signed an order consolidating the two Montgomery County cases. David Forward and Catalyst Equity filed an appeal in the consolidated case from the interlocutory order dated November 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Mr. Forward and Catalyst Equity contend in this appeal that the Montgomery County court erred in granting the motion for ancillary relief in aid of enforcement of the Prince George\u2019s County judgment because \u201cno declaratory judgment was entered in the Prince George\u2019s County case and therefore there was no judgment to enforce.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>agree with the core of appellants\u2019 argument, we do not agree with some of the appellants\u2019 reasons that they contend support their arguments. Those arguments deserve comment, however, because, upon remand, they are likely to resurface.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Appellants argue that the Prince George\u2019s County jury\u2019s answer to the question relating to stock ownership in BIN was not a final judgment because the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-601 (a) were not met. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">Prompt entry \u2014 Separate document. <em>Each judgment shall be set forth on a separate document. </em>Upon a verdict of a jury or a decision by the court allowing recovery only of costs or a specified amount of money or denying all relief, the clerk shall forthwith prepare, sign, and enter the judgment, unless the court orders otherwise. <em>Upon a verdict of a jury or a decision by the court granting other relief, the court shall promptly review the form of the judgment presented and, if approved, sign it, and the clerk shall forthivith enter the judgment as approved and signed. A judgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered as provided in section (b) of this Rule. </em>Unless the court orders otherwise, entry of the judgment shall not be delayed pending determination of the amount of costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ala\">(Emphasis supplied by appellants.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The requirements for a separate document set forth in 2-601 (a) can be waived under certain circumstances by failure to object on appeal. <em>See Suburban Hospital v. Kirson, </em>362 Md. 140, 156, 763 A.2d 185 (2000). In the first appeal concerning the Prince George\u2019s County judgment, neither party complained that the separate document rule had not been met. But, as the Court of Appeals made clear in <em>Kirson, </em>362 Md. at 156, 763 A.2d 185, and later in <em>Taha v. Southern Management Corp., </em>367 Md. 564, 569, 790 A.2d 11 (2002), for preservation purposes the waiver doctrine only applies \u201cwhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>final judgment was entered on the docket.\u201d <em>Taha, </em>367 Md. at 569, 790 A.2d 11. Here, a final judgment was not entered on the docket at any time prior to appeal of Judge Perry\u2019s March 1999 order because, as discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>all claims against all parties were not resolved by that order and the Prince George\u2019s docket entries accurately reflected what issues were resolved. Thus, appellants are correct when they argue that the March 1999 order was not final for failure to comply with Rule 2-601(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Later in their brief, appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">Plaintiffs are barred from litigating again in this case their claim to ownership of 49% of BIN\u2019s stock. Their failure to obtain a declaratory judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict no. 1 in the Prince George\u2019s County case, or to preserve the issue of their entitlement to such a judgment on appeal, rendered the special verdict moot. \u201c[A]ll issues, whether submitted to the jury or not are subsumed in the judgment <em>nisi </em>[the March 11, 1999[,] order] after the special verdict.\u201d <em>Food Fair Stores v. Lascola, </em>31 Md.App. 153, 166, 355 A.2d 757 (1976). The March 11,1999[,] order served to terminate the Prince George\u2019s County case and constitutes the final judgment in that case, even though it did not resolve plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory judgment. <em>See Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 671 A.2d 1 (1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We disagree with appellants\u2019 assertion that the jury\u2019s finding as to the identity and percentage ownership in BIN was somehow nullified (or rendered \u201cmoot\u201d) by Judge Perry\u2019s order. The Maryland Rules were revised effective July 1, 1984, and since that date, \u201cjudgments] <em>nisi </em>\u201d no longer exist. Thus, the language quoted in <em>Food Fair Stores v. Lascola, </em>31 Md.App. 153, 166, 355 A.2d 757 (1976), is not controlling. Moreover, no language in <em>Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 671 A.2d 1 (1996), is even remotely relevant to the issue here to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Aside from what we have already said in regard to Rule 2-601(a), the issue of finality of judgment is controlled by Maryland Rule 2-602, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Judgments not disposing of entire action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">(a) Generally. Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule, an order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action (whether raised by original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim), or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">(1) <em>is not a final judgment;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">(2) does not terminate the action as to any of the claims or any of the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">(3) is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">(b) When allowed. If the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">(1) as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">(2) pursuant to Rule 2-501 (e)(3), for some but less than all of the amount requested in a claim seeking money relief only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">As mentioned earlier, in their Prince George\u2019s County complaint, the plaintiffs asked in three separate counts (Count I, II, and III) for a declaratory judgment as to the names of BIN\u2019s stockholders and the percent of their interest in BIN. That request was made in the last complaint filed by plaintiffs prior to the jury verdict. Despite asking for a declaratory judgment, none was entered in the Prince George\u2019s County case prior to November 16, 2001 \u2014 the date the Montgomery court granted ancillary relief to enforce the Prince George\u2019s County order filed in March 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>What Judge Perry should have done, once the jury resolved the factual issue as to the identity of BIN\u2019s current stockholders and the percentage of their stock ownership in BIN, was to formally declare the respective ownership interest of David Forward, Mark Burnett, and Curtlan McNeily. As the Court said in <em>Maryland Ass\u2019n of HMO\u2019s v. Cost Review Comm\u2019n, </em>356 Md. 581, 603, 741 A.2d 483 (1999) (quoting <em>Harford Mutual v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-15, 687 A.2d 652 (1997)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\u201cThis Court has reiterated time after time that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, \u2018the trial court <em>must render a declaratory </em>judgment.\u2019 <em>Christ v. Department, </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34, 38 (1994). \u2018[W]here a party requests a declaratory judgment, it is error for the trial court to dispose of the case simply with oral rulings and a grant of ... judgment in favor of the prevailing party.\u2019 <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, 660 A.2d 447, 455 (1995), and cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cThe fact that the side which requested the declaratory judgment did not prevail in the circuit court does not render a written declaration of the parties\u2019 rights unnecessary. As this court stated many years ago, \u2018whether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, <em>there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made. </em>\u2019 <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959) . . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Here, there was never even an oral declaration by Judge Perry of the respective ownership rights of the parties in BIN. The request for declaratory judgment was simply ignored. Thus, there was no final judgment entered in the Prince George\u2019s County action. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The Montgomery County court had no authority to grant ancillary relief based on a non-final order entered in another county. Accordingly, the interlocutory judgment filed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Circuit Court for Montgomery County on November 16, 2001, shall be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The appellees made the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">The predicate of Forward\u2019s appeal derives from a technical argument that Judge Perry\u2019s March [16], 1999[,] Order was not properly entered as a final judgment in strict conformity with Maryland Rule 2-601(a). App. Br. at 8. Whatever the merits of Forward\u2019s argument, the issue has been rendered moot by Judge Lamasney\u2019s April 4, 2002[,] Order, <em>Nunc Pro Tunc, </em>[correcting] the docket entry of Judge Perry\u2019s March [16], 1999[,] Order, thereby bringing it into conformity in all respects with Maryland Rule 2-601 (a). A copy of Judge Lamasney\u2019s Final Judgment is attached as Exhibit 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The <em>\u201cNunc Pro Tunc </em>\u201d order referred to by appellees is not among the papers filed in the record sent to us by the Montgomery County clerk\u2019s office, and ordinarily documents not filed cannot be considered by us. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Angeletti, </em>71 Md.App. 210, 213 n. 2, 524 A.2d 798 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Appellees, recognizing that Judge Lamasney\u2019s order is not in the record, ask us to take judicial notice of it. In <em>Fletcher v. Flournoy, </em>198 Md. 53, 60, 81 A.2d 232 (1951) (quoting <em>Morse v. Lewis, </em>54 F.2d 1027, 1029 (4th Cir.1932)), the Court held that \u201ca court will not travel outside the record of the case before it in order to take judicial notice of the proceedings in another case even between the same parties, and in the same court, unless the proceedings are put into evidence .... \u201c An exception to this rule exists, however, when failing to judicially notice a fact would offend \u201cthe ends of justice.\u201d <em>James v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 666, 685, 358 A.2d 595 (1976). We shall assume, although the issue is not free from doubt, that we are empowered to judicially notice Judge Lamasney\u2019s <em>\u201cNunc Pro Tunc </em>\u201d orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Judge Lamasney entered two orders dated April 4, 2002. One order reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>1. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Entry of Final Judgment <em>Nunc Pro Tunc </em>is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">2. The Court will enter the Final Judgment herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">3. The Clerk shall enter the Final Judgment on the docket forthwith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The second order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">Upon consideration of the reasons set forth in the Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Entry of Final Judgment <em>Nunc Pro Tunc, </em>and for good cause shown, as set forth fully in the Amended Order Granting Partial Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, Denying Motion for New Trial, and Granting Defendants\u2019 Trial Motions, entered on March 16, 1999, the Court finds as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">1. All matters reserved for ruling at the end of the evidence in this trial are granted in favor of the defendants for the reasons raised by the defendants on the record during the trial and as set forth in the Court\u2019s Amended Order entered on March 16,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">2. All rulings on motions to dismiss raised by the defendants which were reserved during the trial are granted in favor of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">3. The jury found for the defendant in that he did not expend BIN resources for personal gain and that he did not unlawfully and intentionally and wrongfully destroy BIN business opportunities, causing BIN to lose revenues. The jury also found for the defendant, Mary Ann Forward. On the issues of damages for breach of contract, the jury awarded no damages to PCI/McNeily. Those verdicts are in accord with the evidence and instructions, and will not be disturbed. The jury found that Forward was a 51% shareholder of BIN, Burnett a 5% shareholder, and McNeily a 44% shareholder. Those verdicts were based upon evidence and in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions, and will not be set aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">4. The Motion for New Trial is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Whereupon, it is hereby,</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED THIS <em>4 </em>DAY OF <em>April, </em>2002, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">1. All matters reserved for ruling at the end of the evidence in this trial are granted in favor of the defendants for the reasons raised by the defendants on the record during the trial and as set forth in the Court\u2019s Amended Order entered on March 16, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">2. All rulings on motions to dismiss raised by the defendants which were reserved during the trial are granted in favor of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">3. Forward is hereby adjudged to be a 51% shareholder of BIN, Burnett a 5% shareholder, and McNeily a 44% shareholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">4. The Motion for New Trial is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">As can be seen, the second order <em>did </em>declare the rights of the parties and appears to otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 2-602. Neither of Judge Lamasney\u2019s orders, however, renders moot the issue of whether the November 16, 2001, ancillary judgment entered in Montgomery County should be reversed. First, an order of court should be given retrospective effect <em>(ie., </em>applied <em>Nunc Pro </em>Tunc) only if the order is entered to correct a clerical mistake in a prior order. <em>See 91st Street Joint Venture v. Goldstein, </em>114 Md. App. 561, 582, 691 A.2d 272 (1997). Judge Lamasney\u2019s order did more than merely correct clerical error(s). The order, <em>inter alia, </em>declared the rights of the parties \u2014 which Judge Perry had neglected to do. Thus, despite the <em>\u201cNunc Pro Tunc </em>\u201d language, the orders should be given only prospective effect and can have no bearing on the validity of the November 16, 2001, order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, even if it were appropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>give retroactive effect to Judge Lamasney\u2019s order, appellants have never filed that order in Montgomery County. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-623.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Montgomery County would have had no power to enforce either of Judge Lamasney\u2019s <em>\u201cnunc pro tunc </em>\u201d orders until such time as they were filed in accordance with Rule 2-623.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Appellees also argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Forward attempts to make much of the failure of the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court <em>to rule on a motion for declaratory judgment </em><footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> filed by the plaintiffs at the conclusion of the trial. App. Br. at 10. <em>To the extent that the motion sought reaffirmation of the special jury verdict, </em>it was already moot at the time of filing since the rights of the parties had already been determined and adjudicated. <em>See, e.g., Popham v. State Farm, </em>333 Md. 136, 140-41 n. 2, 634 A.2d 28 (1993) (declaratory judgment ordinarily is not available when the issue has become moot); <em>Turnpike Farm v. Curran, </em>316 Md. 47, 49, 557 A.2d 225 (1989) (declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>judgment is not available and should be dismissed, where there is a pending action between the parties presenting the same issue).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The <em>Popham </em>and the <em>Curran </em>cases cited by appellees are inapposite. Both cases deal with the propriety of granting a motion to dismiss a request for declaratory relief. Here, no motion to dismiss was filed. In any event, at the time Judge Perry\u2019s March 1999 order was filed, the request in the complaint for declaratory relief was not moot. The jury, by its answers to questions on the special verdict sheet, simply resolved the factual issue presented by the prayer for declaratory judgment. It remained for the court to declare, in writing, the rights of the parties based upon the jury\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY DATED NOVEMBER 16, 2001, REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">.

Appellants ask a second question as well, but as to that question we are without jurisdiction to decide it. That second question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">Did the circuit court err in denying appellants' motion for summary judgment, where the complaint is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and the statute of limitations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">The denial of a summary judgment motion is not a final judgment as defined by Maryland Rule 2-602. <em>See Porter Hayden Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>339 Md. 150, 164, 661 A.2d 691 (1995), and cases therein cited. Moreover, no statute allows an interlocutory order of this type to be appealed immediately. <em>See, e.g., Taha v. Southern Mgmt. Corp., </em>367 Md. 564, 790 A.2d 11 (2002). And, a non-appealable order may not be combined with an appealable interlocutory order so as to confer jurisdiction upon this Court. <em>Williams v.

We agree. As we stated in <em>Prince George's Co. v.

As we further stated in that case, it is properly used only to correct clerical errors.
