Following complaints by three DLLR employees, appellant was fired because of \u201cunjustifiably offensive conduct toward fellow employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Employer discharged appellant, with prejudice, about one hour after advising him of the allegations of misconduct. Based on procedures applicable to an at-will, \u201cmanagement service\u201d employee in the Executive Branch of State government, appellant was not afforded a hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). Thereafter, Eugene Conti, Jr., the Secretary of DLLR, denied Danaher\u2019s appeal, on the ground that Danaher failed to identify an illegal or unconstitutional ground with respect to the termination, as required by 17.04.05.01 of the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Appellant subsequently sought review of DLLR\u2019s action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. By order dated November 13, 2000, the circuit court affirmed. From that order, appellant noted this appeal, and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">I. Did the Department fail to reclassify appellant as either a skilled or professional service employee after restructuring his job position, thus denying him appropriate administrative review of his termination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">II. Did DLLR violate appellant\u2019s rights by ignoring the legal strictures of Title Eleven of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, requiring the appointing author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ity to investigate, consider mitigation, and meet with the employee within thirty days prior to termination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">III. Did DLLR arbitrarily and capriciously classify this termination as one \u201cwith prejudice\u201d, which is reserved for only those proven actions that are so egregious as to not merit employment in any capacity with the State?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">FACTUAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">As noted, Danaher was an employee of the State for twenty-five years. At one time, he served as the Director of Finance of DLLR, a position within the management service of the State Personnel Management System. According to appellant, his duties changed considerably on January 6, 1998, when he was reassigned to the Accounting Unit as a Fiscal Administrator V.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of that reassignment, Danaher claims he no longer had direct responsibility for the oversight and management of personnel or financial resources. Nevertheless, it is clear that, at the time of his discharge, appellant was a management service employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The Record Extract shows that Danaher and others attended \u201cSexual Harassment Training\u201d on March 19, 1996, for a total of three hours. Moreover, DLLR has a written, one-page \u201cSexual Harassment Policy,\u201d which became effective on July 1, 1997. It states that the Department is \u201ccommitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>creating a workplace void of all unlawful discrimination and ... free from harassment or intimidation based upon sex.\u201d The policy lists examples of unacceptable conduct, including suggestive remarks, gestures, or jokes of a sexual nature, and intentional physical behavior. Further, the policy provides that \u201c[sjwift and appropriate disciplinary actions up to and including termination will be taken against any DLLR employee found to have sexually harassed any other DLLR employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">By memorandum of May 15, 1998, Denise Carroll, an employee in DLLR\u2019s Employee Relations Unit, wrote to Donald Crumble, DLLR\u2019s Director of the Office of Personnel and Training, regarding a \u201cLewd Statement by Rick Danaher.\u201d According to Ms. Carroll\u2019s memorandum, Sheena Thomas and Andrea, whose last name was not known to Ms. Carroll, were \u201cwithin the hearing distance ...\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when appellant made his offensive remarks on May 15, 1998. Ms. Carroll stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">On the afternoon of Friday, May 15, 1998, .... I went to the fourth floor snack room to make a purchase.... Richard Danaher, started a conversation with me and made a <em>colorful </em>statement. The conversation started out discussing voting preferences and continued like this:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">As I was paying for my purchase at the coffee mug next to Andrea\u2019s cubicle, Mr. Danaher asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">I said to him, \u201cRick, I was in your office for a meeting not too long ago, you don\u2019t remember who I am? If you don\u2019t remember my name, you should remember my face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">Rick said to me, \u201cI am not good with faces; I\u2019m better with <em>butts.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">I put up my hand up as if to say <em>stop </em>and said, \u201cHold it right there. Don\u2019t even go there.\u201d I then told Rick my name and that I worked in Personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">Rick asked me, \u201cWhere do you work in Personnel?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">I said to him, \u201cI work with Sharon Ball.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Rick put his hand to his head and said, \u201cOh no! I stay in trouble. Another one of those social service people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">(Italics and underline in original). Ms. Carroll added that the conversation occurred within \u201chearing distance\u201d of Sheena Thomas and an individual named Andrea, whose last name she did not know. But, Ms. Carroll was not \u201csure\u201d if they heard what had been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In addition, Meriel Newsome, another DLLR employee, sent an undated memo to Sharon Ball, the \u201cDeputy Director/Employer Relations Manager,\u201d regarding \u201cInappropriate Statements Made by Rick Danaher\u201d on May 15, 1998. She indicated that an employee named Sheena was also present. Ms. Newsome stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">On Friday, May 15, 1998, ... Sheena [Thomas] ... introduced me to Mr. Rick Danaher....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">... I mentioned [in my conversation with Danaher] that in Canada the sales tax is really high ... however the health care system is totally free. He made the statement \u201cYou must be a democrat, you have to be because you are black[.]\u201d... I then stated that I always had very good health care because my parents have good jobs and that I felt that everyone is entitled to good healthcare [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Then Rick made a joke about my having Polish ancestry which I didn\u2019t understand. He explained to me that there was a stereotype about Polish people being hypochondriacs. Rick asked me if I had ever seen a certain television show and I told him \u201cNo.\u201d He said to me \u201cYou need to stop watching so much B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television).\u201d I told him that I don\u2019t watch very much television at all....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Sheena then mentioned, to Rick, that I was elected \u201cMiss Coppin\u201d and showed Rick the Ebony Magazine so that he could see my picture. He stated that \u201cI can\u2019t tell which one you are because you all look alike.\u201d Rick then asked me if I had any naked pictures of myself and I told him no. He then made a joke, saying \u201cDo you want to buy some?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8k\">Rick also, in my presence, told Sheena that she needs to get married because she is ruining her life since she had two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>children and wasn\u2019t married. She told Rick that she her [sic] life was not ruined. Rick said \u201cNot necessarily because you are not young but the Bible says that people should marry if they are going to have children.\u201d Rick then said most of those girls having babies are very young. I felt that this comment was racially motivated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">I got the feeling that Rick wanted me to respond in some way because he made all of these inappropriate statements twice to make sure that I heard him clearly. I didn\u2019t take any of these statements personally because I don\u2019t know Rick very well. However, I don\u2019t feel the comments he made were in good taste. I felt that his racially stereotypical comments could make someone very angry. I also felt that the question he asked me about ... owning naked pictures was belittling and sexist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In an undated memorandum, Melissa Ellen, Personnel Clerk, reported to Crumble that she witnessed appellant engage in inappropriate touching of Trudy Meads, Danaher\u2019s Administrative Assistant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time, Ms. Meads was pregnant. Ms. Ellen wrote, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">They [i.e., Trudy Meads and appellant] were about to leave [my cubicle] when Mr. Danaher got behind Trudy (who is about 6 months pregnant) and put his hand underneath her blouse, and I really did not pay any attention to this action until I heard this popping noise which I realized was the elastic of her pants. This was in the middle of the aisle in my office because I have an open cubicle and there was also another person in the office at the time. This was a very open scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">On May 18, 1998, Crumble sent a memorandum to Thomas Crowley, Chief Financial Officer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Crumble said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In less than one month, Mr. Danaher has managed to offend another female member of my staff. Ms. Denise Carroll of my Employee Relations Unit was wantonly offended when Mr. Danaher made a verbal statement to her indicating that he \u201cwas not good at remembering faces, but good at remembering BUTTS!\u201d Mr. Danaher also makes reference that my Deputy Director is a \u201cSocial Worker\u201d and that shows a lack of respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">I feel that we can no longer tolerate this kind of attitude from a senior staff member who evidently has no regard for the feelings of female employees in this Department. I recommend that Mr. Danaher be terminated immediately under the circumstances of the attached memorandum from Ms. Denise Carroll dated May 15, 1998 and the written testimony from Ms. Lisa Allen [sic] dated April 28, 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">At about 3:00 p.m. on May 19, 1998, Danaher was orally advised about the allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior that had been lodged against him. By 4:00 p.m. on that date, in a letter from the Secretary of DLLR, appellant was terminated, with prejudice, effective June 3, 1998. Citing \u00a7 11 \u2014 104(7)(ii) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cS.P.P.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), the Secretary stated that the discharge was \u201cdue to [appellant\u2019s] unjustifiably offensive conduct toward fellow employees.\u201d Appellant was also advised of his right to appeal under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-113. In addition, appellant was provided with an \u201cUnsatisfactory Report of Service,\u201d notifying him that his termination was \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">On May 20, 1998, Danaher appealed the termination to the Secretary of DLLR. He also completed a \u201cState Personnel Management System Appeal and Grievance Form\u201d in regard to his appeal, in which he asserted that his termination was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u201carbitrary, capricious, and has no factual basis.\u201d Appellant added: \u201cAdditional issues of fact and law may and will be developed during the course of discovery and hearing on employee\u2019s appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">By letter of June 10, 1998, the Secretary upheld the termination. The Secretary stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">I have received and reviewed the appeal of your recent termination. Please be advised that your appeal was considered pursuant to State Personnel and Pensions Article, Sections 11-113 and 11-305, which states, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cAn appeal ... may only be based on the grounds that the disciplinary action is illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">The appeal submitted on your behalf did not specify a legal nor constitutional basis on which it could have been considered, as required by COMAR 17.04.05.01[F]. Based upon my review of this matter, I have decided to uphold the disciplinary termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">Pursuant to Title 11 \u2014 113(b)(3), this decision is the <em>final </em>administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The Record Elxtract contains a transcript of a recorded statement provided by Trudy Meads on June 10, 1998, which is the same date on which the Secretary upheld appellant\u2019s termination. Ms. Meads, who was appellant\u2019s assistant, stated that she had known appellant since March 1989. She characterized their relationship as \u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201cenjoyable.\u201d Moreover, Ms. Meads insisted that appellant had never made any offensive racial or sexual remarks to her, nor had anyone ever complained to her about such conduct. Significantly, she characterized as \u201cfalse\u201d the allegations in which Danaher was accused of putting his hand under her clothes. When asked whether there was any truth to the allegations, Ms. Meads responded: \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d Nor was she aware of any such conduct involving Danaher and someone else. Rather, Ms. Meads attributed the incident to \u201cplayful banter\u201d that is accepted in the workplace, and which continued after Danaher had been fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Ms. Meads also recounted that she had filed a grievance to dispute the allegations that Danaher touched her. Although she had approached Crumble about the matter, she recalled that Crumble declined to discuss it, saying it was \u201cconfidential.\u201d Ms. Meads added that Danaher is \u201cone in a million,\u201d and completely \u201cfair, no matter who you are.... \u201d Moreover, she maintained that she had never known him to discriminate based on race or gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">On July 9, 1998, appellant sought review of the agency\u2019s decision in the circuit court. In September 1998, appellant filed a \u201cMOTION TO ORDER THE [DLLR] TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AND TO STAY THE TIME FOR FILING A RULE 7-207 MEMORANDUM OF LAW.\u201d That motion was denied on January 21,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">While the matter was pending in circuit court, Crumble submitted an affidavit of April 5, 2000, amplifying, for the first time, some of the facts and circumstances that culminated in the termination of appellant. He averred, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">2. Richard Danaher remained in the same position, at the same rate of pay, and classification of Fiscal Administrator .V from January 1997 until his termination in June of 1998. Mr. Danaher was assigned to the management service within the State Personnel' Management System pursuant to personnel reform legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">3. I conducted the Department\u2019s investigation of the incidents giving rise to Mr. Danaher\u2019s termination. Ms. Melissa Ellen reported first to my deputy, and then to me, informed [sic] that she witnessed Mr. Danaher placing his hands under the shirt of Mr. Danaher\u2019s assistant, Ms. Meads, to pull the elastic of her pants. Ms. Ellen was upset when she reported these events. I asked Ms. Ellen to place her statement in writing. <em>I did not feel it was necessary to speak with Ms. Meads, the employee who v&gt;as involved in the touching incident, because I was aware of the close working relationship between Ms. Meads and Mr. Danaher, and was concerned about Ms. Mead\u2019s [sic] veracity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>4. Only two weeks later, another DLLR employee, Ms. Denise Carroll reported first to my deputy, and then to me, that she had a conversation with Mr. Danaher in which Mr. Danaher commented that he did not recognize Ms. Carroll's face but was \u201cbetter with butts.\u201d Ms. Carroll was upset when she reported these events to my deputy. I asked Ms. Carroll to put her statement in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">5. <em>I found both Ms. Carroll\u2019s and Ms. Ellen\u2019s statements to be credible. I took into consideration the fact that these employees were willing to put their statements in writing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">6. After considering the Ellen and Carroll incidents, I wrote to Mr. Danaher\u2019s supervisor Thomas Crowley, Director of Budget and Fiscal, suggesting that disciplinary action be taken against Mr. Danaher based upon his workplace conduct. While the Department was evaluating the situation, the third statement by Ms. Meriel Newsome was brought to the Department\u2019s attention. On the very same day that Mr. Danaher made inappropriate comments to Ms. Carroll, he also made both sexually and racially inappropriate comments to Ms. Newsome, a DLLR intern, concerning her race and naked pictures. I felt that there was a pattern of conduct which made the statements even more credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">7. Pursuant to a delegation from the Secretary of the Department, Mr. Thomas Crowley, Mr. Danaher\u2019s supervisor, and I met with Mr. Danaher. We informed him of the allegations, and provided him with the opportunity to respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">8. After meeting with Mr. Danaher, we reported to the Secretary the events from the meeting. <em>Taking into consideration </em>the credibility of the employees making the allegations against Mr. Danaher, the pattern of conduct reflected in the three statements, Mr. Danaher\u2019s response, the existence of <em>any mitigating circumstances, </em>and the law on discrimination and harassment, the Secretary made the final decision to terminate Mr. Danaher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">On October 19, 2000, the circuit court held a hearing on the matter. In her oral ruling, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>This case comes before the Court today as an appeal from a decision of the Secretary of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation to terminate the State service of the petitioner, John R. Danaher. There are a number of issues which Mr. Danaher raises in the appeal. [He] has the burden of proof here, and he must prove that the Secretary\u2019s determination and decision was either illegal or based on an, an [sic] unconstitutional ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">It is apparent to me that when Mr. Danaher had his job duties moved from one place to another that he continued to be an at-will employee of the State of Maryland. He did not seek reclassification during the time he was employed with the State and it\u2019s too late to complain about it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">... Section 11-106 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article provides that prior to taking disciplinary action for employee misconduct \u2014 the Agency will investigate the alleged misconduct, which it did, meet with the employee, which is, it apparently did, based upon an affidavit, I think it\u2019s from Sharon Ball, consider mitigating circumstances, determine the appropriate disciplinary action and give written notice of the action below of Frederick A. Blow. I am persuaded that the Agency did all that it had to do under 11-106. This was not an automatic termination. It, <em>the conduct that was set out against Mr. Danaher did not fall specifically within one of the automatic termination criteria; </em>it was done in conformity with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">The other matter is the termination with prejudice. And I can certainly understand why Mr. Danaher is extremely upset and angry that he would be determined, to be let go with prejudice after 25 years of credible service to the State of Maryland, but the Secretary has discretion to terminate an employee with prejudice and it is not up to the Court to, to substitute its judgment for that, the Secretary in making that determination. The appeal petition is denied and I will sign an order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">By Order dated November 13, 2000, the circuit court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review, finding that the \u201cDepartment\u2019s decision to deny [appellant\u2019s] appeal of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>termination for lack of illegal or unconstitutional grounds is supported by the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Our analysis begins with a review of the statutory scheme involved in this case. Following a study undertaken by a Task Force appointed by the Governor, the so called State Merit System was revised by the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996 (the \u201cAct\u201d). <em>See Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and </em>Corr. <em>Servs. v. Beard, </em>142 Md.App. 283, 298, 790 A.2d 57, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002); <em>Western Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. 562, 567-68, 747 A.2d 697 (2000), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2002); <em>see also State Election Bd. v. Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 548 A.2d 819 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1644, 104 L.Ed.2d 159 (1989). The General Assembly created the State Personnel Management System (\u201cSPMS\u201d) to govern the employment of persons in the Executive branch of State government. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 6-202 <em>et seq. </em>SPMS falls \u201cunder the authority of the Secretary of Budget and Management.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 6-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Pursuant to S.P.P. \u00a7 6-102, the \u201cbasic purpose\u201d of the SPMS \u201cis to provide a system of employment for employees under the authority of the Secretary.\u201d To that end, the SPMS \u201cestablishes categories of service for employees based on the general nature of the employee\u2019s duties or method of appointment.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 6 \u2014 102(l)(i). In particular, it \u201cgroups employees into classes based on specific duties ...,\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 6-102(2)(i), and \u201cprovides for a system of merit employment in the skilled service and professional service,\u201d based on a \u201cstandard\u201d of \u201cbusiness efficiency.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 6-102(3). Further, SPMS \u201cprovides procedures for the appointment, discipline, and termination of employees in each service.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 6-102(l)(ii). Additionally, it provides \u201ca process for the ... prompt removal of employees.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 6 \u2014 102(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Specifically, within SPMS, there are six employment categories: skilled service; professional service; management service; executive service; special appointees; and temporary employees. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7\u00a7 6-401 to 6-406. Under S.P.P. \u00a7 6-401(a), \u201call positions in the Executive Branch of State government that are included in the State Personnel Management System are in the skilled service,\u201d unless otherwise provided.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Collectively, the various provisions of the Act combine to refute the perception that a person employed by the State is virtually guaranteed continued employment, without regard to the quality of performance. Instead, the legislative scheme provides for a system in which a skilled employee\u2019s continued employment depends upon satisfactory job performance. That view is reflected in S.P.P. \u00a7 2-301(a), which states: \u201cIn keeping with State efforts to reinvent government, restructuring of the State\u2019s personnel system should enhance the delivery of services to citizens in an effective and timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As we noted, appellant was in the management service, not the skilled service. S.P.P. \u00a7 6-403(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">Except as otherwise provided by law, a position ... is in the management service if the position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">(1) primarily involves direct responsibility for the oversight and management of personnel and financial resources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">(2) requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">(3) is not in the executive service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">S.P.P. \u00a7 6-402(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">Except as otherwise provided by law, a position in the Executive Branch of State government is in the professional service if the position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(1) requires knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a course of specialized intellectual instruction and study; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">(2) normally requires a professional license, advanced degree, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Subtitle 5 of Title 7 of S.P.P. concerns employee performance appraisals. Pursuant to S.P.P. \u00a7\u00a7 7-501 to 7-504, the Act provides that skilled, professional, and management service employees are evaluated in accordance with the subtitle. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 7-502(a). These employees are assessed, in writing, in six month intervals, based on the employee\u2019s entry-on-duty date. The employee receives both a mid-year and end-of-year appraisal, with an overall performance rating of either \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201cexceeds standards,\u201d \u201cmeets standards,\u201d \u201cneeds improvement,\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 7-502(a)(b). Although S.P.P. \u00a7 7-503 sets forth a careful process of appraisal, it does not outline the consequences, if any, of a poor evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Title 11 is called \u201cDisciplinary Actions, Layoffs, and Employment Terminations in State Personnel Management System.\u201d Subtitle 1 concerns \u201cDisciplinary Actions,\u201d and is expressly applicable to <em>all </em>employees in the State Personnel Management System of the Executive Branch, with the exception of temporary workers. S.P.P. \u00a7 11-102. Under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-103(a), the appointing authority \u201chas the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in any proceeding under this subtitle,\u201d including appeals. As we noted, S.P.P. \u00a7 11-104(7)(ii) allows for the termination of an employee, \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d if the employee\u2019s actions are found \u201cegregious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Pursuant to S.P.P. \u00a7 11-111, the Secretary, \u201cby regulation,\u201d must establish policies and procedures with regard to \u201cdisciplinary actions related to employee performance,\u201d including: (1) counseling of an employee with performance deficiencies; (2) an opportunity for the employee to improve the deficiencies; (3) imposition of disciplinary actions, if warranted; and (4) notice to the employee of disciplinary action and appeal rights. Apart from layoffs, employees in the skilled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>professional services, previously known as classified employees, may be removed from State service only for \u201ccause.\u201d <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 11-109; COMAR 17.04.05.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Under S.P.P. \u00a7\u00a7 11-109 and 11-110, skilled and professional service employees are entitled to an administrative hearing with respect to disciplinary actions. In contrast, employees in the management service, who are sometimes referred to as \u201cat will\u201d employees, <em>see </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 11-305, do not have a statutory right to a full administrative hearing regarding disciplinary action. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 11-113; COMAR 17.04.05.05C. Rather, an appeal of an at-will employee\u2019s termination \u201cmay only be based on the grounds that the disciplinary action is illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d S.P.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 113(b)(2)(ii) (1997); COMAR 17.04.05.05C. A management service employee\u2019s appeal is heard by the head of the principal unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105 specifies the conduct that constitutes cause for \u201cautomatic termination of employment.\u201d Section \u00a7 11-106, which we discuss, <em>infra, </em>concerns the procedure that must be followed before any disciplinary action is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Because appellant was in the management service, he was an at-will employee. Therefore, subject to certain statutory protections regarding disciplinary actions, applicable to almost all employees in the SPMS, appellant could be terminated, without cause, so long as the action was not illegal or unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Subtitle 3 of Title 11 is called \u201cEmployment Separations and Terminations.\u201d None of the six sections in Subtitle 3 provides that Subtitle 1 is inapplicable to an employee' in the management service. Moreover, S.P.P. \u00a7 11-301 states that Subtitle 3 applies to all nontemporary employees in SPMS. S.P.P. \u00a7 11-305 is relevant. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">11-305. Termination of other employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">(a) <em>Applicability of section. </em>\u2014 This section only applies to an employee who is in a position:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">(1) under a special appointment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">(2) in the management service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(3) in the executive service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">(b) <em>Employee at will. </em>\u2014 Each employee subject to this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">(1) serves at the pleasure of the employee\u2019s appointing authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">(2) may be terminated from employment for any reason, solely in the discretion of the appointing authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As appellant was in the management service, his appeal was governed by S.P.P. \u00a7 11-113. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">11-113. Appeal to head of principal unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">(a) <em>Applicability of section. </em>\u2014 This section only applies to an employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">(1) in the management service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">(2) in the executive service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">(b) <em>Procedure. </em>\u2014 (1) An employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file a written appeal of a disciplinary action with the head of the principal unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">(2) An appeal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">(i) must be filed within 15 days after the employee receives notice of the disciplinary action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">(ii) may only be based on the grounds that the disciplinary action is illegal or unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-16\">(3) The employee has the burden of proof in an appeal under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-17\">(c) <em>Conference. </em>\u2014 The head of the principal unit may confer with the employee before making a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-18\">(d) <em>Disposition. </em>\u2014 (1) The head of the principal unit may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-19\">(i) uphold the disciplinary action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-20\">(ii) rescind or modify the disciplinary action and restore to the employee any lost time, compensation, status, benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(2) Within 15 days after receiving an appeal, the head of the principal unit shall issue the employee a written decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">(3) The decision of the head of the principal unit is the final administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">As a threshold matter, we shall address the Employer\u2019s claim that this \u201cappeal must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d Specifically, the Department asserts that appellant did not present at the administrative level any of the arguments he advanced to the circuit court or to this Court. DLLR cites <em>Maryland State Retirement &amp; Pension Sys. v. Martin, </em>75 Md.App. 240, 248, 540 A.2d 1188 (1988), and <em>Chertkof v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>43 Md.App. 10, 16, 402 A.2d 1315 (1979), to support its position that Danaher cannot present an \u201centirely new theory\u201d that \u201cwas not exposed\u201d at the agency level. DLLR\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">First, both cases involved administrative hearings, in which the parties would have had an opportunity to present or challenge the evidence and articulate legal theories. No hearing ever occurred here. Second, in both cases the appellants raised new theories before this Court. In contrast, appellant\u2019s contentions were fully raised with the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Moreover, it appears to us that the Department has confused principles of waiver with those of exhaustion of administrative remedies. It is a \u2022 longstanding principle of administrative law that one must ordinarily exhaust statutorily prescribed administrative remedies before resorting to the courts. <em>See Moose v. Fraternal Order of Police, </em>369 Md. 476, 486, 800 A.2d 790 (2002); <em>Montgomery County v. Broadcast Equities, Inc., </em>360 Md. 438, 452, 758 A.2d 995 (2000); <em>Young v. Anne Arundel County, </em>146 Md.App. 526, 566, 807 A.2d 651 (2002); <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey, </em>110 Md.App. 493, 526, 678 A.2d 55 (1996). Therefore, a litigant must first pursue the applicable administrative pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>cess; other remedies cannot be pursued prematurely. <em>Schneider v. Pullen, </em>198 Md. 64, 68, 81 A.2d 226 (1951); <em>Landover Books, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>81 Md.App. 54, 62, 566 A.2d 792 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In this case, appellant clearly pursued his administrative remedies, limited though they were. He also exercised his right to seek judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s adverse decision. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(a)(1) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 195, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969), the Supreme Court noted that one purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to prevent the possibility \u201cthat frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes could weaken the effectiveness of an agency by encouraging people to ignore its procedures.\u201d We explained in <em>Boyd v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City, </em>57 Md.App. 603, 471 A.2d 749 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">The purposes of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies are threefold. It is designed to encourage the determination of particular issues by agencies with special expertise as to those issues; to avoid the judicial resolution of matters the legislature thought could be best performed by an agency; and to keep from the courts matters they might never be called upon to decide if the prescribed administrative remedy was followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 606, 471 A.2d 749 (quotations omitted). <em>See also McGee v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 479, 489-91, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971) (in criminal prosecution for draft evasion, exhaustion doctrine applied to prevent defendant from raising the defense that he was a conscientious objector, because he had not pursued that contention before the Selective Service Board); <em>Gingell v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>249 Md. 374, 376-77, 239 A.2d 903 (1968) (specifying the reasons for the exhaustion doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Judicial review of an administrative order is generally available only when that order is \u201cfinal,\u201d meaning that there must be nothing further for the agency to do. <em>See Holiday </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Spas v. Montgomery County Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>315 Md. 390, 395, 554 A.2d 1197 (1989); <em>Celanese Corp. of America v. Bartlett, </em>200 Md. 397, 409, 90 A.2d 208 (1952); <em>Crofton Partners v. Anne Arundel County, </em>99 Md.App. 233, 243, 636 A.2d 487, <em>cert. denied, </em>335 Md. 81, 642 A.2d 192 (1994). The \u201cexhaustion\u201d and \u201cfinality\u201d requirements both share the common goal of preventing potentially unnecessary and premature disruption of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Appellant was an employee in the management service. He pursued all .administrative avenues before turning to the courts for relief. First, through the Maryland Classified Employees Association, appellant sent a letter to the Secretary. The letter stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">The Maryland Classified Employees Association is requesting a Second Step Hearing on behalf of John R. Danaher, ... employed by DLLR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">We would appreciate your cooperation in scheduling a time, date and place for this hearing and notifying my office of same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Then, as we noted earlier, appellant submitted the State Personnel Management System Appeal and Grievance Form, seeking a hearing on appeal. Thus, there is no merit to appellee\u2019s claim that appellant failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">To the extent that appellee contends that appellant\u2019s complaints are not preserved because they were waived, due to the inadequacy of his assertions below, we reject that position as well. Appellant\u2019s challenge was, of necessity, very general. DLLR did not reveal what information had been furnished so as to enable appellant to particularize his allegations. Indeed, there is no indication that appellant knew who had complained, when he learned for the first time of such complaints, or even if he had been told of the nature of the complaints. Nor was appellant copied on Crumble\u2019s memo to Crowley on May 18, 1998, although five other persons were copied. Indeed, the only indication of notice to appellant as to the particular complaints appears in Crumble\u2019s affidavit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>April 5, 2000, submitted to the circuit court well <em>after </em>appellant\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Further, appellee overlooks that appellant was terminated about an hour after he was advised of the complaints, and never had an administrative hearing at which he could have particularized with specificity his contentions. Indeed, DLLR did not complain about appellant\u2019s failure to particularize his allegations until the circuit court proceeding was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">As appellant clearly followed every procedural step required in the administrative review process, he exhausted his administrative remedies. Therefore, appellee\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">As a result of a reorganization in late 1997 or early 1998, appellant was reassigned to the Accounting Unit, where he functioned as a Fiscal Administrator V. Appellant\u2019s new duties did not require him to provide oversight or management, nor did he exercise discretion or independent judgment in regard to his responsibilities. Therefore, although appellant acknowledges that, at the time of his termination, he was in the management service, he maintains that his change in job duties should have altered his service category from \u201cmanagement\u201d to the \u201cskilled\u201d service or \u201cprofessional\u201d service, consistent with S.P.P. \u00a7\u00a7 6-401 and 6-402. According to appellant, if DLLR had reclassified him as a skilled service employee after restructuring his job position, he would have been entitled to a full administrative hearing. As a result of his eironeous classification, appellant maintains that he was improperly deprived of the appropriate administrative review in regard to his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Danaher\u2019s claim is without merit. There is no dispute that, at the relevant time, Danaher was in the management service. Therefore, he was an at-will employee. Had appellant believed that the prior change in his duties and responsibilities warranted a change in his classification, his recourse was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>State\u2019s grievance procedure. Appellant cannot shift the blame to the Department because he failed to exercise his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The State Personnel and Pensions Article provides that an employee may grieve the assignment of duties and responsibilities if the assigned duties and responsibilities are applicable to a different class. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7\u00a7 7-102(e)(2), 12-102; <em>see also </em>COMAR 17.04.06.05 (\u201cIf a grievance is based on a position\u2019s reclassification ... \u201d); COMAR 17.04.02.01B (\u201cA grievance involving a position reclassification is governed by State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u00a7\u00a7 7-102(e), 12-101(b)(2), and 12-205.... \u201d). Under the State\u2019s grievance procedure, however, Danaher was required to file a grievance challenging his improper classification within twenty days of gaining knowledge of the events giving rise to the grievance. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 12-203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Clearly, Danaher failed to timely file a grievance relating to his classification. Moreover, appellant filed his appeal directly with the Secretary, rather than with OAH, because of his status as a management service employee. Yet, he never complained at that time about his alleged improper category of service. Therefore, this contention is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Appellant launches numerous procedural challenges to his termination from State employment. Primarily, he contends that DLLR violated his due process rights and his statutory \u201cfundamental employment rights\u201d by failing, <em>inter alia, </em>to adhere to the procedural requirements of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He maintains that the State was obligated to \u201censure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>that the appointing authority has all relevant information ... prior to making a decision to terminate or otherwise discipline an employee.\u201d In this regard, Danaher contends that the \u201cthin record\u201d demonstrates that DLLR\u2019s investigation was woefully deficient. According to appellant, the appointing authority also failed to satisfy its statutory obligation to meet with Danaher and consider mitigating circumstances. Instead, Danaher claims that the Employer relied on unsubstantiated, \u201cbald hearsay statements\u201d in reaching its decision to terminate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Appellant also complains that, substantively, the accusations did not warrant termination. He asserts that, at most, his conduct was in \u201cbad taste.\u201d As to his termination with prejudice, appellant asserts that the \u201cRecord does not reveal that the appointing authority, Secretary Conti, ever made a determination that Danaher\u2019s alleged actions were so egregious that he does not merit employment in any capacity with the State.\u201d In sum, appellant asserts that DLLR merely \u201cgathered three questionable memoranda which have no corroboration and made a knee-jerk decision to [terminate this long term and dedicated employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">With respect to appellant\u2019s due process claim, it is well settled that a court \u201c \u2018will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCarter v. State, </em>363 Md. 705, 712, 770 A.2d 195 (2001) (quoting <em>Baltimore Sun v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 659, 755 A.2d 1130 (2000) (other citations omitted)); <em>Williams v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 463, 473, 780 A.2d 1210, <em>cert. denied, </em>367 Md. 90, 785 A.2d 1293 (2001). Moreover, this principle governs \u201ceven if the [dispositive] non-constitutional ground was not raised by any party in the case.\u201d <em>McCarter, </em>363 Md. at 713, 770 A.2d 195; <em>see also Professional Staff Nurses Ass\u2019n. v. Dimensions Health Corp., </em>346 Md. 132, 138-39, 695 A.2d 158 (1997). Because we resolve this case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the basis of the applicable statute, we decline to address appellant\u2019s constitutional due process claim. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Appellant maintains that, even as an at-will employee in the management service, S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106 applies to him. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As we observed, Subtitle 1 of Title 11 concerns disciplinary matters. Under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-102, Subtitle 1 expressly applies to <em>all </em>employees in the SPMS, except temporary employees. Therefore, although appellant was an at-will employee, he was entitled to the protections afforded by S.P.P. with regard to termination based on alleged misconduct. In this regard, S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106 is relevant. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u00a7 11-106. Duty of appointing authority prior to imposing sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(a) <em>Procedure. </em>\u2014 Before taking any disciplinary action related to employee misconduct, an appointing authority shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">(1) investigate the alleged misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(2) meet with the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">(3) consider any mitigating circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">(4) determine the appropriate disciplinary action, if any, to be imposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">(5) give the employee a written notice of the disciplinary action to be taken and the employee\u2019s appeal rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">(Emphasis added). Under S.P.P. \u00a7 l-101(b), the \u201cappointing authority\u201d refers to \u201can individual or a unit of government that has the power to make appointments and terminate employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">Section ll-106(a) \u201cprescribes what must be done before imposing discipline----\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 143, 807 A.2d 32. As noted, S.P.P. \u00a7 ll-106(a) provides that, \u201cbefore\u201d any disciplinary action is taken, the appointing authority \u201cshall\u201d follow certain procedural steps. When the word \u201cshall\u201d appears in a statute, it generally has a mandatory meaning. <em>See In re Abiagail C., </em>138 Md.App. 570, 581, 772 A.2d 1277 (2001). As this Court recently observed, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>purpose of the requirement [in S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106] that an employee\u2019s misconduct be investigated by an appointing authority is to avoid the imposition of discipline based on unsubstantiated accusations.\u201d <em>Maryland Reception, Diagnostic &amp; Classification Ctr. v. Watson, </em>144 Md.App. 684, 693, 800 A.2d 16, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 Md. 71, 806 A.2d 681 (2002); <em>see Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 144, 807 A.2d 32 (\u201cIt is significant that one of the prerequisites for the imposition of discipline is the conduct of an investigation of the alleged misconduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">COMAR 17.04.04.04 is also relevant. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARP\">Separation Reports for Unsatisfactory Performance or Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">A. A unit shall report in writing to the Secretary when an employee is voluntarily or involuntarily separated from a position with an unsatisfactory employment record. The unit shall give the employee a copy of the report, either in person or by certified mail sent to the employee\u2019s last address of record. The Secretary shall determine the form of the report. The unit shall forward the report to the Secretary within 30 days of the employee\u2019s separation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">B. Separation for unsatisfactory performance or conduct is grounds for denial of future State employment for a period of up to 3 years. Termination with prejudice is a bar to employment in any capacity with the State for 3 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We turn to consider the scanty record in light of the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106. Among other things, under S.P.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(a)(1), the appointing authority was required to make an investigation of appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct. The record reveals that Crumble, the Director of the Office of Personnel and Training, wrote a memorandum on May 18, 1998, to the Chief Financial Officer, recommending Danaher\u2019s termination. But, Crumble\u2019s two paragraph memorandum does not detail any investigation of Danaher\u2019s alleged misconduct. To be sure, Crumble attached the memorandum of Ms. Carroll, along with written \u201ctestimony\u201d of Ms. Ellen. There is no indication in the record, however, of an attempt by the Employer to verify or corrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>rate the allegations of Ms. Ellen or Ms. Carroll. For example, Crumble did not suggest in his Memorandum that anyone at DLLR spoke with Ms. Ellen or Ms. Carroll regarding Danaher\u2019s conduct, or with persons mentioned in their memoranda who were either present or within earshot of appellant at the relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Similarly, the undated and unsigned memorandum from Ms. Newsome to Sharon Ball reveals that Sheena Thomas, a DLLR employee, was present during the conversation that prompted Ms. Newsome\u2019s memorandum. Although Ms. Thomas was clearly a witness to the exchange, the record does not reflect that anyone at DLLR interviewed Ms. Thomas about appellant\u2019s remarks, in an effort to determine, among other things, whether she perceived appellant\u2019s comments as \u201cracially motivated.\u201d Moreover, although Ms. Yeates may have been present, she was not questioned about what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Of particular significance, we have found no evidence in the record that anyone involved in the matter on behalf of the Employer ever spoke with Ms. Meads, the only individual who was the subject of alleged improper and offensive touching by appellant. For reasons that are not clear, Crumble did not consider it \u201cnecessary\u201d to speak with Ms. Meads. Moreover, without explanation, Crumble claimed that he was concerned about' Ms. Meads\u2019s \u201cveracity.\u201d Considering that Ms. Meads flatly repudiated the allegation of Danaher\u2019s misconduct, in a recorded statement that she provided in June 1998, it is difficult to overlook DLLR\u2019s failure to interview her. Crumble also determined that he did not need to speak with the three complainants; he regarded their statements as \u201ccredible,\u201d based on their willingness to put their statements in writing. Crumble never indicated, however, that Ms. Meads refused to submit a written statement. Indeed, there is no evidence that the Employer ever asked her to do so. Given Ms. Meads\u2019s willingness to file a grievance to dispute the accusations, it seems quite likely that she would have provided a written statement if one had been requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>We recognize that S.P.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(a)(1) does not detail how the Employer was to conduct the required investigation. When we construe the words of a statute, we may refer to the dictionary. <em>See Rouse-Fairwood Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>120 Md.App. 667, 689, 708 A.2d 19 (1998), <em>cert denied, </em>365 Md. 475, 781 A.2d 780 (2001). The word \u201cInvestigate\u201d is defined as: \u201cTo inquire into (a matter) systematically!.]\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary 830 (7th ed.1999). The word \u201cinvestigation,\u201d is defined as a \u201ccareful search; systematic inquiry.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 320 (Pocket Ed.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In our view, the Employer did not conduct a \u201ccareful search\u201d or a \u201csystematic inquiry.\u201d Instead, the Employer seems to have made a slip shod effort to determine what occurred on the dates in question, by accepting as true the contents of the written memoranda submitted by the three DLLR employees. At the very least, before terminating a twenty-five year veteran of State service, the Employer\u2019s investigation should have included efforts to interview those persons who were witnesses to appellant\u2019s allegedly offensive behavior. And, DLLR certainly should have questioned Ms. Meads, as she was the only person who was allegedly touched by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In performing an adjudicatory function, an administrative agency must adhere to basic principles of fairness. <em>See Coleman v. Anne Arundel Police Dep\u2019t, </em>369 Md. 108, 142, 797 A.2d 770 (2002); <em>Gigeous v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 509, 769 A.2d 912 (2001). In our view, when an investigation is statutorily mandated prior to the imposition of sanctions, it is unfair to discipline an employee without an adequate investigation of the alleged wrongdoing. Appellant was fired based on employee statements that the Employer deemed credible, without verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In addition, S.P.P. \u00a7 ll-106(a)(2) obligates the appointing authority to \u201cmeet\u201d with the employee. There is no evidence, however, that any meeting occurred at which appellant was provided with a meaningful opportunity to respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the accusations, or to present DLLR with information that might help DLLR assess the veracity of the allegations. In our view, a meeting between appellant and Crumble one hour before appellant was terminated does not satisfy the letter or spirit of S.P.P. \u00a7 ll-106(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Clearly, by the point in time when Crumble met with appellant, the Department had already determined to discharge appellant; it was not interested in ascertaining his version of events. If the agency had conducted a meaningful meeting with appellant, it would have done so in time to consider his explanation, if any, and to explore or verify his comments. As best we can determine, that never happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Further, under S.P.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(a)(3), DLLR was required to consider mitigating circumstances \u201cbefore taking any disciplinary action related to employee misconduct.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>144 Md.App. at 694, 800 A.2d 16. <em>See also </em>COMAR 17.04.05.04D(4). In <em>Watson, </em>the Court suggested that an employee\u2019s \u201cextensive career of meritorious State service\u201d may constitute mitigation. <em>Id. </em>at 695, 800 A.2d 16. Yet, the record does not reveal what, if any, mitigating circumstances were considered by the appointing authority. For example, there is no indication that the Secretary reviewed or considered Danaher\u2019s lengthy career with the State, the numerous awards and citations supposedly in his personnel file, or even his most recent evaluations. Nor are we aware that Danaher had an opportunity to bring his record to the Employer\u2019s attention at a meeting prior to his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">With respect to mitigating circumstances, <em>Maryland State Retirement Agency v. Delambo, </em>109 Md.App. 683, 675 A.2d 1018 (1996), provides guidance. Delambo, a State employee for over twenty years, used her computer to \u201caccess\u201d the subdirectory of the agency\u2019s Executive Director. <em>Id. </em>at 686-87, 675 A.2d 1018. One of the files she accessed contained a copy of the letter of appointment that had been issued to the new Executive Director, whose identity had not yet been publicly released. After appellee revealed the Executive Director\u2019s identity to two co-workers, the agency sought her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>removal from State service, and she was suspended without pay. Following a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, the charges were upheld; the agency concluded that \u201c \u2018a reasonable person in [appellee\u2019s] position would have known that her actions constituted misconduct, even in the absence of an Agency directive ... [so appellee\u2019s] exceedingly poor judgment, resulting in her misconduct reflects that she is unfit to hold a position in this agency.-\u2019 \u201d <em>Delambo, </em>109 Md. App. at 687, 675 A.2d 1018. The Secretary adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The circuit court upheld the Secretary, but modified the punishment by reducing it to a suspension without pay. This Court said, at 109 Md.App. at 688-90, 675 A.2d 1018:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">Appellant is entitled to impose a number of disciplinary sanctions, including (1) official reprimand, (2) demotion pursuant to \u00a7 4-604, (3) suspension without pay pursuant to \u00a7 9-402, and (4) removal pursuant to \u00a7 9-201 et. seq. <em>See also </em>COMAR 06.01.01.45. Demotion, suspension, and removal of classified employees may only occur for cause. The rationale behind each sanction is quite different. Demotion must be supported by a written recommendation that includes the specific reasons for the demotion. COMAR 06.01.01.41. Suspension may occur only for misconduct, negligence, inefficiency, insubordination, or other reason satisfactory to the Secretary of Personnel. COMAR 06.01.01.46. Cause for removal, however, requires at least one of the following serious elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">(1) incompetence or inefficiency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">(2) wanton carelessness or negligence in performing duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Thus, the conduct constituting cause for removal is both specific and extreme in character. Proceedings for demotion or suspension differ from proceedings in which the agency seeks termination. When the agency contends that the charges are serious enough to warrant removal, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the factual bases for those charges have been established, the ALJ must then recommend that the Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">(a) restore the employee, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">(b) suspend the employee without pay, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">(c) demote the employee, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">(d) remove the employee from the position and from the classified service, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">(e) take other appropriate action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">COMAR 06.01.01.61. A written decision must be submitted regardless of what sanction is imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Although the Court affirmed the- agency\u2019s classification of Delambo\u2019s actions as \u201cordinary misconduct,\u201d the Court could not affirm the sanction, because the agency failed to articulate adequately why appellee\u2019s removal from service was appropriate. <em>Delambo, </em>109 Md.App. at 690-691, 675 A.2d 1018. Writing for the Court, Chief Judge Murphy reasoned, at 109 Md.App. at 691, 675 A.2d 1018:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">There is no indication that either the ALJ or the Secretary (1) considered any of the other relevant factors that must be considered in determining the severity of appellee\u2019s punishment, or (2) considered imposing any alternative sanctions that might have been appropriate under the circum.stances....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">For all that appears in the record before us, appellee was fired because she could be fired. We cannot determine what \u2014 if any \u2014 consideration was given to appellee\u2019s (1) overall employment history in State service, (2) attendance record during that period of time, (3) disciplinary record at the present agency and at other State agencies as well, (4) work habits, and (5) relations with fellow employees and supervisors. All these factors should have been considered by the ALJ and the Secretary. Appropriate consideration should also have been given to making \u201cthe punishment fit the crime.\u201d In this regard, appellant was fired for violating a subsequently enacted regulation that now expressly prohibits the conduct at issue, and appellee\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>made possible by the absence of safeguards that would have easily prevented her from accessing the \u201csensitive\u201d information. Neither the ALJ nor the Secretary has given consideration to either of these facts in a way that permits judicial review. As neither this court nor the circuit court can substitute its judgment for that of the agency, a remand to the agency is necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">(Boldface in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The <em>Delambo </em>Court concluded that \u201cthe agency\u2019s \u2018bottom line\u2019 sanction [should] be accompanied by a statement that explains (1) precisely what (written or unwritten) law, procedure, rule or regulation has been violated by the employee; and (2) why the agency has decided against imposing any of the other sanctions that it has discretion to impose....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692, 675 A.2d 1018. As we see it, the same rationale applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Notwithstanding DLLR\u2019s discretion as to punishment, <em>Delambo, </em>109 Md.App. at 690, 675 A.2d 1018, there is nothing in the record here to demonstrate that the Secretary considered why Danaher\u2019s removal was an appropriate exercise of discretion. Nor is there any indication that DLLR satisfied the requirements of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106. As we mentioned, S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106 applies to all SPMS employees, except temporary employees. Therefore, this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Delambo </em>is applicable; DLLR was required to satisfy <em>all </em>the requirements of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106. Appellant did not have the benefit of the protections afforded him by law, however. In its role as an employer, the State has obligations under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106, to conduct itself in such a way so as to ensure that the appointing authority has all relevant information before making a decision to terminate or otherwise discipline an employee. Danaher, like all non-temporary employees in the State Personnel Management System, was entitled to these protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Appellants do not rely on the so called <em>Accardi </em>doctrine to support their position. Nevertheless, we believe that doctrine is relevant to the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The <em>Accardi </em>doctrine derives its name from the case of <em>Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 267-68, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954). It is a rule of federal administrative law, which generally provides that a federal administrative agency must follow its own rules and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 74 S.Ct. 499; <em>see United States v. Caceres, </em>440 U.S. 741, 751, n. 14, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 59 L.Ed.2d 733 (1979); <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 235, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) (\u201cWhere the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their own procedures.\u201d) As the Court of Appeals recently recognized in <em>Maryland Transp. Auth. v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 286, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002), \u201ca similar doctrine is reflected in Maryland administrative law.\u201d <em>See also Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 457, 800 A.2d 768 (2002) (\u201c \u2018Moreover, numerous opinions of this Court have involved the review of agency action to determine if the agency complied with its regulations and required procedures.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">This Court has recognized or applied the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine in numerous cases involving Maryland administrative law matters. <em>See, e.g., Anastasi v. Montgomery County, </em>123 Md.App. 472, 491, 719 A.2d 980 (19.98). In <em>Anastasi, </em>123 Md.App. at 491, 719 A.2d 980, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">Thus, to the extent that Administrative Procedures apply to a particular county agency or department, and to the extent that they have the force and effect of law, and are not simply interpretive rules, policy statements, or other, lesser, rules of agency organization, procedure or practice, that agency or department, under the well-known <em>Accardi </em>doctrine, must follow them; and if the agency or department fails to follow such Administrative Procedures when taking an action, then the agency\u2019s action is invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Recently, in <em>Smith v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 780 A.2d 1199 (2001), we reiterated that \u201c \u2018[a]n agency of the government must scrupulously observe rules, regulations or procedures which it has established. When it fails to do so, its action cannot stand and courts will strike it down.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 780 A.2d 1199 (quoting <em>Hopkins v. Maryland Inmate Grievance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Md.App. 329, 335-36, 391 A.2d 1213 (1978)). Until recently, however, the Court of Appeals had not expressly adopted the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine with respect to matters of Maryland administrative law, even though the Court had reviewed agency conduct to determine compliance with agency regulations. <em>See, e.g., Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 725 A.2d 1027 (1999). The decisions in <em>Jordan Towing, </em>369 Md. at 455-57, 800 A.2d 768, and <em>King, </em>369 Md. at 282, 284-86, 799 A.2d 1246, reveal that the Court of Appeals now recognizes the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">As a matter of legal doctrine, regulations promulgated by. an agency \u201ccannot be waived, suspended or disregarded in a particular case as long as such rules and regulations remain in force.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>140 Md.App. at 455, 780 A.2d 1199; <em>see Jordan Towing, </em>369 Md. at 455, 800 A.2d 768; <em>King, </em>369 Md. at 282, 799 A.2d 1246. Rather, \u201can administrative agency should follow its own established rules, regulations and procedures.\u201d <em>Jordan Towing, </em>369 Md. at 455, 800 A.2d 768; <em>see King, </em>369 Md. at 285, 799 A.2d 1246; <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10 \u2014 222(h)(iii), (iv) of the State Government Article. As the Court said in <em>King, </em>369 Md. at 286, 799 A.2d 1246:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">[TJhe judicial review section of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act provides that a reviewing court may \u2018reverse or modify the [administrative] decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision ...

DLLR had a duty to comply with the statute by conducting an investigation and considering mitigating circumstances.

For the guidance of the parties on remand, we shall briefly address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">A termination with prejudice would bar Danaher from employment with the State in any capacity for three years. COMAR 17.04.04.04.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-104, the Secretary has a range of possible disciplinary actions. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u00a7 11-104. Disciplinary actions permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">An appointing authority may take the following disciplinary actions against any employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(7) with prior approval of the head of the principal unit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(i) terminate the employee\u2019s employment, without prejudice; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(ii) if the appointing authority finds that the employee\u2019s actions are egregious to the extent that the employee does not merit employment in any capacity with the State, terminate the employee\u2019s employment with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Appellant argues that his alleged actions were not so egregious as to merit termination with prejudice, because they did not fall under those actions listed in S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105, mandating automatic termination. That provision states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u00a7 11-105. Automatic termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">The following actions are causes for automatic termination of employment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">(1) intentional conduct, without justification, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">(i) seriously injures another person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">(ii) causes substantial damage to property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">(iii) seriously threatens the safety of the workplace;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">(2) theft of State Property of a value greater than $300;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">(3) illegal sale, use, or possession of drugs on the job;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-16\">(4) conviction of a controlled dangerous substance offense by an employee in a designated sensitive classification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-17\">(5) conviction of a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-18\">(6) accepting for personal use any fee, gift, ... in connection with ... State employment if given to the employee by any person with the hope ... of receiving a favor....;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">Appellee counters that \u201c[t]he fact that the basis for M[r], Danaher\u2019s termination \u2014 \u2018unjustifiably offensive conduct in the workplace\u2019 \u2014 is not listed as one of the eight grounds for termination set forth in [S.P.P.] has no relevance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-20\">Under the statute, even if an employee commits an act that warrants automatic termination, the termination need not be with prejudice. Assuming that appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>otherwise lawfully, terminated, DLLR had the discretion to terminate him with prejudice, so long as the Secretary was satisfied that the misconduct was so egregious as to warrant a termination with prejudice. On the record before us, however, it is not clear that the Secretary ever made such a determination. Because such a termination is an extreme disciplinary measure, and is not mandatory even when there is cause for automatic termination under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105, the record should reflect that the Secretary fully considered the propriety of that sanction before terminating an employee with prejudice. The record here does not demonstrate that the extreme sanction was imposed after careful consideration of the relevant circumstances and factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO DLLR FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
