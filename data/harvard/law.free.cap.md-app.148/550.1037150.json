Neither Shehan nor Goddard individually has participated in this appeal. DRD poses two questions on appeal, which we have consolidated into one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>I. Did the circuit court err in holding that cohabitation of unmarried parents renders null and void support orders and any agreement reaffirming the unmarried father\u2019s duty to support premised upon a finding of paternity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">For the reasons below, we shall reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Goddard and Shehan lived together in Maryland and are the parents of Carly Shehan (the \u201cchild\u201d), the oldest of the couple\u2019s three children. The child was born on July 9, 1985. Because of continuing difficulties in their relationship, Goddard planned to move to Connecticut to reside with her sister. On January 28, 1986, Goddard filed a paternity petition against Shehan regarding the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Shortly thereafter, on March 4, 1986, Shehan signed an agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) admitting paternity. The Agreement provided that Shehan\u2019s child support would continue until the child \u201cbecomes 18 years of age, dies, marries, or becomes self-supporting, whichever event occurs first.\u201d It also noted that Shehan was \u201cunemployed and has agreed that this matter is to be reviewed in six weeks for a specific amount of support.\u201d Although Goddard and Shehan were then living together, Goddard informed DRD that they lived apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">On May 12, 1986, Goddard and Shehan signed a consent order, pursuant to which Shehan agreed to pay child support to DRD in the amount of $25.00 per week for the child and to inform the agency of his whereabouts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, he believed that \u201cthings were going to be over\u201d between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Approximately two weeks after the consent order was signed, Goddard moved to Connecticut. On June 21, 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Goddard gave birth to the couple\u2019s second child. Shortly thereafter, she informed Shehan about the birth. He then moved to Connecticut and lived with Goddard. Although the record is unclear, Shehan testified that, from 1986 through the \u201cnext 11 or 12 years,\u201d appellant moved back and forth between Maryland and Connecticut, where he resided with Goddard. During Shehan\u2019s periodic stays in Connecticut, which are not detailed in the record, Goddard became pregnant with the couple\u2019s third child, who was born on January 24, 1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shehan made no child support payments and did not inform DRD of his periodic stays in Connecticut. DRD filed a petition requesting that Shehan be found in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">According to Shehan, from 1986 until 1998, he provided \u201ca little more than\u201d $25.00 per week for child support and also contributed to the rent. Shehan testified that Goddard left Connecticut and moved to Tennessee in 1998. The accuracy of that testimony, however, was disputed at oral argument by DRD\u2019s statement that sometime during 1995, Goddard married and was living in Tennessee and that, in about 1994, Shehan married and was living in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">There is no evidence in the record that Goddard personally sought enforcement of the child support order. Because DRD had not received child support payments since the parties executed the Agreement, it notified Shehan in February 2000 that it would suspend his driver\u2019s license. In response, Shehan entered into an arrearages payment schedule requiring him to pay $25.00 per week for child support and $25.00 per week toward the arrearages. Shehan also made an initial payment of $100.00 to DRD.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">When Goddard received a copy of the notice to suspend Shehan\u2019s driver\u2019s license, she telephoned DRD on March 21, 2000; the substance of that conversation is not part of the record. Shehan did not pay the child support payments last agreed to and, on September 28, 2000, the circuit court again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ordered that Shehan pay $25.00 per week for child support and also pay $25.00 per week toward the arrearages. At that point, Shehan informed DRD that he and Goddard had lived together in Connecticut for twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Because Shehan did not make any further payments, DRD initiated contempt proceedings in October 2000, pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-1041 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). On October 12, 2000, the circuit court issued a show cause order requiring Shehan to explain why he should not be held in contempt for not paying his child support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 30, 2000, Shehan failed to appear for the contempt hearing and the court issued a bench warrant setting bond in the amount of $18,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The circuit court issued a second show cause order on December 15, 2000, requiring Shehan to appear before a special master on January 11, 2001. At that hearing, the contempt case was continued and set for review in April 2001. Goddard apparently was made aware of the proceeding by a letter sent by Shehan\u2019s counsel, which requested that she relinquish any claim to child support. Goddard did not consent to that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">On April 12, 2001, the contempt hearing was continued to May 2001. At that time, Shehan owed more than $19,000. Four days later, Shehan filed a motion to terminate the child support order and dismiss the arrearages. On May 7, 2001, a hearing was held before a special master. Goddard did not receive notification of that hearing and therefore did not attend. During that hearing, the master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">[T]hat raises an interesting question which I have some reservation or thoughts about. DRD does not represent [Goddard]. They enforce support orders. Is [Goddard] even a party to this particular proceeding, and to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>decision I make today, and recommend and sign off by a Judge? Does that bind her, as she is not here?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Despite a concern that Goddard was not present, the master made the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">The parties\u2019 second child was bom on 21 June 1986. Shortly thereafter [Shehan] moved to Connecticut to live with [Goddard] and the two children and they lived thereafter as a family. [Shehan] provided all of the support for [Goddard] and the children, and his financial support of [the child] exceeded $25 per week. In 1998 [Goddard] took all of the parties\u2019 belongings, left with the children and moved to Tennessee. [Shehan] then returned to Maryland. [Shehan] has not seen the children since the separation and only recently learned of their actual location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">There is no question but that the resumption of cohabitation by the parties for some 12 years was a <em>bona fide </em>reconciliation. Therefore, the 1986 support order was nullified upon the parties\u2019 reconciliation in Connecticut. And as acknowledged by DRD\u2019s counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as there was no valid support order in place, the Consent order of 15 September 2000 is void <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">4 It is, therefore, not necessary to address the issue of [Shehan\u2019s] right to a set off for the support he actually provided [the child] during the period of cohabitaion. <em>Coffman v. Hayes, </em>259 Md. 708, 270 A.2d 808 (1970); <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 650, 558 A.2d 798 (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The master recommended that Shehan not be held in contempt and that the court void the 1986 child support order and the subsequent order regarding Shehan\u2019s arrearages. DRD filed timely exceptions to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">On August 22, 2001, the circuit court held a hearing on the exceptions. Again, Goddard was not notified, was not present at the hearing, was not represented by counsel, and did not have an opportunity to contest Shehan\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>On September 12, 2001, the court ratified the master\u2019s recommendations, issuing an order not holding Shehan in contempt and ordering that the \u201cConsent order of Modification entered 12 May 1986 is void; and the Consent Order entered 28 September 2000 is void.\u201d This appeal was filed on October 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">Review by [an appellate court] involves interpreting whether the circuit court\u2019s order was legally correct. While child support orders are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, <em>see Beckman v. Boggs, </em>337 Md. 688, 703, 655 A.2d 901, 908 (1995) (discussing the circuit court\u2019s discretion in family matters, with specific reference to visitation orders); <em>Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. 133, 144, 716 A.2d 1029, 1035 (1998) (reviewing the lower court\u2019s determination of custody); <em>Early v. Early, </em>338 Md. 639, 654, 659 A.2d 1334, 1341 (1995) (reviewing the circuit court\u2019s child support order), not to be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion, where the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u201clegally correct\u201d under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>See In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 782 A.2d 332 (2001) (reviewing a trial court\u2019s visitation order <em>de novo </em>when the issue involved whether the order itself constituted an improper delegation of judicial authority).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\"><em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 391-92, 788 A.2d 609 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">DRD argues that the circuit court exceeded its statutory authority by ruling that the cohabitation of Shehan and Goddard voided the child support order. DRD acknowledged, however, during oral argument that it was not opposed to providing Shehan a set-off for the child support that he paid while he resided with Goddard in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Here, it would appear that Goddard was not informed of Shehan\u2019s motion to terminate the child support order, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>though she and the child were directly affected by the decision of the circuit court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She neither attended nor was represented by counsel at the hearings held by the master or the circuit court, and did not have the opportunity to testify before either the master or the circuit court. We believe that Goddard remains a party or has the right to participate as a party to any proceeding seeking to have an order of support declared void. Therefore, the circuit court violated FL \u00a7 5-1037, which provides: \u201cThe court may not enter an order under this subtitle against a party unless the party is given reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d In addition, but we need not decide, she may have been denied due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Therefore, we shall vacate the decision of the circuit court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. We provide the following for guidance on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">As expressed in FL \u00a7 5-1002:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The General Assembly finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">(1) this State has a duty to improve the deprived social and economic status of children born out of wedlock; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">(2) the policies and procedures in this subtitle are socially necessary and desirable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">(b) <em>Purpose. </em>\u2014 The purpose of this subtitle is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>(1) to promote the general welfare and best interests of children born out of wedlock by securing for them, as nearly as practicable, the same rights to support, care, and education as children bom in wedlock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">(2) to impose on the mothers and fathers of children born out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">(3) to simplify the procedures for determining paternity, custody, guardianship, and responsibility for the support of children born out of wedlock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">(c) <em>Establishment of paternity. </em>\u2014 Nothing in this subtitle may be construed to limit the right of a putative father to file a complaint to establish his paternity of a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u201c[PJarenthood is both a biological and a legal status, that by nature and law it confers rights and imposes duties, and that one of the duties it casts upon parents is the duty to support their children until the law determines that the children are capable of self-support.\u201d <em>Thrower v. State ex rel. Bureau of Support Enforcement, </em>358 Md. 146, 159, 747 A.2d 634 (2000) (citing <em>Carroll County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 577 A.2d 14 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">As Maryland courts have made clear, \u201c[i]t is manifest that the Legislature intended the Paternity Act to occupy and control the field of disputed paternity.\u201d <em>State v. Rawlings, </em>38 Md.App. 479, 482, 381 A.2d 708 (1978) (quoting <em>Quinan v. Schneider, </em>247 Md. 310, 313, 231 A.2d 37 (1967)). The Act\u2019s purpose is achieved by following the statutory scheme in paternity cases and the resulting child support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Upon a declaration of paternity, support is governed by FL \u00a7 5-1032, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If the court finds that the alleged father is the father, the court shall pass an order that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">(1) declares the alleged father to be the father of the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">(2) provides for the support of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>(b) <em>Terminating events. </em>\u2014 {1) The father shall pay the sum to be specified in the order until the first to occur of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">(i) the child becomes an adult;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">(ii) the child dies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">(iii) the child marries; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">(iv) the child becomes self-supporting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">(2) If the child is an adult but is destitute and cannot be self-supporting because of a physical or mental infirmity, the court may require the father to continue to pay support during the period of the infirmity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">(c) <em>Continuation of child support. </em>\u2014 Any money that is due for child support under this subtitle and is unpaid at the time the child becomes an adult, dies, marries, or becomes self-supporting is a continuing obligation of any party bound by the order of court until the money is paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">(d) <em>Garnishment of wages. </em>\u2014 The court shall pass an immediate and continuing withholding order on earnings of the father in accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 1, Part III of this article. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">In addition, FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 1033(a)(1) provides that, in \u201ca paternity proceeding, the court may order the father or the mother to pay all or part of ... the support of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">With limited exceptions, \u201ca declaration of paternity is final.\u201d FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(a)(1). The court, however, may modify or set aside certain provisions of a paternity order pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-1038, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">(a) <em>Declaration of paternity final; </em>modifications.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">\u2756 \u00ed[\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">(2) (i) A declaration of paternity may be modified or set aside:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">1. in the manner and to the extent that any order or decree of an equity court is subject to the revisory power of the court under any law, rule, or established principle of practice and procedure in equity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>2. if a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029 of this subtitle establishes the exclusion of the individual named as the father in the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a declaration of paternity may not be modified or set aside if the individual named in the. order acknowledged paternity knowing he was not the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">(b) <em>Other orders subject to modification. </em>\u2014 Except for a declaration of paternity, the court may modify or set aside any order or part of an order under this subtitle as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\"><em>See also Walter, </em>367 Md. at 394-95, 788 A.2d 609; <em>Jessica G. v. Hector M., </em>337 Md. 388, 401, 653 A.2d 922 (1995); <em>Adams v. Mallory, </em>308 Md. 453, 463, 520 A.2d 371 (1987). \u201cSection 5-1038(b) deals strictly with paternity orders, i.e. orders relating to or arising from paternity declarations, or more specifically, orders relating to <em>valid and enforceable </em>paternity declarations.\u201d <em>Walter, </em>367 Md. at 395, 788 A.2d 609 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The existing statutory scheme concerning paternity proceedings does not expressly provide a basis for termination of child support when the unmarried parents live together. The cases relied on by the circuit court, <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>294 Md. 605, 451 A.2d 1215 (1982), and <em>Torboli v. Torboli, </em>365 Md. 52, 775 A.2d 1207 (2001), are distinguishable from this case. The parties in those cases were married; Shehan and Goddard were not. In <em>Torboli, </em>the order for emergency family maintenance expressly forbade the parties\u2019 cohabitation; the paternity order in this case contained no such prohibition. In addition, FL \u00a7 5-1032(b) provides that child support may only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>terminated upon the child becoming an adult, the death or marriage of the child, or if the child becomes self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We have not been directed to, nor have we found, a Maryland paternity case that has considered the effect of cohabitation on a support order. Some guidance is provided in cases from other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In <em>Griffis v. Griffis, </em>202 W.Va. 203, 503 S.E.2d 516 (1998), two identical questions were certified to the court by the Circuit Court of Boone County in three separate cases. In one case, in which no paternity action was filed, but a subsequent divorce order found that Mr. Griffis was the child\u2019s father, the court concluded that the \u201cmarriage or remarriage of parents automatically terminates the preexisting child support order; however, mere cohabitation does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 503 S.E.2d 516. The court stated that the \u201csubstantial differences that exist between marriage and cohabitation unquestionably compel the conclusion that cohabitation, without marriage, is insufficient to automatically nullify the provisions of an existing court order related to child custody and support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 503 S.E.2d 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We have found other cases that have considered the issue of cohabitation and the presumption that is created when a parent, who owes child support, cohabitates with and becomes the co-custodial parent of his or her children. None of these cases, however, are paternity cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In <em>Patron v. Patron, </em>40 Va. Cir. 379 (1996), the circuit court concluded that parents who were involved in a divorce proceeding, but who had been living together, were both \u201ccustodians and there [was] no showing that the child\u2019s needs [were] not being met while living with her parents, all in the same household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380 Accordingly, the court denied the wife\u2019s request for child support. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In <em>Parker v. Parker, </em>86 Ohio App.3d 727, 621 N.E.2d 1229 (Ohio Ct.App.1998), the court considered the effect on child support of divorced parties that continued to live together. The court held that Mr. Parker was entitled to a \u201ccredit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>unpaid support\u201d during the period that he cohabitated with his former wife and their child. <em>Id. </em>at 730, 621 N.E.2d 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In <em>Dalton v. Dalton, </em>207 W.Va. 551, 560, 534 S.E.2d 747 (2000), the parties were married, had a child, and divorced. The Husband was ordered by the court to pay $225 per month in child support. The parties, however, continued to reside together for approximately eight years. In considering whether the husband met his child support obligation, the court found that cohabitation did not create a \u201cpresumption that the obligor has fulfilled his or her support obligations.\u201d Rather, the parties\u2019 cohabitation is but one factor in determining whether the obligor former spouse met his or her support obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 534 S.E.2d 747. The court also stated that the \u201cobligor bears the burden of proving that he or she has made court-ordered support payments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Here, the child remains a minor and the circumstance of cohabitation ended no later that 1998. Considering that the purpose of the applicable law is to secure support for children bom out of wedlock and to impose on the parents of such children the responsibilities of parenthood, it is difficult to understand, how declaring the outstanding orders of support void could be just and proper and in the child\u2019s best interest. Therefore, we conclude that a period of cohabitation by the father with the child\u2019s mother and child does not void support orders issued pursuant to FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-1032(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Nevertheless, and in keeping with FL \u00a7 12-204(k)(2), which provides that the \u201cthe custodial parent shall be presumed to spend that parent\u2019s total child support obligation directly on the child or children,\u201d it is to be presumed, absent evidence to the contrary, that Shehan spent his child support obligation on the child during the periods that the parties actually cohabitated.
