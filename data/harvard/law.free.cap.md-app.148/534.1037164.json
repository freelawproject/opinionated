(\u201cHams\u201d), Jonathan D. Duvall, and Kenneth P. Sullivan, challenge the decision of the Circuit for Prince George\u2019s County granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants present the following question, which we have re-worded:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">Did the circuit court err in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on Md.Code \u00a7\u00a7 19-509 &amp; 19-510 of the Insurance Article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">We answer \u201cno\u201d and affirm the decision of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The material facts in this case are not in dispute. Appellee, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, issued a business automobile insurance policy (the \u201cpolicy\u201d) to Hams for a 1996 Toyota pickup truck (the \u201cvehicle\u201d), for the period between December 1997 through November 1998. The policy provided liability coverage of $500,000 per accident and uninsured/un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>derinsured (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> coverage of $50,000 per incident. There was no written waiver by a Hams\u2019 representative authorizing the variation between the liability and UM/UIM coverage limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The vehicle was used by Jonathan Duvall, an officer and employee of Hams, for both business and personal purposes. On June 20, 1998, he was involved in an automobile accident while operating the vehicle for personal use. Kenneth Sullivan, who was not affiliated with Hams, was a passenger in the pickup truck. Both men suffered injuries that exceeded the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage and surpassed the $50,000 per incident UM/UIM coverage that was available under Hams\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On November 8, 2000, the appellants filed a complaint in the circuit court requesting reformation of Hams\u2019 insurance policy to increase the UM/UIM coverage to \u201cequal that of the liability coverage.\u201d Appellants asserted that Maryland insurance law required insurers to notify the insured and obtain a written waiver when a policy\u2019s liability insurance coverage was not equal to its UM/UIM coverage. Because no such waiver had been obtained, appellants argued that Hams\u2019 UM/UIM coverage must be increased to equal the policy\u2019s liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On February 26, 2001, appellees filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>that McLCode (1997, 1998 Supp.), \u00a7 19-510 of the Insurance Article (\u201cIA\u201d) did not apply to commercial or business lines policies. Therefore, according to appellees, no written waiver authorizing the differing coverages was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Appellants responded to that motion and also filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the court. Appellees then filed another motion for summary judgment on June 15, 2001, again arguing that the written waiver requirement did not apply to the policy at issue. The court held a motions hearing on September, 7, 2001, and granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">In any statutory interpretation [case] the Court must first look to the words of the statute to determine whether the statutory aim and objective is clear and unambiguous, and in that process the Court is entitled to consult the legislative history to determine the legislative purpose or goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">The pertinent language in the statute in question, 19-509 and specifically 19-510, is the interpretation of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">I am persuaded primarily by the fiscal note submitted on behalf of MAIF regarding the difference in their personal lines coverage and commercial lines coverage and the subsequent amendment contained within the legislative history by the striking of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and replacing it with \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle,\u201d that the intent of the legislature was not to have Sections 19-509 and 19-510 to apply to business or commercial lines policies but only to personal lines policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">Finding that that was the intent of the legislature, I will then grant the defendant Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff is not entitled to have this policy reformed to have the uninsured motorist liability limits be identical with the bodily injury liability limits absent any waiver by the insured of that right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Appellants filed this appeal on September 27, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Summary judgment \u201cis used to dispose of cases when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118 (2000) (citations omitted). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact is a factual dispute that is real and not imagined.\u201d <em>Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>139 Md.App. 470, 483, 776 A.2d 80 (2001), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>368 Md. 434, 795 A.2d 715 (2002). A material fact is one that would \u201caffect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). \u201cSummary judgment may not be defeated by a dispute as to a fact that is immaterial.\u201d <em>Schmerling, </em>139 Md.App. at 483, 776 A.2d 80. \u201cNeither general allegations of facts in dispute nor a mere scintilla of evidence will suffice to support the non-movant\u2019s position; there must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the moving party.\u201d <em>Fearnow v.

Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726 (2001). \u201cEvidentiary matters, credibility issues, and material facts which are in dispute cannot properly be disposed of by summary judgment.\u201d Unde<em>rwood-Gary v. Mathews, </em>366 Md. 660, 685, 785 A.2d 708 (2001). Moreover, \u201c[i]n appeals from grants of summary judgment, Maryland appellate courts, as a general rule, will consider only the grounds upon which the lower court relied in granting summary judgment.\u201d <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 422, 768 A.2d 1029 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Accordingly, because there is no dispute of material fact, \u201cour review is limited to whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206 (2001). We look to whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the relevant law to the uncontested facts. <em>Fister </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>v. Allstate Life Ins.

The Court of Appeals \u201chas stated many times \u2018that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 81, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001) (citation omitted). Our starting point is always the text of the statute. <em>Adamson v. Correctional Med. Servs., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501 (2000). \u201c[I]f the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 473, 784 A.2d 569 (2001). The plain meaning rule is \u201celastic, rather than cast in stone[,]\u201d and if \u201cpersuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute, we do not turn a blind eye to it.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251, 753 A.2d 501 (citing <em>Kaczorowski v.

Department of Employment &amp; Training, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382 (1987). \u201cThis enables us to put the statute in controversy in its proper context and thereby avoid unreasonable or illogical results that defy common sense.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 252, 753 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">A. Statutory Language</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Appellants argue that the vehicle was a \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle\u201d and thus the plain language of IA \u00a7 19-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>510 required appellees to obtain an affirmative written waiver if there were to be different liability and UM/UIM limits. At oral argument, appellants referred to Md.Code (1977, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-144.1 of the Transportation Article (\u201cTA\u201d), which defines \u201cpassenger car\u201d as \u201ca motor vehicle, except a multipurpose passenger vehicle or motorcycle, designed to carry 10 persons or less.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Alternatively, appellants contend that the legislative history supports a finding that the term \u201cprivate passenger motor\u201d vehicle was to include all vehicles other than \u201cgovernmental or quasi-governmental\u201d vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Appellees assert that summary judgment was \u201cappropriate because the statutory basis for the [appellants\u2019] claim, Section 19-510 of the Insurance Article, is inappropriate to the commercial policy at issue in this case.\u201d Further, they claim that any ambiguity regarding a distinction between private passenger and commercial lines policies in the context of IA \u00a7 19-510 is resolved by the legislative history, which demonstrates the legislature\u2019s recognition of a distinction between \u201cprivate passenger\u201d policies and \u201ccommercial\u201d policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Uninsured motorist coverage is governed by IA \u00a7 19-509(e), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">(1) The uninsured motorist coverage contained in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy:<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">(i) shall at least equal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">1. the amounts required by Title 17 of the Transportation Article;<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>2. the coverage provided to a qualified person under Title 20, Subtitle 6 of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">(ii) may not exceed the amount of liability coverage provided under the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">(2) Unless waived in accordance with \u00a7 19-510 of this subtitle, the amount of uninsured motorist coverage provided under a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy shall equal the amount of liability coverage provided under the policy. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">IA \u00a7 19-510, provides the statutory criteria for waiver of uninsured motorist coverage in an amount equal to the liability coverage of a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">(a) <em>Scope of section. </em>\u2014 This section applies only when the liability coverage under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance exceeds the amount required under \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) If the first named insured under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance does not wish to obtain uninsured motorist coverage in the same amount as the liability coverage provided under the policy or binder, the first named insured shall make an affirmative written waiver of having uninsured motorist coverage in the same amount as the liability coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">(2) If the first named insured does not make an affirmative written waiver under this section, the insurer shall provide uninsured motorist coverage in an amount equal to the amount of the liability coverage provided under the policy or binder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">(c) <em>Notice required. </em>\u2014 A waiver made under this section is not effective unless, prior to the waiver, the insurer gives the first named insured written notice of the nature, extent, benefit, and cost of the level of the uninsured motorist coverage being waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">(d) <em>Form. </em>\u2014 (1) A waiver made under this section shall be made on the form that the Commissioner requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">(2) The form may be part of the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">(3) The form shall clearly and concisely explain in 10 point boldface type:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">(i) the nature, extent, benefit, and cost of the level of the uninsured motorist coverage that would be provided under the policy if not waived by the first named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">(ii) that a failure of the first named insured to make a waiver requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorist coverage in an amount equal to the amount of the liability coverage provided under the policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">(iii) that an insurer may not refuse to underwrite a person because the person refuses to waive the excess uninsured motorist coverage under this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">(iv) that a waiver made under this section must be an affirmative written waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>(4) Subject to the Commissioner\u2019s approval, a waiver made under this section may be made on the same form as the waiver made under \u00a7 19-506<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">(e) <em>Effective period. </em>\u2014 A waiver made under this section by a person that is insured continuously by an insurer or by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund is effective until the waiver is withdrawn in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">(f) <em>Refusal to underwrite prohibited. </em>\u2014 (1) An insurer may not refuse to underwrite a person because the person refuses to waive the excess uninsured motorist coverage under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">(2) An insurer that violates this subsection is subject to the penalties provided by \u00a7\u00a7 4-113 and 4-114 of this article. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">IA \u00a7 19-510 is directed at a type of insurance policy, rather than the vehicle being insured by that policy. Here, it is undisputed that the pick-up truck was owned by Hams; that the insurance policy covering the vehicle was a commercial lines policy; that the accident occurred while the vehicle was being operated by a Hams\u2019 employee for personal, rather than business purposes; and most significantly, for the purposes of this dispute, that appellees did not obtain from Hams a written waiver regarding the difference between the liability and UM/UIM coverage limits. Therefore, the issue is whether the policy sought to be reformed was a policy of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle liability insurance\u201d for the purpose of IA \u00a7 19-510. Stated differently, does IA \u00a7 19-510 apply to a commercial lines insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">We find guidance in the statutory treatment of the required coverages for motor vehicle insurance contained in the Insurance Article. For example, IA \u00a7\u00a7 19-504,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>19-505(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 19-512(a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> regulate liability coverage, personal injury protection coverage (\u201cPIP\u201d), and collision coverage, respectively. The liability and PIP statutes govern the minimum coverages required for a \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance policy!)]\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>IA \u00a7\u00a7 19-504 and 19-505(a). The collision coverage statute applies to a \u201cmotor vehicle insurance policy.\u201d IA \u00a7 19-512(a). These sections generally apply to insurance policies insuring motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">IA \u00a7 19-509(e) also applies to \u201cmotor vehicle liability insurance\u201d policies generally. In contrast, the UM/UIM waiver provision \u201capplies only when the liability coverage under a policy or binder of private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance exceeds the amount required under \u00a7 17-108, <em>[supra,] </em>of the Transportation Article.\u201d IA \u00a7 19-510(a) (emphasis added). The words \u201cprivate passenger\u201d differentiate the application of this provision from the more general provisions related to liability, PIP, collision and UM/UIM coverage in motor vehicle insurance coverage. Therefore, the language of the statute itself indicates that the waiver provision of IA \u00a7 19-510 was not intended to apply to a commercial lines policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We have found a differentiation between \u201cprivate passenger\u201d and \u201ccommercial\u201d automobile policies in other provisions of the Insurance Article. In fact, both IA \u00a7\u00a7 23-306(b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 23-307(b)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> differentiate \u201cprivate passenger automobile\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201ccommercial automobile\u201d insurance policies. <em>See </em>IA \u00a7 20-503(b) and (c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">B. Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Assuming that the language of the statute is not free from any ambiguity, we, as did the circuit court, have examined the legislative history of the provisions at issue. Our conclusion regarding the statutory language is consistent with the legislative history of IA \u00a7 19-510.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On March 13, and April 1, 1992, the Maryland General Assembly Department of Fiscal Services, Division of Fiscal Research, issued a \u201cFiscal Note\u201d and \u201cFiscal Note Revised\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>that discussed proposed amendments to Senate Bill (\u201cSB\u201d) 767. That bill proposed that \u201cmotor vehicle insurers\u201d be required to increase the amount of uninsured motorist coverage to equal the amount of liability coverage provided in the insurance policy, unless the insured submitted a written request to reduce the uninsured motorist coverage. Their respective overviews appear to apply to insurance policies in general. Moreover, the notes refer to the impact of SB 767 on \u201cprivate passenger business\u201d and \u201ccommercial business.\u201d The April 1,1992 Note stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">Most of [Maryland- Automobile Insurance Fund\u2019s (\u201cMAIF\u201d) ] private passenger insureds carry only the basic mandatory limits of $20,000/$40,000 and $10,000. Therefore this bill would have little impact on its private passenger business. However, this- bill would greatly increase the liability limits for MAIF\u2019s commercial business, at least temporarily until the insured requests a change back to basic uninsured motorist coverage limits. The amendment that provides for renewal at the same reduced level previously requested will affect about 15% of its commercial Insureds.<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">MAIF points out that in addition to issuing uninsured motorist coverage at the level of the bodily injury liability limits (unless there is a written request to reduce it), uninsured motorist coverage for property damage liability would be raised to the level above $10,000 carried by the insured. Commercial insureds frequently carry $50,000 to $100,000 property damage liability. Approximately 38% carry more that $10,000 in property damage liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In a subsequent Revised Fiscal Note, dated May 12, 1992, the phrase \u201cinsurance policy,\u201d located in the \u201c[ojverview of [legislation,\u201d was stricken and replaced by the phrase \u201ca policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.\u201d In addition, references to the impact on \u201ccommercial business\u201d were removed. Accordingly, only an analysis concerning \u201cpri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>vate passenger insureds\u201d remained. The Revised Note read: \u201cMost of MAIF\u2019s private passenger insureds carry only the basic mandatory limits of $20,000/40,000 and $10,000. Therefore this bill will have little impact on its private passenger business. The provision for continuing a waiver once made by continuously insured private passenger persons can be handled by MAIF\u2019s existing resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Therefore, we find nothing in the language of the statute or in the legislative history that persuades us that the General Assembly intended the phrase \u201cpolicy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance\u201d to relate to insurance on all vehicles except \u201cnon-governmental\u201d vehicles. Clearly, the legislature considered applying the uninsured motorist provision to \u201ccommercial\u201d as well as \u201cprivate passenger\u201d policies. In its deliberations, it was made aware of the large \u201cincrease\u201d in liability limits, with presumably increased costs, for commercial businesses. By substituting \u201cpolicy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance\u201d for the term \u201cinsurance policy\u201d the General Assembly intended to limit the UM/UIM waiver provision to private lines policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Accordingly, based on the language of the statute, as well as the legislative history and the distinctions between \u201cprivate passenger\u201d and \u201ccommercial\u201d insurance polices in other sections of the Insurance Article, we conclude that the circuit court was legally correct in deciding that the waiver provisions contained in IA \u00a7\u00a7 19-509 and 19-510 did not apply to the commercial lines policy at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"AvP\">COSTS PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\">.
