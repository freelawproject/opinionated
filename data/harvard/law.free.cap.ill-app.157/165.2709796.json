This is an appeal of the defendant from a judgment for $475, recovered against him in the Municipal Court by plaintiff in an action of the fourth class. This is plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Claim:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-14\" pgmap=\"183\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claim is the agreed price at fair market value of one No. 2 Walsh press and one No. 4 Walsh press sold by the plaintiff to one John Wollgren at the request of defendant, W. A. Sharp, and upon his promise to guarantee the account and pay the same if the purchaser did not. Said promise and sale was made on, to-wit, August 14, 1908, and the prices agreed upon between the plaintiff, defendant and Wollgren were as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-16\" pgmap=\"183\">One No. 2 Walsh press at.......... $155.00</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-17\" pgmap=\"183\">One No. 4 Walsh press at.......... 320.00</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-18\" pgmap=\"183\">Amount due...................$475.00.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\" pgmap=\"184\">August 9, 1908, Wollgren called at plaintiff\u2019s place of business and selected two presses, which he desired to purchase on a credit of sixty days. The next day the treasurer of plaintiff called on defendant Sharp and asked him if he would \u201cguarantee the account of Wollgren for the presses he was about to purchase from McDowell, Stocker &amp; Co., and Sharp said that he would, that if Wollgren did not pay, he, Sharp, would.\u201d The price and terms proposed were told to defendant before he \u201csaid that he would pay the bill if Wollgren did not.\u201d August 14, 1908, a proposal by plaintiff to Wollgren to sell him said presses on the terms therein stated was presented to Wollgren and defendant and accepted by each in writing. This is said proposal and acceptance:</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\" pgmap=\"184\">\u201cProposal from McDowell Stocker &amp; Co.

This proposal was accepted by Wollgren and Sharp in writing, and afterwards the presses were delivered by plaintiff to Wollgren.</p> <p id=\"b185-7\" pgmap=\"185\">The assent of Sharp to plaintiff\u2019s proposal is shown by his acceptance of it, and he thereby promised plaintiff that it should receive in payment for said presses Wollgren\u2019s note endorsed by Sharp. The sale was not complete until the presses were delivered and the delivery of the presses to Wollgren, after the acceptance of the proposal by Sharp, was a sufficient consideration for Sharp\u2019s promise to plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b185-8\" pgmap=\"185\">The term of credit had expired when this suit was brought, and plaintiff could recover the price of the presses, as damages for the breach of the special contract for payment in an endorsed note. Dunsworth v. Wood Machine Co., 29 Ill. App. 23; Hanna v. Mills, 21 Wend. 90; Worthy v. Jones, 11 Gray, 168.</p> <p id=\"b185-9\" pgmap=\"185\">The cause of action proved is not accurately set forth in plaintiff\u2019s \u201cStatement of Claim,\u201d but we do not think that the defendant was prejudiced thereby, or that for that reason the judgment should be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b185-10\" pgmap=\"185\">We find no error in the rulings of the court on questions of evidence.</p> <p id=\"b185-11\" pgmap=\"185\">The record is, in our opinion, free from reversible error and the judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b185-12\" pgmap=\"185\">'Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
