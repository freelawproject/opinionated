Lewis to restrain him from building an apartment house in violation of an agreement made with Lewis, and others, in which action Lewis was unsuccessful and appealed. After the present action was commenced the court ' of appeals reversed the judgment in the prior action, and the purchaser at the foreclosure, finding that a <em>lis pendens </em>had been filed and that the title had been refused by a title company, refused to complete his purchase. Pending a motion to compel such completion Lewis and the others who were interested in the restrictive agreement bought the mortgage in suit and served notice of withdrawal of the motion so far as the plaintiffs w\u00e9re concerned. .</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b926-7\">The opinion at special term was as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b926-8\">Cullen, J.\u2014That the purchaser would acquire under the foreclosure and sale a perfect title I have no doubt. The mortgage foreclosed is for the purchase money of the lands, and, of course, is paramount to any incumbrance that the acts or contracts of the grantor Grollner can have imposed on the lands. But this is not decisive of the application. -Defendant Lewis, in whose favor it is claimed Grollner created an easement or restriction upon the-mortgaged premises, has now acquired the mortgage in suit The-affidavits aver that all the liens, except the purchase money mortgage, accrued after the filing of the <em>lis pendens </em>in the action brought by Lewis to enforce the agreement made by Grollner. Lewis\u2019 equities are therefore superior to those of all the other parties to the action except the plaintiffs, and the equities of the plaintiffs extend only to the right to have their mortgage paid. Lewis, therefore, was entitled to acquire plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage to prevent the abrogation of his easement, and to have the sale made subject to his easement. Had this been done before the sale his rights would have been clear. A sale has been had. If carried out, Lewis\u2019 easement is destroyed. But the purchaser is willing ta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>forego his contract. The plaintiffs, having assigned their mortgage, withdrew their application to compel the purchaser to complete the purchase. The only party who seeks to enforce the sale is the defendant Grollner, who, by the sale, avoids his contract with Lewis. He certainly has no equity in his claim, nor can the defendant Lewis be properly charged with loches in not having acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage earlier. While the trial courts found the fact that Grollner had made the agreement restrictive of the use of the mortgaged lands, it was held that such an agreement could not be enforced. Had Lewis sought in this action to compel an assignment of the' plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage, he would have failed because of the judgment in the other action that he had no interest or easement in the lands. It was not till the judgments of the court of appeals reversing the judgment below that Lewis could assert his rights. Then he promptly acquired the paramount mortgage. Under these circumstances, it seems to me unjust to carry out the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b927-3\">Motion denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b927-4\"><em>Alfred R. </em>Page, for app\u2019lts; <em>Wm.
