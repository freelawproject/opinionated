This action was not commenced within six years from the maturity of such obligations, and consequently the plea of the statute must avail, unless the commencement of the action was stayed by injunction or other order of a court or judge, or by a statutory prohibition. Code, \u00a7 406. There was here no injunction or statutory prohibition, but it is contended that there was what amounted to \u201can order of a court or judge\u201d restraining the commencement of the action. It seems that the defendant, the maker of these obligations, brought replevin therefor against the plaintiff, and recovered a judgment for their possession, which judgment was subsequently reversed, and on a new trial judgment was given for the plaintiff that he was entitled to retain the instruments. The plaintiff\u2019s present contention is that the statute did not run while the judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor with regard to the right of possession remained in force. This contention, in my judgment, cannot be sustained. The possessory judgment did not stay the commencement of an action on the obligations. It is true that it may have been pleaded against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, but that involved no prohibition of the \u25a0action. The defense would not have been the judgment itself, but the plaintiff\u2019s want of ownership, as to which the judgment was <em>res adjud\u00edcala. </em>While the judgment remained unreversed, therefore, it was simply conclusive evidence in support of a single defense to an action on the obligations ; and though in a general sense conclusive, it could have been rebutted by proof of fraud or want of jurisdiction. But, even if the judgment were thus conclusive, and could not have been rebutted, still it did not work any practical inconvenience, for, if pleaded to a complaint on the obligations, the court would undoubtedly have stayed the trial until the determination of the appeal. The rule is well settled that a party who seeks to avoid the statute, notwithstanding- the lapse of the prescribed period, must bring himself expressly within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>some of the exceptions specified in the Code. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>62 N. Y., 553. He does not do this merely by showing the existence, for a specified period, of a valid defense to his claim. He must show that he was actually restrained from bringing his action ; not that such action, because of some particular incident, would probably have been unsuccessful. The plaintiff here was not only free at all times to bring an independent action upon these obligations, but I think he might have set up his present demand by way of counterclaim in the possessory action. The maker of the obligations was there the plaintiff; and the subject matter of that action was the ownership of the instruments. Such ownership was a prerequisite to recover upon the obligations, and the plaintiff\u2019s present claim was therefore connected with the subject of the possessory action. If the situation were reversed, there would be no doubt of the defendant\u2019s right in the present action to set up, by way of counterclaim, its ownership of the instruments, and to demand as affirmative relief that the plaintiff deliver them up. The ownership of the instruments is, in effect, the subject of both actions. It is the foundation of one and the gist of the other. Why could not the present plaintiff have said to the plaintiff in the possessory action: \u201c You are not the owner of these obligations, but I am; and as I am such owner, and as the obligations are due, I demand as a fitting incident to my claim of ownership, if successful, that you pay such obligations? \u201d It would seem to be as reasonable, and as harmonious with the Code (\u00a7 501, subd. 1), to permit a complete determination of the substantial controversy in this manner as to permit an equitable counterclaim in an action upon the obligations, praying that the ownership be determined, and that the instruments be delivered to the defendant. A verdict must therefore be directed in favor of the defendants.\" Each group of defendants, appearing by separate attorneys, is entitled to costs. Thus there will be three bills taxed, but, under the circumstances, I shall grant no extra allowance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-3\"><em>Delos McCurdy, </em>for app\u2019lt; <em>John D.

Final judgment of dissolution was entered in April, 1879, under which the plaintiff was continued as receiver. Among the assets which came into his hands were ten bonds purporting to be made by the Davis Sewing Machine Company for the sum of $1,000 each, which by their terms were due on November 1, 1876. These bonds, it would appear, had been pledged with the trust company as collateral for a loan to the Security Bank of Watertown, which remained unpaid at the time the receiver was appointed. In February, 1878, the Davis Sewing Machine Co., by leave of this court, brought against the receiver an action of replevin for the bonds, demanding judgment for their possession and damages for their detention. The answer of the receiver claimed a lien thereon for the unpaid balance of the loan for which they were pledged as security. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>trial was had upon the issue thus raised in July, 1878, which resulted in favor of the sewing, machine company, awarding them possession and adjudging. that the receiver had no title to, or right to the possession of the bonds. This judgment was by the general term reversed on October 19,1883, and a new trial ordered. In May, 1884, the re-trial was had, which resulted in a judgment in favor of the receiver, awarding him possession of the &lt;\u25a0 three bonds which are the subject of the present suit From this judgment an appeal was taken to both the general term and the court of appeals, and the right of the receiver to the possession of the three bonds was finally affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-2\">This suit was commenced as to some of the defendants in March, and as to others in April, 1884. It will be noticed that from July, 1878, to October, 1883, there was a valid outstanding judgment against the receiver denying his ownership or right to the possession of these bonds, and awarding their possession to defendant. It is conceded that if during this period while the judgment was outstanding the running of the statute of limitations was not suspended, then the statute is a bar to the action; for the obligation being promissory notes, and not sealed instruments, the six years statute of limitations applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">The Code provides (\u00a7 406): \u201c Where the commencement of an action has been stayed by injunction, or by other order of a court or judge, or by a statutory prohibition, the time of the continuance of the stay is not a part of the' time limited for the commencement of the action.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Although there is much force in the argument of appellant that \u201cthe effect of the action of replevin and the judgment therein against the receiver was more potent than an injunction or other order of the court, for it not only barred his remedy on the obligations, but judicially denied his right to their possession,\u201d it must be conceded that the judgment is not one of the exceptions provided by the Code preventing the running of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The question therefore is presented, whether there is any-ground other than the exceptions provided by statute which will suspend the running of the statute of limitations after it has once commenced to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We agree with the view expressed by the learned judge below, \u201c that the rule is well settled that a party who seeks to avoid the statute, notwithstanding the lapse of the prescribed period, must bring himself expressly within some of the exceptions specified in the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In the case of <em>McQueen </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>41 Barb., 337, it was decided that a right of action not expressly stayed or prevented by an injunction must be prosecuted within the prescribed period or it is barred. In the case of <em>Sanford </em>v. Sanford, 62 N. Y., 553, the debtor was declared a lunatic and had no committee who could be served. Although the argument was there made that for this reason the statute did not run, the court held that there was no provision for an exception in such a case. We think that the authority of this case and an examination of the earlier cases will show that the statute when once it commenced to run was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>suspended except pursuant to some other express provision of law ; and it was to abate the vigor of this rule that caused the enactment of \u00a7 406 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\">In view of the clear and satisfactory opinion of the learned judge below, it is unnecessary for us to do more than adopt his-reasoning and concur in the result reached by him. - We are, therefore, of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Van Brunt, P. J., O\u2019Brien and Patterson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
