Bud-nick and Colleen Diane Devine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defaulted on a home equity loan. Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank commenced a judicial foreclosure action against Budnick and Devine in federal court. Budnick and Devine failed to appear, so the .district court granted a default judgment in U.S. Bank\u2019s favor. Budnick and Devine subsequently moved to set aside the default judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The district court denied the motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The court \u201cmay set aside a final default judgment under Rule 60(b),\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which authorizes the court to \u201crelieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d if certain prerequisites are met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny relief pursuant to Rule 60(b) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cUnder this standard, the district court\u2019s ruling is \u2018entitled to deference,\u2019 but we review <em>de novo </em>\u2018any questions of law underlying the district court\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">Budnick and Devine first argue that the district court should have granted relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), which authorizes relief from a void judgment. According to Budnick and Devine, the default judgment is void because U.S. Bank failed to effectively serve them with legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">\u201cIf a court lacks jurisdiction over the parties because of insufficient service of process, the judgment is void and the district court must set it aside.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a party may waive service of process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-17\">US Bank at least attempted to personally serve Budnick and Devine pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e), but the record contains conflicting evidence regarding whether that attempt ultimately succeeded. The district court never made factual findings to resolve those evidentia-ry conflicts. Nonetheless, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that U.S. Bank never successfully served Budnick and Devine, the record unequivocally establishes that Budnick and Devine explicitly agreed not to raise any objections to service of process. Shortly after U.S. Bank\u2019s process server attempted to serve Budnick and Devine, Budnick and Devine sent U.S. Bank\u2019s counsel the following e-mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>[D]ue to the fact that service of process is defective and therefore not proper and legal/lawful notice as required bylaw, we are willing to overlook this defective service of process provided that you and your client U.S, BANK, NA, agree to provide us with an adequate extention [sic] of time to respond to this Civil Action properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The record contains no indication that U.S. Bank had previously asked Budnick and Devine to waive service of process; Bud-nick and Devine\u2019s offer to \u201coverlook\u201d any alleged defects in service was therefore unsolicited. US Bank\u2019s counsel promptly responded: \u201cIn your e-mail, you don\u2019t say how long of an extension you\u2019re looking for. When do you and your wife want to file your response?\u201d Budnick and Devine replied, \u201cWe would like to file a response by March 20, 2014.\u201d US Bank\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cOK.\u201d In reliance on its agreement with Budnick and Devine, U.S. Bank did not ask the district court to enter a default against Budnick and Devine or move for a default judgment until July 9, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Budnick and Devine argue that them agreement is unenforceable because it does not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(l)\u2019s requirements for waiver of service.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. Rule 4(d)(1), by its plain terms, applies only when the <em>\u201cplaintiff </em>... requests] that the defendant waive service of a summons.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Budnick and Devine cite no authority for the proposition that a waiver of service must comply with Rule 4(d)(1) when the <em>defendant, </em>without any prior solicitation from the plaintiff, volunteers to waive service in exchange for an extension of time. Nor has our independent research revealed any such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">In sum, Budnick and Devine promised to overlook any defects in service of process. In exchange, U.S. Bank accorded Budnick and Devine extra time to answer the complaint. Budnick and Devine broke that promise by raising a service of process objection in their Rule 60(b) motion. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">Budnick and Devine also argue that the district court should have vacated the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), which permits the court to relieve a party of a final judgment on the basis of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Budnick and Devine do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>explain how any of those factors are present in this case, so they have abandoned this argument.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Finally, Budniek and Devine argue that the district court should have vacated the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), which permits the court to set aside a judgment for any \u201creason that justifies relief\u201d other than those explicitly listed in Rule 60(b)(l)-(5). According to Budniek and Devine, they are entitled to Rule 60(b)(6) relief because they have a-valid statute of limitations defense against U.S. Bank\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Rule 60(b)(6) permits relief from a final judgment only if \u201c \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u201d exist.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No extraordinary circumstances are present here. If Budniek and Devine had a viable statute of limitations defense, they could have raised it before their time to file an answer had expired.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying Budniek and De-vine\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
