Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a), and worker\u2019s compensation retaliation, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.205. On appeal, Wood argues that: (1) a reasonable jury could find that Calhoun County\u2019s alleged reason for terminating him \u2014 insubordination\u2014was a pretext for discrimination; and (2) the district court erred in holding that the Calhoun County Board of Commissioner\u2019s (the \u201cBoard\u201d) hearing eliminated his supervisor\u2019s bias. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1211 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A factual dispute exists where a reasonable fact-finder could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the non-moving party is entitled to a verdict. <em>Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, </em>694 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability on the basis of the individual\u2019s disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Florida\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation retaliation statute prohibits an employer from discharging an employee because of the employee\u2019s valid worker\u2019s compensation claim. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.205.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">We analyze both ADA discrimination and Florida workers compensation retaliation claims under the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> burden-shifting framework. <em>See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C:, </em>492 F.3d 1247, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>1255 (11th Cir.2007) (ADA claim); <em>Andrews v. Direct Mail Exp., Inc., </em>1 So.3d 1192, 1193 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (Florida worker\u2019s compensation retaliation claim). Once a plaintiff meets his prima facie burden under either statute \u2014 which includes showing causation \u2014 the defendant must present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004) (ADA claim); <em>Andrews, </em>1 So.3d at 1193-94 (Florida worker\u2019s compensation retaliation claim). To succeed in his claims, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the reason given was a pretext for a statutorily-protected purpose. <em>See Cleveland, </em>369 F.3d at 1193; <em>Andrews, </em>1 So.3d at 1193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Pretext means that the r\u00e9ason given by the employer was not the real reason for the adverse employment decision. <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir.1997). An employee can show that the employer\u2019s articulated reason was false by pointing to \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, in-coherencies, or contradictions\u201d in the proffered explanation that a reasonable factfinder would find them unworthy of credence. <em>Id. </em>at 1538 (quotation omitted). However, a reason is not a pretext for discrimination unless the plaintiff shows both that the reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). The plaintiff \u201cmust meet [the proffered] reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">In certain circumstances, causation may be established, under the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d doctrine, when a decisionmaker followed a biased recommendation from a non-deci-sionmaker without independently investigating the complaint. <em>Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.1999). In such a case, the recommender uses the decisionmaker as a mere conduit, or cat\u2019s paw, to give effect to his discriminatory animus. <em>Id. </em>If, however, a decisionmaker conducts its own evaluation and makes an independent decision, the decision is free of the taint of a biased subordinate employee. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Here, the district court properly granted summary judgment. As the record reveals, any alleged animus by his supervisor was cleansed by the independent review of the Calhoun County Board of Commissioners (\u201cthe Board\u201d), and Wood did not show that the reasons for firing him were pre-textual. Indeed, the Board upheld Wood\u2019s termination after conducting an independent hearing where Wood was represented by counsel, presented witness testimony and exhibits, cross-examined adverse witnesses, and argued his case to the Board. After the hearing, the Board independently determined that good cause supported Wood\u2019s termination. This conclusion was supported by the undisputed evidence that Wood continued to operate a forklift, in violation of the direct command of his supervisor, which amounted to insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Wood\u2019s reliance on <em>Staub v. Proctor Hosp., </em>562 U.S. 411, 420-21, 131 S.Ct. 1186, 179 L.Ed.2d 144 (2011), to prove his \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory is not convincing. In <em>Staub, </em>the Supreme Court specifically noted that \u201cthe supervisor\u2019s biased report may remain a causal factor if the independent investigation takes it into account without determining that the adverse action was, apart from the supervisor\u2019s recommendation, entirely justified.\u201d 562 U.S. at 421, 131 S.Ct. 1186. For starters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>however, <em>Staub </em>is arguably not applicable because it dealt with a claim under the Uniform Services Employment And Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), and we\u2019ve held that its holding does not necessarily extend to other employment discrimination statutes. <em>See </em>Staub, 562 U.S. at 417-18, 131 S.Ct. 1186; <em>Sims v. MVM, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 1327, 1336 (11th Cir.2013) (declining to extend Staub\u2019s causation standard to claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d)). Moreover, if we assume that <em>Staub </em>applies, the record here shows that the Board conducted an independent hearing where Wood had the opportunity to present his case. At that hearing, the Board specifically found that Wood\u2019s admission that he violated a direct command and intended to continue doing so justified his termination independent of his supervisor\u2019s actions. The Board\u2019s independent evaluation, therefore, broke the causal link between Wood\u2019s supervisor\u2019s alleged animus and his termination, and Wood never directly rebutted the reason given for his firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">On this record, a jury could not find that Calhoun County terminated him because of his disability or his worker\u2019s compensation claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Calhoun County\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-13\">. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
