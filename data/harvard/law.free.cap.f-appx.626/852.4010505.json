Because the district court did not determine whether the defendants could be located by the U.S. Marshal with reasonable effort, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">In his complaint, Allen named as defendants Sergeant Howard W. Carey, Officer McKinney, Sergeant Kyle Knight, and Officer W. Hubbard. He identified the defendants as employees of the Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida, and he listed the address of the prison for each. The district court granted Allen leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) and assessed a partial filing fee, and later directed the U.S. Marshals Service to serve the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">The U.S. Marshal returned unexecuted the summons for each of the four defendants. According to the U.S. Marshal, the defendants could not be served for the following reasons: (1) there were two prison employees with the last name \u201cMcKinney,\u201d so a first name was needed; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Hubbard could not be identified as an employee of the Florida Department of Corrections; (3) Carey was out on extended medical leave; and (4) Knight was out on military service leave for more than one year. On September 18, 2014, a magistrate judge ordered Allen to respond within 21 days with McKinney\u2019s first name or initial and the locations of the other three defendants, or face dismissal of his complaint without further notice. On September 29, Allen filed a response stating that he had requested, but did not know, McKinney\u2019s first name, and that he did not know the whereabouts of Hubbard or Carey. He also submitted a request for discovery, asking to have the prison provide the U.S. Marshal with the present or last known addresses of the defendants and also prison logs relevant to Allen\u2019s allegations that would help identify the first names of McKinney and Hubbard.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">On October 20, the district court issued an order striking Allen\u2019s request for discovery and dismissing Hubbard, Carey, and Knight from the action without prejudice based on Allen\u2019s failure to identify their whereabouts. The court directed Allen to provide McKinney\u2019s first name by November 18 and cautioned that failure to do so would result in dismissal without further notice. Allen moved for appointment of counsel and timely responded that he was unable to determine McKinney\u2019s first name. The district court then dismissed the case without prejudice on December 1 because \u201cPlaintiff has failed to provide the Court with sufficient information to successfully execute process on Defendant McKinney, the only remaining Defendant in the case.\u201d Doc. 24 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">On appeal, Allen argues that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him discovery to help identify the defendants and by not allowing him to plead a fictitious party in place of McKinney until he identified his first name. He also argues that the U.S. Marshal was required to try to locate the defendants that he identified. As a <em>pro se </em>litigant, he asserts, he could not obtain the defendants\u2019 home addresses, but he did provide the district court with the only address he knew, which was the state prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">The district court did not identify the mechanism for dismissal for failure to serve, but Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs. We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to effect service under Rule 4(m) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Richardson v. Johnson, </em>598 F.3d 734, 738 (11th Cir.2010). We will affirm unless we conclude that the district court has made a clear error of judgment or has applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Id. </em>Under Rule 4(m), the court \u201cmust dismiss the action without prejudice ... or order that service be made within a specified time\u201d if a defendant was not served within 120 days after the complaint was filed. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). If a plaintiff shows \u201cgood cause\u201d for the failure, however, \u201cthe court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">A plaintiff proceeding IFP under \u00a7 1915 is entitled to have a U.S. Marshal or other appointed person effect service. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(3). \u201c[T]he failure of the United States Marshal to effectuate service on behalf of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>plaintiff through no fault of that plaintiff constitutes \u2018good cause\u2019 for the plaintiffs failure to effect timely service within the meaning of Rule 4(m).\u201d <em>Rance v. Rocksolid Granit USA, Inc., </em>583 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2009). We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>said that it is unreasonable to expect prisoners proceeding <em>pro se </em>to provide the current addresses of prison-guard defendants who no longer work at a prison. <em>Richardson, </em>598 F.3d at 739-40 (citing <em>Sellers v. United States, </em>902 F.2d 598,- 602 (7th Cir.1990)). Thus, so long as the U.S. Marshal can locate the defendant with \u201creasonable effort,\u201d a plaintiff establishes \u201cgood cause\u201d under Rule 4(m) by providing enough information to identify the prison-guard defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Herei we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Allen\u2019s case. Allen largely identified the defendants and provided information relevant to distinguishing which of the two McKinneys was the subject of Allen\u2019s complaint. In dismissing all of Allen\u2019s claims, the district court failed to determine whether the defendants can be located' with reasonable effort. <em>See id. </em>We therefore vacate the dismissal of Allen\u2019s complaint and remand for the court to make that determination. If so, they must be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. In a supplemental filing on appeal, Allen represents that both Carey and Knight have returned from their respective leave and are currently working at the state prison he originally identified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
