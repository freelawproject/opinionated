The Government moves to dismiss or for summary affirmance. We dismiss the appeal as barred by the appeal waiver in Cameron\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-25\">We pretermit determination of the standard of review because the appeal waiver is enforceable under either the de novo standard or the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). There is no merit to Cameron\u2019s claim that Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Criminal Procedure ll(b)(l)(M) was not satisfied and that consequently the plea agreement is involuntary, unknowing, and invalid. The plea agreement correctly recited that the maximum possible sentence for the offense was 20 years, the minimum supervised release term was three years, and a f\u00edne of up to $1,000,000 was possible. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 846. Additionally, the agreement noted the district court\u2019s obligation to consider the Sentencing Guidelines and the court\u2019s discretion to sentence outside the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">A written supplement to the plea agreement also made clear that the district court was free to sentence Cameron to the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law. Cameron and his attorney each declared that the plea agreement and the supplement were read by or to Cameron, were explained to Cameron by his attorney, were understood by Cameron, were voluntarily accepted by Cameron, and were agreed to by Cameron. Both Cameron and his counsel signed the plea agreement and the supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Additionally, the district court at rear-raignment reviewed with Cameron the maximum sentence he faced. The district court emphasized its authority to sentence Cameron up to the maximum sentence. A defendant is aware of the consequences of his plea for sentencing purposes and the plea is knowing and voluntary if the defendant understands the length of prison time he might face. <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>898 F.2d 442, 447 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We conclude that the stated purpose of Rule ll(b)(l)(M) \u2014 which is \u201cthat the defendant understands\u201d the court\u2019s sentencing authority and obligations \u2014 was achieved. Cameron\u2019s waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily, and it applies to the circumstances at hand, based on the agreement\u2019s plain language. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir.2011). Because the appeal waiver admitted of no exceptions, it bars this appeal. Consequently, we GRANT the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and DENY the alternative motion for summary affir-mance.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b121-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
