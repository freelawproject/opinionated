At the time of his sentencing, at least one criminal case was pending against him in Georgia state court. The district court ordered Lewis\u2019s sentence to run \u201cconsecutively to any other sentence that may be imposed in Colquitt County, Georgia Superior Court and any pending case.\u201d On appeal, Lewis argues that the district' court abused its discretion by ordering his sentence to run consecutively because the court allegedly failed to consider the factors under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 5G1.3(d), failed to state its reasons for the sentence with particularity, and otherwise imposed an unreasonable sentence that is \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d After careful review, we affirm Lewis\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-20\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We likewise review a district court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>sentence for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346 (11th Cir.2009). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Federal district courts generally \u201chave discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings.\u201d <em>Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1468, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). This discretionary authority extends to situations where, as here, \u201ca federal judge anticipates a state sentence that has not yet been imposed.\u201d <em>Setser, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1468; <em>United States v. McDaniel, </em>338 F.3d 1287, 1288 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] district court does have the authority to make a federal sentence concurrent to a state sentence not yet imposed for pending state charges[.]\u201d); <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>330 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A] court does have the authority to impose a consecutive sentence to an unimposed, future sentence.\u201d). We have recognized that \u00a7 3584(a) and the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cevince a preference for consecutive sentence when imprisonment terms are imposed at different times.\u201d <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1993); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (\u201cMultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">In exercising its discretion under \u00a7 3584(a), the district court must consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b); <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1505 (\u201cThe court\u2019s discretion in determining whether a consecutive or concurrent sentence is appropriate is tempered by the statutory requirement that the sentencing court consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the Sentencing Guidelines in effect when the defendant was sentenced. <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1505; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)-(5). The district court need not discuss each factor individually, but must acknowledge consideration of the de-f\u00e9ndant\u2019s arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors as a whole. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Section 5G1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual governs the imposition of a sentence on a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment or an anticipated state term of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. As relevant here, the guideline provides that the sentence \u201cmay be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively\u201d to the undischarged or anticipated sentence \u201cto achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(d) (policy statement). The application note to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>\u00a7 5G1.3(d) lists factors the court may consider \u201c[i]n order to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense and avoid unwarranted disparity,\u201d including \u201cthe factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)),\u201d and \u201cany other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 cmt. n.4(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering Lewis\u2019s 60-month sentence to run consecutively to his anticipated sentences on pending charges in state court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Andrews, </em>330 F.3d at 1307. The record reflects that the court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when deciding to run Lewis\u2019s federal sentence consecutively. The court determined that a consecutive sentence was appropriate, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, Lewis\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need to promote respect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) &amp; (a)(2)(A). In particular, the court cited Lewis\u2019s multiple felony convictions related to theft of firearms, some of which did not result in the assessment of criminal-history points. The focus on these offenses was warranted, given that the instant offense involved Lewis\u2019s possession of a stolen firearm. Although the court did not go into specific details about the \u00a7 3553(a) factors it found relevant, the district court\u2019s statement that it considered all the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) and made an individualized assessment was sufficient. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Viewing the court\u2019s action against the backdrop of the \u201cpreference for eon-secutive sentence when imprisonment terms are imposed at different times,\u201d <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1506, the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering Lewis\u2019s sentence to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Lewis contends that the court failed to discuss the factors under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(d) at sentencing, but he has not identified what relevant factor the court did not discuss. To be sure, the court did not reference \u00a7 5G1.3, but the court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(d) cmt. n.4(A)(i), and Lewis has not put forth \u201cany other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence\u201d that the court failed to consider, <em>id. </em>cmt. n.4(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Because the court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the only limitation on the court\u2019s running of Lewis\u2019s sentence consecutively is that \u201cthe resulting total sentence must be reasonable.\u201d <em>Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1347. Apart from the conclusory statement that the sentence is \u201ctoo harsh\u201d due to its consecutive nature, Lewis does not explain why his sentence is unreasonable. Nor can we say based on the totality of the circumstances that the court abused its discretion by imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence. Consequently, Lewis has not met his burden of showing that his sentence is unreasonable, and we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. The government contends that plain-error review applies because Lewis did not object to the consecutive nature of his sentence at sentencing. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). Under either standard, Lewis is not entitled to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1),(3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b921-6\">. Other factors not directly implicated by an anticipated state sentence are also listed, including the type or length of the prior undischarged sentence, as well as the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 cmt. n.4(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. Lewis does not argue that the sentence\u2014 imposed to run consecutively to \"any pending case\u201d\u2014is impermissibly indefinite and uncertain. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>46 F.3d 57, 58-59 (10th Cir.1995) (concluding that a similar sentence was sufficiently definite and certain).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
