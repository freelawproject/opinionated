He argues the district court erred in summarily granting his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without discussing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors or otherwise explaining its reasons for the chosen sentence reduction. Because we find the court\u2019s order insufficient to enable meaningful appellate review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-25\">Lara was indicted in 2007 by a federal grand jury for his role in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. He pled guilty to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>spiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Under the 2006 Sentencing Guidelines, Lara was assigned a base offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of III. This established an advisory guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The district court sentenced Lara to serve 216 months in prison, stating that a sentence within the guideline range was appropriate based on the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. On appeal, we held that the district court did not procedurally err in imposing Lara\u2019s sentence because its statement of reasons for the sentence was sufficient. <em>United States v. Concepcion, </em>316 Fed.Appx. 929, 933 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 782, which reduced the offense level for certain drug-trafficking offenses, including Lara\u2019s, by two levels. That same year, Lara, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The government responded and agreed that Lara was eligible for a reduction based on Amendment 782. Based on the two-level reduction, Lara\u2019s guideline range became 155 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. In his motion, Lara did not request a specific sentence, but rather generally requested that the court grant a sentence reduction in accordance with \u00a7 3582(c)(2), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e), and Amendment 782. In its response, the government suggested that a sentence at the middle to high end of the amended guideline range was appropriate, The government did not explain why it thought such a sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">The district court issued an order granting Lara\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction using the two-page AO 247 form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court reduced Lara\u2019s sentence of imprisonment from 216 months to 188 months. The form states that the court issued the ruling after considering Lara\u2019s motion \u201cand taking into account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent that they are applicable[.]\u201d (Doc. 133 at 1). Lara now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). A district court abuses its discretion by failing to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures when making a determination under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010). We hold <em>pro se </em>pleadings to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, liberally construe them. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment if a defendant\u2019s sentence is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>First, the court must recalculate the applicable guideline range, substituting only the amended guideline for the one originally used. <em>Id. </em>Then, the court must decide, after analyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (stating that the \u201cthe court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(B)(i) (stating that the court \u201cshall\u201d consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining whether to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). The district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Here, the district court reduced Lara\u2019s sentence to the top of the amended guideline range, 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, which amounted to a 28-month reduction in Lara\u2019s original sentence. Other than the form order\u2019s stock language that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, however, the court\u2019s order gives no indication of the court\u2019s reasoning for its chosen sentence or its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">While it is true that the district court need not explicitly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, either the court\u2019s explanation or the record as a whole must demonstrate that the court adequately considered those factors. <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that that district court adequately addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when the defendant' argued \u201cat length\u201d at the sentencing hearing based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the court explicitly considered the circumstances of the offenses and acknowledged that it had considered the defendant\u2019s arguments); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 761 (11th Cir.1998) (finding adequate, consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the \u201cdistrict court cited defendant\u2019s demonstrated violence and ... all the other considerations that went in to the establishment of this defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d (internal quotation marks)); <em>Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23 (finding adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the defendant\u2019s motion listed the factors and the government\u2019s response, cited by the court in its order, discussed \u201cspecific elements that were relevant to the necessary section 3553(a) inquiry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The government argues that the district court\u2019s order should be affirmed because the \u201crecord as a whole\u201d shows that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, given that the form order itself, which was signed by the district judge, explicitly states that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. But despite the conclu-sory statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court provided no explanation of its reasons for imposing the sentence that it did. And the record otherwise does not demonstrate that the court considered the pertinent factors. Neither Lara\u2019s motion nor the government\u2019s response discussed factors relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry, and no hearing was held on Lara\u2019s motion: <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that the record demonstrated that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the parties\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) filings presented arguments pertinent to the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis and the court held a sentencing reduction hearing). All we have for review is a form order with no reasoning. In short, we lack any detail, however minute, as to what was considered by the district court when it reduced Lara\u2019s sentence of imprisonment to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>The government suggests that the \u201cdistrict court carried its original sentencing determination \u2014 that Lara deserved a sentence above the middle of his advisory sentencing guidelines range \u2014 over to its determination\u201d on Lara\u2019s \u00a7 3583(c)(2) motion. Had that been the case, it may provide adequate insight into the court\u2019s reasoning. The record here does not support that contention, however. Lara\u2019s original sentence of 216 months\u2019 imprisonment was slightly higher than the middle of the 188- to 235-month guideline range, but still well below the top of the range. If the court intended to carry over its original sentencing determination, presumably Lara\u2019s reduced sentence would have been closer to the middle of the 155- to 188-month amended guideline range, rather than at its apex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">On this record, we cannot conclude that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making its reduction determination. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257. \u201cWithout such information, we cannot engage in meaningful appellate review and must vacate and remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1220 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting Lara\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. AO 247 is a standardized form used by district courts in denying or granting motions for sentence reductions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Page 2 of the form in this case is not part of the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. From low end to high end, Lara's original guideline range spanned 47 months (from 188 to 235). Lara's original sentence was 28 months above the low end, or about 60% of the total 47-month range (0.60 x 47 = 28.2). If the court intended to sentence Lara at an equivalent point in his amended guideline range (with a range of 33 months), for example, it would have imposed a sentence of around 175 months\u2019 imprisonment, or 20 months' above the low end of the range (0.60 x 33 = 19.8).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
