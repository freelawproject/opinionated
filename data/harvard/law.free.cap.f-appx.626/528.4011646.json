Guth brought a <em>qui tarn </em>action against Roedel, Parsons, Koch, Blache, Balhoff <em>&amp; </em>McCol-lister for alleged fraudulent billing practices arising from Roedel Parsons\u2019s representation of Louisiana State University in an expropriation proceeding against Guth. On appeal, Guth challenges the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action for failing to state a claim. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-18\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b551-19\">After Hurricane Katrina, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) made federal funds available to the City of New Orleans in the form of Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). The City set aside a portion of the CDBG funds to construct a United States Department of Veterans Affairs medical center and a teaching hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tal for Louisiana State University (LSU). The City and the State of Louisiana entered into a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement, assigning LSU the power and funds to acquire or expropriate property for the medical facilities. LSU then hired Roedel Parsons to acquire or expropriate the necessary property.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">During negotiations to acquire property from commercial property owners, Roedel Parsons had appraisals completed for both the real estate and any businesses on the property. Roedel Parsons then compensated owners for the greater of the two appraised amounts, maintaining that the compensation satisfied the requirements of the Louisiana Constitution. For Guth\u2019s property, the real estate was appraised for $173,000 and the business for $95,000. An expropriation suit was brought against Guth, and Guth was paid $173,000 for his property. As part of the suit, Guth counterclaimed for the loss of his business, and Roedel Parsons rejected Guth\u2019s offer to settle the counterclaim for the business\u2019s appraisal amount. The original expropriation suit remains pending on appeal in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In this' related action, Gregory Guth brought a <em>qui tam </em>action under the False Claims Act (FCA) on behalf of the United States against Roedel Parsons for allegedly fraudulent billings for legal work completed during the expropriation proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his amended complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Guth alleged that Roedel Parsons violated four FCA provisions: (1) the presentment provision, (2) the false statement provision, (3) the \u201creverse\u201d false claim provision, and (4) the FCA conspiracy provision. On December 18, 2014, the district court granted Roedel Parsons\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), and on January 2, 2015, dismissed Guth\u2019s complaint and amended complaint with prejudice. Guth timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>United States ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, </em>565 F.3d 180, 185 (5th Cir.2009). Under Rule 8(a), a pleading must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to. relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201c[W]e accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and interpret the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Spicer v. Westbrook, </em>751 F.3d 354, 365 (5th Cir.2014). However, we do not have to accept legal conclusions as true. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. While a complaint \u201cdoes not need detailed factual allegations,\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, \u201c\u2018[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere eonclusory statements\u2019 do not establish facial plausibility,\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>751 F.3d at 365 (quoting <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>S.Ct. 1937). Facial plausibility exists when sufficient facts in the complaint \u201callow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">FCA claims must also meet the supplemental pleading standards of Rule 9(b). <em>Spicer, </em>751 F.3d at 365; <em>see also Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 186 (\u201cRule 9(b) supplements but does not supplant Rule 8(a)\u2019s notice pleading.\u201d). Rule 9(b) requires the party to \u201cstate with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). This court has succinctly described Rule 9(b) as requiring the plaintiff to \u201cset forth the who, what, when, where, and how of the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>751 F.3d at 365 (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Steury v. Cardinal Health, Inc., </em>625 F.3d 262, 266 (5th Cir.2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the plaintiff \u201ccannot rely on speculation or conclusional allegations\u201d to fulfill Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement. <em>United States ex rel. Rafizadeh v. Cont\u2019l Common, Inc., </em>553 F.3d 869, 873 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">On appeal, Guth presents a number of issues for review. The majority of these issues relate to the same alleged error: that the district court erred in dismissing Guth\u2019s FCA claims based on alleged over-billing and double billing by Roedel Parsons. Guth further argues that the district court erred by: (1) dismissing Guth\u2019s FCA claims based on statutory violations for failing to plead a false certification of payment, (2) dismissing Guth\u2019s \u201creverse\u201d false claim, and (3) applying an incorrect standard to Guth\u2019s FCA conspiracy claim. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">First, Guth contends that the district court improperly dismissed his FCA claims based on alleged fraudulent over-billing by Roedel Parsons for legal work relating to the expropriation proceeding against Guth. Guth does not allege that the legal bills were fraudulent because they misrepresented the actual work performed by Roedel Parsons. Rather, Guth alleges that Roedel Parsons took a legal position on expropriation compensation \u2014 that paying the greater of either the real estate or business value compensated the property owner \u201cto the full extent of his loss\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2014 that \u201chad no legal basis or support in law or fact\u201d in order to increase Roedel Parsons\u2019s legal billings from the expropriation process. Thus, Guth\u2019s amended complaint alleges that \u201ceach, every, any and all such legal bill(s), timesheet(s), memoranda and/or other document(s)\u201d submitted by Roedel Parsons based on this legal position constituted a false claim. Guth also alleges that Roedel Parsons failed to negotiate in good faith and refused to settle in order to further increase its legal fees. Together, Guth argues that these actions allowed Roedel Parsons to fraudulently ov-erbill the government for unnecessary legal work. The district court held that Guth failed to satisfy the pleading standards of Rule 8(a) and Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">Under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A), liability attaches if a person \u201cknowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\u201d Under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B), liability attaches when a person \u201cknowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>fraudulent claim.\u201d Generally, four elements must be pleaded to state a cause of action under the FCA: \u201c(1) a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct; (2) that was made or carried out with the requisite scienter; (3) that was material; and (4) that caused the government to pay out money.\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>751 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In his amended complaint, Guth provided only the following limited facts to support his contention that Roedel Parsons fraudulently overbilled: (1) state and federal laws and regulations mandate that negotiation be attempted before beginning expropriation proceedings; (2) LSU hired Roedel Parsons to acquire and expropriate property, Roedel Parsons had the real estate and business appraised \u201cas part of its sham negotiations process,\u201d and Roedel Parsons initiated an expropriation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (3) Guth was paid the higher of the two appraisals; and (4) Roedel Parsons rejected Guth\u2019s proposed settlement of Guth\u2019s counterclaims in the expropriation suit and has continued to refuse to settle. Guth also provides his legal arguments as to why Roedel Parsons\u2019s legal position is contrary to the Louisiana Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Accepted as true, these facts appear to describe a relatively common, albeit contentious, legal proceeding: two parties disagreeing over the appropriate compensation for an expropriation and then resorting to litigation to settle their disagreement. <em>See, e.g., State Dept. of Transp. &amp; Dev. v. Dietrich, </em>555 So.2d 1355, 1356-58 (La.1990) (detailing the parties\u2019 disagreement over the appropriate compensation for an expropriation under the Louisiana Constitution). These facts alone are not enough for \u201cthe court to draw the reasonable inference\u201d that Roe-del Parsons overbilled for unnecessary legal work. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Guth attacked the strength of Roedel Parsons\u2019s legal position, but advancing a purportedly weak legal argument does not constitute, by itself, a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct. In particular, Guth has not pleaded any facts that raise a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that Roedel Parsons took its legal position, negotiated, or refused to settle merely to increase its legal fees. Guth\u2019s statements that these actions were \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d and \u201cconstituted fraud,\u201d are mere legal conclusions that do not have to be accepted as true, <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, and Guth\u2019s contention that the actions were undertaken \u201cto maximize legal billings,\u201d without more, is merely \u00e1 conclusory statement without any factual support. <em>See id. </em>at 686, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (\u201cBut the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint\u2019s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Guth also argues that the district court improperly dismissed his FCA claims based on alleged double billing for legal services by Roedel Parsons. Particularly, Guth alleges that multiple attorneys prepared for, traveled to and from, and attended court hearings during the litigation. Guth does not allege that the attorneys fraudulently billed for time not actually worked or for time worked by others; rather,, Guth contends that merely having multiple attorneys involved in the expropriation suit was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and therefore a basis for a FCA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Merely stating that multiple attorneys prepared for and attended hearings does not \u201callow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference\u201d that the work was unnecessary. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. As the district court correctly recognized, it is \u201cnot uncommon\u201d for more than one attorney to appear on behalf of a client, especially on complex matters such as expropriation suits. Guth also provides several invoices submitted by Roedel Parsons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the invoices only provide more evidence that multiple attorneys worked on the matter. \u201cStanding alone, raw bills \u2014 even with numbers, dates, and amounts \u2014 are not fraud without an underlying scheme to submit the bills for unperformed or unnecessary work.\u201d <em>Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 190. Nowhere in the amended complaint or its attachments has Guth provided any factual assertions that support his eonclusory statements that the additional attorneys were <em>unnecessary.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even accepting all factual allegations as true and interpreting the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, <em>Spicer, </em>751 F.3d at 365, Guth has failed to allege sufficient facts to plead a facially plausible claim that Roedel Parsons overbilled or double billed the government for unnecessary legal work. Because Guth has failed to state a plausible claim for relief under Rule 8(a), we do not address the supplemental Rule 9(b) standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Guth argues that the district court erred in holding that his \u201cfalse claims predicated on legal violations\u201d failed because Guth did not allege that any statute or regulation required a certificate of compliance or that Roedel Parsons falsely certified compliance. Guth argues that his amended complaint pleaded a plausible claim because it generally alleged that Roedel Parsons \u201cviolated the federal regulations of HUD and the CDBG program\u201d and the Code of Professional Conduct when it submitted the allegedly fraudulent legal billings to the government. Under a false certification theory, a defendant can be liable under the FCA for a legal violation if the government requires a certification of compliance with a statute or regulation and the claimant falsely certifies compliance. <em>Gonzalez v. Fresenius Med. Care N. Am., </em>689 F.3d 470, 475 (5th Cir.2012). However, \u201c[c]laims for services rendered, in violation of a statute do not necessarily constitute false or fraudulent claims under the. FCA.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>125 F.3d at 902. The only specific regulation cited by Guth is OMB Circular A-87, but nowhere in Guth\u2019s amended complaint does he assert that the regulation requires a certification of compliance or that Roedel Parsons falsely certified compliance. Thus, insofar as Guth intended his FCA claims to rest upon violations of statutes or regulations, he has failed to plead the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201clinchpin of [such] an FCA claim.\u201d <em>Spicer, </em>751 F.3d at 365. The district court therefore did not err in dismissing Guth\u2019s FCA claims predicated on legal violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Guth also contends that the district court wrongly dismissed his \u201creverse\u201d false claim. Under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(G), liability attaches when a person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al7\">knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Guth alleges that by double billing the government, each double payment created an obligation to refund the government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As previously discussed, Guth has not pleaded sufficient facts to allow the court \u201cto draw the reasonable inference\u201d that Roedel Parsons double billed for unnecessary legal work, <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, and therefore this court cannot reasonably infer that an obligation to refund the government has arisen. However, even if we assume Guth sufficiently pleaded facts showing unnecessary double billings by Roedel Parsons, we find no error in the district court\u2019s reasoning for dismissing Guth\u2019s reverse false claim for failing to plead a plausible claim under \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(G). <em>See United States ex rel. Marcy v. Rowan Cos., </em>520 F.3d 384, 391 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Finally, Guth asserts that the district court employed the wrong standard in dismissing his FCA conspiracy claims. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(C) subjects to civil liability any person who \u201cconspires to commit a violation\u201d of a number of FCA provisions, including the presentment, false statement, and reverse false claim provisions. Here, Guth asserts that the district court applied a summary judgment standard because the district court cited <em>United States ex rel. Farmer v. City of Houston, </em>523 F.3d 333, 343 (5th Cir.2008), for the elements required to show a FCA conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">The district court cited <em>Farmer </em>not for the standard to prove a FCA conspiracy claim, but to lay out the elements that Guth had to plead with particularity in order \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570,127 S.Ct. 1955. This very court has cited <em>Farmer </em>for the elements that must be pleaded for a FCA conspiracy claim to survive a 12(b)(6) motion. <em>Grubbs, </em>565 F.3d at 193 (quoting <em>Farmer, </em>523 F.3d at 343). After laying out the elements of a FCA conspiracy claim, the district court properly articulated and applied the supplemental pleading standard under Rule 9(b) to find that Guth failed to state a claim under the FCA conspiracy provision. <em>See id. </em>(noting that the Rule 9(b) standard applies to the FCA conspiracy provision). We find no merit to the claim that the district court applied the wrong standard in dismissing the \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(C) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. A FCA <em>qui tam </em>action may be brought by the government or by a private person in the name of the government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(a)-(b). The United States declined to intervene in the qui tam action. Guth also named the Board of Supervisors of LSU as a defendant; it was dismissed as a defendant on July 8, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-11\">. We refer to Guth\u2019s \"amended complaint\u2019\u2019 because Guth\u2019s First Amended Complaint incorporated by reference all of Guth\u2019s Original Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">. Under the Louisiana Constitution, \"the owner shall be compensated to the full extent of his loss\" from an expropriation. La. Const, art.

Guth claims that the expropriation was \u2018\u2018premature\u201d' but fails to provide any facts to support this conclusory allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b554-9\">. Those legal arguments were included in a memorandum attached to the original complaint. <em>See Wilson v. Birnberg, </em>667 F.3d 591, 595 (5th Cir.2012) (\"A court\u2019s analysis generally should focus exclusively on what appears in the complaint and its proper attachments.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b555-4\">. Those invoices, originally attached to Guth's opposition to Roedel Parsons's motion to dismiss, were expressly incorporated by reference in Guth\u2019s amended complaint as proof that Roedel Parsons was submitting bills to the government. <em>See Brand Coupon Network, L.L.C. v. Catalina Mktg. Corp., </em>748 F.3d 631, 635 (5th Cir.2014) (\u201cThe court may also consider documents attached to either a motion to dismiss or an opposition to that motion when the documents are referred to in the pleadings and are central to a plaintiff's claims.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. In his amended complaint, Guth alleges that Roedel Parsons attorneys conspired by generating false billings for \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable and duplicative work\u201d based \"on information and belief from the practice of law for over 30 years, and from 4 years [of] experience working against Roedel Parsons on this case.\u201d However, \"even where allegations are based on information and belief, the complaint must set forth a factual basis for such belief.\u201d <em>United States ex rel.
