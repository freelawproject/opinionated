On appeal, Vissers argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(3)(A) for fraudulent use of a United States passport. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1305 (11th Cir.2009). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s application of the relevant conduct guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 to the facts of a case. <em>United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir.2008). Review for clear error is deferential, and we will not disturb the district court\u2019s finding unless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010). If a defendant fails to object to an alleged violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure at sentencing, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007). To show plain error, a defendant must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). If the defendant satisfies the three conditions, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, we \u201cmay decline to address an argument where a party fails to provide arguments on the merits of an issue\u201d in his appeal brief. <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Where a defendant is convicted for making a false statement in an application for a United States passport, a four-level sentencing enhancement may apply where \u201cthe defendant fraudulently obtained or used ... a United States passport.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(3)(A). In determining whether this enhancement applies, the district court may consider relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.2(b), 1B1.3. Relevant conduct is defined as \u201call acts and omissions committed ... by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires a district court to rule on \u201cany disputed portion of the presen-tence report or other controverted matter,\u201d or _ to \u201cdetermine that a ruling is unnecessary.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). However, we\u2019ve previously held that \u201ca sentencing court\u2019s failure to make individualized findings regarding the scope of the defendant\u2019s activity is not grounds for vacating a sentence if the record supports] the court\u2019s determination with respect to the offense conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>685 F.3d 1237, 1253 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation omitted). We\u2019ve also rejected the argument that a district court failed to make explicit findings of fact where the court \u201cdid not depart fi\u2019om the guidelines range and clearly resolved all disputed factual issues in favor of the [pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">In this case, the district court did not clearly err in applying a four-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(3)(A) for Vissers\u2019s fraudulent use of a United States passport. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>starters, the record supports the finding that Vissers used L.W.C.\u2019s passport to avoid detection for his charged offenses, which involve Vissers\u2019s use of G.S.S.\u2019s information without authority. According to the PSI, Vissers obtained L.W.C.\u2019s passport after the two victims, L.W.C. and G.S.S., responded to Vissers\u2019s posts on Craigslist about job opportunities. When each victim met with Vissers, they brought their identification documents. Vissers made copies of G.S.S.\u2019s birth certificate and social security card, and later used this information to apply for a United States passport. Vissers also took L.W.C.\u2019s passport, claiming he needed it as part of L.W.C.\u2019s application because the job required travel. On August 20, 2013, Vissers was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Florida for making a false statement in a United States passport application and for aggravated identity theft, based on his use of G.S.S.\u2019s information, \u25a0 On August 29, 2013, Vissers was detained in Mexico after he produced L.W.C.\u2019s passport and identified himself as L.W.C. to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In the PSI Addendum, the probation officer noted that it was reasonable to conclude that Vissers presented L.W.C.\u2019s passport in Mexico to evade detection by law enforcement. After hearing testimony from both the government and defense, the court explicitly adopted the findings of the PSI. We can discern no clear error in finding that Vissers used L.W.C.\u2019s passport to avoid detection by law enforcement for the offenses based on his use of G.S.S.\u2019s information. Moreover, because relevant conduct under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) is defined as conduct that occurs \u201cin the course of attempting to avoid detection\u201d for the charged offense, Vissers\u2019s use of L.W.C.\u2019s passport constituted relevant conduct for the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">As for his claim \u2014 raised for the first time on appeal \u2014 that the district court plainly erred in resolving the factual dispute about whether Vissers actually fraudulently used L.W.C.\u2019s passport, we are unpersuaded. For starters, the district court explicitly adopted the factual findings of the PSI after hearing testimony on the disputed issue. Because the district court resolved this disputed issue in favor of the PSI, it made sufficient findings of fact, <em>See Daniels, </em>685 F.3d at 1253. Moreover, the record reveals that an agent with the U.S. State Department testified that Mexican immigration officials informed the State Department that the defendant had presented the L.W.C. passport to Mexican immigration officials. There is no error, much less plain error, in the district court\u2019s finding of those facts, or that Vis-sers \u201cused\u201d the passport. Accordingly, the court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(3)(A) to Vissers\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
