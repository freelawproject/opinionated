For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Alaniz owns four rental properties at 1519, 1520, and 1526 Orlando Street, and 1614 Phoenix Street, in Edinburg, Texas. Each property contains four apartment units. Alaniz purchased two successive commercial property insurance policies for the properties from Sirius, with the policy periods extending from July 6, 2011, to July 6, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">On March 29, 2012, there was a substantial hailstorm in the area of the properties. Alaniz was aware of the storm and its severity as well as reports that it caused damage to vehicles. He did not notice any hail damage, inspect the properties for hail damage, or have them inspected by a professional.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">In the summer of 2013, a tenant notified Alaniz of a leaking and wet ceiling in one of the units at the 1519 Orlando Street property. Alaniz attempted to repair the ceiling by applying spackling. He inspected the roof himself but did not notice any visible damage. A week later, the tenant reported that the repair had failed, so Alaniz reapplied spackling. Shortly thereafter, a tenant in a different unit at the 1519 Orlando Street property reported the same problem, and Alaniz attempted to repair it in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">A few weeks later, an owner of a neighboring property suggested to Alaniz that the leaks and water damage might be attributed to hail damage from the March 2012 hailstorm. The neighbor told Alaniz that he had similar damage and did not initially realize it was from the hailstorm until he contacted an attorney and had the property inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">A few months after this conversation, Alaniz visited with an attorney regarding the damage to the' property. Alaniz signed a representation agreement with that attorney on September 5, 2013. A little over five months later, on February 14, 2014, Alaniz faxed notice of hail damage and an insurance claim to Sirius regarding each of his four properties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alan-iz had the roofs of the properties inspected by a professional on February 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">After failing to receive a response from Sirius, on March 27, 2014, Alaniz filed suit against Sirius in Texas state court. He alleged claims of breach of contract, breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the Texas Insurance Code and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\u201cDTPA\u201d). Sirius removed the case to federal court oh diversity jurisdiction grounds and thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment arguing, among other things, that Alaniz could not recover under the insurance policy because he did not satisfy its requirement of providing \u201cprompt notice of the loss or damage.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Sirius, dismissing all of Alaniz\u2019s claims. Alaniz timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, construing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Hernandez v. Velasquez, </em>522 F.3d 556, 560 (5th Cir.2008). We may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record and presented to the district court. <em>See id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Likewise, the interpretation of an insurance contract is reviewed de novo. <em>See Admiral Ins. Co. v. Ford, </em>607 F.3d 420, 422 (5th Cir.2010). Because this is a diversity case involving a Texas insurance contract, Texas insurance law and rules of contract interpretation apply. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The primary basis on which the district court dismissed Alaniz\u2019s breach of contract claim was that Alaniz\u2019s failure to comply with the prompt-notice provision in the insurance contract precluded recovery under the policy. The policy required that Alaniz provide \u201cprompt notice of the loss or damage\u201d and, \u201c[a]s soon as possible,\u201d provide a \u201cdescription of how, when and where the loss or damage occurred.\u201d An insurer has a right to demand notice as a condition to liability under the policy. <em>See Dairyland Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Roman, </em>498 S.W.2d 154,157 (Tex.1973) (\u201c[A] provision ... requiring that notice of the accident be given the insurer as soon as practicable is a condition precedent to liability. In the absence of waiver or other special circumstances, failure to perform the condition constitutes an absolute defense to liability on the policy.\u201d); <em>Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Modern Exploration, Inc., </em>757 S.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex.App.\u2014Dallas 1988, no writ); 21 William V. Doksaneo III, Texas Litigation Guide \u00a7 343.03 (2015). However, as we discuss more fully below, Texas law has qualified this right in various contexts by requiring the insurer to prove that the lack of notice prejudiced it. <em>See generally PAJ, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>243 S.W.3d 630, 634-37 (Tex.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Where, as here, the policy does not define the phrases \u201cprompt notice\u201d and \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d Texas courts \u201cconstrue the [phrases] as meaning that notice must be given <em>within a reasonable time </em>after the occurrence\u201d <em>Ridglea Estate Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>415 F.3d 474, 479 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stonewall, </em>757 S.W.2d at 435, and adding emphasis); <em>see also Cont\u2019l Sav. Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>762 F.2d 1239, 1243 (5th Cir.1985). \u201cWhat constitutes a reasonable amount of time depends on the facts and circumstances in each particular case.\u201d <em>Stonewall, </em>757 S.W.2d at 435. \u201cWhile generally a question of fact, reasonableness becomes a question of law if the facts are undisputed.\u201d <em>Cont\u2019l Sav., </em>762 F.2d at 1243; <em>see also Klein v. Century Lloyds, </em>154 Tex. 160, 275 S.W.2d 95, 97 (1955). As the district court recognized, in the present case, this issue may be determined as a matter of law because the relevant facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The parties dispute whether the reasonableness analysis should focus on the entire time since the hailstorm or only the period following when Alaniz\u2019s awareness of facts suggested hail damage. As did the district court, we find it unnecessary to determine the exact time period for considering the reasonableness of the notice given because, even employing Alaniz\u2019s preferred characterization, Alaniz\u2019s delay in providing notice to Sirius did not satisfy the policy\u2019s prompt-notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Alaniz, he provided notice to Sirius on February 14, 2014. Alaniz was aware of the March 2012 hailstorm, its severity, and damage that it caused in general, but, according to him, he did not initially realize it caused damage to his properties. In the summer of 2013, Alaniz was notified by tenants of wet ceilings and leaks in two separate units of the same apartment complex. He attempted interi- or repairs on the ceiling, which were initially unsuccessful. A few weeks later, an owner of a neighboring property suggested that the leaks and water damage might be attributed to hail damage from the March 2012 hailstorm. The neighbor told Alaniz that his neighboring property had similar damage, which was caused by the hailstorm, but that he did not initially realize that he had hail damage from the storm. At this point (some time in the summer of 2013), Alaniz was aware of facts necessary to conclude that he should notify his insurer of the damages to his properties or have the properties inspected by a professional for hail damage. <em>See Ridglea, </em>415 F.3d at 477 (concluding that, given the magnitude of a hailstorm as well as hail- damage to other portions of a plaintiffs property, the plaintiff \u201cshould have been aware of the likelihood that its roofs had suffered hail damage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">Nevertheless, it was not until a few months after this conversation that Alaniz took any action. He contacted an attorney regarding the damage to his property and a representation agreement was signed with that attorney on September 5, 2013. Alaniz\u2019s actions thus confirm that he was aware of damage to his properties that he believed required professional attention. At that time, the hailstorm had occurred more than 17 months earlier, but Alaniz still did not provide notice to Sirius of the damage to his properties. Instead, he delayed five and a half additional months before providing notice to Sirius.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Other courts have found similar and even briefer periods of delay in providing notice to be unreasonable as a matter of Texas law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, if the delay occurs without explanation, it is appropriate to conclude that prompt notice was not given as a matter of law. <em>See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Bourn, </em>441 S.W.2d 592, 595 (Tex.Civ.App-Fort Worth 1969, writ ref\u2019d., n.r.e) (\u201c[A]n inexcused delay or delay because of a flimsy excuse entitles the insurance company to judgment as a matter of law since delays of that type violate the \u2018soon as practicable\u2019 provision of the policy and notice is deemed as not having been given within a reasonable time.\u201d); <em>Nat\u2019l Surety Corp. v. Diggs, </em>272 S.W.2d 604, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>607-08 (Tex.Civ.App.1954, writ ref d, n.r.e). Here, Alaniz provides no explanation for his delay in providing notice, and the evidence demonstrates he did not use this period to have the properties inspected, as that did not occur until after he provided notice to Sirius. Accordingly, in light of the undisputed \u201cfacts and circumstances in [this] particular case,\u201d we conclude that Alaniz did not satisfy the policy\u2019s requirement that he provide prompt notice of the hail damage. <em>Stonewall, </em>757 S.W.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">However, this conclusion does not end the inquiry, because it is also necessary to address whether Alaniz\u2019s violation of the policy\u2019s prompt notice provision prejudiced Sirius. <em>See Ridglea, </em>415 F.3d at 480.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prejudice requirement is grounded in \u201cthe principle that one party is excused from performing under a contract only if the other party commits a material breach.\u201d <em>Greene v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>446 S.W.3d 761, 767 (Tex.2014). Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen an insurer must prove it was prejudiced by the insured\u2019s failure to comply with the notice provisions, the recognized purposes of the notice requirements form the boundaries of the insurer\u2019s argument that it was prejudiced; a showing of prejudice generally requires a showing that one of the recognized purposes has been impaired.\u201d <em>Berkley Reg\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., </em>690 F.3d 342, 347 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Blanton v. Vesta Lloyds Ins. Co., </em>185 S.W.3d 607, 612 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, no pet.)). The primary purpose of a prompt notice and proof of loss provision in a policy such as this one is to allow the insurer to investigate the incident close in time to the occurrence, while the evidence is fresh, and so that it may accurately determine its rights and liabilities under the policy (and take appropriate remedial action). <em>See Stonewall, </em>757 S.W.2d at 435; <em>see also Blanton, </em>185 S.W.3d at 615; 46 Tex. Jur. 3d Insurance Contracts and Coverage \u00a7 869 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Sirius argues that Alaniz\u2019s delay in providing notice prejudiced it by depriving it of the ability to promptly investigate damage to the properties at a time when the evidence of any hail damage would be less likely to be altered by time and continuing deterioration of the property and to provide for the repair of any such damage before further deterioration occurred. Sirius states that because the roofs were not timely fixed, the intrusion of water that purportedly caused damage to the interiors of the properties has been allowed to continue, thus causing further damage. Indeed, Sirius states that Alaniz now alleges that all sixteen apartment units have extensive property damage from water intrusion. Sirius also points out that during the period of delay, Alaniz did nothing to mitigate further deterioration of the properties by fixing the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ported hail damage, but instead patched over water damage to the interior ceilings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Significantly, Alaniz has completely failed to mention, much less contest, Sirius\u2019s facts or arguments on prejudice either in the district court or on appeal. Accordingly, Alaniz has not raised a dispute of material fact on the issue of prejudice. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Alaniz, we conclude that Sirius has proven as a matter of law that Alaniz\u2019s delay in providing notice prejudiced its ability \u201cto promptly investigate the circumstances of the accident while the matter is fresh\u201d and \u201cto enable it to form an intelligent estimate of its rights and liabilities under the policy.\u201d <em>Stonewall, </em>757 S.W.2d at 435. Further, it is evident that there has been continued deterioration of the properties due to water damage that could have been at least partially avoided by prompt action on Alaniz\u2019s part. Alaniz estimates the damage at upwards of $650,000. This continued deterioration of the property prejudices Sirius\u2019s ability to investigate to what extent any damage to the properties might be attributable to the March 2012 hailstorm and exacerbates the cost of any repairs. <em>See, e.g., Hamilton Props. v. Am. Ins. Co., </em>No. 3:12-CV-5046-B, 2014 WL 3055801, at *9-10, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91882, at *32-33 (ND.Tex. July 7, 2014) (finding prejudice caused by delay in providing notice of purported hail damage under a property insurance policy), <em>appeal filed, </em>No. 15-10382 (5th Cir.). Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Sirius on Alaniz\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Alaniz also asserted extra-contractual claims pursuant to common law and the Texas Insurance Code. These claims fail because such claims generally cannot be maintained when the breach of contract claim they arise out of fails. <em>See JAW The Pointe, L.L.C. v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>460 S.W.3d 597, 602 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (Tex.2015) (citing, <em>inter alia, Republic Ins. Co. v. Stoker, </em>903 S.W.2d 338, 341 (Tex.1995)); <em>State Farm Lloyds v. Page, </em>315 S.W.3d 525, 532 (Tex.2010) (citing <em>Progressive Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Boyd, </em>177 S.W.3d 919, 922 (Tex.2005)). \u201cAlthough [the Texas Supreme Court has] left open the possibility that an insurer\u2019s denial of a claim it was not obliged to pay might nevertheless be in bad faith if its conduct was extreme and produced damages unrelated to and independent of the policy claim,\u201d Alaniz did not put forth evidence of such extreme conduct or of damages suffered independent of those that would have resulted from an alleged wrongful denial of his claim. <em>JAW, </em>460 S.W.3d at 602 (quoting <em>Boyd, </em>177 S.W.3d at 922); <em>see also Great Am. Ins. Co. v. AFS/IBEX Fin. Servs., </em>612 F.3d 800, 808 n. 1 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Provident Am. Ins. Co. v. Castaneda, </em>988 S.W.2d 189, 198 (Tex.1999). In like manner, Alaniz\u2019s claims pursuant to the DTPA fail since they are predicated on the same standards as his common law bad faith claims and those asserted under the Texas Insurance Code. <em>See Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Doubletree Partners, L.P., </em>739 F.3d 848, 870 (5th Cir.2014) (explaining that claims under DTPA and the Texas Insurance Code fail if the bad faith cause of action fails where they require the same predicate for recovery (quoting <em>Higginbotham v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>103 F.3d 456, 460 (5th Cir.1997))); <em>Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v.

There is a dispute as to whether Alaniz actually sent notice to Sirius, However, given the summary-judgment context of this case, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to Alaniz and assume he sent the faxed notice.; <em>See Hernandez v.

Since that time no authoritative decision of the Texas Supreme Court has called <em>Ridglea\u2019s </em>reasoning into question in this context.
