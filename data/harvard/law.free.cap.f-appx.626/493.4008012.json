We DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">In November 2011, the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure (the \u201cMedical Board\u201d) instituted disciplinary proceedings against petitioner Dr. Michael White. The Medical Board acted after a DEA investigation exposed misconduct related to White\u2019s medical weight-loss practice. Evidence from the investigation revealed, among other things, that White prescribed phentermine, a schedule IV controlled substance, to multiple patients without performing a thorough physical examination, documenting properly their medical history, and verifying that they had made efforts to lose weight without the aid of controlled substances. Several of the patients were not obese or overweight when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>White authorized use of phentermine; some gained weight during treatment, but White never discontinued their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Medical Board decided that White failed to comply with its rules and regulations as well as applicable state statutes governing the prescription and dispensing of the medication. It imposed a stayed six-month suspension of \u201cWhite\u2019s medical license in January 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, the Medical Board permanently barred him from practicing or prescribing controlled substances in the area of weight loss. The Medical Board also required White to attend continuing medical education courses. He failed to timely complete the courses, which prompted a second hearing before the Medical Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In March 2012, following the Medical Board\u2019s decision, White voluntarily surrendered his DEA certificate of registration. Several days later, he applied for a new certificate. The DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator issued an order to show cause why White\u2019s application should not be denied because registration would be inconsistent with the public interest under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 823(f) and 824(a)(4). White was granted a hearing. The DEA called three witnesses including an investigator who participated in the investigation of White\u2019s practice, the executive director of the Medical Board, and a medical expert in weight loss and bariatrics. White also testified. Documents were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found, among other deficiencies, that White failed to conduct an examination or document the medical history of the patients to whom he prescribed phentermine. Thus, he had not established a <em>bona fide </em>doctor-patient relationship with them, and had thereby violated multiple statutes and regulations. The ALJ also said that White failed to submit mitigating evidence showing he could be trusted with a new certificate. Although at the hearing White admitted he engaged in some misconduct, the ALJ found he denied that his underlying actions were improper, blamed subordinates, criticized applicable laws and regulations, was angry at the Medical Board for disciplining him, and attributed the initial investigation to being unfairly targeted by the DEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">In the final agency decision on White\u2019s application, the DEA Deputy Administrator adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation, explaining that there was \u201cmore than ample evidence to support the conclusion that [White] poses a potential danger to the public.\u201d White petitions for review of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">In reviewing the denial of an application, deference is given to the Deputy Administrator\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>See Noell v. Bensinger, </em>586 F.2d 554, 558 (5th Cir.1978). An agency decision will only be set aside if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an \u00e1buse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.\u201d <em>See Williams v. Admin. Review Bd., </em>376 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Factual findings are sustained if they are supported by substantial evidence, which is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">The Controlled Substances Act created a \u201cregulatory system making it unlawful to ... dispense ... any controlled substance\u201d unless authorized by the statute. <em>Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>zales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 13, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). Persons in the lawful distribution chain must be registered with the DEA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823. In carrying out its responsibilities related to registration, the DEA Deputy Administrator may deny a practitioner\u2019s application for a certificate if issuing it would be inconsistent with the public interest. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 824(a)(4). Five factors have bearing on this determination: (1) the recommendation of a state licensing board; (2) \u201c[t]he applicant\u2019s experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances\u201d; (3) the applicant\u2019s criminal history related to controlled substances; (4) the applicant\u2019s compliance with state, federal, and local laws related to controlled substances; and (5) \u201cother conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 823(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Where the government has established a <em>prima facie </em>case that the public interest would be harmed in issuing a certificate, the DEA requires an applicant to submit \u201cmitigating evidence to assure the Administrator that [he] can be entrusted with the responsibilities]\u201d that accompany registration. <em>See Med. Shoppe</em>\u2014Jonesborough, 73 Fed.Reg. 364, 387 (Drug Enft Admin. Jan. 2, 2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Such evidence includes acceptance of responsibility and a demonstration that the applicant \u201cwill not engage in future misconduct.\u201d <em>Id.; see also, e.g., Hoxie v. Drug Enf\u2019t Admin., </em>419 F.3d 477, 482-83 (6th Cir.2005); <em>MacKay v. Drug Enf\u2019t Admin., </em>664 F.3d 808, 820-21 (10th Cir.2011) (finding that an applicant\u2019s self-reproach may indicate whether he will transgress again, a \u201cconsideration ... vital to whether ... registration is in the public interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">White\u2019s only argument now is that the Deputy Administrator erred in determining that White failed to accept responsibility for his actions. White asserts that his decision to end his weight-loss practice prior to the Medical Board\u2019s ruling, voluntary surrender of his DEA certificate, admitting he made \u201cmistakes\u201d in his practice, and accepting professional discipline demonstrates he acknowledges and regrets his misconduct. White argues his failure to \u201cgive a lachrymose true confession[ ] or lie prostrate\u201d during the hearing on the show cause order, and his displeasure about the Medical Board proceedings and at being allegedly singled out by the DEA, does not undermine the sincerity of his promise to avoid future missteps. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">As an initial matter, the government has established a <em>prima facie </em>case. Consistent with the purposes of the Controlled Substances Act, the DEA requires that prescriptions be issued for \u201clegitimate medical purpose[s] by a[ ] ... practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04(a). Here, the DEA investigation, the disciplinary action rendered by the Medical Board, the medical expert who testified at the hearing on the show cause order, and even some of White\u2019s testimony at the hearing, indicate that White repeatedly prescribed phentermine to individuals with whom he did not have a <em>bona fide </em>doctor-patient relationship, who were not obese, and who had not demonstrated an attempt to lose weight without the aid of controlled substances. Thus,- there is substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that White\u2019s experience in dispensing controlled substances and his history of compliance with applicable laws, the second and fourth statutory \u201cpublic interest\u201d factors, weigh against granting a new certificate of registration. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">As for mitigating evidence, during the healing on the show cause order, White testified that he voluntarily quit his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>weight loss practice and now realizes that phentermine is \u201cdangerousf.]\u201d Even when White was apologetic, however, he often equivocated and deflected blame. For example, White minimized his prescription of \u201cdiet pill[s]\u201d as compared to other weight loss solutions like plastic surgery, emphasized that none of his patients have suffered injuries as a result of his actions, denied prescribing phentermine without \u201cmedical justification,\u201d and indicated that the nurse practitioners with whom he worked were responsible for the subpar physical examinations and medical history documentation. He also testified that the DEA unfairly targeted him even though his practice was in line with other physicians\u2019 practices. In weighing whether White adequately demonstrated acceptance of responsibility, the Deputy Administrator properly considered all of this evidence. There is substantial support for the determination that White fell short in showing that he could be trusted with a new certificate. The agency\u2019s decision was not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
