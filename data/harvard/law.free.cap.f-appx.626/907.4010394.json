After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Mr. Jean-Louis was convicted of conspiracy. to possess 50 grams or more of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. At his sentencing hearing in November of 2009, the district court used the 2008 Sentencing Guidelines Manual to determine that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 base offense level was 32. The district court applied a 2-level obstruction of justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1, which gave Mr. Jean-Louis a total offense level of 34. With a criminal history category of I, Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 advisory guideline range was 151-188 months. The district court varied downward from that range, imposing the statutory minimum sentence of 10 years, or 120 months. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">Mr. Jean-Louis recently moved the district court to reduce his sentence under Amendment 782, which he argued reduced his base offense level by 2 levels. The district court denied his motion because Amendment 782 did not authorize it to reduce his sentence below the 120-month statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">On appeal, Mr. Jean-Louis argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to reduce his sentence. He contends that he is entitled to a reduction in light of the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines, the Department of Justice\u2019s changed policy with regard to sentencing crack cocaine offenses, the fact that he is not an American citizen and will be deported after serving his sentence, and his good behavior while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding ... its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number><em>States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A district court may reduce the prison sentence of \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ....\u201d\u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l) (\u201cReduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range (Policy Statement)\u201d). A district court\u2019s ability to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is narrow. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">To be eligible for a reduction, \u201c[t]he Sentencing Commission must have amended the Sentencing Guidelines, ... that guidelines amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range,\u201d and the amendment must also have been made retroactively applicable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2), (d), and cmt. n.1(A). The district court is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range unless the defendant\u2019s original sentence was below the guideline range because of a substantial assistance motion filed by the government. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B). Similarly, if the district court lacked the authority to impose a sentence below a mandatory minimum at the defendant\u2019s original sentencing proceeding because the government did not file a substantial assistance motion, it cannot reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence below the mandatory minimum in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c[A] reduction [under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] is not authorized if the [retroactively applicable guideline] amendment does not actually lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision, such as a statutory mandatory minimum prison term.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Amendment 782, which became effective in November of 2014, provides a two-level reduction in the base offense level for most drug quantities listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend, 782. Amendment 782 has been made retroactively applicable under \u00a7 lB1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Here, the district court did not err in determining that Mr. Jean-Louis was ineligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782. Mr. Jean-Louis is correct that Amendment 782 lowered his base offense level from 32 to 30, and his guideline range from 151-188 months to 121-151 months. But when the district court originally imposed Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 sentence in November of 2009, it varied downward from the then-applicable guideline range of 151-188 months, imposing a sentence of only 120 months, which was the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The district court did not lower Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 sentence due to a substantial assistance motion filed by the government. And the government has not filed a motion on Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 behalf authorizing the court now to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum. Thus, under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782, the district court was not authorized to reduce Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 sentence below the 120-month mandatory minimum it originally imposed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) \u2014 (B), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Jean-Louis\u2019 motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c) and Amendment 782 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
