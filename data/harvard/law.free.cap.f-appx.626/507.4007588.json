JONES, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">This appeal challenges the district court\u2019s order dismissing appellant\u2019s counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The dismissal order accompanied an order remanding this case to state court for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons explained below, this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">In the fall of 2013, Appellee Underwood Cotton Company, Inc. (\u201cUnderwood\u201d) contracted with Texas Gulf Coast Logistics (\u201cTGCL\u201d) to unload cotton that Underwood had shipped to TGCL\u2019s facility in Houston, then load that cotton into shipping containers, and deliver those containers to the Port of Houston. In response to a series of unforeseen events, TGCL contracted with Appellant Clark Freight Lines, Inc. (\u201cClark\u201d) to complete the delivery of the shipping containers to the port. Based on these deliveries, Clark made a demand and subsequently invoiced Underwood for over $43,000 in shipping services.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Underwood filed suit in the 99th District Court in Lubbock County, Texas seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not liable to Clark for those shipping charges. On June 19, 2014, Clark removed the declaratory judgment action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. In Clark\u2019s Notice of Removal, it asserted the federal district court had federal question jurisdiction based on (1) \u201cthe federal common law which governs and controls Underwood\u2019s liability\u201d, (2) \u201cthe whole preemption of the field of interstate commerce and of marine commerce\u201d, and (3) \u201cthe marine character of the transit and based upon the absence of any concurrent Texas common law remedy available to or saved to Underwood as a suitor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Ten days later, Clark filed an answer to Underwood\u2019s complaint and asserted a counterclaim seeking payment of the shipping charges. Clark \u201cassert[ed] that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>counterclaim and Underwood\u2019s declaratory-judgment action may only proceed in federal district court.\u201d Clark\u2019s answer and counterclaim based federal jurisdiction on (1) \u201cthe federal common law [which] governs and controls the rights and obligations of both CFL and Underwood\u201d due to the movement of the cotton (2) \u201cas part of an interstate ... transit of goods and as part of a marine transportation of goods.\u201d \u201cIn this regard,\u201d Clark contended, (3) \u201cthe federal common law preempts any Texas law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In a single opinion and order, the district court dismissed the counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remanded the case to state court. The court described the counterclaim as a \u201cconverse breach of contract action to Underwood\u2019s declaratory judgment action\u201d and ruled that Clark had \u201cnot proved that there is federal jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action and the counterclaims involved in this case.\u201d After its motion for reconsideration was denied, Clark timely appealed the dismissal of its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">This Court has jurisdiction to determine whether its own appellate jurisdiction exists. <em>Fontenot v. Watson Pharms., Inc., </em>718 F.3d 518, 520 (5th Cir.2013). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that statute, there is no appellate review of remand orders premised on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Arnold v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>277 F.3d 772, 775 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.2001). This court, however, \u201cmay review any aspect of a judgment that is distinct and separable from the remand proper.\u201d <em>Regan v. Starcraft Marine, LLC, </em>524 F.3d 627, 631 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Genina Marine Servs., Inc., </em>136 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.1998)). In this appeal, Clark noted carefully that it was not appealing the remand order itself, but only the dismissal of its counterclaim for lack of jurisdiction. Thus, the primary issue before this Court is whether the dismissal of Clark\u2019s counterclaim is \u201cdistinct and separable\u201d from the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">An order is \u201cdistinct and separable\u201d if it precedes the remand order \u201cin logic and in fact\u201d and is \u201cconclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An order precedes a remand \u201cin logic and in fact\u201d when the prior order is what deprives the court of subject-matter jurisdiction and necessitates the remand. <em>See, e.g., Heaton v. Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga., </em>297 F.3d 416, 421 (5th Cir.2002) (finding an order preceded the remand in logic and in fact when the remand decision was \u201cnecessarily predicated\u201d on the order). An order is conclusive when \u201cit will have a preclu-sive effect in the state-court litigation and will not be subject to review there.\u201d <em>Regan, </em>524 F.3d at 631 (quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>136 F.3d at 394). A separate order \u201cdoes not just determine the forum in which a claim will be heard. It ... determines whether there is any claim to be heard in any forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Both parties rely on <em>Regan v. Starcraft Marine, LLC </em>to support their positions on appellate jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 627. In <em>Regan, </em>the plaintiff sued several private defendants in state court over a boating accident that occurred at a military facility. <em>Id. </em>at 630. One of the private defendants filed a third-party complaint against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) and the government removed the ease to federal court. <em>Id. </em>The district court dismissed the complaint against the government under the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, \u201cwhich bars tort suits against the United States by or on behalf of service members whose injuries arise out of activity incident to their military service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The district court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>remanded the case back to state court. This court held that it had jurisdiction to consider the order dismissing the United States from the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 633. In particular, this court found the dismissal order to be conclusive because, unless there was review, \u201cthere [would be] no claim to be heard anywhere against the United States on these facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The differences between <em>Regan </em>and this case demonstrate why there is no appellate jurisdiction here. In <em>Regan, </em>the dismissal of the United States preceded the remand in logic and in fact because as long as the government remained in the lawsuit, there was federal jurisdiction. Dismissing the government from the lawsuit allowed the district court to subsequently remand the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, the dismissal order was conclusive because the United States could not be made a third-party defendant to an FTCA suit in state court. <em>See </em>14 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 3658 (2013) (\u201cThe district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over actions under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\u201d). In <em>Regan, </em>dismissing the government and remanding the case meant that the United States would completely escape its potential liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In this case, however, the dismissal of the counterclaims did not precede the remand in logic and fact. Dismissing the counterclaims did not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction; the district court ruled it never had jurisdiction to begin with. As demonstrated above and as the district court found, the counterclaims were a mirror image of the declaratory judgment action. The district court\u2019s determination that the counterclaims lacked jurisdiction wa|S a simultaneous recognition that the declaratory judgment action lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Nor is the dismissal of the counterclaims conclusive or, at the very least, any more conclusive than the remand order itself. In finding that there was no federal jurisdiction over the counterclaims and the declaratory judgment action, the district court was merely determining in which forum the claims could be heard. Clark will be able to raise its counterclaims in state court. Clark argues that the state court will likely give \u201cissue-conclusive weight\u201d to the district court\u2019s determination that there is no maritime commerce involved in this action. There are two responses to this contention. First, this circuit\u2019s precedent establishes that jurisdictional determinations are not conclusive for purposes of appellate jurisdiction over remand orders. <em>See Dahiya v. Talmidge Int\u2019l Ltd., </em>371 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Doleac ex rel. Doleac v. Michalson, </em>264 F.3d 470, 486 (5th Cir.2001)). Second, the jurisdictional determination regarding the counterclaims in this case is no more conclusive than the jurisdictional determination regarding the remand order. Where Congress specifically excluded the latter from appellate jurisdiction, allowing the counterclaim dismissal to be reviewed would be an end-run around this explicit statutory limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">This result is supported by <em>Dahiya v. Talmidge International, Ltd. </em>371 F.3d at 207. In <em>Dahiya, </em>the defendants removed a case under a statute allowing removal of certain actions subject to foreign arbitration agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 208. The district court concluded that there was no valid arbitration agreement, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, and remanded the dispute to state court. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, this court refused to review the denial of the motion to compel and dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 209-10. This court stated that the district court\u2019s ruling that the arbitration agreement was invalid was jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>and could be \u201crevisited by a state court upon remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. As such, it was not conclusive and could not be reviewed independently of the remand order. <em>Id. </em>A contrary rule, this court recognized, \u201cwould circumvent \u00a7 1447(d) by affording review of remand orders issued in nearly every case removed\u201d under the arbitration removal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The same is true in this case. Clark will have ample opportunity to be heard on all its counterclaims in state court. A review of the dismissal of those counterclaims by this court would operate as a review of the district court\u2019s remand order. Because the remand was for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, appellate review is prohibited by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">For the foregoing reasons, this case is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
