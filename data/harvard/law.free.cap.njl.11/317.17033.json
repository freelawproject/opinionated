Appr. March 27,1874, sec. 217, <em>(Rev. Stat. </em>pape 642), directing all notices to be served upon the attorney when party appears by attorney, unless otherwise specially provided for.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">The Court of Common Pleas refused to receive in evidence a deposition of a witness about to go out of the state, taken, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>on the part of the plaintiff, under the 5th section of the act, <em>(Rev. Raws </em>438) because the notice of taking the deposition was served, not on the defendant, but on his attorney, neither of whom attended *the examination of the witness. [*318 The rejection, of this deposition is shewn by a bill of exceptions, and is assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The act requires the notice to be given to \u201c the adverse party.\u201d A notice to the attorney is, therefore, in my opinion, insufficient,</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">1st. Because of the natural import of the words \u201c the adverse party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">2d. Because in the same act, the term <em>\u201c </em>party,\u201d is used with manifest reference to the principal, and not the attorney. Thus, in the first section, interrogatories are to be signed by \u201c the parties or their counsel in the cause.\u201d In the second section, the commissioner is authorized to deliver the commission and examination \u201c to the agent or attorney of the party in whose behalf the witness is examined.\u201d In the seventh section, \u201c either party in the said action or suit may at his or her costs and charges, take copies.\u201d And in the tenth section, \u201c the party requiring such examination shall be at the sole expense thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">3d. Because in various other places a distinction is maintained between the party and the attorney. Thus, in the practice act, sections 30, 31, 32, 54, 55, 56, the terms are, \u201c the plaintiff or his attorney,\u201d and \u201c the defendant or his attorneyand in section 56, <em>\u201c </em>the party, whether plaintiff or defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">4th. Because the term \u201c the adverse party,\u201d in the previous act for taking the depositions of witnesses, had been settled to require a service on the principal, and not on the attorney. <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Taylor, Coxe </em>445.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">5th. Because the convenience of suitors will be best promoted by service of the notice on the party, rather than the attorney. And if some inconvenience, by requiring such .service, may be found where the party resides out of the state, the wisdom of the legislature may readily remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Upon the whole, I am of opinion the Court of Common Pleas gave a sound construction to the act, and properly rejected the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
