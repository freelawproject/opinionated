Elmer,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asx\">contra, contended that interest should be calculated at the rate of six per cent, from the date of the judgment ; and said that the practice of the Court of Chancery in casting interest upon a bond which bore date prior to the fourth of July, 1824, is to compute interest at seven per cent, up to the date of the master\u2019s report, and from that time at six per cent.; and this practice proceeded upon the principle that the bond was extinguished by the decree.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-9\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Wo are of opinion that the calculation should be made at six and not seven per cent, from the date of the judgment. Whenever a new principal is formed of a date subsequent to the fourth of July, 1824, the interest. must be computed at six per cent. When a judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>obtained, in England on . a foreign contract, the foreign interest is calculated up to the time of the judgment, and after that the English, if any, interest is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">PT. B. The court did not intend to sanction the mode here adopted, of making a new or compound <em>principal\u25a0; </em>nor to deny seven per cent., if the calculation had been made on the original principal only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
