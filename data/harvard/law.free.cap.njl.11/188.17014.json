In <em>Sutphin </em>v. <em>Hardenbergh, </em>5 <em>Halst. </em>288, we held that an appeal was rightly dismissed, because an alteration, not noted, appeared to have been made in a material part of the appeal bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Whether this case was in point of fact, within that principle ; whether an alteration did appear to have been made, wore questions of fact for the Court of Common Pleas to decide, upon inspection; and even if we are bound to review their decision, there seems, upon examining the bond which has been exhibited to us, no possibility of doubt that an alteration has at some time been made; at what time we need not and do not intimate an opinion. All difficulty in this case, as seems to us, might have been obviated, if the subscribing witness to the bond, who was the counsel of the appellant, and present when the motion to dismiss was made, had then subjoined to the attestation a note that the alteration was made before the execution of the bond; which we doubt not would have been permitted by the Court of Common Pleas; or if refused, would have afforded a just foundation for redress here. No't having been done, we are of opinion the appeal was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Application for mandamus overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
