Williamson, the plaintiff below, moved for a rule \u201c that the plaintiff in certiorari file security, and that the proceedings in this court be stayed in the mean time.\u201d And in support of his motion he read an *316] affidavit stating *that the plaintiff in certiorari admitted that he was unable to pay the costs if the judgment .was affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">We are all of opinion that we cannot grant this application.

But what is the case here ? Simply, that the plaintiff is poor and unable to pay the costs. Where shall we find ourselves if this rule is established. The next case may be an action of debt; the same application may be made; and there is no material difference in the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Motion denied.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Note. \u2014 Sinco this certiorari was brought, the legislature have passed an act, requiring a party, before he can obtain a certiorari in an action of forcible entry and detainer, to enter into bond in the sum of \u00a3250, conditioned that he will prosecute the certiorari in the Supreme Court, pay the yearly value of the premises in dispute from the time of granting the certiorari to the determination of the same; together with the costs o\u00ed the suit before the court below; and such further costs as may be taxed if the judgment he affirmed; and shall in all things abide the judgment of the said Supreme Court respecting the judgment, order or proceedings, given or made by the court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
