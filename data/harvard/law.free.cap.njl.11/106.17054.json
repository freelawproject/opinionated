Which said several sums of money above mentioned after the death of the said Nicholas Dubois, the said defendant promised and agreed to pay to the said plaintiff as executor as aforesaid, whenever he should be thereunto requested. Yet the said defendant hath not although requested so to do, paid the said sums of money or either or any part thereof to the said Nicholas in his lifetime or to the said plaintiff as executor as aforesaid since the death of the said Nicholas, but hath hitherto wholly refused and still doth refuse so to do, by means whereof and by force of the statute in such case made and provided, an action hath accrued to the said plaintiff as executor as aforesaid to demand and have of and from the said defendant the said sum of one hundred dollars above demanded, for which he brings suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\">From this judgment, Oox appealed and upon the trial of the appeal the following state of the case was agreed upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">This cause carne on to bo fried before the Court of Common Pleas in the term of June, 1828.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The plaintiff having opened his cause by his counsel, the defendant, by his counsel, moved the court to non-suit the plaintiff, upon two grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>1st. That the action was misconceived, being debt instead of case. And</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">2d. Because of a misjoinder of action. The declaration *107] containing *two counts, both including the rent which accrued, as well before as after the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">The court, after hearing the arguments of counsel for both parties, being equally divided, the defendant took nothing by his motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">The defendant offered Mrs. Sarah Stryker as a witness to prove that after the defendant had occupied the premises,, and while he was in possession, and in the life time of one Mary Cook, the testator stated to her at different times, that the defendant paid and was to pay the rent for the-premises to the said Mary Cook, to wit, that he paid her a certain annual amount due her as her right of dower, in lands bought by testator, formerly her husband\u2019s. That the testator stated at the same time to the witness, that the-defendant had paid said amount to the said Mary, annually, for him as her right of dower, and which was more than the-yearly rent of the premises occupied by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-8\">The defendant offered further to prove by Mary Ammerman \u25a0 and Mrs. Sarah Stryker, that the testator stated to \u25a0 each of them repeatedly, while the defendant occupied the premises, that he. had purchased the premises, for the-defendant to live on .as his own, lree from any other charge, than to pay the said Mary Cook her right' of dower; that the defendant was to repair and improve the premises; that he had repaired and improved the same by building a kitchen, milk room, barn, and an addition to the blacksmith\u2019s shop; and' the testator stated to the witness at the same time, that after purchasing and paying for the premises in question he had a surplus of money in his hands of' the defendant. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-9\">The defendant further offered in evidence a certified copy of the last will and testament of the said Nicholas Dubois,, dec., under the hand and seal of office of John Erelinghuysen, esq., surrogate of the county of Somerset.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Also a lease between the testator and defendant for the same premises, dated the day of A. D.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">sent up with the papers by the justice; proving the same by the subscribing wfitness, and also proving by the same witness that said lease was produced and proved before the justice in the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">The plaintiff by bis counsel objected to the foregoing testimony, *as severally offered; and the court after [*108 hearing arguments, overruled the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">The defendant offered a certified copy of the inventory of the deceased as evidence which was read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-8\">The cause having been submitted, the court reversed the judgment of the justice below, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of sixty-seven dollars and thirtj'-five cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-9\"><em>Hartwell, </em>for the plaintiff in certiorari,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2S\">relied upon two reasons for the reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-10\">First. Because of a misjoinder of action, in this, that the plaintiff has included in his state of demand two counts; the first for rent which accrued in the life time of the testator; the second for rent which accrued after his death; the samo not being assets, if recovered, but belonging to the heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-11\">Second. Because the court admitted improper evidence on the part of the plaintiff below, and rejected proper evidence offered by the defendant below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-12\">In support of the first reason, he said, the declaration contains two counts, claiming the rent that accrued as well after as before the death of the testator. Eent becoming due after the death of the testator goes to the heir, and not to the executor; <em>Jacob L. D. Land, and Ten. </em>99, 100; <em>Sacheverel </em>v. <em>Frogart, </em>2 <em>Levinz, </em>13. The heir in law may, in right of his ancestor, maintain an action of debt for rent which accrued after the death of ancestor; for the rent is incident to the lands and part of the reversion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A plaintiff cannot join in the same action a demand as executor with another in his own right. 1 <em>T. R. </em>489; 1 <em>Chit. Plead. </em>202. <em>Lord Ellenborough </em>expressed a wish that the rule laid down in <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>had been abided by, viz: \u201cThat where the money recovered would-be assets, the executor may declare for it in his representative character 1 <em>Chit. Plead. </em>203; 1 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>261; 6 <em>East, </em>405. Here the money in the first count would go to the executor, and in the second to the heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">In support of the second reason, viz., that the Court of Common Pleas overruled proper testimony offered by the defendant, he said, the action is brought upon a parol demise, and the. defendant offered to shew not only payment, but the terms on which the property was occupied. *109] The plaintiff shewed no contract *either written or parol; the defendant offered to shew a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">Our statute of frauds, <em>Rev. Laws </em>151, sec. 10, is similar to the 1st section of the statute of 29, <em>Gar; II. c. </em>3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">Where there is a parol agreement for a lease for years, &amp;c., although by the statute of frauds the agreement be void as to the duration of the lease, it governs the terms on which the tenancy subsists in other respects ; 3 <em>Stark. </em>1012, 1015, 10 <em>Mass. Pep. </em>303.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">Even in the case of a written contract, parol evidence is admissible, where it does not vary the terms of the original contract or agreement, but shews that it has been discharged ; 2 <em>Stark. </em>1002; 1 <em>Phil. Evi. </em>444, <em>$c.; Comyn on Con. </em>80, 81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-9\">The court also erred in rejecting the will; 1 <em>Penn. </em>35, <em>Ben ex dem. Snedeker </em>v. <em>Allen. </em>This case proves that a transcript of a will may be'read in evidence even without the proofs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-10\">The court rejected the lease which would have proved that there was a contract, and that the rent reserved was $126, and ousted the justice of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-11\">Where no new contract or lease is proved, the law presumes a renewal of the original agreement. 1 <em>B. \u00bff E. </em>164.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Vroom, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-5\">Bv tiie Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ASU\">This was an action for use and occupation. On the trial, the plaintiff proved the occupation of the defendant, and the annual value; and rested on the presumption of law, that, as executor, he was entitled to recover. The defendant offered to prove that the testator had declared he was to pay no rent; and to prove also, the reason why he was to pay no rent. This evidence of the Court of Common Pleas overruled, ill our opinion, improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
