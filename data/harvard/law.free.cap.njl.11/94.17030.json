To prove the notice, he read an affidavit stating that a notice of taking depositions on the 31st, was put into the post-office at Elizabethtown, on the 24th day of August, directed to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney at Jersey City.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-5\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">asked if there was any case in which the putting a letter into the post-office liad been held a sufficient proof of the service of a notice, where the opposite attorney did not appear. In the case of <em>McCoury </em>v. <em>Suydam, </em>5 <em>Halst. </em>245, the defendant\u2019s attorney was in court. If the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was now here, and did not deny the receipt of the notice, proof of putting the notice into the post-office would be <em>prima fade </em>evidence of his having received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\"><em>Scudder </em>said that he knewof no. case in this court, in which it had been decided that putting a letter in the post-office was a sufficient proof of notice; and he would, therefore, waive his present motion, and apply for a rule to shew cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
