And the principle seems as correct as the precedents are authoritative. In <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>at November term, 1794, a certiorari was quashed for want of j urisdiction; In <em>The State </em>v. <em>Vanderveer, </em>at May term, 1823, because allowed by a judge at chambers, and not in court; In <em>Coddington </em>v. <em>Staunton, </em>at September term, 1823, because a prosecutor was not named, either in the rule for allowance, or on the writ; In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>and in <em>Saxton </em>v. <em>Geary, </em>at September term, 1824, because not the proper remedy; In <em>The State </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>at February term, 1827, because sued out against good faith; and in all these, costs were ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In the present case, the-certiorari was quashed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Let there be an order for costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
