Dismissal of the complaint was therefore warranted <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3216 [e]; <em>Sortino v Fisher, </em>20 AD2d 25). Dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendants Bob Flaherty and Bob Flaherty, Inc., for failure to comply with a disclosure order was also appropriate <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3126 [b] [3]). Thompson, J. P., Rosenblatt, Ritter, Friedmann and Krausman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
