Worth, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-15\">The auditor in the Court below, A. P. Reid, reported the facts substantially as follow's:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-16\">Sarah J. Worth died April 8th, 1877, intestate, leaving three children, \u2014 Henry M. Worth, Franklin J. Worth, and Rebecca J. Hiddleson, and seised of certain real estate in the borough of West Chester. Upon this real estate were three liens, in the following order: A mortgage to the West Chester Building and Loan Association, dated April 5th, 1875, to secure the payment of $1000 in ten years, with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>terest, and monthly contributions of $5 on five shares of stock, owned by the decedent, and fines; a mortgage to J. Llewellyn Meredith, dated April 5th, 1875, payable in five years, which had been reduced, to $1000; and a judgment for $884.19, payable to the children of the decedent in equal shares. Henry M. Worth took out letters of administration May 7th, 1877. There was no personalty, and November 19th, 1877, the Orphans\u2019 Court made a decree authorizing the administrator to sell the above-mentioned real estate for the payment of the debts of the decedent, upon his filing a bond in $5600, with William H. Hodgson and J. Llewellyn Meredith as sureties. The bond was filed, and the administrator made return to the order of sale that he had made sale of the property to William II. Hodgson for $2300. The sale was confirmed by the Court. The administrator by deed, dated April 1st, 1878, but not recorded until' August 10th, 1880, conveyed the premises to William II. Hodgson. Hodgson was not at the sale, and at the time knew nothing about it. Before the sale of the property, it was supposed it would not sell for enough to cover the liens, and the administrator, under the advice of counsel, bought it in the name of Hodgson, with the intention of creating new liens in favor of the lien creditors, and holding the property until a sale to better advantage could be made. His sister, Rebecca <em>J. </em>Hiddleson, was consulted about it before the sale was made, and was informed that it had taken place, and that he was the purchaser. He then filed an account, charging himself $2348, the amount of the sale, and $48 in rent collected, and claiming credit for, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\"><em>~W. </em>C. B. and L. Association, judgment and interest, . $ 700 50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">Eebecca J. Hiddleson <em>et al., </em>judgment and interest,. . 235 18</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">J. L. Meredith, judgment and interest, .... 1050 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">This account was confirmed. After the filing of the account, Worth collected the rents of the property, and about April 1st, 1880, occupied it himself. William H. Hodgson and wife by deed, dated August 9th, 1880, and recorded August 10th, 1880, conveyed the premises to Henry M. Worth, who, November 16th, 1880, executed a mortgage to J. Llewellyn Meredith to secure the payment of $1000 and interest from May 1st, 1880, in settlement of the mortgage he had previously held. The other lien creditors were not paid. The auditor found that in this transaction no actual fraud was meditated. Nothing was said or done to deter bidders at the sale, and the property brought a fair price and as much as it would be likely to bring if sold again. Meredith did not know of the facts attending the sale until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>some time in August, 1880. A judgment was entered January 4th, 1881, against Worth in favor of Lavina E. Hannum for $700. Other judgments were entered against him, and on the 6th of January 1881, he made an assignment for the benefit of creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">January 24th, 1881, J. L. Meredith filed a petition, under which the present contention arises, setting forth that Worth \u201cfraudulently and unlawfully became the purchaser of said real estate himself;\u201d and \u201cfalsely made return that he had sold the same to Hodgson, and that the Court, being deceived by the said administrator, and without knowledge of his fraud, confirmed the sale; that no consideration was paid Hodgson upon said transfer of title, and that the same was wholly collusive and fraudulent;\u201d that none of the credits claimed in the account filed had been paid ; that Worth was insolvent; that these frauds had only come to the knowledge of the petitioner in the latter part of December, 1880. He asked to have the decree confirming the sale to Hodgson and the decree confirming the account opened, stricken off and set aside, and the administrator removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">Answers were filed by Lavina E. Hannum, and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">On March 15th, 1881, The West Chester Building and Loan Association presented their petition, asking leave to join with Meredith as a party complainant, which was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-10\">There was uncontradicted evidence that, February 10 th, 1881, the association brought suit on the $5600 bond against the principal and sureties, and that they filed an affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\">The auditor found that \u201c The Building Association has done nothing that would prejudice their right, except to. permit the administrator to have the stock transferred to himself. This, of course, was subject to the Association\u2019s rights as collateral assignee, and was without any knowledge of the facts. It was confirmatory of nothing.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-13\">The auditor reported that Meredith, having full knowledge of the facts, and having with deliberation taken a new security, had elected to confirm the purchase and could not object to it, and that the sale having produced ample funds to pay both him and the Building Association, their debts were in effect paid, and that only the heirs and unsatisfied creditors could ask to have the sale set aside. He further reported that the prayer for striking off the decree.confirming the sale ought not to be granted, and that the prayer for striking off the decree confirming the account should be granted, and that the items of credit for claims unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>should be stricken out. To this report Mei\u2019edith and the Building and Loan Association filed exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">The Court, Fcjtiiey, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">\u201c It is a well-settled principle of law that no trustee,' or person acting in a- fiduciary character, can become a purchaser at his own sale, either directly or indirectly, or acquire an interest in the trust estate, without the consent of those for whose benefit he has consented to act, or of the Court having jurisdiction of the trust; such a purchase, however, is not absolutely void, but voidable at the election of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>or those beneficially interested in the estate, so that the trustee takes the property, subject to the power of disaffirmance by lien creditors, or others interested: Fisk <em>v. </em>Sarber, 6 W. &amp; S., 18; Chronister <em>v. </em>Bushey, 7 W. &amp; S., 152 ; Beeson <em>v. </em>Beeson, 9 Barr, 279 ; Pennock\u2019s ApSeal, 2 Harris, 446 ; Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey, 315 ; Istate of John C. Hallman, 1 Chester Co. R., 141.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">\u201c The real estate in question was purchased for the administrator \u00e1t his own sale, and return made to Court that the property was sold to William H. Hodgson, and the sale confirmed. Mr. Hodgson was entirely ignorant at the time of the fact that the property was returned as sold to him; he had not attended the sale, or authorized his name to be used. No further action was had with regard to perfecting the title by the making of deeds for about two and a half years, and until August, 1880, some five months before the commencement of these proceedings, during all which time neither the sureties of the administrator nor the lien-creditors (except a sister of the administrator) appear to have had any knowledge that the purchase had been made by the administrator. Under these circumstances, had the Court been informed of the facts when they came to the knowledge of the sureties, we would, at their instance, without more, have stricken off the confirmation of the sale. They became sureties for the faithful appropriation by the administrator of the proceeds of the sale. Their suretyship contemplated a sale to some one other than the administrator, and the receipt of purchase-money, for the faithful appropriation of which they became responsible. It did not contemplate a responsibility for moneys to be raised by the administrator from his own resources; hence, they had standing to ask the Court to interfere in their behalf. It appears, however, that, after they became aware of the state of the title, one of them, Hodgson, to whom the sale had been confirmed, conveyed the land to the administrator individually, and the other, Meredith, took a new mortgage from him for a debt, secured by mortgage of the decedent. The auditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>finds that Meredith, the surety who petitions the Court for relief, by this action confirmed the purchase, so far as he is concerned, and cannot now object to it. We are not prepared to say that he is in error, although it is not necessary to express an'opinion upon that point. The application is united in by the West Chester Building and Loan Association, a mortgage-creditor of the decedent, and they ask that the confirmation of this sale may be stricken off, so that the lien of their mortgage may be preserved until the property is properly sold, and the purchase-moneys that may be realized therefrom are in the hands of the administrator. This creditor is undoubtedly a party having an interest in the sale of the land, and competent to make this application: Fisk <em>v. </em>Sarber, Pennodk\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">\u201c It is objected that, as the price bid for the land by the administrator is sufficient to cover their liens, they have no standing, but must resort to the sureties of the administrator, he being insolvent, to obtain payment of it. Had the sale been a <em>bona fide </em>one, this position would probably have been correct, but should the Court, under the circumstances, compel them to loose their hold on the land and look to the sureties alone, and take their chances of recovering their money from them ? We cannot assure them that they would be successful in this resort. It appears from the report of the auditor that they have brought suit against the sureties, whc have filed an affidavit of defence, and the case awaits the determination of this proceeding. As the sale is voidable, and as the Building Association, as the auditor finds, have done nothing to prejudice their rights, and as the title, is still in the administrator, we are of opinion they are in a position to ask the interference of the court, and that the relief prayed for should be granted. That the Court has power to grant such relief we think is clear: George\u2019s Appeal, 2 Jones, 260 ; Sbollenberger\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris, 387; Dundas\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. S., 325.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">\u201cThe rights of no one will be prejudiced thereby. Mrs. Hiddleson, one of the lien creditors, who by the sale as made would receive a small amount on her judgment, was cognizant of the purchase by the administrator, and is affected with knowledge that he had no authority to thus purchase, and she cannot complain that the sale is not sustained. She will occupy the same position as a lien-creditor, which she did before the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">\u201c The judgment-creditors of the administrator, as an individual, and his assignee for benefit of creditors, have no such interests as will prevent the interposition of the Court. Their rights rise no higher than those of their creditor, as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>debts owing by the decedent: Sheetz <em>v. </em>Marks, 2 Pearson, 302, and cases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\">\u201c The rights of purchasers will not be affected, as the title still remains in the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">\u201c That the sureties of the administrator will be relieved from responsibility we do not, under the circumstances, think inequitable. This case is an illustration of the unwisdom of trustees purchasing at their own sales, unless they have the permission of the Court, or the consent of all parties interested as owners or beneficiaries.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The Court, therefore, ordered :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">1. That the decree confirming the sale be opened, and the confirmation of the sale be stricken off, and the sale be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">2. That the decree of the Court, confirming the account of the administrator, be opened, and the account be corrected by striking out the item on the debit side, charging himself with $2300, purchase-money of the real estate, and \"by striking out the items of credit, not paid by him, including the Meredith judgment for $1050, and his compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">3. That the letters of administration, granted to H. M. Worth, be vacated, and he be removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">Lavina R.
