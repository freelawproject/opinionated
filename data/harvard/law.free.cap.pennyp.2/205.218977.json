Metzger </em>testified in substance: I was attorney for the defendant, and at about the hour fixed for the hearing appeared at Mr. Jones\u2019s office with the defendant, and there met William P. Snyder, Robert Hausman, and Henry J. Woodring. Mr. Snyder then testified that as attorney in fact for Moses Heberle he had transferred the note in suit to Woodring, subject to its indorsement over by Heberle to Henninger as collateral security for a claim, and that his power of attorney had been lost or mislaid, but was recorded. I then, in the presence of these parties, said, \u201c If Snyder\u2019s power of attorney is recorded we will soon make an end of this;\u201d to which the alderman responded, \u201c Oh yes. I knew if you got together and talked the matter over, you could come to some understanding.\u201d I proposed to Mr. Snyder that he and I proceed to my office, and arrange the matter. I handed him two of the notes held by Henninger as collateral security. We agreed that the Guth note should be handed to him by me after the lapse of ten days or a fortnight. February 10th, 1880, I received notice of an execution. The alderman informed me that he had been requested by Robert Hausman to enter judgment at noon of the day when we had met. I saw Mr. Snyder, who said he would remedy it; that it was all wrong. I saw Mr. Hausman, and after some conversation said, \u201c I\u2019ll give you the note as I had promised, and you go and enter satisfaction on this judgment.\u201d I think the costs amounted to six dollars and something, which I paid him, at the same time handing him the Guth note. I paid him his fees of twenty dollars, and he left me with the promise that he would pay over the costs and satisfy the judgment. I heard nothing more about it until this second execution was issued. The hearing was not completed when Mr. Snyder and I left the alderman\u2019s office. What I said, in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>to the compromise of the case in the alderman\u2019s office, was said in the hearing and presence of Woodring. He took part in the conversation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\"><em>William P. Snyder </em>testified in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">The suit was brought on the $300 note, the maker of which was Samuel Guth. There had been a payment of $100 on account before its assignment to Woodring. Mr. Metzger, in the presence and hearing of Woodring, made an offer of compromise. Neither Mr. Metzger nor his client on the day of suit was willing to deliver the notes. Mr. Metzger suggested to Woodring, whether if, within a reasonable time, he should deliver the notes to Mr. Hausman, that would settle the suit before the alderman. Woodring said, \u201c Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\"><em>William </em>L. Jones, the alderman, testified in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">I gave Henninger notice of the entry of the judgment the same day it was entered, only a few minutes after it had been entered. When I heard the case, as near as I can recollect, I gave notice that the decision would be rendered right after dinner. I recollect nothing that was said about settling the matter. I did not say to Mr. Metzger that the judgment had been entered at the instance of Mr. Hausman. I think I entered, \u201c February 10th, 1880, I acknowledge to have received full satisfaction \u201d at the instance of Mr. Hausman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-10\">The defendant then filed exceptions: 1st. That the judgment was obtained by fraud; 2d. That there should be satisfaction entered on the judgment; and seven others, raising questions of fact. He also filed additional exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-11\">1. The record of the alderman shows that on February 3d, 1880, execution was issued on the judgment, which on February 6th, 1880, was marked: \u201c Keturned by order of plaintiff\u2019s attorney.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-12\">2. The record shows an acknowledgment of full satisfaction of the above judgment on February 10th, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-13\">3. An alias execution was issued August 30th, 1880, after an acknowledgment of satisfaction in full of the judgment, and payment of costs by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-14\">The Court, Albright, P. J., filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-15\">\u201c From the depositions and from what was said at the argument, it is apparent that if Mr. Henninger is required to pay this judgment, a gross wrong will have been committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-16\">\u201c To set aside the execution, if the power to do so existed, would do the defendant no good (Mr. Henninger was defendant before the alderman). If the judgment must stand, another execution would be the consequence. The law provides, that no execution isued by a justice shall be set aside for informality, if it shall appear on the face of the same that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>it was issued in the name of the Commonwealth for the sum for which judgment had been entered, that a day has been mentioned for the return thereof, and that the cause of action was cognizable before a justice. (See Act of 1810, section 22d.) Under the Act of 1879, the justice had jurisdiction. None of the irregularities mentioned exists. The Court therefore cannot set aside the execution. Can the judgment be reversed ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">\u201cThe21st section of the Act of 1810 says,that no judgment of a justice shall be set aside in pursuance of a writ of certiorari, unless the same be issued within twenty days after judgment was entered. It has been decided, that where the party complaining makes it appear that there was no jurisdiction, or that the summons was not served, and that he did not appear, the certiorari may be taken within twenty days from the time the party learns that a judgment had been entered against him. Here there was jurisdiction, and both a service and an appearance. If for any of the matters complained of the Court could relieve, the certiorari would be too late. The judgment was entered January 10th, 188(^; the certiorari was issued September 8th, 1880. The aider-man swears that he told the defendant, the day when judgment was entered, that he had entered it. Defendant\u2019s counsel has testified that he learned of the first execution about the 10th of February, 1880. On certiorari the Court has only the power to affirm the justice\u2019s judgment; the justice\u2019s judgment cannot be corrected, nor can it be reversed for matters subsequent to the judgment: Pool <em>v. </em>Morgan, 10 W., 58. In that case the Court below erroneously awarded an issue to try the question whether there had been a payment in whole or in part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">\u201cThat a gross outrage has been committed is only too apparent. The Court regrets that the law has not given it the power in this proceeding to relieve the victim, Iwtr. Henninger. We can only express the hope that he will be able, without serious loss, to extricate himself from the perplexing situation he is now in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">\u201c Now, June 17th, 1881, the judgments and proceedings are affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">Defendant then took out a writ of error, assigning nine errors, in substance: that the Court erred in affirming the judgment and proceedings before the alderman, in not setting aside the execution, and in mot sustaining the exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-8\"><em>John </em>Rupp, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\">The judgment is re viewable in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The last proviso to section 22 of the Act of March 20th, 1810, which says: \u201c Judgment of the Court of Common Pleas shall be final on all proceedings removed as aforesaid, by the said Court, and no writ of error shall issue thereon,\u201d does not apply where the proceedings are not under that Act: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Burkhart, 11 Harris, 521 ; Zimmerly <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 1 Casey, 134 ; Clark <em>v. </em>Yeat, 4 Binney, 185; Buckmy er <em>v. </em>Dubbs, 5 Binney, 29 ; Carpenter\u2019s Case, 2 H., 486.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">The proviso to the 21st section of that act, which requires that a certiorari must issue within twenty days after judgment, is also confined to cases arising under that act: Cooke <em>v. </em>Reinhart, 1 Rawle, 321; Welker <em>v. </em>Welker, 3 P. &amp; W., 24; Young\u2019s Petition, 9 Barr, 215; Caughey <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 12 S. &amp; R., 53; Graver <em>v. </em>Fehr, 8 Norris, 460.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">Where a judgment is obtained by fraud, it will be reversed on certiorari, though the \"writ was not issued within the twenty days : Lacock <em>v. </em>White, 7 IL, 495.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-8\">Parol testimony is admissible, where fraud on the part of the justice is alleged: Dunbar <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 Ash, 215; McMullen <em>v. </em>Orr, 28 Leg.

Conceding, for the sake of argument, that a writ of error lies in a case like the present, and that the testimony submitted to the Court below is properly before us for consideration, we find nothing in the record of the judgment and proceedings before the alderman, or in the testimony, to justify a reversal. The transcript contains everything that is essential to a regular and valid judgment. The cause of action as therein stated was clearly within the jurisdiction of the alderman; process was regularly issued and served; both parties appeared; witnesses on behalf of each were sworn and examined, and on the same day judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. No appeal was taken, and nearly eight months elapsed before the writ of certiorari was issued. As a general rule the Court' of Common Pleas, in reviewing the judgment of a justice or alderman, will not look beyond the record of -his proceedings. To this rule, however, there are some well-recognized exceptions, but there is nothing in the present case to bring it within any of them. There is no ground on which to base a charge of improper conduct or fraud on the part of the alderman. The hearing was concluded in the forenoon, and notice having been given that the case would be decided in the afternoon, judgment was then entered in favor of the plaintiff, and on the same day notice thereof was given to defendant. These facts were clearly established by the testimony. If the defendant, relying on the promise of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the matter in controversy would be settled, neglected to appeal within the time allowed by law, the alderman is not in any manner responsible for the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
