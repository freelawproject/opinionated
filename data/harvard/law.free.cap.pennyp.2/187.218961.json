He visited her in March, 1879, and called upon her about a dozen times up to July, and after that every evening, and very often in the afternoon. Upon Sunday, the 10th of August, 1879, \u201cas regards getting married, he said he came to the conclusion he would like to get married, and he said he thought I would suit him better than any other woman he ever got acquainted with.....I was agreed, and I told him so, and a day was fixed for the wedding.\u201d She made her dresses and underwear, and told her friends of the engagement. He gave her a silk dress for the wedding, and bought a trunk for the wedding tour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-14\">January 24th, 1880, he told her he had concluded not to be married. \u201c He said he was old and lame, and he didn\u2019t think he would get married any more.\u201d He never came back any more. There were other witnesses for the plaintiff, who testified to hearing the defendant say he was engaged to be married to the plaintiff; that he solicited her to name a day for the wedding; that it was postponed until February, 1880, because of the illness of defendant\u2019s father; that she was making preparations, and he visited her frequently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-15\">The defendant admitted the visits, but denied the promise, the engagement, and the admissions testified to. He testified that he stopped visiting her in January, 1880; that his father was lying very sick then, and died February 14th; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>sjie was sending over to the house for him and coming herself, and it was an annoyance to the family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">The defendant called <em>Elmira </em>Stackhouse, and proposed to ask her whether in January, 1880, the plaintiff said, \u201c Charlie has quit coming. He leit me abruptly. This is the way with these Charlies. I never knew he had so little brains.\u201d And also said, \u201c She hoped his father would livelong enough to see what trouble she would make him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">The offer was disallowed, the question not being confined to the time preceding or on January 24th, 1880, on which day the alleged breach occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">The defendant called <em>Augustus Hippie, </em>and proposed to show that shortly after the alleged breaking off in January, plaintiff said to witness, \u201c Shedid not care a damn for Charlie; she wanted that pile of brick (pointing over to his father\u2019s house), and she said she would make him haul- the rest of his days,\u201d which language was communicated to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">The offer was disallowed, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">Counsel for the defendant asked the Court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-13\">1. If the jury should find that there was a marriage contract, made on the 10th of August, 1879, between plaintiff' and defendant, being on Sunday, plaintiff cannot recover, the nature of such contract being executory, and such contract would be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-14\">2. If the jury believe that the defendant entered into a contract of marriage with plaintiff, and stopped his visits by reason of his father\u2019s sickness and death, and she refused to recognize and speak to him after his death, when he had recognized her, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-15\">The Court answered these points as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-16\">1. We refuse that point, under the evidence of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-17\">2. We deny that point, as presented. It is for the jury to determine from all the evidence which party failed and refused to execute the contract by an actual marriage, if the jury find a contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-18\">The Court, in its general charge, left it to the jury to ascertain whether or not a contract had been made, and said, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-19\">\u201cYou, the jury, may consider the pecuniary value of the marriage, when there is any evidence as to their, the parties, financial condition. There is very little evidence on that point. It is testified that the lady \u2014 the plaintiff \u2014 is about* thirty-five or six years of age, a woman of energy, supporting herself by her own application and industry, amiable in manner, and respectable, so far as you know from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the evidence. As to the defendant, it is testified that he is about fifty-one years old, and worked at home for his father, his father being now deceased, but nothing is testified about his wealth. [In fixing the damages, we say that you may consider, without knowing the financial means of either plaintiff' or defendant] thepecuniary value of the marriage, the high or low or moderate station or condition in life that would be gained thereby, and the injury to the feelings, the affections, the self-respect, and the wounded pride of the lady, the plain-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">February 17, 1882.
