The lease reserved to tbe defendant tbe use of tbe part of the house occupied by him, the use of tbe spring and trough, tbe carriage-house, pig-pen, the ground on the northwest of the truck-patch, the Franklin pears, the small fruit in the yard, with manure for the same, and the chicken-yard, with the right of \u201cdoing any repairing\u201d or the planting of trees about the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-15\">In September, 1879, the barn burned down. An instalment of rent, $200, came due February 1st, 1880, and, not having been paid, the defendant distrained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-16\">Counsel for plaintiff\u2019 made several offers of evidence, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-17\">1. That, without the consent of the landlord, and against his consent, the outgoing tenant entered on the premises to cut his grain, and entered the barn for the purpose of threshing, and whilst in possession the barn was consumed by fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>2. The extent of the loss by fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">3. That by this fire the tenant was deprived of the use of any barn and outbuildings to the end of his term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">No buildings were substituted for those destroyed during the term for tenant\u2019s use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">4. That immediately after the fire, the landlord put men to work tearing away d\u00e9bris and tearing down walls, for the purpose of rebuilding, and that this was done without consent of tenant and against his objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">5. That new buildings were not completed within three mouths from the time of fire, and that said buildings were not intended for the enjoyment of said tenant, and tfiat said tenant had no enjoyment of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">These offers were all objected to and were rejected, and exceptions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">February 1st, 1881. Verdict for the defendant, rent in arrear, $200, on which judgment was subsequently entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-10\">The plaintiff then took out a writ of error, assigning as errors the exclusion of the above offers of testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-11\"><em>Wm. Hall </em>Waxier, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-12\">Only one side of the case was heard, and no fair conclusion can be formed. There was a clear and unmistakable eviction. The landlord took possession without the conseut of the tenant and tore down the walls. Rent is not apportioned in favor of a wrongdoer: Linton <em>v. </em>Hart, 1 Casey, 193; Bennett <em>v. </em>Bittle, 4 Rawle, 342; Briggs <em>v. </em>Thompson, 9 Barr, 338; Kessler <em>v. </em>McConachy, 1 Rawle, 435; Ross <em>v. </em>Dysart, 9 Casey, 452; McOlurg <em>v. </em>Price, 9 P. F. Smith, 420; Magaw <em>v. </em>Lambert, 3 Barr, 444.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-13\">If it be argued by the counsel for the defendant that the landlord hacfa right to re-enter upon the premises for the purpose of repairing, then it is submitted that no covenant to repair can be so construed that the landlord can re-euter and erect entirely new buildings in place of those burned down; certainly no such force of construction can be given to the word repair in this case, where the destruction by fire was not contemplated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-14\">In the case of Hoeveler <em>v. </em>Flemming <em>et al., </em>10 Norris, 322, it was decided, that, where the repairs are not ordinary, but of a character to deprive the tenant of all beneficial enjoyment of the premises, or at least seriously interrupt it while the repairs are in progress, they amount to an eviction, and suspend the rent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-15\"><em>Samuel </em>Wakeling, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-16\">As to the first offer, the waygoing tenant had a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>right to enter on the land to cut and remove the waygoing crop, even after the expiration of his time: Stultz <em>v. </em>Dickey, 5 Binney, 285; Demi <em>v. </em>Bossier, 1 P. &amp; W., 224; Craig <em>v. </em>Dale, 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>S., 509; Iddings <em>v. </em>Nagle, 2 W. <em>&amp; 8., </em>22.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">The destruction of the barn by fire, whereby the plaintiff was deprived of its use, is no defence. The lease contained an express covenant to pay, and as there was no clause for a suspension of the rent in case of fire, or until the premises were rebuilt, the tenant took the risk and bound himself to pay the rent during the term: Bussman <em>v. </em>Ganster, 22 P. F. Smith, 285.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">The right to repair the barn should be construed as a right to rebuild, it for the benefit of the business to be conducted upon the whole property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-8\">The lease contained no covenant on the part of the landlord to rebuild or repair for the tenant, who was bound to pay rent even if one of the buildings had been destroyed. There was no covenant as to repairs in three months, and the oifor did not go to show that the enjoyment of the bairn at the time when completed was refused by the landlord.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-9\">While there are many instances where an eviction is a snspension of the rent, yet the principle does not apply to this case, because the landlord was in part possession and enjoyment, and had reserved the right to maintain his estate in proper order. The cases cited by the plaintiff in error do not apply to this case. In all instances the tenants were in absolute possession, and there were no rights of entry in the landlord to maintain the estate. In this ease the right of the landlord was based upon his concurrent enjoyment and possession of the building destroyed, with his reserved right to maintain his estate. The mere fact of the burning of the barn was not an eviction, unless it could be shown that it was the act of the landlord, and as the offer tendered no such proof, or even such suggestion, it should therefore fall.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b365-10\">February 13th, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ATAB\">\u2014 Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"AQm\">The offers of evidence, if admitted, would have made out no defence. By the lease the landlord had the right to repair the damage done by the fire. To repair, means to put the premises in their former condition. As there was no stipulation in the lease to that effect, there was nothing to relieve the tenant from the payment of the rent while the repairs were going on. Had the lease not been near expiring, the tenant no doubt would have insisted upon having them done.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
