Officers acting under the authority of the State for the collection of the public taxes and fines and penalties due the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-10\">The preamble clearly expresses the mischief to be remedied, \u2014the issuing of writs of replevin \u201c for goods and chattels taken in execution, and for fines and penalties legally incurred and due the Commonwealth, to the delay of public justice, and to the great vexation of the officers concerned in taking and levying the same:\u201d Vanhorne <em>v. </em>Horra nee, 2 Dallas, 305; Mulholm <em>v. </em>Cheney, Addison, 301.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-11\">The act mentions the officers to be protected, \u2014 \u201c sheriff, naval officer, lieutenant or sub lieutenant, of the city of Philadelphia, or of any county, constable, collector of the public taxes, or other officer, acting in their several offices under the authority of the State.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-12\">Under his appointment, under the Act of May 15th, 1874, the defendant was not a sheriff, naval officer, lieutenant, nor sub-lieutenant, constable or collector of the public taxes. This is clear.' The expression in the Act of 1779, \u201cor i/n? <em>other officers acting in their several offices under the authority of the State,\u201d </em>cannot apply to the defendant. ' He is a county officer. No goods and chattels can be taken in execution by him; he has nothing to do with the collection of public taxes or fines and penalties legally incurred and due the Commonwealth, and he does not aet under the authority of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-13\">No part of the fines imposed for violation of the Act of 1874 goes to the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-14\"><em>Peter D.

Besides, for anywrongful seizure that may be made, the aggrieved party has his remedy by a common-law action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">It is true that the money realized on the sale of the condemned goods does not go into the State treasury, but this objection was raised and disposed of by the Supreme Court in the case of Pott <em>v. </em>Oldwine, 7 Watts, 178: Stiles <em>v. </em>Griffith, 3 Yeates, 82; Zaue <em>v. </em>Cowperthwaite, 1 Dallas, 313.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b51-8\">March 13th, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AWV\">\u2014 Per Curiam</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">:</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">There can be no doubt that the defendant was an officer, \u201c acting in his office under the authority of the State,\u201d within the provision of the Act of April 3d, 1779,1 Sm., 470, and the writ of replevin, therefore, issued in this case, was irregular, erroneous, and void: Pott <em>v. </em>Oldwine, 7 Watts, 173.
