Mr. Barnholt said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to me, in the presence of Mr. Ulrich, that he had settled with Philip, and wanted me to draw a paper for Mr. Ulrich to sign, acknowledging that the properties bought at the sheriff\u2019s sale were his, Barnholt\u2019s. I knew that the principal part of the purchase-money had been paid by Mr. Barnholt previously. He paid to the sheriff all but the $850 I got from Mr. Ulrich. I then drew this paper, read it over to Mr. Ulrich, and he signed it in my presence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">P.

It was about a week or ten days ago.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">\u201c Q,.

On March 4th, 1867, the defendant Ulrich executed and delivered to George Barnholt the paper, which the master will call the declaration of trust, recited in the bill. No part of the $9000 was paid to Ulrich. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-12\">\u201cThe said sum of $733.25 was not returned to the defendant, Ulrich, and is still due him. Ulrich always held the title to these properties, and the same stands in his name at the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-13\">\u201c During the life of George Barnholt no request was made of Ulrich to execute a conveyance, a period of nearly twelve years elapsing between the date of the sheriff\u2019s deed and the death of Barnholt, during which time there is evidence that Ulrich exercised control over the collection of the rents growing out of the said real estate. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-14\">\u201c In his finding of said facts, he did not consider the evidence of Philip Ulrich, the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-15\">The master further reported:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-16\">\u201cIn the first place this money was advanced to Barnholt for specific purposes, for the purposes contained in the receipt which was given Ulrich by Barnholt\u2019s attorney: Four hundred and twenty-five dollars thereof was intended for the payment of a part of a mortgage of $5500 on the Marshall Street property; two hundred and seventy-five dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>for the payment of interest on a mortgage of $3000 on the Seventh Street property, and twenty-five dollars for the proportion of interest on the $5500 mortgage. This receipt most particularly sets forth the manner in which the money is to be applied. Ulrich advanced this money on the'identical properties which he held, and for the purposes of meeting claims and demands against these properties. It is not contended that the advance took any other course than that specified in the receipt. If the money had been loaned to Barnholt for ordinary purposes simply, or, in other words, if it had been given for any other purpose than expenditure on these very properties, it might be argued to some effect that the defendant was not justified in refusing to sign the deed when presented; but, when we consider that in advancing this sum of $733.25, both Ulrich and Barnholt took the precaution to specify the mode of its application, by a receipt prepared by an attorney, we must presume that that receipt was intended for more than an ordinary acknowledgment of a simple debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">\u201c Holding the title, a sheriff\u2019s deed, holding a receipt for moneys advanced on account of said properties, controlling to a certain extent the collection of the rents therefrom, Ulrich must be considered in the light of a trustee, and, as such, has every right to be reimbursed for expenditures and advances (especially when made at the request of the <em>cestui que trust), </em>before a chancellor will direct him to convey. The position of the parties is not at all altered by the fact of a sum of money being paid into court sufficient to cover the debt due the defendant, and by the fact of the defendant having signed the deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">\u201c The claim of the defendant is simply removed from the property to the fund. The principle that the master has applied to the conveyance of the real estate applies with equal force to the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">\u201cYour master most respectfully submits the foregoing report, and suggests that the sum.of $733.25, with interest from the ninth day of April, A. \u00a3&gt;. 1866, be awarded from the said fund to Philip Ulrich, the defendant; that the bill as filed by plaintiff be dismissed, and that the plaintiff pay the costs of these proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">The complainants filed twelve exceptions to these findings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">The Court below, Briggs, J., sustained the exceptions, and ordered that the money in court be awarded to the plaintiff, and the costs be paid by the defendant, filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">\u201c We do not think that the evidence in this case sustains the master\u2019s conclusions. The sealed declaration of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>fendant, of March 4th, 1867, made and delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s decedent eleven months after the receipt of Mr. Simpson, of April 9th, 1866, is utterly inconsistent with the theory that the moneys advanced, as set out in that receipt, were still due and unpaid. The defendant\u2019s declaration is in these words: [Reading it.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">\u201cThe language here employed admits of no doubt as to its meaning, and raises an express obligation on the defendant\u2019s part to convey the premises, subject only to the proper costs of conveyance and existing mortgages. The learned master, nevertheless, maintains that the premises are also subject to the advances mentioned in the receipt of Mr. Simpson, of April 9th, 1866. There is, however, no legal evidence (for the defendant is not a competent witness) to warrant this conclusion, and to support such a deduction, we must assume that a provision to secure those advances was omitted from the paper signed by the defendant, for some reason not defined. If the advances were, then, unextinguished, it were just as easy to say so as to charge the premises with the mortgage and cost of conveyance, as that paper was given but eleven months after the advances had been made, and while, it is fair to presume, the transactions were yet fresh in the memory of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">\u201c The more rational theory to be adduced from these documents alone is, that a settlement at the time of making the defendant\u2019s paper, or before, had taken place between them, and that the document was given to show precisely the conditions upon which the premises were then held by the defendant, and were to be conveyed at Barnholt\u2019s request. This view is supported by the additional testimony of Messrs. Simpson and Davis. The former testifies that Barnholt and Ulrich \u2018 came to my office together the day this paper was drawn and dated. Mr. Barnholt said to me in the presence of Mr. Ulrich, that he had settled with Philip, and wanted me to draw a paper for Mr. Ulrich to sign, acknowledging that the properties bought at sheriff\u2019s sale were his, Barnholt\u2019s......I then drew the paper, read it over to Mr. Ulrich, and he signed it in my presence.\u2019 Now, here we have them together at Mr. Simpson\u2019s office, stating that they had settled, and wished a paper drawn to show precisely what the settlement was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">\u201cThe paper is drawn accordingly. Under these circumstances, to allege that that document does not express the result of the settlement, and show the true relation between the parties as it then existed, is to assert that their going to Mr. Simpson\u2019s office, and what was there said and done, was an empty circuity and form, and was not intended to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>press the intention of the parties. In the absence of proof the law does not raise a presumption to support such a theory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\">\u201c If more were wanted, we have it in the fact that since the date of that settlement (March 4th, 1867) fourteen years have passed, and no effort has been made to obtain either .the principal of the advances, or a cent\u2019s interest accruing thereupon. And during all these years, Barnholt to the time of his death, and the plaintiffs since, have received the rents issuing from the premises, and have paid the taxes and water-rent assessed thereupon, with the exception that upon one occasion the defendant stopped the rents until he was paid another sum of money which he had advanced to Barnholt. That being repaid, the rents were paid to the plaintiffs and their decedent, precisely as if the claim now set up had never existed. After this lapse of time, a presumption of payment arises, which is protected by the statute of limitations. And wherever that statute will bar in suits at law, it will, by analogy, be a like bar in proceedings in equity: Neely\u2019s Appeal, 4 Nor., 397; Hamilton <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 6 H., 20; Bickel\u2019s Appeal, 5 Nor., 204; Ashhur3t\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith, 290 ; Fricke <em>v. </em>Magee, 38 Leg. Intel., 139 ; Irwin <em>v. </em>Cooper, 11 Nor., 298. It follows, that neither equity nor sound reasoning will permit this long silence now to be broken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">\u201c From the views already expressed, we are irresistibly led to a conclusion adverse to that reported by the learned master, and hence sustain the 3d, 10th, 11th, and 12th of the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">The defendant then appealed, assigning that the Court erred in sustaining the exceptions, in making its decree, in not ordering that the sum of $733.25 be paid to defendant, in overruling the demurrer to the bill, and in not dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-7\"><em>Theodore F.
