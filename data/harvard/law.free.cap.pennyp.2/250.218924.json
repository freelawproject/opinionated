The husband collected for the wife $93 of interest. He got $750 from the obligor, which the wife gave to him for his use. He bought from the obligor a bill of lumber, which was used upon her lot by her directions. All of these transactions were conducted by the husband alone.

John Gerhab is the defendant, but, in any event, your verdict must be, and will be under the ruling of the Court, in favor of the plaintiff. This case, like all others where a married woman is' involved in litigation, presents questions of law which, although the Act of 1848 has been in existence since that period, and has been before the Court of last resort, I think, probably some thousand times at least, is still left in such doubt and in such difficulty that the wisest and ablest lawyers very often give an opinion with fear and trembling......</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201c This is the substance of her testimony, for she says she knew nothing whatever about it, and the sole inquiry here, as I regard it, is purely a matter of law, with one slight exception, which it is hardly worth while to submit to you, although I suppose I must do so. It is whether Mr. Gerhab is entitled to a credit of $300, with its interest upon the $300 note, and a credit of $160, the balance unpaid by Peter 8. Euth of the $200 note, or not. It is said that he has the right to set it off against this j udgment, for the reason that the husband in law is presumed to be the agent of the wife for the transaction of her business; that the relations between them are such that it becomes his duty to supervise her affairs and act in her place and stead. And this is measurably true, for in an early case, Walker <em>v. </em>Eamey, reported, I think, in 1st Wright, it was ruled that where a woman has got property by gift or devise, or obtained it by grant under the Act of 1848, the husband becomes in a large sense her trustee, and it does appear that where the husband has invested money with the knowledge and consent of his wife where he has received the interest, and either by knowledge upon the part of the wife and no protest upon her part against it, that the presumption of law is that he has acted as her agent, and a credit thus obtained by her debtor by the payment of interest under the circumstances, and the interest-money being used in the family with the knowledge of the wife, is sufficient evidence upon which a jury can base a verdict in favor of the defendant who had made such payment to the husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">\u201c It has never been held, gentlemen of the jury, that this presumption was quite final. It is simply a presumption, and it can be overturned by the truth ; and here we have the declaration of the husband to Mr. Gerhab, if you believe Mr. Gerhab\u2019s testimony, at the time they tried to settle, that he declared his wife knew nothing about it. We have his own testimony from the stand that he knew nothing about it. We have her own testimony that she knew nothing about it, and therefore if you believe this testimony, and it is all one way in that regard, this wife neither had knowledge of the payment when it was made nor of the agreement that it should be taken on account of the judgment; nor did she recognize it in any way whatever. And if this be true, the legal presumption of the agency of the husband is distinctly and positively rebutted by the proof. Then, again, gentlemen, as a matter of law, I charge you distinctly that while the husband may be presumed by law to be the agent of the wife in the collection of her rent for money invested by him and for money invested by her during a series of years, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>nevertheless this presumption does not apply to the actual conversion by the husband of the wife\u2019s property for his own use. If the presumption of agency would justify such a conversion \u2014 the whole corpus \u2014 that is, the whole body of the estate of a \u25a0married woman might be swept away by her husband simply presenting himself to her debtor either by mortgage, judgment, plain bond, or note, and having the money paid to him on his bare statement that he was her husband. If that doctrine be true the Act of 1848 keeps the promise to the ear and breaks it to the hope. It is very different in regard to interest and income from investments, for there the accrued interest, if used for the support of the family and for the benefit of the children and clothing of the children and the wife, and to provide the wife with necessaries used as household money with her knowledge, I think that her knowledge would raise the presumption as between herself and her husband that there was an agency, but when it comes to take away the principal fund of the estate of the wife by the husband\u2019s voluntary appearance for her, it seems to me that if that be the law we might as well repeal the Act of 1848 in regard to personal property, and place the husband precisely where he was at common law. Now, then, gentlemen, I said there was a question of fact. It hardly rises to the dignity of the question. Mr. Gerhab swears that Mr. Ruth told him that part of this money was his and part was his -wife\u2019s. I do not intend to rule the testimony out, but I say to you that the declaration of Ruth in regard to part of this money being his is no evidence against his wife unless she was present, or by her acts or by her declarations subsequently ratified it. It does appear in evidence positively here, if you believe the old lady, that this was money entirely her own, which came from the estate of her deceased minor son, and therefore it is that it is hardly worth while even to submit this question of fact to you for your consideration, and in order that the defendant here may have a broad ruling, and if this Court has committed error it can be fairly met and demonstrated, and that error corrected by our superiors, who, I am glad to know, will have an opportunity of again expressing themselves upon this married woman\u2019s law, [I charge you distinctly that, if you believe all the evidence all around in this case, the only payments which can be used here as set-off and as payment upon this, judgment are the $750, the $93 and the $107.49.] A calculation will be shown you, but that calculation don\u2019t bind' you. You must make it for yourselves, and ascertain that it is correct, unless counsel on both sides agree; but, in making up your verdict, you will remember that the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>three items allowed as set-off or payment are the $750, the $93, and the $107.49, [and that you must reject the credits of $300, with its interest, and of $160 and its interest.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">\u201c 2.

Ruth and his wife did not constitute him the agent of the wife.
