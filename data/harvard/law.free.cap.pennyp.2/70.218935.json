Livingood in the matter of the estate of Mary C. Ringler, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of <em>Berks </em>County, reducing his compensation as guardian, and confirming the report of the auditor upon his account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">October 6th, 1863, Livingood was appointed by the Court, guardian of the person and the estate of Mary C. Ringler, a minor child of Jerome Ringler, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\">The minor having reached fourteen years of age, selected as her guardian, June 30th, 1879, James K. Getz. Livingood filed an account August 22d, 1879, showing a balance due the estate of $1719.49, and claiming as compensation $400. The account was referred to C. H. Ruhl as auditor, who reported the facts substantially as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">The ward lived with her mother, who boarded, clothed and sent her to school, and the guardian had no care of her person, and had no trouble in that respect. Livingood was attorney for the heirs of Jerome Ringler, drew a petition in partition, and conducted the subsequent legal proceedings, for which he never received any compensation. The auditor allowed, as the proportion of the ward, for these services, $40. The guardian received of the ward\u2019s estate, altogether $4027.37, and had it in hand for fifteen years and nine months. The guardian did not'invest this fund separately, gave it no earmark, but invested it in his own name in the purchase of real estate along with his individual funds. There were no profits realized by the guardian from the investment of. this fund. There was no evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>show that the guardian speculated with this money for his own profit, or that he subjected it to the risk of any hazardous business or undertaking, and there was no evidence of bad faith in the investment or management of the fund. He paid the interest to the mother for the support and maintenance of the ward semi-annually. There was no evidence to show that he was guilty of negligence or tardiness in filing his account and making settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">The auditor found that the guardian having done his duty in all other things, the fact that he had invested the trust funds in his own name in the purchase of real estate, did not deprive him of commissions, and he allowed the compensation claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">To this finding the subsequently appointed guardian James 3L Getz excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">The Court below, Hagenman, P. J., ordered and decreed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">\u201cUnder all the circumstances in this case, two hundred dollars would be a fair compensation to the accountant for his risk and care of the estate. The simple fact that he retained the money in his own hands, charging himself with full interest, does not deprive him of the right to all compensation. The exception is sustained to the amount exceeding two hundred dollars, and the report thereupon confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">From this decree Livingood appealed, assigning as errors that the Court erred in reducing the compensation and in confirming the report after reduction. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-9\"><em>Gyrus G-.
