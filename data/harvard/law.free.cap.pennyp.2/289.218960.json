They filed an account, which was referred to H. W. Scott, as auditor, to settle and make distribution. The auditor reported, <em>inter </em>alia, the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">John Horner had borrowed money from the testator in his lifetime for Horner\u2019s sister, which was eventually lost. As security for the loan Horner gave two notes, under seal, one for $1462.22, dated April 1st, 1875, at one year, and the other, dated April 2d, 1877, for $697.44, at one year. These notes were found by the executors among other papers of the testator in a bureau in the spare-room of his dwelling. Horner took the notes into possession at the time he found them, and claimed them as his own. This was five or six days after the death of the testator. Horner put the notes in his pocket-book and retained possession of them. They were produced before the appraisers, but were not included in the inventory or account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\"><em>Samuel Smith </em>testified, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">\u201cI had a conversation with'Mr. Clendennin about ten or twelve days before his death about these notes of John Horner\u2019s. He was complaining of being sick some, but sat up. He was not very feeble. He told me that he didn\u2019t want John Horner to pay back those notes any more. He said John got that money for his sister, and he says, \u2018I guess that money is lost.\u2019 He said,\u2018I can a-fford it better than John.\u2019 He used these\u2018words: \u2018I don\u2019t want John to pay that money back.\u2019 He had spoken to me before about the notes. I couldn\u2019t say that he mentioned how much it was. He told me before that it was something like $2000. That was the only claim, and these the only notes he spoke about ever as holding against John. Didn\u2019t have the notes out that day. He didn\u2019t tell me to say that to John.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\"><em>John </em>Horner, having been called by the opposite party, and being recalled, testified, under objection as to his competency, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u201cHe (testator) asked me to write a will for him. I said I would; we got ready to go to work. First, he said, I should do some figuring, and make an estimate for him over his personal property. He handed me a memorandum of his papers \u2014 names of parties he had papers against. He said I should mark what I considered good and what had. I took the papers and made a list. I proved it up at his request to see what it amounted to. My notes were on the list he had. Then I commenced writing by his directions. While writing, he said he wanted to mention me in the will. While writing it, I said I would prefer to be not mentioned. Then he said the notes which he held against me were mine. Those notes, then, were not included in the estimate; he requested me to deduct them from the estimate I had made. He told me where the notes were. He said they were in the drawer in the other room; I think he said in the upper drawer. The key he said was in the secretary in that room where he was. He told me to get the notes; I said it was late, I would leave'them until I came. up again. He said very well, or something to that effect. When he told me to fet the notes, that was the time he told me where I could nd the key. I did not get up until after his death. I lived away from him about a mile and a half. The next day I had to go away from home, and Thursday morning I was getting ready to go up when they sent for me to say he had died. The first time I saw the papers was after the funeral, when I took possession of the notes in the way I have described.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">Cross examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">\u201c He didn\u2019t have any papers that day of the will except this memorandum.

They were for money which I had borrowed and not repaid. When I got the notes out after his death they were locked up in his bureau. Julia Lilly, his housekeeper, brought the key. The papers, my notes and others, as I remember now, were tied up in a bundle together. It had been a year or afterwards before when I last saw these notes. When I wrote that will I didn\u2019t consider him that night in any danger. I wrote this will in the room at the west of the house ; the papers we found in the bureau in room at the west end of the house. Was not in that room at all the night I wrote the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-11\"><em>Julia Lilly </em>testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-12\">\u201c I lived with Thomas Clendennin, deceased, in his lifetime, about thirty years.

That was the last time Mr. Horner was there before Mr. Clendennin\u2019s death. I had some conversation with Mr. Clendennin. He said he had now fixed his things the way he wanted to have them. He had said John should go and get those notes; that John had said it was so late; that he would come another time and get them.

He said that John was to come up. He didn\u2019t say what John was to do when he came up. He didn\u2019t say that night anything about what he had done with the notes. He said that John should have those notes. I talked with Mr. Hamersley this morning and some time ago. I told Mr. Hamersley that Mr. Clendennin said to me, \u2018 Now I have fixed my worldly affairs to suit me and I have given John Horner his notes, but as it was so late John said he could get them when he came over again. He can have them ; they are his,\u2019 and Mr. Clendennin said that to me.

That the donor did not deliver to the donee by manual tradition the supposed gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-12\">5. That the donee had the power at the time of the supposed gift to induce into his actual possession the choses in action which were the evidences of indebtedness the donor intended to forgive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-13\">6. That these choses in action were in another and non-communicating room from the donor and the donee, tied in a bundle with other securities, locked in a bureau drawer, the key of which was in the room with the donor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-14\">7. That the key to this drawer was not delivered by manual tradition to the donee, nor taken into his possession, but that he was directed to get it by the donor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-15\">The auditor held that no title vested in the donee, and surcharged both of the accountants with $2804.85, the amount of the notes and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-16\">To this finding the accountants excepted, <em>inter alia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-17\">The Court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-18\">The accountants then appealed, assigning that the Court erred in dismissing the exceptions and confirming the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-19\"><em>W.

O. llamersley, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-20\">The elements of a complete gift are: (1) Words or acts of present meaning importing an intention to give; (2) immediate surrender of dominion ; (3) acceptance by the donee; (4) irrevocability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-21\">Manual delivery is, perhaps, the most satisfactory evidence of these elements, and it may be insisted on as a matter of policy, except where these essential elements are otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>clearly and satisfactorily shown. To lay down an unbending rule that manual tradition is the only proof of these elements of a gift is to ignore the principle, and seize upon a mere technical formula. It would seem upon first blush as if the principal cases in our Pennsylvania books established the inexorable rule that no gift could be complete without a corporal delivery of the thing, or in case of a debt, of the written security; but it will be found that in all the cases the difficulty was that there were not words of present meaning, or else there was an indication of purpose not to part with the entire control of the thing or security, or its taking effect was upon some future condition or event: Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr, 100 ; Kidder <em>v. </em>Kidder, 9 C.,268 ; Mechling\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant, 158; Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Streeper, 25 P.

Smith, 52.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">The case in hand shows a present intention to relinquish dominion and irrevocability. The language and conduct of the decedent indicated this, and his pains to impress upon Julia Lilly the idea of its being a completed transaction is confirmatory thereof. The notes were placed at Horner\u2019s disposal on the night in question. lie accepted them and then left them in their place as his property. The testator, if they were still in any way in his possession, was as much a bailee or trustee as though he had gone through the mummery of taking them in his hands, depositing them in Horner\u2019s hand, and then the latter returning them with a direction to keep them for him until he came again. As a matter of convenience Horner left them where they were: Crawford\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F.
