It having been shown by the plaintiff that Kline owed Roth more than the amount of the judgment, and that it was given to secure the debt of Roth, and there being no proof that Roth was to pay the claim of the plaintiff out of the proceeds, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-26\">\u201c Fifth. No contract has been shown in this ease that can be enforced by the plaintiff, and the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-27\">\u201c Sixth. The plaintiff' cannot recover on the contract declared upon, because it is not averred that the consideration of the judgment was in part the debt of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-28\">\u201c Seventh. There is a fatal variance between the averments in this declaration and the proof, inasmuch as the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>declared upon is that the defendant would pay and satisfy\u2019 the debt of the plaintiff\", while the proof of the plaintiff is that the contract was to pay the claim of the plaintiff, if Kline, the principal debtor, could not pay;\u2019 consequently the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">\u201c Eighth, Under all the evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-7\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff seeks to recover against Jeremiah Roth upon this ground : It appears that on September 11th, 1877, Solomon R. Kline signed and gave to Jeremiah Roth what is commonly called a judgment note. It is a promise to pay to Jeremiah Roth $5000, with a warrant of attorney authorizing confession of judgment, and upon that instrument judgment was entered in this Court; and [it is alleged by the plaintiff that, at the time this judgment was given, Jeremiah Roth promised and agreed to pay this debt, which Solomon R. Kline owed to Mrs. Barn\u00e9r, and that the judgment was signed by Mr. Kline, on condition that he promised to pay said debt, and that the promise and agreement of Roth to pay Mrs. Barner was the inducement to give the judgment. If that is proved, then I say to you that the plaintiff is entitled to recover], and if it is not proved, your verdict must be in favor of the defendant, notwithstanding the fact that Kline may owe Mrs. Barner, or that Roth\u2019s name appears upon the note, or that Roth may have said that he would pay Mrs. Barner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\">* * * <em>* </em>* =K *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-10\"><em>\u201c </em>The burden is upon the plaintiff, who makes this allegation, to establish it. If the plaintiff satisfies you from the evidence in the case, that, when the judgment was givqn, it was agreed between Solomon R. Kline and Jeremiah Roth that Roth would pay the debt of Mrs. Barner, it being the amount owing on this note in suit, and that the judgment was confessed on condition that Roth would pay this claim of Mrs. Barner, and if it is proved that there was a promise or undertaking by Roth to pay the debt of Kline, which he owed to Mrs. Barner, and that that promise or undertaking induced Kline to confess judgment, the plaintiff can recover in this suit. If the plaintiff has not satisfied you that such a contract was made, and that the judgment was given upon that condition, your verdict must be in favor of the defendant. And I say to you here that there must be an absolute promise on the part of Mr. Roth. If he merely said that he would pay the note of Mrs. Barner, in case Kline could not or would not, it would not be enough to hold him ; it would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>such an undertaking as to bind Jeremiah Roth, and if you find that that was all that was said, your verdict must be in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">\u201cIf, after considering the testimony of these two witnesses upon this important and principal point in the ease, you find it is so equally balanced that you cannot say which you are to believe, whether there was a promise or not, the plaintiff has failed to make out his case, and your verdict must be in favor of the defendant. On the other hand, if you find that Kline owed the note to Mrs. Barner, which is really not in dispute, and if you find that, when the judgment was given, it was given on condition that Roth would pay this note to Mrs. Barner, \u2014 that he undertook and promised to pay it, and that Kline was induced by that promise to give the judgment, \u2014 you may find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the note, with interest, less the amount paid on account of it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">January 20th, 1882.

After referring to the testimony, the learned judge said in-substance, if the jury was satisfied from the\" evidence that, when the judgment was given, it was agreed between Kline and Roth that the latter would pay the debt due to Mrs. Barner, that the promise or understanding of Roth to pay the debt induced Kline to give the judgment, and it was confessed on that condition, then the plaintiff might recover ; but, on the other hand, if the plaintiff failed to satisfy them that such was the contract and condition on which the judgment was given, their verdict must be for the defendant. He also instructed them that there must be an absolute promise on the. part of Roth. \u201c If he merely said he would, pay the note, in case Kline could not or would not, it would not be enough to hold him.\u201d In view of the explicit instructions thus given, the jury must have found that the plaintiff in error, in consideration of obtaining the confession of judgment, promised absolutely and unconditionally to pay the balance due on the note, and that the judgment for $5000 was given by Kline on the faith of that promise. Any doubt that may have existed as to the essential features of the agreement was thus settled by the verdict. That there was a good consideration for the promise found by the jury can scarcely be doubted. The plaintiff in error, by obtaining the confession of judgment when he did, was placed in a better position than he occupied before. He acquired a lien on the real estate of his debtor, then in failing circumstances, which gave him an advantage over Mrs. Barner and other unsecured creditors. \"While he was thus benefited by the preference acquired, she was prejudiced to the extent that her chances for the security and ultimate collection of the note were impaired. Kline was not bound to prefer him to the exclusion of Mrs. Barner, or any of his other creditors, and if, for the purpose of protecting her, he gave the judgment on condition that plaintiff in error would pay her claim, coupled with an express promise to do so, it cannot be doubted there was sufficient consideration for the promise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>While the promise was not made to her, it was undoubtedly intended for her benefit. In Hird <em>v. </em>Holdship, 2 Watts, 104, it is said: \u201c A consideration is sufficient, if it arise from any act of the plaintiff\", from which the defendant or a stranger derives any benefit, however small, if such act is performed by the plaintiff, with the assent, express or implied, of the defendant; or, by reason of any damage or any suspension or forbearance of the plaintiff\u2019s right at law or in equity ; or any possibility of loss occasioned to the plaintiff by the promiseof another, although no actual benefit accrues to the party undertaking.\u201d It is not essential that the consideration should be adequate in point of actual value, for the reason that the law does not weigh the <em>quantum </em>of consideration. The presumption is that plaintiff in error could not have obtained a preference whereby Mrs. Barner\u2019s security would be lessened, if he had not assumed the payment of her claim. Again, it is worthy of notice that plaintiff in error is not merely an irregular indorser of the note described in the declaration, and which he specially promised to pay in consideration of obtaining the judgment. The note to the order of Mrs. Barner, reads: \u201c One year after date, <em>we </em>promise to pay,\u201d etc.; and is signed by both Kline and plaintiff in error ; by the former, in the usual place at the right, and by the latter on the left, under the words \u201c Credit the drawer.\u201d The declaration is not against him as maker, but the manner in which the note is signed shows he is'not a mere stranger to the debt he promised to pay.' Moreover, the note could have been regularly negotiated by Mrs. Barner, and, in the hands of her indorsee, he might have been liable on his irregular indorsement. It cannot be said, therefore, that he was so far a stranger to the note, that he was not pecuniarily interested in making provision for its payment. These features of the case are sufficient to distinguish it from those that are mainly relied on by the plaintiff in error. From what has been said, it may safely be concluded that the parol promise declared on was founded on a good and sufficient consideration, and was made for the benefit of the defendant in error. If this be so, there appears to be no valid objection to her maintaining a suit in her own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
