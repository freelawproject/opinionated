Roberts, upon which he obtained judgment for $5168.33, and under a <em>levari facias </em>the premises embraced in the mortgage were sold to Margaret B. Roberts for $11,000. After the payment of the costs and the execution-creditor, the balance of $5469.58 was paid into court, and was referred to an auditor, John B. Colahan, for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">The auditor reported the facts substantially as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\">The liens of record upon the premises sold were,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-12\">1. A mortgage from George II. Roberts to Margaret B. Roberts, dated April 10th, 1879, for $7000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-13\">2. A judgment confessed by George H. Roberts to Margaret B. Roberts, July 22d, 1879, for $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-14\">3. A judgment confessed by George II. Roberts to the Consolidation National Bank, July 26th, 1879, for $1800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-15\">4. A judgment confessed by George H. Roberts to the Manufacturers\u2019National Bank, July 28th, 1879, for $3106.60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-16\">The indebtedness of the defendant to the Manufacturers\u2019 National Bank originated December 4th, 1877. Prior to the time at which this bank took the judgment-note held by them to secure his existing indebtedness, he misrepresented to it the amount of the incumbrances on his Third Street property, which was the one sold by the sheriff, by saying that there was an incumbrance against it of $5000, and thereby obtained additional time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-17\">Margaret B. Roberts was the wife of the defendant. November 26th, 1856, the defendant, being then the owner of premises No. 1011 Arch Street, in the said city, subject to a mortgage of $10,000, conveyed them, without consideration, through a third person to his wife. At the time of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>settlement he was worth, above all debts, $50,000. The bond and mortgage of $10,000 upon this property was reduced, May 31st, 1864, by a payment of $5000 on account, of which Mrs. Roberts paid $2500. The interest was paid with her money and that of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">To prove consideration for the mortgage held by Mrs. Roberts, it was shown that she executed a mortgage for $10,000 upon the Arch Street property September 15th, 1873, to secure a bond of her husband for the same amount to the Philadelphia Saving Fund. That sum was paid by the Saving Fund September 20th, 1873, to her husband with her consent. On the same day he paid off a mortgage for $10,000 on the Third Street property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">In 1859 Mrs. Roberts loaned her husband $2500, and in 1860 the further sum of $2000. Upon these sums the interest had been paid, but not the principal. In his ledger she was credited, January 1, 1868, with $4500, and every six months thereafter, until the time of the audit, was also credited with the interest and debited with its payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">It was also in evidence that she had received, between 1859 and 1864, from the estates of different relatives, $17,301.71.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">The reduced mortgage of $5000 and the subsequent mortgage of $10,000 upon the Arch Street property remained unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\">This mortgage of $10,000 and the loans of $4500 constituted the consideration for the mortgage of $7000, upon which, with the $500 judgment, the claim of Mrs. Roberts was based, and also the consideration of another mortgage for $7000, dated April 10th, 1879, to her from her husband upon other real estate owned by him. Until April \u00cdOth, 1879, Mrs. Roberts held no securities for the indebtedness to her, and no acknowledgment of the loans. He collected her interest, invested her money, and paid her interest and taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-11\">The auditor found \u201c that $10,00Q of the consideration for the claim of the wife for $ 14,500 has been established. As to the remaining $4500, that has also been shown by loans to that amount made by Mrs. Roberts to her husband in 1859 and 1860, as airead]' stated. These loans, as well as the ability of Mrs. Roberts to make them from her separate estate, has been proven,\u201d and that it was clearly a debt due by the husband to the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-12\">He awarded the balance of $5149.58 to the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-13\">Exceptions to this award were filed by the subsequent lien-creditors. The Court, June 18th, 1881, dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The Manufacturers\u2019 National Bank then appealed, assigning as errors, 1 and 2, the dismissal of the exceptions and refusal to decree the fund to the appellant; 3, in holding that the indebtedness of George H. Roberts to Margaret B. Roberts amounted to a sum sufficient to take the entire fund; 4, in holding that the mortgage to secure her husband\u2019s bond created an indebtedness by the latter to the former; and 5, in holding that consideration for.the $7000 had been shown.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-5\"><em>Robert H.

There was ample consideration to sustain her mortgage of $7000 on the premises, and the amount awarded her fell short of that sum. Even if her husband did make a false representation to the bank when he obtained the discount, that surely can be no estoppel to her. They ought to have sought information on the subject of the amount of the incumbrances from the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
