It was to do the job. It was considered one job for twelve houses on the north side of Butler Street, and twelve on the south side. They were all alike, supposed to take exactly the same kind and exact amount of lumber for each house, and the lumber was delivered for these twenty-four houses, to be divided <em>pro rata, </em>each house alike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-11\"><em>William T.

J., entered judgment for the defendant <em>non obstante </em>veredicto, on the point reserved, filing an opinion which, after stating the facts, continued as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">\u201cUpon the trial it appeared that under a contract between the plaintiff and Asay and Roberts, contractors, dated August 1st, 1878, a large quantity of lumber, amounting in value to $4825.08, was furnished for twenty-four houses, twelve of which were on the north side and twelve on the south side of Butler Street, one of the public streets of the city of Philadelphia. Twelve of the houses were therefoi\u2019e in one block and twelve in a different block, the two blocks being separated by Butler Street. It was proved that the lumber was delivered to the contractor indiscriminately upon the credit of the twehty-four houses. No proof was given to show what proportion or amount of the lumber, if any, was actually used in the erection of the particular house sought to be charged by this claim, or that any of the lumber ordered went into this particular house. The plaintiff made out an apportioned claim against the twenty-four houses, and filed this claim as a single claim against each house. The Court reserved the point whether this claim, unsupported' by any other proof than that the lumber was delivered to the contractors upon the credit of all the houses in the different blocks, could be sustained. The question is whether, upon such a state of facts, the claim can be maintained as a valid and legal claim under the acts of Assembly and the construction which they have heretofore received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">\u201c Upon the argument, it was contended by the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>counsel that this is not an apportioned claim. It is true that if we look to the formal part of the claim alone as it was filed, rejecting altogether the bill of particulars which is annexed and made part of it, nothing is said there about an apportionment. But we are not at all at liberty to do that. The bill of particulars is an integral part of the claim, and must be read with it: Knabb\u2019s Appeal, 10 Barr, 186'; Donahoo <em>v. </em>Scott, 2 Jones, 45 ; Calhoun <em>v. </em>Mahon, 2 Har., 56; Hill <em>v. </em>.McDowell, lb., 175; McClintock <em>v. </em>Bush, 13 Smith, 203.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">\u201c Indeed, it must be apparent that if the plaintiff were to stand upon the claim alone, rejecting the bill of particulars, it could not be maintained, for \u2018 the amount of materials furnished and the time when they were furnished,\u2019 nowhere appear with sufficient certainty, except in the bill of particulars. It is for that reason, doubtless, that the plaintiff in his claim prays that the bill of particulars may be taken and considered as part of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">\u201c Looking then at the bill of particulars as an essential and integral part of the claim filed, it distinctly appears that the lien claimed is for $4825.08, and is against twenty-four buildings, twelve of which are in one block and twelve in another. \u2018 Against all of which buildings said claimants claim to have a lien for a proportionate part of the said debt.\u2019 It is, therefore, perfectly p'ain that this is an apportioned claim, and not only an apportioned claim, but, so far as the bill of particulars is concerned, it is a joint apportioned claim, although if we regard the formal parts of the claim apart from and independently of the bill of particulars, it is on its face a single and unapportioned claim. But we are bound to read the bill of particulars as a part of the claim. As has been already said, if the plaintiff rejects the bill of particulars his claim is clearly invalid for uncertainty, inasmuch as it does not comply with the statutory requisites in setting out the \u2018 times and quantities:\u2019 Bussell <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 Wr., 54; Behrer <em>v. </em>Zeigler, 8 W. &amp; S., 258 ; Lehman <em>v. </em>Thomas, 5 W. &amp; S., 262 ; Witman <em>v. </em>Walker, 9 W. &amp; S., 183.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\">\u201c Is it competent then for the plaintiff to avoid the difficulty which clearly appears in his bill of particulars, that this is an apportioned claim against houses in different blocks, by saying that the claim proper as filed is only against a single building, and is not apportioned in the claim itself? In other words, if the claim itself is clearly shown in the bill of particulars to be an apportioned claim against houses separated by a public street, and which, therefore, by no latitude of construction whatever can be said <em>to </em>be \u2018adjoining,\u2019 can it be properly treated as a single unappor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tioned claim, because it would so appear if we rejected entirely the bill of particulars ? Is it competent to make an apportioned claim against buildings in different blocks a good claim by filing such a claim separately against each building? Are separate apportioned claims against houses in different blocks good, although joint apportioned claims against buildings so situated are bad ? If the law is so, then such claims may be filed against a multitude of buildings for which materials are supplied under one contract in various and remote localities, where the materials have been furnished indiscriminately upon the joint credit of all, and the only standard of charge against each is an apportionment between all made by the claimant himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">\u201cSo far as the right to apportion claims for materials among several houses depends upon statutory authority, it is clear that the acts of Assembly contemplate only \u2018 houses and buildings adjoining each other\u2019 as proper subjects of such apportionment, and the reason assigned for permitting the apportionment in the Act of 1831 is, that as to houses so situated \u2018 it sometimes happens that it is impossible for the person who has provided materials to specify in his claim the particular house or building for which the several items of his demand were provided.\u2019 Both the Act of 1836 and the Act of 1850, where they speak of the apportionment, clearly refer to the apportionment previously authorized; that is, to the apportionment provided for in the Act of 1831, and not to any new or different kinds of apportionment. The ease of Penuock <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 R., 291, where the claims were made under the Act of 1806 and its supplement of 1808, was the case of claims filed against contiguous houses, and it was held that claims against such \u00edouses might be filed against all the houses jointly, or they might be apportioned and separate claims filed against each. Pennock <em>v. </em>Hoover, as well as the subsequent eases of Dayis <em>v. </em>Earr. 1 Har., 167, and Harper <em>v. </em>Ileely, 5 H., 234, are authorities which decide that either joint or separate apportioned claims may be filed against <em>adjoining </em>houses. But there is no case which holds that either joint or separate apportioned claims can be filed against houses not adjoining in any sense, but which are separated by streets, and therefore situated in different blocks, or which decides that any right of fixing and charging the amount of a claim by the process of apportionment exists in the cases of houses so situated. The reason assigned by the act and by the cases for permitting a charge by apportionment does not exist in such a state of things, for, as was said in Chambers <em>v. </em>Yarnall, 3 Har., 268, it is as easy to distinguish between separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>blocks as it is between separate houses in different streets. The words \u2018several houses' and buildings adjoining each other\u2019 have been construed to mean any number of buildings owned by the same person, provided they are all in progress and are all situated in the same block: Young <em>v. </em>Chambers, 3 Har., 267; Taylor <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 8 Har., 443; but in Young <em>v. </em>Chambers, and the subsequent case of Goepp <em>v. </em>Gartiser, 11 Casey, 130, followed in our own case of French <em>v. </em>Kaign, 3 W. N. C., 495, it was distinctly decided that a material-man cannot maintain a claim which rests upon an apportionment made between houses in different blocks, because such an apportionment is neither within the reason nor the letter of the acts of Assembly, nor within any previous decision. Those were cases of joint apportioned claims. 13ut the principle upon which they rest seems to us to control the present case, for, as we have already seen, the present case clearly appears by the bill of particulars to be in reality an apportioned claim against houses in different blocks, although it is ingeniously attempted to avoid the effect of that by filing a copy of this jointly apportioned claim against each house separately. There is no precedent and no authority for such a claim as this, and it would- be extremely impolitic and dangerous in practice to allow it, for if it can be done, then a contractor under a contract for the erection of a multitude of buildings in different parts of the city, no matter how remote they may be from each other and how different from each other in their dimensions and plans, may fasten upon each of the buildings a claim resting upon no certainty whatever, but depending entirely upon guesses as to the amount which should be charged to each of them, and all the proof necessary to support such a claim will be, as in the present case, proof that credit was equally given to all the houses when the contractor purchased the lumber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">\u201c The cases relied upon in the able and ingenious argument of the plaintiff, Davis <em>v. </em>Farr; Harper <em>v. </em>Keely; Fitzpatrick <em>v. </em>Allen, 30 Smith, 294; Rush <em>v. </em>Bank, 2 W. N. C., 263; Armbrust <em>v. </em>Galloway, 2 W. N. C., 585, were all, without exception, cases of <em>adjoining </em>buildings, either actually adjoining, or constructively adjoining, in the sense that they were situated in the same block. All that was decided in Millett <em>v. </em>Allen, 3 W. N. 0., 374, was that separate apportioned claims may he filed when the materials have been indiscriminately furnished for several buildings. The case is but a confirmation of Davis <em>v. </em>Farr, Harper <em>v. </em>Kelly, and the cognate cases. The record did not raise the question whether an apportionment could be made where the houses are in no sense adjoining, but situated in different blocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and separated by streets. \"Where materials are furnished to many houses, situated on different streets in different localities, it is certainly very easy to keep an account of the materials furnished for the different blocks, if not to the different houses. If a material-man will not do so much as that, and seeks to apportion a large amount, obtained by a contractor, among different houses upon different streets, surely he ought to be prepared to show by measurement, or by some similar proof, what proportion of the materials was actually supplied to the house he seeks to chai\u2019ge. Otherwise, the practical result is that the apportionment is <em>to </em>be made according to his own arbitrary will, without any regard whatever to the rights of owners, and that such an apportionment is to be supported by simply proving that a large quantity of materials was obtained by a contractor upon the credit of many buildings which he was erecting in different blocks, and that the whole was supplied to him under a single contract for a gross sum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The plaintiff then took out a writ of error, assigning as error the entry of judgment for the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-7\"><em>J.
