L. J., discharged the rule, saying, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-10\">\u201cThe grand maxim in the construction of wills is that the Court is bound to find out the intention of the testator, if it be possible so to do, and to make such construction as will effectuate that intention. This intention is to be collected not from any particular or detached clause of the will, but from the whole taken together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-11\">\u201cA careful examination of this will reveals an intention upon the part of the testator to provide \u2018equally for his children according to their respective ages.\u2019 This is shown by the legacy of the certificate of stock for one hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>shares of the capital stock of the Thomas Iron Company, to Thomas F. Butz as trustee for John P. Butz, for the \u2018purpose thus far of providing for his children equally according to their respective ages.\u2019 It is shown by the division of his estate, after deducting the devise to the widow, into three hundred and sixty-five shares, which is afterward subdivided \u2018 according to the respective ages \u2019 of his children. In point of fact, his estate is not divided equally among his children. He takes into consideration in the division their ages. Flow he arrives at the different fractions of his estate, how be apportions the different shares according to the ages of his children, is not apparent from the will, but that the calculation is based upon an effort to provide for them equally in the division of 'his estate, having in'view the difference in their age, is manifest throughout the whole will. After the division of his estate into four parts, \u2018according to the ages of his children,\u2019 the \u2018 bequest to John Peter Butz and his children\u2019 is not devised to John Peter Butz, but in part to Thomas F. Butz in trust for John Peter Butz, after his death in trust for the children of John Peter Butz, and after their death to their children, and in part to the use of the children of John Peter Butz with remainder to their children. This is a difference as to the disposition of \u2018the bequest to John Peter and his children,\u2019 not a difference as to the amount he and his children would receive. Even if the intention to provide equally for his children was not apparent from the will itself, it has been held \u2018 that when the meaning of a will is doubtful, the rule of equality among children must be taken as a guide to its interpretation:\u2019 Malone <em>v. </em>Dobbins, 11 Harris, 296; Weber\u2019s Appeal, 17 Penna. Stat. Rep., 474; Minter\u2019s Appeal, 40 Penna. Stat. Rep., 111. We start, therefore, by finding that it was the intention of the testator to divide his estate into four shares, making the only difference in the shares the one based upon the difference in years of his four children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">\u201cThe testator charges all the \u2018notes,bonds,mortgages, or other obligations, of whatsoever nature or date the same may be,\u2019 held against his children, against their respective shares of his estate, \u2018 except the judgment which I hold against my son, John Peter Butz.\u2019 Why does he make this distinction between this particular debt of his son John and the debts due from his other children? Is it because he means to discharge the debt due from John in the judgment, and thus give to John $4200 more than to the other children? This is contradicted by the intention of the testator, manifested throughout his will, to make the only difference in the four shares the difference in age of his four children. He devises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>nothing to John Peter Butz from which the judgment could be deducted; one of the four shares the testator devises to John Peter Butz, his children and grandchilden, providing that the said John Peter Butz shall have the'interest on but $11,000 of said share, and no more. The residue of this share being devised in trust for the children of John Peter, with remainder to their children, \u2018 which is to be the bequest for the benefit of my son John Peter Butz and his children.\u2019 The testator speaks of this as being the bequest to John Peter Butz and his children. It does not say this together with the judgment which I hold against him shall be the bequest, but speaks of this portion as \u2018 <em>the </em>bequest.\u2019 For some reason, which does not appear from the will, the testator does not desire to permit his son, John Peter Butz, to control the principal, or any portion of the principal devised for the benefit of himself and children, and hence it would appear that he desires this judgment paid by his son John, and, if not paid, then collected by legal process from the real estate upon which it is a lien, and the bequest for the benefit of his son John and his children to remain intact, in such shape that he cannot expend any portion of the principal of said share. The testator does not mention in any way the judgment in connection with the bequest to his son John Peter Butz and his children. He does not except the judgment when he directs that his estate, after deducting the devise to his widow, \u2018shall be divided into three hundred and'sixty-five shares, to be distributed among his four children, . . . according to their respective ages.\u2019 This balance so to be divided includes all the notes, bonds, mortgages, and other obligations due from all the children, and, before directing the same to be divided as set forth in the third section of the will, he directs that this balance shall be converted into money, or its equivalent. A literal observance by the executor of this item would necessitate the payment by each legatee of the debts due from him, and the receipt by him of his entire share without any charge against it. Seemingly to avoid this, lie directed in the fourth item of his will that all notes, bonds, etc., due from any of his children shall be deducted from their share. In point of fact, he directs his executor to take such debts into account as assets of the estate, and afterward to deduct the amount from their share in the distribution, without actually collecting them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">\u201c \u2018Except the judgment due from John Peter Butz.\u2019 That is, the balance of his estate is to be converted into money and divided, etc., etc. The debts due from the legatees shall not be collected from them, except the judgment due from John Peter Butz. Therefore the judgment against John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Peter Butz, under the third item of the will, will have to be converted by the executor into money, or its equivalent, and be divided with the rest of the estate as is therein directed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">The defendant then took out a writ of error, assigning that the Court erred in not granting the prayer of the petitioner to set aside the execution, and to restrain the plaintiff from issuing execution in the future.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-7\"><em>Edward J. Fox, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">The decision is based on the idea that the testator meant to divide his estate equally among his children. There is nothing in the will to warrant the assumption. The fourth and third clauses show that the fund to be divided was to be composed of the proceeds of sale of his realty and personalty, of the stock specifically bequeathed in trust, and of the obligations held against his four children, with the one exception of the judgment held against John Peter Butz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\">In the opinion of the Court below, the testator intended to have his son sold out by the sheriff* and deprived of a home, and has not awarded him the privilege of having the debt set oft* against his legacy as he did in the case of the other children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">This interpretation causes the amount of the judgment, when received, to be added to the residuary fund and distributed, which the will says plainly shall not be done: 2 Williams oh Executors, 1119; Eden <em>v. </em>Smyth, 5 Yesey, 341; Aston <em>v. </em>Pye, 5 Yesey, 350.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-11\"><em>Morris L. </em>Kauffman, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-12\">Doubt might arise under the fourth clause if alone, but the construction must be that which is consistent with the whole scheme of the will: Middleswarth <em>v. </em>Blackmore, 74 Penna.

The shares were to be proportioned according to the respective ages of the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-14\">Taking the scheme of the testator and all the other provisions of the will into consideration, <em>the fourth article </em>should be construed to mean, that all claims against his children who receive their portions absolutely should be deducted from their respective shares, but the share of John Peter Butz being given entirely into the hands of trustees, he has no share from, which the judgment can be deducted, therefore the executor is to collect the same according to the <em>thii'd </em>article, which directs that \u201call the rest and remainder of my property, whether real,personal, or mixed, I order and direct that my hereinafter named executor convert into money, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>its equivalent, for tbe benefit of my estate, . . . to be divided into three hundred and sixty-five shares,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">If the testator had intended to extinguish the debt, and release John Peter Butz from the obligation to pay the judgment, the testator would have excluded it from the assets of his estate, which he directs to be divided into three hundred and sixty-five shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">Under the will, none of the claims which the testator held against his children are to be excluded from the assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">If John Peter Butz would have been released from the payment of this judgment, then he would have received $4200 more than the one hundred shares, as his portion, and consequently the decedent\u2019s estate would not have been equally divided among his children according to their respective ages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\">The testator distinctly says in the eighth article, that the one hundred shares are \u201c to be the bequest for the benefit of my son John Peter Butz and his children.\u201d Nowhere in the will does it appear that he is to receive in addition thereto the $4200 secured by the judgment: Malone <em>v. </em>Dobbins, 11 Harris, 296; Weber\u2019s Appeal, 17 Penna.
