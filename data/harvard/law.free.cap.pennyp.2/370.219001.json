J., plaintiffs gave the following facts in evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-11\">Plaintiff's are in the lumber business, and occupy and have occupied since February, 1870, Pier No. 44, north of Laurel Street, in the City of Philadelphia, under leases from the owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-12\">By Act of Feb. 25th, 1861, P. L. 43, relating to the city of Philadelphia, it is provided: \u201c And the said councils shall continue the- culvert intended to drain Cohocksink Creek, by the shortest practicable course from Front Street along the said creek or canal, and any of the streets hereby authorized to be laid out or already established, into the river Delaware, and upon the completion of the said culvert, and opening the streets so laid out or extended, the said councils are further authorized to fill up the said creek or canal to the proper grade, and declare vacated such parts of it west of Delaware Avenue as may not be occupied by said culvert, or made a part of any of the streets so laid out, in such manner and at such time as they may deem expedient. Provided, that if the said councils decide to construct said culvert on Laurel Street, the owners of property shall be exempt from the usual charges for culverts,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>By ordinance approved April 24th, 1868, the city councils authorized a contract for the construction of \u201c a sewer from the east side of Front Street upon the open channel of the Cohocksink Creek (Canal Street) to Laurel Street, thence in said Laurel Street to the Delaware River, with its branches.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">Under this authority the city entered into a contract for the sewer, in 1869, and it was completed in March, 1872. The sewer drains 1600 or 1800 acres north and west of plaintiffs\u2019 wharf, and there are many manufactories along it. Cohocksink Creek was walled up and its whole drainage turned into the sewer. Its terminus is very near low-water line. It could be carried out further into the river, to the wardens\u2019 line. Engineers differ in opinion as to the propriety of so carrying out sewers. When plaintiffs took possession of their wharf in 1870, there was sufficient water on the south side in the dock to receive and discharge large-sized vessels. The effect of opening the sewer was to till up the dock with debris and stuff. At low-water mark it became bare from one side to the other. The city dredged it out in 1874, but in four months it filled up again. With water in the dock, two vessels of five hundred tons burden could be moored there, at a wharfage of five dollars a day each. The ordinary daily discharge from the sewer is about three feet deep. It caused the filling of the dock. It is quite offensive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">Upon this evidence the Court entered a judgment of non-suit, and subsequently, January, 8th, 1881, discharged a rule to take off the nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">The plaintiffs then took out a writ of error, assigning as error the refusal to take off the judgment of nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-9\"><em>John R.

L., 43, authorizes the councils of the city of Philadelphia to continue the culvert intended to drain Cohoeksink Creek, from Front \u00a1Street into the river Delaware. In 1869, the city entered into a contract for the building of the culvert. It was finished in 1872, the mouth being at the low-water line of the river, at the foot of Laurel Street. The plaintiffs\u2019 wharf, held by lease, is materially injured by the tilling of the dock, on its south side and in front of the street, with matter discharged from the culvert. Upon these facts the Court entered non-suit, which judgment is the specification of error. The plaintiffs\u2019 title to the land does not extend beyond the low-water line. Outside that line his right is subject to the control of the Commonwealth under her laws. Neither allegations nor proof show want of care or skill in the construction of the culvert, nor that it drains a larger district than was contemplated by the statute, nor that it casts any substance on the plaintiffs\u2019 land. The alleged nuisance is in the river, where the title is in the Commonwealth, and -where the statute authorized the city to place the mouth of the culvert.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The principle is well settled, that a municipal corporation is not liable to an action for consequential damages to private property, unless it be given by statute, where the act complained of wms done under a valid act of the legislature, and there has been no want of reasonable care or of reasonable skill in the execution of the power, although the same act, if done without legislative sanction, would be actionable: Dill, on Mu. Corp., \u00a7 781; O\u2019Connor <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 6 Har., 187; Allentown <em>v. </em>Kramer, 23 P. F. S., 406. Nothing appears in the evidence to take this case out of the operation <em>of </em>that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
