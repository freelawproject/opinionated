The fact that a policy of insurance was made out in the name of a married woman, and that she was in possession of the goods insured at the time of the fire, was, in a suit by her on the policy, <em>prima facie </em>evidence, as against the defendant, of her ownership.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-13\">2. A policy of fire insurance provided that \u201c the assured should, if required, submit to an examination or examinations under oath, by any person appointed by the company, and subscribe thereto, when the same is reduced to writing.\u201d An agent of the company testified that he met the husband and agent of the assured, and requested him to produce her. He further testified: \u201cI said we desired to transact our business with her. He said he would do just as well, he was her husband; we could not see her, and, if we did,' she didn\u2019t know any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>thing about it, and wouldn\u2019t give us any information.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that this was not evidence that the assured had refused to submit herself to examination under oath.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b141-4\">3. The Court charged the jury: The rule of law is that, when a company receives proofs of loss and makes objections to them, they are bound by the obj\u00e9ctions they make; and if these objections are met in the next proofs of loss, and the company then remain silent, they cannot afterwards raise new objections which existed at the time the first proofs were furnished. If, therefore, the 'Company did retain proofs of loss dated 22d of March, 1879, and remained silent in regard to the invoices alleged not to be furnished, and made no objections thereto, the company are to be considered as waiving the defects as to form. <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b141-5\">4. The defendant company offered to prove by its agent that the husband and agent of the assured <em>\u201c </em>gave him a list of the parties and their places of business, from whom he alleged he had purchased the goods insured, and said to him he did not believe these firms would give him the bills, and directed him to go to these firms and get the bills for the goods ; that the witness did take these names and places of business and go to them and ask them for bills, which they refused to give because no goods had been sold to A. (the agent) or the assured, and therefore they were unable to give such bills.\u201d The Court admitted the evidence only so far as to show that the agent of the assured gave the names of the parties from whom he alleged he had purchased; that the witness went to them, and that they refused to give the bills of invoice. <em>Held, </em>that the excluded testimony was hearsay and incompetent, and that the assured was not bound by the answers.</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b141-6\">Before Sharswood, C.

The fire occurred February 23d, 1879. The same morning I notified the agent, Smith. I got the policy in August, 1878. Smith issued them. I got it about the 10th of August for Mrs. Betty Ackerman, my wife. Smith was there when the policies were issued, and he looked over the stock and machinery. Ve had taken an inventory about August 1st, 1878. The value of the stock of goods at the time of the fire amounted to between $15,000 and $16,000. That includes machinery. Take about $2500 for machinery out of it, and that will tell the goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">In rebuttal he testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">\u25a0 \u201c Geiser bought in the property for Mrs. Ackerman. She \u2022gave a check for it from her money. The property was in the factory and remained there. She was in possession of it. The goods Betty Ackerman bought were stored here in this building, $16,900 worth. They were moved back into the factory and went in there, and what were not sold were there at the time of the fire. What was left at the time of the fire can be seen by the inventory.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\"><em>Jacob Geiser, </em>for the plaintiff, testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">\u201cI was bookkeeper and done the shipping, August 1st, 1878.

I assisted in removing them. I think it was in May or J une, 1877. I know about how much we moved back, and I know about how much was there. I think there was about $15,000 worth at the constable sale of Ackerman &amp; Co., Limited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Mrs. Ackerman told me to buy tbe goods in for her and she would pay for them.

She paid for them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\">There was evidence that plaintiff' sent proofs of loss to the defendant four or five days after the fire. March 14th, 1879, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff\u2019 as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">\u201c Upon examination of the papers submitted to the office purporting to be proofs of loss in case of policy No. 301,874, issued to you through the Scranton agent of the company, I beg to give you notice that the same are imperfect, and cannot be admitted or received as proofs of loss owing to the' following defects, to wit: The papers are not sworn to by the party assured. Second. The papers allege that the actual cash value of the property destroyed, referred to in schedule A, to be $13,452.27. This schedule is defective, inasmuch as it does not set forth properly the'cost, present sound value and damages on each article therein enumerated, or otherwise support the statement made as to the actual damage, as is required by the terms and conditions of the policy. Third. The papers are defective, inasmuch as they do not set forth the names of the different parties occupying the premises previous to the fire. Fourth. The papers do not state that the interest of the assured was the sole and unconditional ownership of the property alleged to have been destroyed. The papers submitted being so imperfect and incomplete as that they do not comply with the terms and conditions of the policy, you are therefore notified .that the same are not accepted or received as proofs of loss by this company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">Further proofs were sent by the plaintiff March 22d, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">Counsel for defendant called <em>J.

Ackerman arrived, and his counsel, Me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Kune, arrived there with those three books, \u2014 those two and another book, \u2014 and he proposed to go on at once with the examination of those books and ascertain his loss. I said to Ackerman that I understood his name was David Ackerman, and he was not the party .we wanted to see at all. Who was Betty Ackerman? He said Betty Ackerman was Mrs. Betty Ackerman, his wife. I said we desired to transact our business with her. He said he would do just as, well; he was her husband; we could not see her, and, if we did, she didn\u2019t know anything about it and wouldn\u2019t give us any information. Upon consultation with my colleagues, Knowles and Goodrich, we concluded to go on and examine these books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">\u201cQ.

I asked him to produce his stock book, his sales book, his cash book, his ledger, his previous inventory, and all the papers in support of that inventory. He said he could not produce the vouchers in support of the inventory, but would give the names of the parties from whom he purchased goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-15\">\u201cQ.

He said he could not do it; I don\u2019t know that they will furnish me the bills, but I will give you the names and you can go and see the parties and get the bills. I said it is not my business to get these bills, but inasmuch as they are in New York, and it will be easy for me to see these parties, I will, and I went in pursuance with this arrangement, with Ackerman, to see these parties; X have a list of the names of the parties \u2019he gave me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-17\">^Q.

As to their reason it is no evidence. They cannot be bound by conversations given by them in New York.

Did you waive it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-9\">\u201c A. No, sir, I didn\u2019t waive it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-10\">There was much testimony produced by both plaintiff and defendant as to the value of the property destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\">Counsel for plaintiff asked the Court to charge :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-12\">\u201c That, by receiving and retaining, without objection, the proofs of loss dated 22d March, 1879, furnished to them by the plaintiff, the defendant has waived any objection he might have thereto, and said proofs are to be taken as received in form and substance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-13\">The Court answered : \u201cVe answer this as follows: [The rule of law is that when a company receives proofs of loss and makes objection to them, they are bound by the objections <em>they </em>make, and if these objections are met in the next proofs of loss, and the company then remain silent, they cannot afterwards raise new objections, which existed at the time the first proofs were furnished ; if, therefore, the company did retain proofs of loss dated 22d March, 1879, and remained silent in regard to the invoices alleged not to be furnished,- and made no objections thereto, the company are to be considered as waiving the defects as to form.] We, therefore, affirm this point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-14\">Counsel for defendant asked the Court to charge, <em>inter alia :</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AE1\">\u201c 6. If the jury believe from the evidence that the assured refused to present herself for examination under oath regarding the fire and loss and damage resulting therefrom, as required by the condition of the policy, there can be no recovery, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-15\">Answer of the Court: \u201c As a general proposition, we affirm this point. It was obligatory upon the plaintiff to present herself for examination, if she was demanded, as required by the clause referred to in the policy which we have read to you. But, we say further: the plaintiff, Betty Ackerman, must have had distinct and actual notice that this clause of the policy is brought to bear upon her. She must have distinct notice that the company request her to submit to examination under oath by a person appointed by the company, and then she must have refused to appear. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>not enough that the agent should say,\u00a3 I wish to see Mrs. Ackerman,\u2019 and for him to answer, \u2018 He acted for her, and there was no necessity in sending for her,\u2019 and the company did not by actual notice, apprising her of the demand, insist upon her appearance. That is not enough; they should say distinctly and give her notice distinctly of what they wanted her for. I do not think, gentlemen, that the evidence in this case is sufficient to bring the defendant or the plaintiff within this clause of the policy. If, however, you differ from us on the evidence in this regard, and the evidence shows you that the plaintiff had distinct notice that the company was demanding their rights under this clause of the policy ^ then you may find as this sixth point requests us to charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEL\">The Court further charged the jury, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\">\u201c On such a contract the plaintiff sued. She must, in order to recover, satisfy you first that she was, at the time of the fire, the sole and unconditional owner of all the property she seeks to recover for, and that it is covered by the description of the property mentioned in the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\">\u00a3\u00a3 In the first place, she must satisfy you that she has complied with all terms of the contract made obligatory upon her by the language thereof, or that, if she has failed in the compliance, the defendants have waived or excused, or the law has excused her therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">*******</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">\u201c [Now, has the plaintiff shown a loss under this policy ? This is a question of fact for you. In the first place, has the plaintiff proved to your satisfaction that she owned this property? The testimony in this case before you is that which is produced by the policy itself, that which is produced by the witnesses, particularly Mr. Ackerman, Mr. Geiser, and by all the testimony in the case bearing upon the subjuct of ownership, whatever it may be. We say to you that possession is <em>prima facie </em>title, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership.] This question is a question of fact for you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">\u201c The next question is, if this plaintiff owned this property, what amount of loss has she sustained ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\"><em>\u201c </em>[The defendant claims that the goods were not there: the amount of the goods that the plaintiff claims; that the plaintiff has dealt unfairly with them by asserting the stock that did not exist. Have they sustained their case in this particular ?] It is all for you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">\u201c The plaintiff took the policy for $2500 concurrent, with three others. The plaintiff swears to the amount of his goods; refers to his inventories, invoices, etc., which he says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>are correct. As we have said before, the defendant shows by persons, who were in the store shortly before the fire, that they did not consider there was such a stock there as the plaintiff has sworn to. They show by Mr. Neal, who had a conversation shortly before the fire with Mr. Ackerman, and he said he had a small stock, also by other witnesses that the stock appeared to be small.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">\u201c Now, gentlemen, around this point is the main controversy. It is alleged, on the part of one side, that this plaintiff is perpetrating a fraud upon this defendant; they claim to have shown to you enough to sustain it. Upon the part of the plaintiff, they claim to have shown conclusively to you the amount of goods that were there, as fully and as completely as it was possible to show the state and existence of the stock of goods that has been destroyed, or mainly destroyed by the fire.

Verdict for the plaintiff for $2471.32, on which judgment was subsequently entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">The defendant then took out a writ of error, assigning as errors the portions of the charge within brackets, the answer to defendant\u2019s sixth point, the answer to plaintiff\u2019s point, and the rejection of the evidence as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-8\"><em>Lemuel Amerman </em>and <em>Henry H. </em>Hess, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\">1. No recovery can be had upon a policy against loss by fire, unless the insured has an interest in the subject insured at the time of the loss, and that interest must be averred and proved: Howard <em>v. </em>Albany Ins. Co., 3 Denio, 301; Murdock <em>v. </em>Chenango Ins. Co., 2 Comst., 210; Eowler <em>v. </em>New York Ins. Co., 26 N. Y., 422; Illinois Eire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Marseilles Mfg.

Have they sustained their case in this particular?\u201d could but mislead the jury. It was equivalent to saying that the defendant must prove that the stock claimed for was not there. The defendant is liable for the full amount of the policy, unless they show you that the stock they insured in the policy was not in the fire, or not destroyed. The assured must not only prove that there has been a loss, but he must also prove its amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-12\">3. The request to the agent of the assured to produce her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>was absolute and certain. The refusal was just as absolute and certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-4\">4. Where a policy contains a clause requiring the assured to produce \u201c certified copies of all bills and invoices, the originals of which have been lost,\u201d the condition must be complied with, or it must be shown that it was impossible for the assured to do so, or that its performance was waived: O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Ins. Co., 68 N. Y., 111.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">These certified copies of bills and invoices the learned judge confused with the proofs of loss, and instructed the jury that if no objection was made to the proofs of loss, and having remained silent in regard to the invoices alleged not to be furnished, the company are to be considered as waiving the defects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">5. The Court refused to admit the answers of the parties to Mullikin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">It was the assured\u2019s duty to furnish these bills and invoices. The company did not relieve her from this obligation, but expressly told her that it was not the business of the company. Mullikin acted for the assured in this matter. This was the only effort of the assured to obtain them. In this she failed. No goods having been sold to Ackerman or the assured made it impossible for her to obtain them. The reasons why bills and invoices could not be furnished by the parties from whom the assured alleged she had purchased through her agent in this matter, would have been the most conclusive evidence of the fraudulent claim of the assured.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-8\"><em>JE.

It was certainly a fact for the jury, and fairly submitted to them, whether the stock of goods insured did in fact exist. There was no evidence, as the learned judge rightly held, that Mrs. Ackerman had refused to submit herself to examination under oath. The answer to the plaintiff\u2019s point, as to waiver, was undoubtedly right, as was the ruling of the learned judge in the rejection of the evidence. The agent, who inquired of the persons in New York, was the agent of the company, and there was nothing in the plaintiff \u2019s reference to them, which bound him by their answers. So far as the evidence was rejected, it was merely hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
