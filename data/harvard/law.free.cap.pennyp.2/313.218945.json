Snyder, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Catharine Thurston, deceased, filed a bill in equity in the Court below against Ira Shipman, administrator of Abraham Shipman, deceased, setting forth that Catharine Thurston, in May, 1877, was seised of certain real estate, and that letters of administration upon her estate were granted to Abraham Shipman, who presented a petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court asking for an order to sell the said real estate for the payment of debts.; that, January 9 th, 1878, the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered him to sell the said real estate, and directed him to enter into bond in the sum of $800, and approved of Ira T. Clement as surety; that, on J anuary 10th, 1878, the administrator and surety executed a bond to the Commonwealth, but that the scrivener who drew it, by mistake, omitted the word \u201chundred \u201d after the word \u201ceight\u201d in the penal sum, so that it purported to be a bond in the penal sum of $8; that the administrator and surety, intending to comply with the order of the Court, by executing a bond in $800, executed the bond as drawn without perceiving the mistake; that, under an order of the Court, of January 18th, 1878, reciting that a bond in $800 had been filed, the administrator sold the real estate, which sale was confirmed, and a deed was made to the purchaser, and $720.19 were received by the administrator; that Abraham Shipman, the administrator, died, and the defendant, Ira Shipman, was appointed his administrator; that Abraham Shipman died insolvent, having in his hands $650.51, proceeds of the sale of the said realty; that the complainant was appointed administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Catharine Thurston, and had demanded the said sum from Ira Ship-man and Clement. The bill prayed that the bond be reformed so as to read $800 instead of $8, that Clement pay the sum of $650.51, and further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\">The answer of Ira T.

At the time said bond was signed, Abraham Shipman merely stated \u2018that he had a small estate to settle up, that did not amount to anything; that he had a bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to give/ and asked me to go on it as surety, but have no recollection whether any sum was mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">Before the examiner appointed to take the testimony, <em>Uriah Bloom </em>testified, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">\u201c This bond was drawn kt the request of Abraham Ship-man, and at the time of drawing it he signed his name to it, and told me that he would leave it in my possession for Mr. Clement to sign, that Mr. Clement was to go on as bail. In the course of several days, it may have been a week, I don\u2019t remember exactly, Mr. Clement came in and told me that Mr. Shipman had requested him to sign a bond in the Thurston estate. At the time he came in, I was working at a desk standing in the corner near the door, and the bond was in a package of papers lying on the table, which was behind the railing. He told me that Mr. Shipman had requested him to sign a bond in the Thurston estate. I told him that the bond was in the package lying on the table ; he walked to the table and took up the package and took out the bond. Whilst he was doing that, he remarked that he believed the bond was to be in the sum of $600. I told him that it was a bond for $800, that the Court had so ordered it. He took the bond to another desk, that was standing in the office against the railing, too, and there signed it without my going over to him or leaving my work. He said, also, at the time that I told him that the bond was to be in $800, that he did not so understand it at the time that Mr. Shipman requested him to sign it; that he, Mr. Shipman, had told him it was only to be for the amount of $600.

The reason is, that the surety is not discharged by the loss of the bond, and the Court only relieves against the accident by setting up the evidence of the debt: Brandt on <em>Suretyship and </em>Guaranty, section 118, Kerney\u2019s Administrators <em>v. </em>Kerney\u2019s Heirs, 6 Leigh (Ya ), 478 ; East. India Co. <em>v. </em>Boddam, 9 Yesey, 464 ; also, \u2018 where the contract does not express the agreement or intention of the parties to the injury of the obligee, and this is clearly made to appear, equity will reform the instrument against sureties' as principals: \u2019 Brandt on <em>Suretyship and </em>Guaranty, section 118; Olmstead <em>v. </em>Olmstead, 38 Ct., 809; Besore <em>v. </em>Potter, 12 S. &amp; R., 154; and again, under same section of Brandt on <em>Suretyship and Guaranty, </em>we find as follows: \u00a3 A trustee, having in his hands funds arising out of the property sold under decree of Court, became delinquent-, and having wasted the fund died intestate, having before committed breaches of his bond, for which both he and his sureties would have been liable at law if he had lived, a claimant of the fund in the hands of the trustee could not place himself in a position to proceed at law on the bond because of the death of the trustee. Held, equity would afford him relief on the bond against the sureties. There was a clear right against the sureties which could not be enforced at law because of the accident of the death of the principal, and the fact that there was a right, and no remedy at law, was sufficient alone to give equity jurisdiction.\u2019 The law on this subject was well and concisely stated by the Court as follows: A court of equity will do nothing to extend the liability of securities beyond the clear intent and import of their contract. But if to such an extent they cannot at law be held liable by reason of fraud, accident, or mistake, a court of equity, to prevent a failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of justice, will interfere and enforce the execution of their contract according to their obvious meaning and design:\u2019 Brooks <em>v. </em>Brook, 12 Gill &amp; Johns. (Md.), 306. One need go no further for authority for assuming that a surety, under certain conditions, stands on precisely the same footing as his principal, and the only question that can remain is, whether those conditions exist in this case or not. Can a security to an administrator bond be held to the express terms of an order of Court? He is no party to the petition, it is true, but his name is presented to the Court as surety, and if he afterwards sign the bond, it may certainly be presumed, with perfect justice, that he willingly makes himself a party to the whole transaction. In the absence, however, of any authority on this point, if the intention of Ira T. Clement, surety in this case, can be satisfactorily established by parol evidence of what occurred at the execution of the bond, equity will surely be warranted in interfering to enforce the said bond \u2018 according to its obvious meaning and intent.\u2019 Parol testimony of what occurred \u2018 at or about the time \u2019 of execution can be offered to correct a mistake in a written instrument: Penshaw <em>v: </em>Gans, 7 Barr, 117...... The master has already found, as a matter of fact, that the weight of the evidence is against Clement, as to whether he was informed at the time of the execution of the bond, what amount the Court had fixed as the condderation in the said bond. Clement does not deny anywhere that he knew he was signing a bond in the Thurston estate. He nowhere states what his intentions were as to the bond than that he \u2018 intended to sign no other bond than the one he did sign.\u2019 This is his statement in his answer to complainant\u2019s bill, and again in his answer to complainant\u2019s interrogatories, and also in effect in his testimony before the examiner. These facts being established, it is the opinion of the master, as already previously stated, that Ira T. Clement signed the said bond believing it to be drawn in the sum of $800, and could therefore have intended to sign a bond in no other sum than the sum ordered by the Court. In only one way is it possible to suppose that Clement, being informed of the sum ordered by the Court, intended to sign a bond drawn in any other sum, and that is by supposing that he discovered the sum in which the bond was actually drawn, and concealed the knowledge of it; and even were this so, and proven, it would only change the case from one of mistake to one of fraud. Believing, then, that Ira T. Clement intended to sign a bond drawn in accordance with the order of Court, a court of equity would not \u2018 extend his liability \u2019 by reforming the mistake made by the scrivener, because, had there been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>mistake made, he would unquestionably be bound in law for the amount due the Thurston estate; and, if equity does not interfere to correct the mistake, it will be impossible to enforce the bond \u2018according to its obvious meaning and intent.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">\u201c Your master, therefore, for reasons set forth, respectfully recommends that a decree be made that the bond be reformed against Ira T. Clement, respondent, in such manner as shall afford the relief prayed for by the complainant, Peter II. Snyder, in his bill in equity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">The defendant, Clement, excepted to these findings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">The Court below, Rockefeller, P. J., dismissed the exceptions, confirmed the report, and decreed that the bond be reformed by inserting the word \u201c hundred \u201d after the word \u201c eight \u201d in the penal sum, filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">\u201c The Court ordered a bond to be given in the sum of eight hundred dollars, and approved of Mr. Clement as bail. In .drawing the bond the clerk, by mistake, filled up the blank by inserting \u2018eight dollars\u2019 instead of \u2018eight hundred dollars.\u2019 It is clear from the evidence, and the master so finds, that the parties intended to execute a bond for eight hundred dollars. The mistake of a scrivener in preparing a writing maybe shown'by parol evidence and the instrument reformed accordingly. Such reformation is an exercise of the equity powers of all our Courts. Equity relieves against mistake as well as against fraud. It is not pretended there was any fraud in this case, but there was a plain mistake.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">Clement then appealed, assigning that the Court erred in dismissing the exceptions and confirming the report, in reforming the bond, in assuming that the parties intended to execute a bond for $800, and in stating broadly, in a case where the intention of the parties is disputed and the evidence conflicting, that \u201c the mistake of a scrivener in preparing a writing may be shown by parol evidence, and the instrument reformed accordingly,\u201d and that \u201c such reformation is an exercise of the equity powers of all our Courts.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-10\"><em>8.
