(2) The transaction was with Hager, and Dunn was not a party to it. (3) It was without consideration. (4) No authority is given by the Board of Directors to any one authorizing the release of the mortgages.

The $130.03 were paid and \u25a0 received in the discharge of a pre-existing debt, and the only effect it had was to settle that debt, for which the association had security. The alleged parol release, if made, was conditional: Reiser\u2019s Appeal, 2 W. N. C., 515.

All the association agreed to do was to satisfy their mortgage upon receiving a new one on the land exchanged. Even if there was an agreement by the association, it was without consideration. The payment of the interest due by Hager could form no such consideration. It was money which the association were entitled to receive, and whether paid by Hager, or by Dunn under the arrangement with him, made no difference to the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">J udgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
