The parties themselves could not be witnesses \u2014 neither Mr. Thom, the defendant, nor his wife \u2014as to anything that transpired at the time the note was given ; neither could Mr. Edward Clarkson testify as to anything that transpired prior to the death of his father. The law which permits parties to a suit to become witnesses, excepts from its operation this class of witnesses, and therefore the mouths of both the plaintiff and the defendant are sealed as to any transactions which occurred affecting this judgment, excepting those which transpired after the death of James Clarkson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-14\">\u201c You have, then, to rely, as we have already said to you, upon the testimony of the defendant as offered. As to the consideration which moved to the giving of this note, it has been alleged by the defendant that this note was reluctantly and unwillingly given by him for the purpose of protecting his wife in the enjoyment of her home, and it has been suggested that, being so given, it would be valid as between the parties, as it was given to defraud creditors. There is nothing in this case, as we understand the evidence, that, at the time this note was given, Samuel Thom was indebted to anybody except James Clarkson, nor that he contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>incurring any indebtedness or undertaking any hazardous business which would have been likely to render him liable to have judgments entered against him. If that was the fact, and Mr. Clarkson, who was his only creditor, consented, he would have a perfect right to make a settlement upon his wife to such an amount as they in their judgment deemed proper, for the benefit and protection of his wife, and it would have been perfectly legal and binding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-3\"><em>\" </em>Evidence has also been adduced in i\u2019egard to the transactions between these parties, and respecting the judgments obtained from the year 1863 down to the judgment, of $4154.29. Those judgments were offered in evidence, with the further offer on the part of the plaintiffs they would show that they had entered into and constituted a part of the judgment of $4154.29. The offer of the plaintiffs was to show that those judgments, which had been entered in 1863, some nine or ten years before the giving of this judgment, were constituted parts of this judgment given on the 14th of March, 1872. There is no evidence in the case of any settlement between James Clarkson and Samuel Thom at the time, of the giving of this note. Indeed, if you discard the evidence of Ann Sheppard, you have no evidence of what transpired between these parties: it does not appear whether any settlement was made at all or not; [but there is no positive or direct evidence that the judgments that had been entered years before, and which had lost their lien upon the property of Samuel Thom, were embraced in the judgment of $4154.29; consequently, we can relieve your minds of any difficulty in regard to those by saying that they need not enter into your consideration. It was perfectly competent to Mr. Clarkson, when he took this note, to have forgiven or discharged the obligations which he had against Mr. Thom up to that time, or to have done it,at any time between the giving of those notes, and the taking of the four thousand dollar note Whether he did so or not, there is no evidence before us, on the one side or the other; and, as there is no evidence that they constituted a part of or basis for this note, it seems to us that they cannot enter ipto the consideration of this case.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">\u201c [It is further alleged, and the testimony of James Gay tends to prove the fact, that in 1870, or 1871, he saw in the possession of James Clarkson, the deceased, a note for $3500, made by the defendant, Samuel Thom. We make the same remarks in regard to that note that we have made in regard to the old judgments to which we have just referred.] There seems to be no evidence that the note of $3500 entered into the computation or consideration of the judgmentof $4154.29. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Indeed, if yon take the note of $3500, the judgment of $1252, and the judgment of $1029, and the judgment of $352, you will have an amount largely in excess of $4154.29. Then, you have in evidence that subsequently to the entry of those judgments in 1863, and 1864, and 1867, and along there, a sale\\vas made by Mr. Thom, the defendant, of his personal property, and that somewhere about $1000 was realized, which, it is alleged by him, went into the hands of Mr. Clark-son. And we may here remark, that the transactions between these parties are peculiar in their nature. They do not seem, either of them, to have kept any accounts. They do not seem, either of them, to have passed receipts, or to have transacted business-as ordinary people transact business. That may arise from the confidential relations that existed between them, or it may arise from some other cause which the jury may find from the evidence. But it is apparent that, while they had a very large amount of transactions, in one way and another, they have not at any time, so far as the evidence in this case goes to show, made any settlements or had any balancing of accounts or anything of the kind. If, as is alleged on the part of the defendant, and as appears slightly, perhaps, in the evidence of Ann Sheppard, the relations of Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Thom were such as are indicated, he may, as a <em>protege </em>of his, have provided for him from time to time, helped him to accumulate the property he had ; and, if so, he had an undoubted right to do it without let or hindrance from anybody, because a man may do what he pleases with his own property. It was perfectly proper and competent, as we have said, for James Clarkson to have remitted any or all indebtedness that may have existed between him and Samuel Thom \u2014 that is, from Samuel Thom to him \u2014 prior to 1872, and to have taken a judgment for the protection of Thom\u2019s wife, under the circumstances which have been detailed before you, if he did so. That, however, is a question purely for you, gentlemen of the jury. It is a question of fact, and the turning-point in the case\u2014 whether this note was taken, at the time it was executed, for the benefit of Mrs. Thom, and to protect the property of Samuel Thom from being squandered by him in his occasional condition of inebriation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">\u201c This case, like all others, is to be passed upon by you upon the evidence adduced. You are to separate the evidence in the case from the allegations of the one side and the other, or the insinuations of the one side or the other, and you are to approach the investigation of the ease with a sincere desire to do justice, and a determination to do justice between these parties. You are to take all the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the order in which it has been detailed before you, and- examine it carefully and considerately and dispassionately, without fear, prejudice or favor. You are to judge of the credibility of the witnesses, and of their truthfulness, by their manner of testifying, their means of knowledge, and by their apparent candor and fairness in testifying, as well as from their general appearance upon the stand. You are to judge of all the evidence that has been offered, so far as it may bear upon the ease, and, taking all the evidence in the case, you will ascertain whether, at the time the note was given, it was given for the purpose which we have suggested or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">\u201c Certain legal points have been submitted to us by the plaintiffs, upon which we are requested to instruct you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">\u00a3\u00a3 (1) The plaintiffs are not required to prove the consideration of the note, on which judgment was entered. The record sho wrs a <em>prima fade </em>indebtedness on the part of Thom to Clark-son, of the amount of the judgment, and the burden of proof is on the defendant to show there is in law no valid debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">' \u201c This is a correct proposition of law, and we affirm it. We have already affirmed it in our general charge. In the opening of the charge, we said to you that, being a record of the court, it -was, <em>prima fade, </em>an indebtedness, and valid, and it devolved upon the defendant to show its invalidity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">\u201c(2) If Thom was indebted to Clarkson by note, judgment or otherwise, prior to the giving of the note in suit, such indebtedness is, in law, presumed to continue until it is proved to have been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-8\">\u201c This, as a naked proposition of law, we affirm. But we must qualify it in so far as that we refer the matter to the jury to ascertain, under the transactions between these parties, whether that indebtedness remains or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-9\">\u201c (3) If Thom was indebted to Clarkson, when said note was given, the note was .a settlement of the amount due in the nature of an account stated, and is conclusive, unless a mistake in the settlement is proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-10\">\u201c This proposition we affirm, with the qualification that, if the jury find from the evidence that such indebtedness was embraced in the $4000 note, then it is conclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-11\">\u201c (4) Though a note, given with intent to delay or hinder the collection of the maker\u2019s debts, may be impeached by Ms creditors, it is good as between the parties. Hence, if the note in this ease was given for the purpose of creating a lien on Thom\u2019s property, to the prejudice or in fraud of creditors, it is good between the parties, and the want of consideration is no defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-12\">\u00a3\u00a3 This is a correct proposition of law, but we do not recall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>in our recollection of the evidence, any testimony tending to show any intention on the part of James Clarkson and Samuel Thom to defraud creditors. \"We refer it, however, to you, gentlemeu, to ascertain, under this- point, whether there is any evidence showing intent on the part of these men to defraud creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-3\">\u201c (5) A note, given with intent to delay or hinder the collec - tion of debts which the maker may thereafter contract, stands on the same footing in law as if given with intent to delay or hinder the collection of debts already existing. lienee, if the note, in this case, was given with intent to delay or hinder the collection of any indebtedness on the part of Thom, either existing at the time, or th$t might thereafter be contracted, it is good in law as between the parties, and the want of consideration is no defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\">\u201c This point we negative, for the reasons that we have given you in our general charge, that, if Thom was not indebted at the time, and was not contemplating indebtedness, or entering upon a hazardous undertaking that might involve him in debt, he had a- right to settle upon his wife such amount as might be prudent and judicious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">\u201c (6) The character of a note as to fraud is fixed by the intent with which it is given, and the purpose for which it is designed, and not by the actual existence or non-existence at the time of indebtedness on the part of the maker. Hence, if the note, in this case, was given with intent to delay or hinder creditors, it is good as between the parties, whether there was any existing indebtedness on the part of Thom or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">\u201c This is a correct proposition of law, and is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">\u201c (7) If the character of the note as to fraud depends on the actual existence of indebtedness on the part of Thom when it was given, the giving of the note with intent to delay or hinder creditors, creates a presumption that such indebtedness existed. The plaintiffs are not bound to prove an indebtedness, but the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that there was none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-8\">\u201c This is also affirmed as a proposition of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-9\">\u201c (8) The defendant having failed to establish a legal defence by the evidence offered in his behalf, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs for the amount of the judgment, with interest from the date of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-10\">\u201c This proposition we negative. We decline to so instruct you. We have already referred it to you as a question of fact to be ascertained, and do not propose to take away from the jury the right of passing upon the questions of fact which belong to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6YK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201c (9.)

The defendant having acknowledged in the affidavit made by him, on which the rule to open the judgment was granted, that when the note on which judgment was entered was given he owed Janies Clarkson $400, and that said note was for the benefit of and belonged to Mrs. Thom, excepting the $100 which defendant owed James Clarkson, and there being no evidence and no allegation that the same has since been paid, the plaintiffs are entitled at least to a verdict for the said indebtedness of $400, with interest from the time the note was given, 14th of March, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">\u201c This would seem to be a fair proposition, and should be affirmed, unless the jury find that such sum was not included and intended to be included in the note, or from the evidence of the witness Melville of the declaration of James Clarkson, just prior to his death, that this note of $4154.29 was given without consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">\u201c We will say to you, in regard to the fifth proposition, that if there were any evidence in this case tending to show that there was any intent on the part of James Clarkson and Samuel Thom to defraud creditors, this would be a sound proposition of law; but, as there has been no evidence offered showing any such intent, we cannot see how that question can euter into your consideration of the case at all. It is not alleged on the part of the plaintiffs, or of the defendant either, that this judgment was given for the purpose of delaying, hindering, or defrauding creditors. It was either given for the benefit' of Mrs. Samuel Thom, or else it was given for a subsisting and <em>bona fide </em>debt. \u2022 [If you shall find that it was given for the benefit of Mrs. Samuel Thom, and the plaintiffs now seek to divert it from that purpose and recover for the use of the estate, your verdict will be for the defendant.] If, on the other hand, you find that it was honestly given for a fair, subsisting debt between the parties, you will find for the plaintiffs for the amount of the note, with interest from the time the judgment was entered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWkA\">Counsel for plaintiffs excepted to the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGa\">May 11th, 1881.

The points, with relation to the judgment having been given to hinder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>delay and defraud creditors, are inapplicable, because there was no evidence to support them, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider them. The plaintiffs\u2019 tenth point should have been affirmed if there had been any evidence to show that the indebtedness of $400, due by Samuel Thom to James Clarkson, was. included as part of the'consideration of the judgment. The Court below left it to the jury to determine-this question, affirming the point unless the jury found that this indebtedness was not included in the note. The jury have found by their verdict that it was not included, and for this finding there was sufficient testimony in the case. The points in relation to the old indebtedness of the defendant to the plaintiff in the judgment, and as to its constituting part of the consideration thereof, were properly answered by referring the whole subject to the jury. Of course, whether it had been previously paid or yet remained, and whether it constituted any part of the consideration of the note in controversy, could only be questions of fact, and, as such, they were necessarily left to the jury. The only remaining question was, whether there was any actual consideration for the note other than those above indicated? None was proved, and, against the inference arising from the mere fact of the execution and delivery of the note, testimony was given which, if believed by the jury, was quite sufficient to show there was none. The only witness who was present at the execution of the note testified directly and positively that it was given reluctantly by the defendant at the solicitation of Mr. Clarkson, the plaintiff, and of Mrs. Thom, the defendant\u2019s wife, without any consideration whatever, and upon the express statement by the plaintiff that it was \u201cfor no value received.\u201d The witness details the circumstances, from which it appears that the defendant had been on a spree, and there was apprehension that he had been indorsing notes for strangers, and, in order to preserve a home for the defendant\u2019s wife, he was induced to sign the note without any consideration from Clarkson. Samuel Melville, another witness, testified that the plaintiff, Clark-son, asked him to tell Mr. and Mrs. Thom to come out and get a large note he held against him, and also their will, which was in his possession, that he repeated this request several times, and in the course of the conversation told the witness that he held a large note against them for no value received. This occurred shortly before Clarkson\u2019s death. The credibility of both these witnesses was left to the jury with proper instructions, and the jury have found by their verdict that there was nothing due to Clarkson on this j udgment. As there was no evidence that Clarkson furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>any money to Thom when the judgment-note was signed, or conveyed to him any property, real or personal, or had any settlement faith him at that time, it is quite apparent that the jury had sufficient warrant for their finding in the testimony. With the credibility of the witnesses we have nothing to do. That was exclusively for the jury. It was suggested that if the judgment-note was given for the benefit of the wife, the plaintiffs, as administrators of James Clark-son, could enforce it in any event,and were therefore entitled to a verdict and judgment, and could then be called upon by Mrs. Thom to account to her for the proceeds. Had the plaintiff's admitted the trust, and proposed to have the judgment marked to her use, there would have been much force in this suggestion. But instead of any such concession, the plaintiffs were endeavoring to enforce the judgment as the property of James Clarkson and for the benefit of his estate. This claim was in direct antagonism with any such trust, and presented the plain issue whether there was anythiug due to James Clarkson in his own right. That issue it was the clear right of the defendant to contest, and he could not be disqualified from making such contest upon the theory that his wife was the equitable owner of the judgment, unless the ownership was either asserted or conceded as a reply to his defence. Moreover, if the plaintiffs were allowed to recover a general verdict and judgment in this proceeding, it would be impossible to know whether it was because he owed the money to James Clarkson in his own right or as trustee for the defendant\u2019s wife. In order to raise that question, a distinct issue should have been presented in the Court below, by the plaintiffs, so that there should be no confusion or uncertainty in the event of a recovery as to the right in which it might be had. As the issue was made up, Mrs. Thom was asserting no right as equitable owner of the judgment, nor were the plaintiffs asserting any such title. It follows, therefore, that the Court below was not in error in directing the jury, that if they found that the judgment was given for the benefit of Mrs. Thom, and the plaintiffs were seeking to divert it from that purpose and recover for the use of the estate, the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-4\">Sharswood, C.
