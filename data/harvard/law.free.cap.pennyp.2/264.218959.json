The January freshet of 1841 carried away a bridge which had been there. In the fall of 1858 the defendant put there some large stones, with poles and straw on them, to keep frost out of the wheel-house of the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-16\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter alia :</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-17\">\" The contention between the parties is as to the location of the road or right of way granted by this deed. The defendant claims that the description in the deed fixes the location of the road in its relation to the mill and race \u2014 where it is to cross the race \u2014 above the mill and across the race at the forebay. The plaintiff contends that the road, as granted by the deed, crosses the race below the mill, being across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>that part usually called the tail race, immediately where the water from the wheel passes from under the grist-mill. The deed from Heller and Clark calls for the fifty feet on the race which leads to the grist-mill, on the north side of the race; and on this fifty feet the Dimmicks erected their fulling mill and carding machine. The deed also grants the privilege of water in said race sufficient to keep in operation a fulling mill and carding machine, and provides that the water is to be taken from said mill-race near a certain stump on the bank of the race. Evidently this means that the water is to be taken from the head race. Then follows next in order the grant of the right of way in these words: \u2018 Also a privilege of a road to cross said race near said grist-mill to the land above described, and from thence to the main road ;\u2019 and then follows the grant of a privilege in these words: \u2018Also the privilege of a tail race for the fulling mill about to be erected by the parties of the second part to intersect the main creek near the tail race of said grist-mill; also the privilege of the bank of the tail race from said grist-mill to the main creek for the purpose \u2022\u25a0of erecting tenter bars for dyeing cloth/ Evidently the parties intended that the road should pass near the grist-mill, whether it should be located above or below the mill. In the description of the land and the water privilege the deed calls for the race leading to the mill, and then come the words \u2018 also a privilege of a road to cross the said race-near said grist-mill/ Said race, this is the same as \u2018the aforementioned race.\u2019 That would be the race leading to the grist-mill; or, in other words, the head race. [There is, however., some ambiguity in the description of the road, and as to the intention of the parties, and I don\u2019t feel at liberty to give you positive instructions that the plaintiff is bound to cross the race above the mill, and will leave the question of the location of the road to be determined by the jury under all the evidence in the cause. The question has respect to the intention of Heller and Clark and the Dim-micks, when the deed of June 1st, 1833, was made and delivered.] The plaintiff contends that the use of the road across the tail race, immediately at the mill, by the Dim-micks and himself, shows that it was intended by Heller and Clark that the road should be there. The fulling mill was erected in 1833 or 1834. The owners of the fulling mill used this road across the tail race from the time of the completion of that mill down to January, 1841. This is admitted by the defendant. It is also admitted by the defendant that the owners of the fulling mill used this road from 1858 to some time in 1876, excepting three years, from 1862 to 1866, when there was no business carried on by the owners of the fulling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>mill in consequence of its having been burned down. The plaintiff alleged that he continuously used the road below the mill from the time he went there, in 1845, down to 1876. From this user of the road the plaintiff contends that the jury will be warranted in finding that the grant of the road as understood and located by the parties was across the tail race below the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">\u201c The defendant, relying upon the description in the deed as indicating the head race, contends that the fact of the use of the road below the mill does not show an intention on the part of the grantors, Heller and Clark, to have the road located across the tail race; that that road having been made and a bridge placed across the race for the use of the owners and customers of the grist-mill, and happening to be there, when the fulling mill was erected, the owners of the fulling milL simply used it because it was convenient for them to do so ; and, further, the defendant alleges that in January, 1841, the bridge was so damaged by a high freshet that it could not be used, and was not passed over with teams, and so remained until 1858, when the defendant, or his predecessors in title, erected the present structure, not for use as a bridge, but to protect his water-wheel from frost; and that the owners of the fulling mill during, those seventeen years did not cross the tail race immediately below the mill with teams, but'at a point lower down where the two tail races of the fulling mill and grist-mill intersect. From these facts the defendant argues that the use by the plaintiff' and his predecessors in title of the road below the mill was simply for their convenience, and by sufferance of defendant and his predecessors in title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">\u201c [Now we propose to leave to you, gentlemen of the jury, the question of the true location of this road across the race of the grist-mill, as granted by Heller and Clark to the two Dimmicks.]; The plaintiff has given in evidence the deed from John A. Dimmick to him, dated May 1,1857, in which this road or right of way is described as crossing the tail race. This deed conveyed to the plaintiff no greater or other right than Dimmick had. If Dimmick did not then have the right of way across the tail race, by virtue of the deed from Heller and Clark, he could not grant a right of way at that point to the plaintiff. [We are therefore thrown back to the deed from Heller and Clark to the two Dimmicks to ascertain the location of the road. You must fix the location of the road from that deed, in the light of the acts and conduct of the parties contemporaneous with and subsequent to the making of the deed.] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>December 20th, 1881. Yerdict for the plaintiff for $37.91, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">The defendant then took out a writ of error, assigning that the Court erred in admitting in evidence the deed from Dimmick <em>et al. </em>to Proctor, in admitting evidence of the use of a highway across the tail race, and in those portions of the charge within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-7\"><em>L. M. Burson, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-8\">The plaintiff could in no way get a right from Dimmick unless he had the right to convey. Before the deed was evidence this must have been shown: Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Rosenberger, 3 W. N. C., 16 ; evidence of what took place at the tail race was entirely irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-9\">There was no ambiguity in the description of the deed, and it was error for tlie Court to leave the whole question of facts and law to the jury: Potts <em>v. </em>Wright, 82 Penna. State, 498 ; Beatty <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 2 P. F.

It does not state where the road is to cross the race. The road obstructed by the defendant crossed the \u201c said race \u201d immediately below the mill. It was a clear latent ambiguity : Phila. Life Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>American Life, etc., Ins. Co., 11 Harris, 65 ; Stub \u00ab.

State, 99.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-12\">The parol evidence was conflicting, and it took the whole case to the jury : Edelman <em>v. </em>Yeakel, 3 Casey, 26 ; Miller <em>v. </em>Fichthorn, 7 Casey, 252; Reynolds <em>v. </em>Richards, 2 Harris, 205; Beatty <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 2 P.

Under such circumstances, parol evidence was clearly admissible and the contemporaneous construction of the parties was entitled to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">We think, therefore, that the question was fairly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
