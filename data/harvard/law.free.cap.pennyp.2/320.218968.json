Fox, leased, under seal, to Allegaert the dwellings and stores Nos. 204, 206, 208, and over No. 208J North Eighth Street, in the city of Philadelphia, for the term of five years, at the rent of $4250 per year, to be paid in monthly portions in advance. Smart was the owner of a number of properties on the west side of Eighth Street, extending from Race Street to Maple Street, and the lease provided, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201c the said John Smart agrees not to rent any of the remaining stores from Race to Maple streets for the millinery business during the term of this lease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">Upon the 1st of October, 1879, a month\u2019s rent of $354.16 became due, and for this sum the defendant distrained. Allegaert did a large millinery business, and took in from $400 to $800 a day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">About August 20th, 1879, Fox, as agent for Smart, rented to David Hertzman a store on the west side of Eighth Street, adjoining that of Allegaert, and in it Hertzman carried on the millinery business until about October 22d, 1879. At that time Fox gave him $100 to surrender his lease. He did a small business, amounting to from $5 to $30 a day. His door was between Allegaert\u2019s window and his own, and the show-window of Allegaert\u2019s store appeared to belong to the store he occupied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">Counsel for plaintiff produced as a witness an employe of the plaintiff', and asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">\u201c (J. To what extent was Allegaert\u2019s business interfered with by Ilertzman\u2019s store ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">The question was objected to, and the objection sustained under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-11\">Allegaert testified, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-12\">\u201c I would not have made the lease if he had not put that clause into it, not to rent the other stores for the millinery business. I could not answer what the difference in rental value between my store with Hertzman carrying on business next door and without him. I would not rent it at all without that clause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-13\">The evidence for the defendant was substantially, that Smart was in ill health ; that his wife attended to his business ; that he did not know this store was rented for a millinery store j that Hertzman\u2019s store was seven or eight feet wide by twelve long; that on learning of the mistake Fox paid Hertzman $100 to get out; and that the rental value of Allegaert\u2019s store was not affected more than five dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-14\">Smart said, <em>inter alia : </em>\u201c I would not have had that clause against renting the other stores for the millinery business for ten thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Counsel for the plaintiff asked the Court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">\u201c That if the j ury find that the Hertzman store was rented for the millinery business, and the millinery business was carried on in the store leased by Hertzman at the time of this distress, then the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">The Court refused this point, and charged the jury, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">\u201c The lease to Mr. Hertzman was executed by Mr. Eox during the absence of Mr. Smart, and without his knowledge, and without knowledge upon the part of Mr. Eox at the time of the condition in Allegaert\u2019s lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">\u201c Although there was no bad faith on the part of Mr. Fox or Mr. Smart, the leasing of the adjoining store to Mr. Hertz-man was a violation of the agreement previously made with Allegaert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">\u201c [This, however, did not release Mr. Allegaert from the payment of rent. He could not remain and. pay nothing, but he may be entitled to a reduction.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-10\">\u201c The measure of which reduction is the difference between the rental value of the premises occupied by Allegaert after Hertzman took possession of the store leased by him and the rent reserved by the lease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-11\">Counsel for the plaintiff excepted to the charge and the refusal of the point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-12\">Verdict for the defendant, rent in arrear $300 and value of goods $500, upon which judgment was subsequently entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-13\">The plaintiff then.took out a writ of error, assigning as errors that part of the charge which is in brackets, the refusal of the point, and the exclusion of the testimony to which objection was made as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASO\"><em>Theodore F. </em>Jenkins, for plaintiff\u2019 in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-15\">The violation of the condition cannot be compensated for by damages, and would, on that account, be restrained in equity: Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, see. 722 a.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-16\">At law, the landlord is precluded from recovering his rent because he is a wrong-doer: Vaughan <em>v. </em>Blanchard, 1 Yeates, 175 ; McClurg <em>v. </em>Price, 9 P. F. Smith, 420; Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, sec. 380.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-17\">The interruption of the enjoyment of the privilege constitutes an eviction: Peck <em>v. </em>Hiler, 24 Barb., 178; Etheridge <em>v. </em>Osborn, 12 Wend., 529.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-18\">As to the measure of damages: Bitner <em>v. </em>Brough, 1 Jones, 127; Hoy <em>v. </em>Gronoble, 10 Casey, 9 ; Garsed <em>v. </em>Turner, 21 P. F. Smith, 56.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>William, G. Harinis, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">This case is governed by Obermyer <em>v. </em>Nichols, 6 Binn., 159 ; Fairman <em>v. </em>Fluck, 5 Watts, 516 ; and Prescott <em>v. </em>Otterstatter, 29 Smith, 462.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">Where no bad faith is charged-and it plainly appears that the breach of covenant was not wilful or intentional, it is analogous to the case of a partial eviction by title paramount, where, when the tenant remains in possession of part of the premises, he must pay a fair rental value of the premises actually occupied by him: Seabrook <em>v. </em>Moyer, 7 Norris, 417; Beed <em>v. </em>Ward, 10 Harris, 144; Linton <em>v. </em>Hart, 1 Casey, 193.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">And even when the landlord is unable to deliver possession of all the premises demised by reason of the wrongful holding over of a former tenant; yet if part be accepted and used and enjoyed, the tenant must pay a fair rental value for the part so used and occupied: Smart <em>v. </em>Allegaert, 8 W. N. C., 217 ; affirmed by the Supreme Court, 10 W. N. C., 29.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-9\">That the Court below was correct as to the measure of damage is abundantly shown by the cases of Sehujdkill Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; B., 411; Fairman <em>v. </em>Fluck, 5 W., 516; Prescott <em>v. </em>Otterstatter, 29 Smith, 462; Smart <em>v. </em>Allegaert, 8 W. N.

The breach of the covenant by the landlord was certainly no forfeiture of the right to the rent. Nor could the damages be set off in replevin. The only effect, according to Fairman <em>v. </em>Fluck, 5 Watts, 516; Warner <em>v. </em>Caulk, 3 Whart., 193; and Prescott <em>v. </em>Otterstatter, 29 P. F. Smith, 462, was, that there should be a reduction of the amount of the rent, proportioned over the whole period of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
