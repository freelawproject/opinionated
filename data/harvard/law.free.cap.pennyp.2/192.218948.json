H. Ainey and Milton Appel, assignees for the benefit of creditors of John L.

Hoffman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">Counsel for the administrators objected to the claim, on the ground of want of jurisdiction upon the part of the auditor to investigate it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">The auditor reported, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">About May, 1858, John L. Hoffman and William H. Hoffman became partners in the lumber business, under the firm-name of J. L. &amp; William H. Hoffman, and continued such until about the year 1870, when the firm was dissolved, but no final settlement -was made of the firm\u2019s accounts. In the sp'ringof 1873 AYilliam H. Hoffman died, and in the summer of 1877 John L. Hoffman died. No settlement was made, and balance struck of the affairs of the firm, during the lifetime of AYilliam H. Hoffman, nor was there a settlement made and balance struck between John L. Hoffman and the administrators or legal representatives of AYilliam H. Hoffman during the lifetime of the said John L. Hoffman. But it is now contended, on behalf of the estate of John L. Hoffman, that, on a final settlement of the affairs of the firm, there is a balance due the estate of John L. Hoffman, deceased. To prove this all the books of the firm, showing the dealings and transactions of the firm, and of the partners with each other, and with the firm from the formation of the partnership until its dissolution, are offered in evidence. And this is all the proof there is in the case on this subject. An examination of the accounts in these books, of the dealings of John L. Hoffman with the firm, and William H. Hoffman with the firm, and with each other, show an indebtedness of AYilliam H. Hoffman to John L. Hoffman, amounting to $5763.95, which, with interest added to date of filing this report, $1729.18, amounts to $7493.13. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>conclusion the auditor has come to from ail examination of the books of the firm, aided by certain statements and abstracts made of the books by James Hausman, Esq., one of the most competent accountants in this community. The auditor attaches no copies of the entries in the books from which he arrives at this conclusion, because both parties interested in this controversy stated that they did not desire it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-4\">The auditor decided that he had jurisdiction, found the balance due, with interest, to be $7493.14, and allowed a <em>pro rata </em>distribution on the claim of $3053.22. He made, however, an alternative distribution, in case the Court should be of opinion that he had not jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">An exception was filed, <em>inter </em>alia, to this finding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">The Court below, Sassaman, A. L. J., sustained the exception^'saying, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">One thing is quite certain ; the Orphans\u2019 Court is a creature of the statutes, and in them we must look for its power. The Common Pleas is our common-law Court, and has power in all matters of law not provided for by statute, in the State of Pennsylvania, so far as remedies in that Court have been developed, leaving to the equity side of it. such matters for which the law remedies are insufficient. This makes that Court a Court of general jurisdiction with us. The remedies known in that Court are always to be invoked when the statute provides no other. Whenever there is a statutory remedy, that must be followed, and whenever a statute is made in derogation of common-law rights, such statute must be strictly construed. Confronted with these principles, it is well known to us, as a matter of law, that the remedy at common law for account between partners is an action of account-render, or, by reason of its cumbersomeness, a bill in equity, on the equity side of the same Court, the latter being the more favored remedy,-by reason of the greater flexibleness of the processes used in such a proceeding, and the chances of more correct and reliable results. Such an action has always been considered rather too complicated in the necessary details for a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">The principle is universally recognized that one partner cannot, on a claim before partnership settlement, maintain an action at law for the debt against another for anything received on partnership account, or for any! hing relating to partnership transactions while the partnership affairs remain unadjusted, on the ground that it would be impossible to determine whether anything be due the plaintiff, until an account of the partnership matters is taken : Ozeas <em>v. </em>Johnson, 4 Dallas, 434; Patton <em>v. </em>Ash, 7 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 116; McFad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>den \u00ae.

L., p. 190, Purdon\u2019s Digest, 1103, and by the Act of 14th April, 1834, \u00a7 52, P. L., p. 351, Purdon\u2019s Digest, 1103, having its powers more specially defined by the 19th section of the Act of 16th June, 1836, P. L., p. 792, Purdon\u2019s Digest, 1104, pi. 8, and by the 1st section of the Act 13th April, \u20181840, P. L., p. 319, Purdon\u2019s Digest, 446, pi. 200. These acts declare that there shall be holden and kept in every county of this State, a court of record styled the Orphans\u2019 Court, having all the qualities and incidents of a court of record at common la\\y, and the jurisdiction of the several Orphans\u2019 Courts shall extend to and embrace the distribution of the assets and surplusage of the estates of decedents, after the settlement of the proper amounts among the creditors and others interested, and it is made the duty of the said Court to appoint auditors on the application of any creditor, heir, legatee, or other person interested in the distribution, to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>distribution to and among tbe persons entitled to the same. \u201c These general terms of the act, it is said, embrace creditors as well as heirs, next of kin, and legatees. The right to be heard by \u00e9ach in support of his claim, and in opposition to every claimant who interferes with it, is necessarily involved in the right to demand payment out of the fund. The power to decide all questions necessary to a proper distribution of the fund follows the power of distribution, and rests in the Orphans\u2019 Court as a necessary incident of the jurisdiction 5 Harris, 416, Xittera\u2019s Estate; Bull\u2019s Appeal, 12 Harris, 288 ; Dundas\u2019s Estate, 23 P. P. t\u00ed., 474; Gochenauer\u2019s Estate, 11 Harris, 460.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">In matters of distribution of decedents\u2019 estates, the Orphans\u2019 Court alone has power, and, although this Court is of limited jurisdiction, when it is once invoked its power is commensurate with its duties: Shollenberger\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris, 337 ; Whiteside <em>v. </em>Whiteside, 8 Harris, 473; Black <em>v. </em>Black, 10 C., 354; Mussleman\u2019s Appeal, 15 P. E. S., 480.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">It thus appears that the powers of our Orphans\u2019 Court are really large, and comprehend a remedy for very many and various subjects of dispute in the settlement and distribution of estates. Yet, with all these powers directly conferred and inferred by the construction put upon the acts of Assembly that the essentials for making distribution must follow the power contemplated, we fail to find anywhere that the Courts have assumed in the settlement of one estate to settle another estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">It seems to us that the separate estate of a firm, with its a-\u2019sefs and liabilities, is just as much an independent estate as the estate of any individual. A firm is usually a partnership of individuals, who join together their capital for purposes of trade and manufacture to be used and carried on by a common management. All the parties entering in the enterprise must usually either contribute money, material, labor or skill for the conduct of the business. All that is contributed is liable for the debts or losses in the first instances, and, in case of the success of the joint adventure, \u2022 then they may share in the profits. If all the liabilities of the concern are satisfied, and when all the assets are collected, then the partners can make final settlement with the firm, and each may then draw from what is left. Before that, no one has anything to get from such firm but by common consent, and he becomes chargeable to the firm for what he thus gets. If the members have not contributed equally from their means, or ifithe said members have drawn in unequal amounts from the said firm, the members cannot claim to equalize the inequality directly from each other. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>anything in this way can be done, there must be an adjustment and settlement of the partnership matters \u2014 as we, for the purposes of this case, call it \u2014 a settlement of the estate of the firm. And just here is where the difficulty, raised by this exception, comes into its greatest pinch. For, although as we have seen the claims of partners <em>inter sese </em>caiinot be collected from each other by an ordinary suit at law until a balance is fixed, and that for this purpose bills in equity are preferred, and we have also ascertained that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court has large and various powers for aiding in the distribution of a decedent\u2019s estate, we are still driven to the conclusion that in order' to make settlement and distribution of one estate, it cannot, by its equitable powers, reach over into another estate, and make settlement of that estate so as to settle the accounts of a partnership firm and adjust rights and liabilities of partners <em>inter sese.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">In order -to entitle the estate of John L. Hoffman to have distribution out of the estate of William H. Hoffman, it is first necessary to establish and fix the claim of the former. This cannot be done until the partnership is settled and adjusted. The debts must be paid, the assets of the firm must be ascertained, the profits and losses must be balanced. Until all these things are done, it is not known how the firm stood. The auditor does not say he did this, and until it is shown that this was done, no one can say what the indebtedness of William to John was. All that the auditor says .about it is that he finds the balance due with interest to be $7498.13, without presenting an account of the dealings of the firm ; without finding that all firm-debts were paid ; without finding what assets were left of the firm ; without finding what each of the members of the firm had put in or drawn out; without stating whether there was profit or loss in the business. All these are certainly matters of great importance, to be ascertained before the auditor could come to any satisfactory conclusion in ascertaining a final and fixed balance due from one partner to his fellow-partner. In our estimation, the auditor attempted too much, and we could not sustain this part of his report. We think that this part of his report went beyond the powers of his appointment, and beyond the powers and jurisdiction of the Court, which appointed him, and which, in this particular, could not assume a concurrent jurisdiction of an action of an account-render or a bill in equity, with the Court of Common Pleas. The burden of settling such an account should also not be put upon the estate of any one of the partners of a firm, but it should be borne by the firm itself before the true balance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>or against any one of such partners can be properly and finally determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\">The assignees then appealed, assigning as error, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Court erred in sustaining the exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>R.
