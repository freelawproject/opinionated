He then proved by the city clerk and his deputy, that the tax of Ira Tripp was assessed on real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-17\">The defendant presented no testimony, and asked the Court to charge the jury that, under the evidence in the case, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-18\">The Court charged the jury <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-19\">\u201c The Act of Assembly makes the registry of the taxes evidence of the claim of the city. The plaintiff has shown a registry of the taxes in this case; the only question is whether it was a tax upon real estate. He has put in the duplicate of the city in the hands of the treasurer of the city, shows from the evidence that it is a tax upon a certain class of property which is only rated as real estate, as stated by the witness. He has also put in the assessment books in the different wards in which this tax is levied, showing an assessment against this defendant in these wards upon real estate. Upon this showing, we think, the plaintiff has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, and is entitled to recover the amount of taxes shown, with interest upon the same from the time of the registry of the taxes down to the present day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-20\">\u201c [The defendant claims there is nothing to show where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>this property is, that it is not properly defined, properly described, and that there is nothing to show here that this tax is a lien upon any particular real estate, that the plaintiff' is obliged to pursue strictly in all respects the Act of Assembly which has been passed relating to city taxes, in a claim of this kind, where he sues personally against the defendant.] All these questions we hold against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">\u201cWe hold as matter of law that the plaintiff' makes out her claim when she has shown an assessment upon real estate, and a registry of the taxes, and the production of that in evidence here. It is not a question of lien. If this was a <em>scire facias </em>upon this claim, by which they were pursuing any particular real estate, then the points made by the defendant might have some foundation ; but this is not an action of that kind, it is an action of debt against the defendant. The defendant would be entitled to show in this case as part of the defence that a mistake had been made, that he didn\u2019t own real estate, or that it had been conveyed to other parties prior to the assessment. Of course it would relieve him of the taxes. But a conveyance subsequent to the assessment of the taxes would not show a release from liability. It is provided in this very act that no conveyance of real estate, dividing up of real estate and apportioning it among different owners, shall affect the personal liability of the owner from the time of the assessment for the whole amount of tax, and costs and commission for delayed payment. [Taking this whole act together, we think the plaintiff has made out her case and is entitled to recover. You will, therefore, render a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of two hundred and forty-four dollars and twenty-eight cents, and the interest.] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">January 20th, 1882.

N. C., 199; Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Oluley, 16 P. F. Smith, 449.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-11\">The assessment does not show the particular property against which the tax is assessed, and even the assessor was \u25a0not called to show what land was assessed. The duplicate furnished the city treasurer does not show any particular real estate, and the so-called lien filed by the city-solicitor does not even show that the tax is on any real estate, but combines taxes, both school and city, for different years, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>taxes for two different years, and in three different wards. The so-called amendment allowed by the Court is not filed as an amendment to the lien, but is filed in this suit, and the Court calls it an amended statement. But there is nothing to sustain it or to found it on, and it does not even state in what State or city the land is situated; yet the city solicitor, with nothing to base it on, assumes to say that the tax is on the real estate' designated by him, which, in his opinion, is the proper real estate to levy the tax on. This suit is an action of debt on a lien, and the foundation of the action must be in a proper and legal form before any action can be sus: tained on it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-4\"><em>1.
