Kirkpatrick, Jr., and Maderwell Kirkpatrick, trustees, against Daniel Buck, James Buck, and William W. Lee, to restrain the defendants from removing certain machinery bought by them at a sheriff\u2019s sale, from an iron foundry, which had been purchased by the complainants upon a sale under a <em>levari facias </em>on a mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-13\">After answer filed, the case was referred to T. F. Jenkins, as examiner and master, who reported the facts substantially as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-14\">Louisa Weieke was the owner of a three-story brick building and kiln, for burning limestone, and lot of ground, buildings and lot of ground, and also a factory and lot, all on New \u2019 Market Street, in the city of Philadelphia. She joined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>her husband, Edward Weicke, in a mortgage of these premises to the complainants, to secure a bond of $15,000 of even date, given to them by Edward \"Weicke. The latter was then in possession, and shortly afterward converted the premises into a boiler manufactory. Machinery necessary for carrying on such a manufactory, consisting of planers, lathes, presses, cutters, etc., were erected by him. The l\u2019elation of landlord and tenant did not exist between them, but Edward Weicke took possession, with the consent of his wife, for the purpose of establishing the factory, and there was no express agreement between them as to whether or not he had a right to remove the tools and machinery. Ther&lt;j was no evidence as to whether or not he intended that these tools and machinery should become and remain attached to the premises as part of the freehold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">A <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the mortgage, judgment was obtained thereon, and the premises were sold by the sheriff, January 6th, 1879, under a <em>levari facias, </em>to the complainants. At the sheriff\u2019s sale, Edward Weicke gave no notice that he, intended to claim the machinery as his personal property, and that it would not pass to the purchaser. A sheriff\u2019s deed was delivered to the complainants January 25th, 1879. After the sale, two writs of <em>fieri facias </em>were issued upon separate judgments against Edward Weicke, and a levy was made upon the tools and machinery, which were sold thereunder to the defendants, Daniel Buck and James Buck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">The other defendant, Lee, was the deputy sheriff who conducted the sale. The complainants had no knowledge of the levy under the writs of <em>fieri facias </em>until after the sale. At the time of the filing of the bill the defendants, Daniel and James Buck, were about to remove the tools and machinery from the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">The master found that the articles mentioned were fixtures, which were bound by the mortgage, and passed to the complainants by their purchase of the real estate at the sheriffs sale, and that the preliminary injunction granted in the case should be made perpetual against Daniel Buck and James Buck, and that as to the other defendant, Lee, the bill should be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">Counsel for defendants filed numerous exceptions to the finding of the master.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">June 17th, 1881, it was ordered and decreed that \u201cthe bill be dismissed as to W. W. Lee, and that the preliminary injunction, heretofore issued, be made perpetual against Daniel Buck and James Buck,\u201d with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-9\">The defendants then appealed, assigning as errors the decree as above,.and the dismissal of the exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>B. F. </em>Fisher, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">The judgment on the mortgage was <em>in rem, </em>and bound only the land. The land belonged to the wife. The inchoate tenancy by the curtesy was no such interest as converted into realty machinery brought on the property by Weicke for his separate business: Estate of Benjamin Hinds, 5 Wh\u00e1r., 188.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">It is absolutely established that it was not the intention of either the husband or wife that the machinery should become part of the realty. The intention to annex is the legal criterion: Hill <em>v. </em>Sewald, 3 P. IT. Smith, 271; Seeger <em>v. </em>Pettit, 27 P. F. Smith, 437; Meigs\u2019s Appeal, 12 P. F. Smith, 28; Lemar <em>v. </em>Miles, 4 Watts, 330.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">To hold that because Weicke did not remove the fixtures during the term, he and the purchaser, under <em>the fieri facias, </em>lost the right to remove them, would be a great hardship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">The owner had, under the law, three full months, after the making of the deed and notice, in which to remove. No notice to quit was ever given. The term- did not end until the right to possession ceased: Smith on Landlord and Tenant, 263; Mackintosh <em>v. </em>Trotter, 3 M. &amp; W., 184; Wee ton <em>v. </em>Woodcock, 7 M. &amp; W., 14 ; Davis <em>v. </em>Moss, 2 Wright, 346; Hill <em>v. </em>Sewald, 3 P.

The term ended with the sheriff\u2019s sale, caused by his own default: Davis <em>v. </em>Moss, 2-Wright, 346; Overton <em>v. </em>Williston, 7 Casey, 155; White <em>v. </em>Arndt, 1 Whar., 91.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-13\">Fixtures erected by a mortgagor of a less interest than a fee will be bound by the mortgage: Meux <em>v. </em>Jacobs, L.

The fixtures in question were erected by one of the mortgagors. It matters not that the title to the land was in his wife. He joined in the execution of the bond, the payment of which the mortgage was given to secure, and he united with her in the mortgage. <em>Scire facias </em>issued on the mortgage, and judgment thereon was duly recovered. By virtue of execution therefor, the appellees purchased the land with the fixtures then on it, and received the sheriff\u2019s deed. No notice was\u2019 given at the sheriff\u2019s sale of any claim that the fixtures were not bound by the mortgage, or that the purchaser at that sale would not acquire title to them. No rights of the appellants had then attached. Their judgment was obtained afterwards. If Weicke could have previously asserted any claim to the fixtures against the mortgage, he waived all such by thus assenting to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
