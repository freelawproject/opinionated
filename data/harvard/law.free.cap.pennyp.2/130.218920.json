The auditor found the facts to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-14\">Dunsworth resided in Huntingdon, where the debts were contracted upon which the judgments claiming the fund were entered. In 1873, together with John L. Etter, he gave a judgment to Samuel W. Collom for $750. It was entered up and became a first lien. In 1874, Dunsworth gave a judgment to G. B. Armitage, trustee, for $357.50, and Collom entered into an agreement that this latter judgment should have priority. In 1879, Dunsworth went to Youngs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>town, in the State of Ohio. He took his family there in January or February, 1880, and has resided there ever since. The fund for distribution, after payment of costs, was $689.25. The auditor awarded $894.25 to the Armitage judgment; $30.95 to a municipal claim, and the balance of $264.05 he applied to \u201cAaron Dunsworth\u2019s claim, under the exemption law of 9th April, 1849.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">Collom filed exceptions to the distribution, upon the grounds, <em>inter </em>alia, that the auditor erred in applying any part of the fund to the claim for exemption, and in not appropriating the balance to the payment of his judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">November 21st, 18811 The Court below overruled the exceptions and confirmed the report of the auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">Collom then appealed, assigning as errors, <em>inter </em>alia, that the Court erred in not sustaining these exceptions and in entering its decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-9\"><em>Simpson \u00a7 Armitage </em>and <em>W.

If Dunsworth can claim the benefit of the Act of 1849 and take away $300, and we should follow him to Ohio, and attempt to collect our claim there, he could claim the benefit of the exemption law of that State, \u2014 thus giving him a double exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-12\">It was not the intention of the legislature, in enacting the Exemption Act, to legislate against the interest of our own citizens who had honest claims, in favor of strangers and foreigners: Yelverton\u00ab.Burton,2 Casey,354; McCarthy\u2019s Appeal, 18 P. F. Smith, 219.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-13\"><em>Brown </em>\u00bff Bailey, for Dunsworth, and <em>John W. </em>Mattern, for the borough of Huntingdon.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-14\">If the legislature intended that the humane provisions of these laws should be enjoyed only by our citizens so long as they continued to reside in the State, it would have taken but very few additional words to have said so. It is not for this Court to make the law; it is its duty to construe it when made by the well-established rules of construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-15\">An exemption law which allows the' citizens of Pennsylvania the privilege of exemption, and forbids it to citizens of Ohio, would be in violation of the Constitution of the United States: Ward <em>v. </em>Maryland, 12 Wallace, 418.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b127-16\">October 4th, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A6x\">\u2014 The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AMI\">Sterrett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">The only question in this case that requires any consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ation, is that raised by the first, third, and fourth specifications of error, viz.: Whether a non-resident of this Commonwealth is entitled to claim the benefit of the Exemption Act of April 9th, 1849, which provides, \u201cThat in lieu of the property now exempt from levy and sale on execution, issued upon any judgment obtained upon contract and distress for rent, property to the value of $100, exclusive of all wearing apparel of the defendant and his family, and all Bibles and school-books in use in the family (which shall remain exempt as heretofore), and no more, owned by or in the possession of any debtor, shall be exempt from levy and sale on execution or distress for rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The fact that the defendant in the execution, to whom part of the fund raised thereon was awarded under the claim of exemption, was a citizen of the State of Ohio, and had resided there with his family a considerable time before the execution was issued, was distinctly found by the auditor and is not now questioned. While non-resident debtors may perhaps be within the letter of the act, we do not think they are within its spirit. As was said by \u00c1lr. Justice Woodward in Yelverton <em>v. </em>Burton, 2 Casey, 351, and afterwards quoted approvingly by the present chief justice in McCarthy\u2019s Appeal, 18 P. F. Smith, 217, we do uot legislate for men beyond our jurisdiction. The Act of 1849 was designed for our own citizens, for the families of the poor who are with us, that the rapacity of creditors might not strip them of every comfort and convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">These expressions were first used in a case differing in some of its features from the one now before us, but they aptly express what we conceive to be the true intent and meaning of our system of exemption, of which the Act of 1849 forms a part. That clause of the act, which specifically includes wearing apparel, \u201cand all Bibles and schoolbooks in use in the family,\u201d of the debtor, necessarily implies a domicil or family residence within the reach of State process. The Act of April 14th, 1851, Purd., 41B, pi. GO, expressly limits the benefit of the exemption provided therein to \u201cthe widow or the children of any decedent dying within this Commonwealth.\u201d In like manner the exemption of sewing-machines, under the Act of 1869, exteuds only \u201cto seamstresses residing in this Commonwealth.\u201d In the case first above cited, it -was held that exemption cannot be claimed by defendants in foreign attachment. The Act of May 8th, 1874, entitled \u201c An Act to provide for the collection of debts against non-resident debtors,\u201d provides, \u201cThat any exemption law of this Commonwealth shall not be construed to extend to any debtor not a resident thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>It is contended that this proviso, contained in the fourth section of the act, applies only to eases of foreign attachment's issued by justices of the peace under the preceding sections. It is true the purpose of a proviso generally is to except something from the enacting clause, to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation; but this is not always the case. Taking into consideration the object of the act, as comprehensively expressed in its title, in connection with the phraseology of the proviso, we think the latter was not intended to be confined in its operation only to cases falling within the jurisdiction conferred by preceding sections of the act; but, on the contrary, it was intended to exclude all non-residents of the State from the benefit of any exemption law of this Commonwealth in any proceedings for the collection of debts due by them. But, whether this be so or not, we are satisfied the spirit of the Act of 1849, when properly construed, excludes the appellee. And it is right that it should be so. Each State has its own exemption laws for the benefit of its own citizens. If non-residents are permitted to participate in the benefit thus provided, they may claim it in every State in which they happen to own property. This would likely work great injury to creditors by withdrawing from their grasp money or property which should, in justice, be applied, to the payment of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Decree reversed at the costs of the appellee, Aaron Dunsworth; and it is now adjudged and decre\u00e9d that the sum of $264.05, erroneously appropriated to his claim, be paid to the appellant on account of judgment, No. 203, August term, 1878, S. <em>W. </em>Collum <em>v. </em>A. Dunsworth.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
