The order was executed and delivered by defendant to the plaintiffs, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201c Philadelphia, September 18th, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">\u201cMessrs.

The latter assumes but a collateral contingent liability. His engagement is to pay in default of solvency in the debtor, provided diligence was used to obtain payment from him: Isett <em>v. </em>Hoge, 2 Watts, 129; Snevily <em>v. </em>Ekel, 1 W. &amp; S., 204; Johnston <em>v. </em>Chapman, 3 Penna.
