Walter, deceased, from tbe decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of <em>Berks </em>County, dismissing exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, upon tbe account of Joseph M. Feger, guardian of tbe said Horace H. Walter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-10\">Horace H. Walter died in 1879, aged about nineteen years. His testamentary guardian, Joseph M. Feger, then filed bis account, charging himself with, <em>inter </em>alia, a certificate for $3000 in the loan of the city of Philadelphia. The account was referred to Jefferson Snyder, as auditor, before whom the amount of the city loan was claimed by John Gravenstine, administrator of the decedent, and by the legatees under the will of Frances E. Walter. The auditor found the facts in regard to this loan as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-11\">\u201c On August 2d, 1865, Mrs. Fanny E. Walter, the mother of Horace H. Walter, was the owner of $4000 Philadelphia City loan, which she had received from her father\u2019s estate, and which stood in her maiden name (Housum), on the city\u2019s books. On that day she transferred $3000 of this loan to the name of\u2018Fanny E. Housum, trustee of Horace II. Walter,\u2019 and received a new certificate in that form. There is no other written evidence of the character or terms of the trust thus proposed to be created. Her further intention, however, appears from the testimony of her mother, whom she consulted at the time of the transfer, in reference to it, and who says that Mrs. Walter, being apprehensive lest her husband, Thomas L. Walter, who was not living with her, might enforce his marital rights to her estate after her death, made this transfer for the purpose of certainly securing this fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to her son ; but with the view of having it continue subject to her disposal in case of his death, so that her husband could not inherit it from him, she transferred it to herself as trustee for him, instead of placing it simply in his name as absolute owner. It does not appear that Horace ever knew of the transfer during Mrs. Walter\u2019s lifetime, or that she ever specifically appropriated to his use the interest on the loan, which she regularly received till her death. Mrs. Walter afterwards died during the minority of Horace, leaving a will, in which she bequeathed, after providing for the payment of her debts, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">\u201c \u2018 <em>Item. </em>\u2014 The residue of my estate I give and devise to my son, Horace H. Walter. If he should die before attaining the age of twenty-one years, then the principal hereby devised, or so much thereof as may be left after maintaining him and giving him a good education, shall go to my nearest relatives, excluding my husband, Thomas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">\u201c <em>'\u25a0Item. </em>\u2014 I appoint Joseph M. Feger to be the guardian of the person and estate of my son, Horace. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">\u201c On the settlement of the account of her executor, the auditor determined that her husband had forfeited Iris marital rights by desertion, and her whole estate, including the $3000 loan, was turned over to the guardian of Horace, by decree of the Court, pursuant to the directions contained in her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\"><em>\u201c </em>There is no contention as to the balance of her estate, which, it is conceded, passed, by her will, on the death of Horace under twenty-one, to her nearest relatives, Abbie C. Housum, and Mary L. Yan Reed, who were her half sisters.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">The auditor found that under this state of facts, the gift to Horace was not completed, that the bonds were Jhe property of Mrs. Walter at the time of her death, and passed, under her will, to her legatees. He made distribution, awarding the same to Abbie C. Housum and Mary L. Yan Reed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-9\">The administrator filed an exception, <em>inter </em>alia, to this distribution, which the Court, Sassaman, J., dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-10\">The administrator then appealed, assigning as error, <em>inter </em>alia, that the Court erred in dismissing the exceptions, and confirming the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-11\"><em>W.
