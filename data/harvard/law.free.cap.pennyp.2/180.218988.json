That day I came into town and went to Emanuel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Reigart, the lawyer, and told him. Then, said I, if a title can be made so that I am safe, I\u2019ll buy it. Then Reigart said a title could be made, that I am safe; if Peter Long don\u2019t pay it, then the property is mine. Then I told him I\u2019ll go and buy it then. lie said yes, I can make a title that you are safe; then I bought it; I said nothing, and he said nothing about making a deed; I had confidence that he would make me safe; I mean Mr. Reigart. 1 told Peter when I went home how I bought the property; he said he bought the property for himself; he bought it for himself but he had no money ; I had no conversation after that with Mr. Reigart about the making of the deed as I recollect; I was young then, and didn\u2019t know how the title ought to be. I paid the purchase-money to Snyder and Bundel, executors, in the first place; then me and Peter agreed that he would give me bonds; he was paying $75 rent; I said to him if you can pay $75 rent you can pay this property. . Then we agreed that he should give me five or six bonds, $75 payable every year; the last bond was more than $75 ; he was to pay me five per cent, interest; he paid me all those bonds. Reigart in the spring gave me the deed and told me to hold it till Peter paid me all the money; I did so, and when h.o paid all the money I gave him the deed and also the deed or release of 1853.

That even if the purchase-money for the property in suit was furnished by Peter Long, the deed for the same of March 29th, 1842, from Jacob Snyder and others, executors, etc., to John B.

If Peter Long, now deceased, and through whom these four defendants claim title to the real estate in suit, paid the purchase-money of the real estate, conveyed by-deed dated 29th March, 1842, from the executors of Jacob Bundel, deceased, in the manner testified to by Mr. Hertzler, and did so, with the intention of acquiring title thereto, in himself, as absolute owner \u2014 and this intention the jury will gather from the whole testimony \u2014 then the entire and absolute ownership of said house and lot, etc., in dispute-, was in him, notwithstanding and in the face of the language of the deed referred to, giving an interest to his wife, now deceased, and his children; and this is a question of fact for the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">\u201c 8. Payment of the purchase-money by Peter Long, upon which he received the deed or paper from John B. Hertzler, dated the 31st January, 1853, and at the same time Hertzler, handing over to him the deed of 29th March, 1842, gave to the said Peter Long the entire and absolute ownership of the real estate in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">\u201c4. If Peter Long, under whom defendants claim, was the owner of said real estate, then he had a perfect right to devise it by his last will and testament and codicil, proved in register\u2019s office, 21st day of March, 1879, to the defendants therein named, and this action of partition cannot be sustained on the part of the plaintiffs, and your verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-8\">The Court answered these points as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\">\u201c 2.

A man of sound mind has always a right to devise any estate he may own to whom he pleases, but under the deed of 1842, and the paper of 1853, he, Peter Long, had no right to convey or devise this property by will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-11\">The Court further charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-12\">\u201cThe plaintiffs allege and say, that they, together with the defendants, hold and own this property as tenants in common under the deed of trust, made in 1842, and they desire distribution to be made among the whole eight children of Peter Long, deceased. While the defendants allege and say, that the property in dispute belongs to them (four of the eight children of Peter Long), having been devised to them by their father, Peter Long, by his will road before you, and it will be for you to say, by your verdict, whether it belongs to the plaintiff's and defendants as tenants in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>mon, they being all the children of Peter Long, or to the defendants only, they being four of said children, who claim under his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">\u201c The case presents a question of law for the Court, rather than one of fact for the jury, depending upon the construction of the deeds of 1842 and 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">\u201cIt appears that on March 29th, 1842, the executors of the will of Jacob Bundel, deceased, sold and conveyed to John B. Hertzler the property in question, in trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\"><em>* </em>&gt;{i \u00edfc ;fc <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">\u201c [Here, then, is an express trust; every part of it complete, and set forth on the face of the deed, and we must take it as expressed, in the absence of duress, fraud or mistake at the time it was made, and there is no evidence of either here.] Mr. Long himself took a beneficiary interest under the trust, which he enjoyed while he lived, and there could be no resulting trust. It is argued that the paper of 1853 gave him a fee simple in the land, and he was therefore fully empowered to devise it by will as he did to defendants. We say to you it does not \u2014 the deed or paper of 1853 is made to the same parties as the deed of 1812, and Peter Long\u2019s acceptance of it was a ratification of the deed of 1842, with the express trust therein. ' And it gave him no such title as claimed, nor did it empower him to devise it by will, and under the deed of 1842, the property belongs to all the children of Peter Long, deceased (the plaintiffs as well as defendants), and therefore your verdict should be for plaintiffs. The fact of the possession by Peter Long, and improvements made by him, would show nothing as to his intent in the purchase, as he had a life interest therein, and all he did was for the benefit of his children, to whom on his death it came under the deed of \u00cd842. With the title to that part sold off we have nothing to do here. [We have answered as to the law in disposing of the points presented. We look upon it, as we have said, as a question of law for the Court, and therefore we direct you to find a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.
