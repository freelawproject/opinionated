I drew up the note. It is my writing. I wrote the first indorsement of interest on the note dated April 1st, 1869. None of the rest. . ... I do not know who made them. I don\u2019t know who paid the interest. I did not. 1 didn\u2019 tell Staman to pay the interest.....I was a partner in business when this note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>was given.' This note was not a partnership note. I was only a security for Mr. Staman on the note.....I was but a surety on the note. I don\u2019t know how the money was obtained. ... I didn\u2019t get any of the money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">Plaintiff then offered in evidence defendant\u2019s answer in the equity suit of Miller, assignee of Staman <em>v. </em>Jacob C. Stoner <em>et al., </em>sworn to January 25th, 1881, and filed, for the purpose of showing that defendant, Stoner, and Staman were partners up to 1876, and that defendant, Stoner, and he signed notes, as this one is signed, as partners. The answer offered contained these paragraphs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">\u201c All of said firms (Stoner &amp; Staman, Peart, Stoner &amp; Sta-man, Peart, Scofield &amp; Co., and Peart &amp; Scofield) had liabilities, and Stoner &amp; Staman borrowed money for their partnership business and gave obligations therefor, signed sometimes Stoner &amp; Staman, and sometimes Jaeob Staman and Jacob C. Stoner, each signing his own name.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">\u201c When the firm of Peart, Stoner &amp; Staman was dissolved, the interest of said parties still continued in the firm of Peart, Scofield &amp; Co., until its dissolution in February, 1876, when Stoner and Staman sold their interests to Peart.\u201d Objected to by counsel for defendant. The offer was disallowed, and plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-10\"><em>John S. </em>Mann, for the plaintiff, testified <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-11\">\u201c In 1868 I went to Mr. Stoner. He asked me whether I knew of any money. I told him I did; that Mrs. Bott had $1000 she offered to me.....He then told me to go and engage it for the firm \u2014 the money. He said they needed a heap of money. She then told me to tell him they could have it \u2014 the firm could have it. I told Stoner so.....He referred to the firm of Staman &amp; Stoner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-16\"><em>Jacob </em>Staman, for the plaintiff, testified <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-17\">\u201c I paid the last and next to the last interest myself. .... If I didn\u2019t pay it, Mr. Stoner did.....I do not know how this money was borrowed from Mrs. Bott, whether for the firm or not. It is too long ago.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-20\">The plaintiff then offered to prove by the witness:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-21\">\u201c That in the spring of 1877, or at a time within six years next preceding the bringing of this suit, Mr. Harnish called on him, representing that he was authorized by plaintiff to see the parties to the note, for the purpose of collecting the unpaid interest for that year, and furthermore demanding payment .of the note, or some other satisfactory arrangement. Witness paid him the interest, and said that the note was all right. Witness then told Mr. Harnish that he would see Stoner, as Harnish had requested, and tell him what plaintiff required, to which Harnish acquiesced, requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>witness to report the result of the interview to Mrs. Bott. \"Witness did see Stoner, and he acknowledged that plaintiff\u2019s claim on note was right, and would pay it, unless plaintiff would agree to take a new note for it. Witness after that saw plaintiff and told her what Stoner had said, and she was satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">' \u201c This to be followed by the testimony of Mr. Harnish, to the effect-that he had been authorized by plaintiff, in the spring of 1877, he having the note in suit with him, to see the parties to the note, she being physically disabled from attending to her out-door business ; that he saw Staman, who lived nearest, and what occurred and took place appears in the offer of Staman\u2019s testimony; that he did not see Stoner, because Staman agreed to do so for him, Staman paying witness the interest for that year; that plaintiff had authorized witness to request Staman to see Stoner touching the payment of the note in suit; that witness did request Staman to see Stoner about the matter, with the understanding that Staman should report the result of the interview with Stoner to Mrs. Bott.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">The offer was objected to, and was disallowed. .Counsel for plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-8\"><em>J. C. Stoner, </em>recalled:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-9\">\u201c Q.

Did they raise money in that way ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-10\">Objected to, and disallowed. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-11\">The witness continued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-12\">\u201c I never paid any interest on that note. I wrote on the first receipt.....I made no entry of interest on the note, except the first payment of interest. I never engaged the money for the firm or for Mr. Staman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-15\">The plaintiff then offered the note in evidence. It was not admitted, and plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-16\">The Court then entered a judgment of non-suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-17\">Plaintiff took a rule to show cause why the judgment of non-suit should not be stricken off, which the Court, April 3d, 1882, discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-18\">The plaintiff then took out a writ of error, assigning as errors the rejection of the offers of evidence, the entering of the judgment of non-suit, and the refusal to take it off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-19\"><em>William JR..

Striekler, 2 W. <em>&amp; </em>S., 411.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\">The real question was, whether the money was borrowed by the firm or by individuals. This was a question of fact for the jury, and the manner of the defendants in carrying on their business was material. The offer of the testimony of Staman, as to the acknowledgment of Stoner, should have been admitted: Wesner <em>v. </em>Stein, 1 Outerbridge, 322; Johns \u00ae. Lantz, 13 P. F.

Proof of the payment of interest by Staman did not prove a promise by Stoner, or create any liability against him: Zent <em>v. </em>Heart, 8 Barr, 337 ; Coleman <em>v. </em>Fobes, 10 Harris, 156; Bush \u00ae. Stowell, 21 Smith, 208 ; Clark <em>v. </em>Burn, 5 Norris, 502; Lazarus <em>v. </em>Fuller, 8 Norris, 331; Wesner-\u00ae. Stein, 10 W. N.

The <em>probata </em>and <em>allegata </em>did not agree: Lee <em>v. </em>Conard, 1 Wh., 168.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-10\">Any offer of proof which was to have the effect of a new promise, would be limited to such as were made to the plaintiff or her agent: Gillingham <em>v. </em>Gillingham, 5 Harris, 302 ; Emerson <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Casey, 278-; Morgan\u00ae. Walton, 4 Barr, 321; Christy <em>v. </em>Flemington, 10 Barr, 129; Kyle \u00ae.
