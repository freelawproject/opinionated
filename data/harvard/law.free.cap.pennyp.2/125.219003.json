Arbitrators awarded to the plaintiff $992.96, being the amount of the debt, interest, and attorney\u2019s commissions, alleged to be due. From this award the defendant appealed. On the 22d of October, 1881, the defendant paid $950.45, being the amount of the debt, interest, and costs up to that date, but not the attorney\u2019s commission. He then filed a plea of <em>nil debet.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-10\">The Court below, Elwell, P. J., entered judgment on the case stated for $65.12, the amount of the attorney\u2019s commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-11\">The defendant then took out a writ of error, assigning as error the enti\u2019y of the above judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-12\"><em>W. H. </em>ffliawn, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-13\">The power to confess judgment, etc., contained in this note, although irrevocable by Drum himself, expired on his death (Panning <em>v. </em>Pawson, 2 Wright, 480 ; Hood <em>et al. v. </em>Harper <em>et </em>al., 8 Phila., 163; 2 Kent Com., 644 and 647), and the stipulation in reference to commissions being connected with the power (Hope <em>v. </em>Everhart, 20 P. E. Smith, 231; Comm. <em>v. </em>Conard, 1 Rawle, 253), the commissions fell with it. The learned judge below, upon the authority of Imler <em>v. </em>Imler, 9 W. N. C., 196, construed the stipulation <em>\u201c </em>and with costs of attorney\u2019s commission,\u201d to be the agreement of the debtor, and part of the note. The only question decided in Imler <em>v. </em>Imler was as to the proper amount of commissions; what was said outside of that was <em>obiter </em>dictum, and so far as it decides this stipulation to be the agreement of the debtor and part of the note, it is in conflict with Hope <em>v. </em>Everhart, and Comm. <em>v. </em>Conard. In the former case, Williams, J., in deciding the relations of the provisions of the note to those of the power, held them to be separate and distinct, and the stipulation \u201c and with costs of attorney\u2019s commission\u201d to be part of the power to confess judgment, etc. In Comm. <em>v. </em>Conard, it was held the stay of execution provided for in the power, contained in the bond, was no part of the bond, but part of the power. If, then, the stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>lation was part of tlie power, the commissions, or properly the claim for which- Beck sues, could only result from the exercise of the power. That having been extinguished by the death of Brum, it is sufficient to refer to Hunt <em>v. </em>Nous manier, 8 Wheat., 174; Hartley and Minor's Appeal, 3 Smith, 212; Lightner\u2019s Appeal, 1 Norris, 301, to. show that the right to commissions fell with it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-4\"><em>Samuel Knorr </em>and <em>L. S. </em>Wintersteen, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">The true grammatical construction certainly is, that the promise to pay and the power authorizing the entry of judg ment, being connected by the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d are both modified by the clause \u201c with costs of suit and costs of attorney\u2019s commission,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">The obvious intention was to indemnify the creditor for his reasonable expenses for counsel fees in collecting the money, and the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of. this contract, whether payment of the debt is enforced by entering judgment, upon the warrant of attorney, in the lifetime of the obligor, or by means of a suit at law brought either in the lifetime of the obligor, or (as in this ease) after his death, and this is in accordance with the decisions of this Court: Imler-r. Imler, 9 W.N.C.,page 196. See, also, Robinson <em>v. </em>Loomis, 1 P. F. Smith, page 78; Baly <em>v. </em>Maitland, 7 W.

The fact that the agreement was contained in the power to confess the judgment, which power was revoked by the death of the defendant, is entirely too refined a point, and falls within the maxim, <em>qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
