The defendant in a judgment, which was a lien on real estate, by amicable action revived the judgment April 2d. He had made an agreement to sell the real estate December 3d preceding, and had executed and delivered a deed for it March 26th; but the deed was not recorded until April 3d. The purchaser had no notice of the revival. There was evidence that the holders of the judgment knew in December of the agreement of sale, and then received, on account of their judgment, some of the purchase-money, with knowledge that it came from the purchaser. The purchaser paid interest on the judgment for three years after his purchase. In a <em>sci. fa. </em>to again revive the judgment the Court charged, \u201c If the jury find that M. and D. [owners of the judgment] had actual notice that B. [the purchaser] had purchased the property from S. [the defendant], and also find that the deed was executed and delivered on the 26th of March, the defendant is entitled to a verdict.\u201d The verdict was against the defendant, but in favor of the terre tenant. <em>Held, </em>that this charge was not such an error as did the plaintiff any harm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-11\">3.

The evidence discloses that in 1868 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Benneville Sehroeder was the owner of real estate in this county and gave a judgment bond to Daniel Sayer for $1850, which was entered' of record in the prothonotary\u2019s office on the 6th of April, 1868, and became a lien on the real estate then owned by Sehroeder. This judgment was assigned, and is now held by Henry H. Maurer and Daniel De Turk, who are the interested parties and real plaintiffs in this action. In December, 1872, Sehroeder entered into an agreement with John Becker, wherein he agreed to sell him one-half of the real estate bound by the judgment, and subsequently the other half, the deed to be delivered on or before the 1st day of April, 1873. The deed was duly executed and acknowledged on the 26th of March, 1873, and put in the recorder\u2019s office for record on the 3d of April following. On the 2d of April, 1873, Benneville Sehroeder, Daniel De Turk, and Henry H. Maurer, according to the recollection of De Turk, went to the prothonotary\u2019s office and revived the judgment by what is known as an amicable <em>scire facias. </em>Becker was not present and had no notice of the revival.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">\u201cThe plaintiffs assume two positions and claim that the revival was legal, and continued the lien of the judgment against the land in the ownership of Becker:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">\u201c 1. Although the deed was executed on the 26th of March, 1873, it was not delivered before the 3d day of April following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">\u201c2. That even if it was executed and delivered on the 26 th of March, the plaintiffs had no knowledge of the sale of the property to Becker, nor had they actual or constructive notice of the execution and delivery of the deed before the 3d of April, when it was entered for record. \u2022 On both or either of these grounds they claim a verdict, and the Court are so asked to charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">\u201cThe defendant, Becker, maintains that Maurer and De Turk had actual notice that he had purchased the property from Sehroeder, and that the deed having been executed and delivered to him on the 26th of March, 1873, and not having been made a party of the record in the revival of the judgment, the lien was lost, and that he is entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">\u201cThere are two modes to revive a judgment to continue the lien, one by an amicable <em>scire facias, </em>confessing judgment on the back of the writ, and the other by adverse process, the writ being served by the sheriff, and judgment recovered in court. Where land, bound by a judgment, is sold, and the lien is sought to be continued, the owner must be made a party on the record, and this whether by amicable proceedings or adverse process. There are circumstances, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ever, since the Act of 16 April, 1849, where a revival will be good, and the owner not named as <em>terre tenant. </em>Thus, a man being the owner of land gives a judgment, and then sells the land and continues in possession. Until the new owner puts his deed on record, or the judgment creditor has actual notice that the land has been sold, a revival of the judgment between the original parties will continue the lien. One Joseph Levan was the tenant under Schroeder, and continued in possession of the land after the 1st of April, 1873. There being no evidence to show that Maurer and De Turk knew of' a change in the tenancy, the possession of Levan was the same as if Schroeder had been in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">\u201c The jury will consider all the evidence in making up their verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">\u201c If the jury find that the deed; although executed on the 26th of March, 1873, was not delivered before the 2d of April following, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">\u201c Again, if the jury find that the deed was executed and delivered on the 26th of March, but that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of the sale of the property to Becker and no actual or constructive notice of the execution and delivery of the deed before the 3d of April, when it was entered for record in the recorder\u2019s office, the verdict must be for the plaintiff's.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">\u201c On the other hand, if the jury find that Maurer and De Turk had actual notice that Becker had purchased the property from Schroeder, and also find that the deed was executed and delivered on the 26th of March, the defendant is entitled to a verdict. This answers all the points on which the Court was requested to charge, and the theory on which the case was tried on both sides.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">May 21st, 1879. Verdict for the plaintiffs against Benneville Schroeder for $2198.75, and in favor of defendant, John Becker, <em>terre tenant. </em>Judgment was afterward entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">The plaintiffs then took out a writ of error assigning that the Court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-12\">1. In charging the jury as follows: \u201c If the jury find that Maurer and De Turk had actual notice that Becker had purchased the property from Schroeder, and also find that the deed wa3 executed and delivered on the 26th of March, the defendant is entitled to a verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-13\">2. In not instructing the jury that the revival of the judgment between the. original parties, before the plaintiffs had either actual or constructive notice of the conveyance of the legal title, was sufficient to bind the land in the hands of the <em>terre tenant </em>to the extent of the unpaid purchase-money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>notwithstanding the plaintiffs knew at the time of the revival th\u00e1t the <em>terre tenant </em>had bought by articles of agreement, but had not paid the purchase-money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">3. The Court erred in not instructing the jury that Becker, the <em>terre </em>tenant, having agreed to pay the judgment in suit as part of the purchase-money, and having requested the plaintiffs in said judgment to suffer the same to continue a lien upon the premises in his hands, and having continued to pay the interest upon said judgment after its revival between the original parties, is presumed to have had notice of such revival (if he was entitled thereto), and is estopped from alleging now that he had not.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-7\"><em>Richmond L. </em>Jones, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">Becker did not- take actual possession, nor put in a new tenant.

It was not necessary for Becker to show in defence to the <em>sci. fa. </em>that his deed was recorded April 2d, 1873, because a record would have furnished the plaintiffs in the <em>sci. fa. </em>wnth no knowledge they did not already have in contemplation of law. They had knowledge of Becker\u2019s agreement of purchase; they had received on account of the consideration, mentioned in that agreement, $1013, and that made it their duty before reviving their judgment with a knowledge of Becker\u2019s equitable title to look into the agreement for the purpose of ascertaining when the legal title was to pass.
