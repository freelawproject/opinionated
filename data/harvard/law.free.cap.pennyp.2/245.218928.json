G. Croll was presented to the Court below, October 16th, 1879, setting forth: \u201cThat a public road or street, called Elm Street, has been laid out in the borough of Norristown, in said county, on and along the lands and premises'of the petitioner, on the southwest side of said Elm Street, two hundred feet north-westerly from Cherry Street, in the Second Ward of said borough of Norris-town, and has within one year last past been opened through the said lands and pre\u00f1ases of the petitioner, creating a high embankment, obstructing ingress and egress to and from his house, situated upon the preniises and lands of the petitioner, and therefore and thereby he has sustained heavy loss and damage,\u201d and asking for the appointment of viewers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">The Court appointed a jury of viewers, who reported, <em>inter </em>alia, that \u201chaving taken into consideration the advantages dei\u2019ived from said road or street being opened through the land of said Albert G. Croll, and the embankments created thereby, (we) do assess the damages sustained by the said Albert G.

The exceptants except to the petition, the appointment of the jury, and all proceedings under the petition as illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-14\">Second. The assessment of damages to the petitioner as returned by the jury is excessive and outrageous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-15\">Third. The county had no notice of the appointment of the jurors, and therefore no opportunity to challenge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-16\">Fourth. The county of Montgomery is not liable to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>damages for filling up a street by the borough of Norris-town after it had been laid out and opened for twenty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">Fifth. The county of Montgomery is not liable for the damages sustained by changing the grade of street by the borough council of Norristown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">The Court below, Ross, P. J., sustained the exceptions and dismissed the proceedings, saying:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">\u201c All these petitions disclose that the petitioners are seeking consequential damages. The date of their applications discloses that they should be in the Common Pleas, if they have rights at all, under the Act of May 24th, 1878.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">The petitioner then appealed, assigning as errors that the Court erred in sustaining the exceptions and dismissing the proceedings, in holding that the damages assessed to the petitioner were consequential damages, and not sustaining the petition and report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-9\"><em>George N. </em>Corson, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-10\">The proceedings are under the Act of 1853, P. L., 230, section 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-11\">The damages we are seeking, while of course they happen as a consequence of the opening of the street, are in no technical sense \u201c consequential damages,\u201d but direct damages done by the opening of a street, and grading it to such a height that the road-bed is above the \"topmost story of the house.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-12\"><em>Aaron 8. Schwartz </em>and <em>H. B. </em>Dickinson, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-13\">The damages were consequential: Henry <em>v. </em>Bridge Co., 8 W. &amp; S., 85. The Act of May 24th, 1878, provides a remedy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-14\">It is found by the exceptions and the decision of the Court that this was no widening but the alteration of a grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-15\">The county is not liable for the grading down of a street or the filling up of a road-bed: O\u2019Connor <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 18 Pa. St. R., 187; Henry <em>v. </em>Bridge Co., 8 <em>W. </em>&amp; S., 85; Monongahela Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Coons, 6 W. &amp; S., 101.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-16\">Nor does the Constitution of 1874 alter the law, for the 8th section of Article XYI. of the Constitution does not apply to counties.
