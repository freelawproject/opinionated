It was about 5.45 p m. On returning from the drug store he attempted to cross from the north side of Lombard Street to the south side. One of the cars of the defendant was going eastward on Lombard Street, and it ran over the plaintiff, crushing both of his legs. He was taken to the Pennsylvania Hospital and both of his legs were amputated above the knees. The testimony as to how the accident occurred was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\"><em>Isaac </em>Silberman, for the plaintiff, testified, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201c The boy came out of the drug store and ran over the street. The car came quick, and the horses knocked him down, and a man came and picked him up. The horses went so fast that he could not get past. So far as I saw the horses were going too fast......He was crossing nearly at the corner. The horses were going too quick......The driver was a little tight; if not, he could have stopped the car. The horses were going fast. The car was going faster than they usually go. He turned the brake after the child was under the horses. There was a man standing on the platform, I think, and the driver was talking to him. The driver was looking sideways, and, if he had been looking ahead, he could nave stopped the car.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-12\">On cross-examination he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-13\">\u201c The boy crossed at the usual place......I saw the horses knock the child down. .....

Wetherill, Jr., </em>for the plaintiff, testified that he was surgeon at the hospital, and described the injuries and amputation. On cross-examination he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-10\">\u201c I observed slight bruises only on body, such as might have been occasioned by falling.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-11\"><em>Thomas Burns, </em>for the defendant, testified, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201c I was conductor of the car......We crossed Sixth Street at the usual rate. There was a car going down Sixth Street. The driver slacked up to let this car pass. He did not have time to get up fast rate after the Sixth Street car passed. .....The accident occurred just below Sixth Street. The crossing was clear. The driver, when we had crossed Sixth Street, put the brake on with such force as to throw me in the doorway. I jumped off and found the boy clear of the car in the centre of the track......He was some distance from the flagstones, \u2014 the length of the car from the flagstones. Boy was sitting up with back to south track. .....To the best of my knowledge he-(the driver) was in a sober condition. He was probably capable of taking care of the car. I was perfectly sober.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-19\"><em>Robert Moore, </em>for the defendant, testified, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201c I was a car driver......A Sixth Street car was passing there. I braked up a little until the car passed.....I then looked ahead. I had a clear track, \u2014 nothing ahead. When I got on the other side of Sixth Street, about six feet from the crossing, was an iron plate or covering. I recollect the little head laying there on the plate in the middle of the track. I could not pick the boy up, but I braked the car as quick as I could. It was six feet from the east side of the crossing. I never saw a bit of the child until I saw him between the swingle-tree and the dasher on the ground. He was lying in the middle of the track, six feet east of the flagging, between the swingle-tree and the dasher. The pole could not have knocked the child down.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-23\">On cross-examination he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-24\">\u201c The first I saw of the boy he was lying between the two tracks, about six feet from the crossing.

What time did you and the driver go to work on that morning ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\">Under objection and exception the witness answered, \u201c About 6.30.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">\u201cQ. What time did you make your last trip the night before?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">Under objection and exception the witness answered: \u201cI couldn\u2019t say that I was working the night before. The car finished its trip the night before about thirteen minutes after twelve, midnight, if it was on time, and started out at 6.30 next morning. The depot is at Twenty-fifth and South streets.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\"><em>Charles Kersclmer, </em>for the defendant, testified, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201c I saw a little boy running across the street......He was from the drug store. He was going across the street south......I saw the boy knocked down and car went over him. He seemed to have something white in his hand. .....The ear was coming across Sixth Street. The boy was running across the street, and ran between the dasher and the swingle-tree of the car and was knocked down. That was the last I saw of him until the ear ran over him. He wms then about three feet east of the flagging-stones on Sixth Street, when he ran between the swingle-tree and the dasher.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-14\">On cross-examination he said: \u201c I think the boy ran between the horses and the dasher. Behind the horses is a swingle-tree......The space between the dasher and the swingle-tree is a foot and a half. The boy ran in this space.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-17\"><em>William J. </em>Mitchell, for the defendant, testified, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201c At the hospital the boy made a remark, when his father came to him and spoke to him, \u2018 Poppy, I did not see the car, or I should not have run into it.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-18\">There was further testimony that the car was going at an ordinary rate of speed. The defendant, at a special meeting of the stockholders, held April 20th, 1870, had by resolution accepted the provisions of the Act of Assembly of April 4th, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-19\"><em>Philip Steinhart, </em>for plaintiff, testified, in rebuttal: \u201cThe child was lying in the hospital.

If you find that the driver, at the time of the accident, was not looking at the track ahead of him, owing to his talking with a person on the platform, or to his looking around, or for any other cause, then this is evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-22\">\u201c 4. If you believe that the injury in question was caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>by tbe negligence of tbe driver in driving too rapidly, or in not watching the track, or in any other manner, and the injured boy had not capacity to appreciate the danger and avoid it, so far as any act on his part contributed to the injury, that incapacity shields him from responsibility for any act of his contributing to the injury, although such act would have been contributory negligence in an adult, defeating his recovery, and your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">\u201c 5. If you believe the injured boy, in trying to run across the street at the crossing, acted according to the habitual impulse of a child of his age, under all the circumstances, and the defendants were guilty of negligence in any of the modes aforesaid, or otherwise, and the injury resulted therefrom, your verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">The Court affirmed these points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">Counsel for defendant asked the Court to charge, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-9\">\u201c 6. If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff ran between the horses and the dasher of the car, then this act caused the injury, and the defendant was guilty of no negligence, and your verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-10\">\u201c 7. In no event can the plaintiff recover more than three thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-11\">The Court refused these points, and charged the jury, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-12\">\u201cThe question for you to arrive at in the first instance is, was this injury caused by the defendant company? Now, you have heard the evidence upon that point. Thejule of law touching injuries of this character is that the party who is responsible for it must have been guilty of negligence. If there was no negligence on the part of the company, causing the injury, then there is no responsibility; and there is another principle of law, not only must that be so, but in ordinary cases there must have been no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff uffo has suffered the injury ; because, if he contributed to his own injury, even slightly, the law says he can have no recovery for that which was partly his own act. In other words, the law will not measure the extent of the responsibilities where there has been contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff . . . As you shall find whether this accident was caused through the negligence of the driver, or by one of those unavoidable circumstances, or series of circumstances, by which an accident occurred without fault, that is, without such fault as the law recognizes, on their part, so should be your verdict. If the accident was caused by the agent of the company\u2014 the driver \u2014 through his want of attention, through his want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of diligence, through his want of care, and if by any want of care which he could have exercised, or want of any attention, or if by any attention which he could have exercised, or any care which he could have exercised, the accident could have been prevented, but which occurred from want of this care and attention, then the company would be liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-3\">\u201c Now, relatively to the duty of care on the part of the boy, the Supreme Court has said, in a case which is well known, which is also a city passenger railway company, where a child of ten years of age leaped off the front platform of the car and was injured, the Supreme Court said the plaintiff was a mere boy, and the law, because of his tender age and inexperience, does not exact of him the same degree of care and prudence that it does of a person of mature years. A boy\u2019s capacity is a measure of his responsibility, and if he has not the ability to foresee and avoid the danger to which he may be exposed, negligence will not be imputed to him if he unwittingly exposed himself to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">\u201c Now that appears to be the law, gentlemen, with respect to the responsibility of a boy, so far as the question of contributory negligence is concerned. You will look at all the facts of the case, gentlemen, with that care that they deserve, and with that attention which I am sure you have already manifested in listening to the evidence in the case, and I am sure you will endeavor to do justice between these parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">\u201c In determining the case, you are not to press down upon the defendants because they happen to be a corporation, nor because they happen to be a street railway company. We have our duties, and they have their rights, as this little boy has his rights. And we are bound to do justice between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">\u201c Such companies are compelled, of necessity, to intrust the management of their cars to other people, and I suppose, ordinarily, they endeavor to do the best for themselves and for the public, in that respect, that they can. Their own interests would seem to induce them to do as well as they can for themselves, as well as for others; at the same time, they are bound to be careful in the selection of their servants, and not put an intemperate man upon their cars; not to put careless men upon their cars; not to put incompetent men upon their cars ; but to exercise such discretion and judgment as will tend to protect the citizen from injury by reason of that fact. And also, gentlemen, there would seem to be a duty with respect to a car approaching a crossing \u2014 a street crossing \u2014 of a more stringent character than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>when running ordinarily along a street at a place where there is no crossing. Of course, the driver must at all times see what is ahead of him. Children are sometimes in the street, in the middle of the square, going across the street, and injuries not infrequently happen. Therefore, there should be diligent attention and care at all points along the highway; but when the car approaches a crossing, it approaches a point where the citizen has a right of way to cross the street, and where he would naturally expect to find people crossing, and he should therefore give, if possible, a more strict attention to the discharge of his duty at that point than at any other place, whilst it is incumbent upon him at all times to be careful in the discharge of his duties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-3\">Counsel for defendant excepted to the answers to the above points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-4\">November 3d, 1881. Verdict for the plaintiff for $4000, upon which judgment was subsequently entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">The defendant then took out a writ of error, assigning as errors the admission of the evidence under exception and the answers to the points as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-6\"><em>Mayer Sulzberger </em>and <em>William Botch Wister, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">The evidence admitted was held to be error in Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Ilenrice, 11 Norris, 431.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">The fact that the questions were asked in cross-examination did not make them less irrelevant: Floyd <em>v. </em>Bovard, 6 W. &amp; S., 75; Mitchell \u00ae. AVelsh, 5 Har., 339.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\">They did not tend to show bias or interest, and were designed to prejudice the jury: Hopkinson <em>v. </em>Leeds, 28 P. F. Smith, 396 ; Helser <em>v. </em>McGrath, 2 P. F. Smith, 531.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were stated in words too vague and general. The words \u201c or for any other cause,\u201d \u201c or in any other manner,\u201d and \u201c or otherwise,\u201d should have been restricted to something that did, in fact, contribute to the accident. If the third point was properly affirmed, a driver can in no case properly look anywhere except at his horses\u2019 heads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-11\">As to defendant\u2019s sixth point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-12\">There were two kinds of negligence charged in plaintiff\u2019s testimony:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-13\"><em>jFirst. </em>Fast driving.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-14\"><em>Second. </em>Drunkenness of the driver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-15\">But no matter how drunk a driver may have been, or how fast he may have driven, in the case submitted by the point neither the drunkenness nor the fast driving caused the boy to run into the car, and such drunkenness or fast driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>was, in such, a case, no part of the accident. We asked the judge to say, that, if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiff ran between the horses and the dasher of the car, this act caused the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-4\">Surely, the learned judge should have affirmed it as put, instead of refusing it; for the same mischief would have been caused whether the car was going fast or slow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">The intoxication and fast driving are, therefore, merely conditions, just as the position of the plaintiff in Boudrou <em>v. </em>Passenger Railway Company, 11 Norris, 475, was a condition: Fairbanks <em>v. </em>Kerr, 20 P. F. Smith, 86; Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Boyer, 9 W. N. C., 497; Goshorn <em>v. </em>Smith, 11 Norris, 435; Baker <em>v. </em>Fehr, 10 W.

For this reason, and because the plaintiff had, in fact, been guilty of contributory negligence, this case is distinguished from Railroad <em>v. </em>Cook, 1 W. N. C., 319; Passenger Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Boudrou, 11 Norris, 475.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-8\">The decision in Boudrou\u2019s case was pronounced with hesitation, and should be reviewed.

The main question, then, was whether the negligence of the railway company caused the injury. While some of the evidence-was conflicting, yet there was amply sufficient, if believed, to justify the jury in finding it as a fact. There was evidence that the driver of the car was intoxicated, and driving at a rapid rate of speed, without giving that attention to the observance of any object on the track which his duty required. The case was well'submitted to the jury, in a full and adequate charge. There was no error in the answer to the eleventh point. We adhere to our decisions as to the unconstitutionality of the Act of 4th April, 1868, limiting the amount to be recovered as declared in Central Railroad Co. of N. J. <em>v. </em>Cook, 1 W. N. C., 319, and Passenger Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Boudrou, 11 Norris, 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
