She died in 1864, never having had a child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">The plaintiff after giving these facts in evidence, rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">The Court entered a judgment of nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-9\">A motion to take off the nonsuit was then made, which the Court, January 31 st, 1881, overruled, filing an opinion as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-10\">\u201cHenry Leis was married to a daughter of John Van Eeed, Senior. On the 10th day of April, 1820, his father-in-law \u2018paid and advanced\u2019 to him the sum of eight hundred and fifty pounds. It is apparent that the reason of this advancement was that Henry Leis was a husband of his daughter Hannah. This is made perfectly clear by the recital in the bond: \u2018 Whereas, the said Henry Leis is intermarried with Hannah, the daughter of the said John Van Eeed, and the said John Van Eeed, Senior, hath this day paid and advanced to the said Henry Leis,\u2019 etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-11\">\u201cAt the time he \u2018paid and advanced \u2019 to Henry Leis this sum he took a bond and mortgage from him. The administrator <em>d. b. n. c. t. a. </em>of John Van Eeed issued a <em>scire facias </em>on the mortgage. The mortgage says: \u2018 Conditioned for the paymenNof eight hundred and fifty pounds, to be paid if certain events m the condition of said bond mentioned shall take place.\u2019 What were the conditions of the bond ? The money was to be retained upon the following conditions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\">\u201c 1. Henry Leis and his wife were to hold it without interest during the lifetime of the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-13\">\u201c 2. In case of her death before her husband, it was to be paid to her heirs as in case of intestacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-14\">\u00ab 3. If Hannah shall have a child with Henry Leis, then if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the child be living, the whole sum shall be considered as paid to Hannah on account of her portion in her father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">\u201c 4. If Hannah should die before Henry Leis, without leaving any children, in one year after her death he was to pay six hundred and sixty-six pounds, thirteen shillings, and four pence, and to retain the balance as part of his wife\u2019s portion had out of the estate of her said father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">\u201c Instead then of the words \u2018 held and firmly bound unto,\u2019 which are those contained in a bond for the loan of money, the words \u2018 paid and advanced \u2019 are here used, clearly indicating that the transaction was not a loan to Henry Leis, but an advancement to him in right of his wife. The object of the mortgage was to protect the wife\u2019s estate in the event of her death in the lifetime of her husband, but nothing is said about a repayment of the money in the event of his death in the lifetime of the wife without children. Henry Leis died over forty years ago without children. Hannah, the wife, died in 1864, without children. In 1878, an administrator was raised on the estate of John Van Reed, and he attempts to collect this money. In the judgment of the Court the contingencies under which the money was to be paid never arose, and as it was to be \u2018 retained \u2019 on every other contingency than those expressly enumerated, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">The plaintiff then took out a writ of error, assigning as error the refusal of the Court to set aside the nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-8\"><em>&amp; B. Wiegand </em>and <em>Richmond L. </em>Jones, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-9\">The error upon which the Court below proceeded, in the matter of this bond, was in looking to the condition and not to the obligation for the promise to pay. The learned judge says: \u201cInstead then of the words \u2018held and firmly bound unto,\u2019 which are those contained in a bond for the loan of money, the words \u2018 paid and advanced \u2019 are here used,\u201d whilst a reference to the obligation shows, as a simple matter of fact, that the words \u201c held and firmly bound unto\u201d are used, and that the words \u201c paid and advanced \u201d are not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-10\">These words, \u201c paid and advanced,\u201d are found neither in the obligation nor in the condition proper, but in a preamble to the condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-11\">The recital of the marriage of his daughter to Leis, in connection with which the words \u201cpaid and advanced\u201d are used, has plain reference to the contingency of her having a child with Leis, in which event it is stipulated in one of the conditions that \u201c the said whole sum of eight hundred and fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>pounds shall be considered as paid to her as part of her portion due to her out of the estate of her said father.\u201d N ow, in the face of this express declaration that the eight hundred and fifty pounds, which the mortgage was given to secure, shall only be considered as part of her portion, or as an advancement in the event of her having a child, the Court below says that these words \u201c paid and advanced \u201d \u201c clearly indicate that the transaction was not a loan to Henry Leis, but an advancement to him in right of his wife,\u201d although she never had a child, and although the very condition upon which it was to be treated as an advancement was not fulfilled. Again, the presumption of its being an advancement to Leis is as plainly rebutted in the other condition, which provides that if Leis should survive his wife (there being no child!, he should, one 3-ear after her death, pay six hundred and sixty-six pounds of this debt to Van Reed, and retain the balance as part of his wife\u2019s portion out of her father\u2019s estate. The reasoning of the Court leads to the most improbable conclusion, that Van Reed, the mortgagee, intended that, after the death of his daughter, the mortgaged premises if in the hands of Leis, his son-in-law, should pay three-fourths of this debt, but if in the hands of strangers should pay nothing at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-6\">The meaning of the whole transaction is obvious. Van Reed having loaned to Leis eight hundred and fifty pounds, took a bond and mortgage to secure the payment of the loan \u2022 upon the death of his daughter, Mrs. Leis, and then provided that, if in the meantime a child should be born to them, his daughter might keep the money, and failing of issue\u2014 if she should die before Leis \u2014 he should pay six hundred and sixty-six pounds, and keep the balance. Neither of those exceptions happened, and, of course, the mortgaged premises must pay the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-7\">Where a bond is conditioned for the payment-of a certain sum, and no time is fixed in it for payment, it is in law a covenant for immediate payment: Rhoads <em>v. </em>Reed, 8 N., 436; Tuckey <em>v. </em>Hawkins, 56 E. C. L. R., 655.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-8\"><em>George F. Baer </em>and <em>Ii. Van Heed, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-9\">In the mortgage itself, the intention of the parties as to the repayment of the money is clearly set forth. It says: \u201cConditioned for the payment of eight hundred and fifty pounds, to be paid if certain events in the condition of said bond mentioned shall take place as in and by the said obligation and condition thereof, relation being thereunto had, more fully and at large appears.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-10\">Now, the force of the obligation was that the money was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>to be paid only on the happening of certain events. What were those events, and did they happen ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\"><em>First: </em>\u201c The said <em>TIenry </em>Leis and wife shall hold the same without interest during the lifetime of his said wife Hannah, but in case she should die before her husband, then the same shall be paid to her heirs as in case of intestacy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">. She did not die before her husband, and under this condition the money is not to be repaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-8\"><em>Second: </em>\u201c If the said Hannah shall have a child at any time during the continuance of the marriage with her present husband, that immediately thereupon, if the said child be living, the said whole sum of eight hundred and fifty pounds shall be considered as paid to her as part of her portion due to her out of the estate of her said father.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-9\">The event provided for here did not happen, and the clause is only of importance as fully confirming the fact that it was intended as an advancement and not as a loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-10\"><em>Third: </em>\u201cIf the said Hannah should die before her husband without having any children, that in one year after her decease, he shall repay to the said John Van Reed, Senior, the sum of six hundred and sixty-six pounds, thirteen shillings, and four pence, part of the said sum of eight hundred and fifty pounds, and the residue thereof to be retained by the said Henry Leis as part of his wife\u2019s portion due out of the estate of her said father.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-11\">Hannah did not die before her husband, and therefore the events herein provided for do not make the bond payable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-12\">As neither of the events mentioned took place, by the very terms of the bond and mortgage it is not payable.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b56-13\">March 13th, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ACG\">\u2014 Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"ASJ\">The bond showed that the amount secured by it was really an advancement to the wife of the obligor, and the condition very clearly indicates that it was to be paid only if one of the events mentioned should take place. Now the event which has taken place, namely, the death of Henry Leis before his wife without leaving any children, is not among these events. It is evident, then, that the charge of the Court below was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
