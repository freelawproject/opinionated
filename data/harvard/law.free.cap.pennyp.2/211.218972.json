Hoffman, under an act of Assembly of 1869, entitled \u2018An act relating to fraudulent debtors.\u2019 In this proceeding Water P. Huber was made garnishee, and certain property was attached in his hands, as alleged by the plaintiff, under the direction of the Court. The jury have been sworn to try the issue between the plaintiff and defendant as to whether there is an indebtedness. The plaintiff has offered in evidence a bond, which shows an indebtedness. The defendant has produced evidence from which it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that there was a recovery of judgment in this Court in another action on the same bond, and the Court is of the opinion that the recovery of judgment in that case prevents a recovery of judgment in this case, and holding these views, the Court direct you to enter a verdict in favor of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\">January 24th, 1882. Verdict for the defendant, upon which judgment was afterward entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-7\">The plaintiff then took out a writ of error, assigning as errors the refusal of the Court to permit the jury to be sworn as to the garnishee, the overruling of the offersof testimony, and the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-8\"><em>JButz \u00a7 Schwartz </em>and J. <em>S. </em>Dillinger, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-9\">This case is distinguished from Brenner <em>v. </em>Moyer, 10 W. N. C., 565, because (1), the attachment issued before the suit was commenced in which judgment was obtained ; (2), the property here is incapable of manucaption; (3), no bond has been filed; (4), this suit is against two persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-10\">All that the Court decided in that case was, that after a bond has been filed by defendant the suit becomes an ordinary personal action: Jackson\u2019s Appeal, 2 Grant, 407; Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Whitney, 19 Pitts. L. J., 114.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-11\">The inference is, that until a bond is filed it is not a personal action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-12\"><em>Edward </em>Harvey, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-13\">The lien is merely interlocutory, and the issue made up on the contract sued upon is the only matter for tidal: Sharp-less <em>v. </em>Ziegler, 11 Norris, 469 ; Cornman\u2019s Appeal, 9 Norris, 256 ; Gould <em>v. </em>Walker, 2 W. N. C., 81; Brenner <em>v. </em>Moyer, 10 W. N. C., 565. The last case decides this controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-14\">It is immaterial which suit is commenced first. It is the first judgment for the same cause of action which constitutes an effective defence: Duffy <em>v. </em>Lytle, 5 W., 132 ; Jones <em>v. </em>Ellison, 10 W. N. C., 205.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-15\">The former recovery is pleadable in bar, and is conclusive evidence: Outram <em>v. </em>Morewood, 3 East, 356; Kilheffer <em>v. </em>Herr, 17 S. &amp; R., 319; Marsh <em>v. </em>Pier, 4 R., 273; Darlington <em>v. </em>Gray, 5 Wh., 487; Gilchrist <em>v. </em>Bale, 8 W., 355; Corbet <em>v. </em>Evans, 1 Casey, 310.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b209-16\">March 20th, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AMM\">\u2014 Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"Ain\">This case is ruled by Brenner <em>v. </em>Moyer, 10 W. N. C., 565, in which it was decided that proceedings under the Act of March 17th; 1869, Pamph. L., 8, are to be regarded as a mere personal action. The attachment is to secure a lien, and depends upon the recovery of a final personal judgment. It follows that the rulings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the learned judge in the Court below were right, and that the prior judgment for the same cause of action was a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
