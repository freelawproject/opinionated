Sylvanus S. Chapman and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b499-6\">A town skip treasurer gave bond to \u201cThe People of the State of Michigan,\u201d instead of to the township as required by law. It was held that suit could not be brought on this bond in the namo of the township.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b499-7\">An averment in the declaration that the defendants, by the bond, \u201cacknowledged themselves to be held and firmly bound unto the plaintiffs, by the name and description of the People of the State of Michigan,\u201d does not help the case. The Court must take judicial notice that the State and the township are separate political organizations, and the averment is therefore inconsistent with the bond, which parol evidence can not be received to contradict.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b499-8\">\n<em>Heard July 12th and 13th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AK3\">\n<em>Decided July 17th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">On case made from Cass Circuit.

The bond itself, when read in evidence, supports the averment in the declaration which is claimed to be repugnant, shows the mistake, and designates the plaintiff as the party in interest. Such being the case, we think it would require no violation of the rules of evidence to prove this averment, and that the bond itself vests the right in the plaintiff: \u2014 <em>Grant on Corp. </em>51 <em>and </em>note; 10 <em>Mass. </em>327; 10 <em>Mass. </em>360; 21 <em>Pick. </em>487; 13 <em>Johns. </em>88; 1 <em>Met. </em>359; 1 <em>Met. </em>473; 18 <em>Ill. </em>38; 28 <em>Penn. </em>186; <em>Kyd on Corp. </em>257; <em>Supervisors v. </em>Coffinbury, 1 <em>Mich. </em>355.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-12\"><em>D. </em>Blackman, for defendants :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-13\">The obligee in the bond who has the legal interest must be the plaintiff\u2019 in debt on bond, although it be stated therein that the bond is made for tbe benefit or use of another than the obligee: \u2014 1 <em>East, </em>497; 8 <em>Conn. </em>286; 4 <em>Gray, </em>81; 9 <em>Wend. </em>233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-14\">This is not a case of misnomer, which is a variation from the true name, but on the contrary the Court take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>judicial cognizance of tbe fact that the town is one corporation and the State <em>another: </em>\u2014 7 <em>Blackf. </em>86.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b500-5\">Manning J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">This is an action of debt on a township treasurer\u2019s bond, brought in the name of _the township against the treasurer and his sureties, on a bond given by them to The People of the State of Michigan, the declaration stating- that the defendants acknowledged themselves to be held and firmly bound unto the plaintiff, by the name and description of The People of the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The defendants craved oyer of the bond, and demurred to the declaration, and the question is whether the action can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The statute requires the township treasurer to give a bond with sureties to the township. <em>Comp. L. </em>\u00a7 <em>569. </em>The bond declared on is to the People of the State of Michigan, instead of the township. It is not the bond required by the statute. And if an action can be sustained on it in its present shape, it must be in the name of The People of the State of Michigan, the obligees, unless the averment in the declaration will authorize an action in the name of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The State of Michigan and the township of LaGrange are separate political organizations; in law corporations, of which we can take notice judicially. This being the case, the averment in the declaration is not consistent but wholly inconsistent with the bond, which parol evidence can not be received to contradict. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and a judgment be entered for the defendants, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-10\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
