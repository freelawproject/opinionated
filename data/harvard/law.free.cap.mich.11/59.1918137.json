Bots-ford was made a defendant as subsequent purchaser. The \u25a0defendants set up the defense of usury. It appeared in evidence that Botsford purchased the mortgaged premises \u2022of the mortgagors, subject to the mortgage, and agreed to pay it up. The Circuit Court in Chancery granted \u25a0decree in favor of complainant for the whole face of the mortgage. Botsford alone appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-11\"><em>O.

By tbe agreement between him and the mortgagor when he purchased he was to pay the mortgage. Its payment was a part of the consideration or purchase price he was to pay for the land. On this ground, if no other, he should not be permitted to-set up usury in tbe contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee. In the case of the <em>Farmers and Mechanics' Bank v. Kimmel, </em>1 <em>Mich. </em>84, usury is held to be a persona^ defense, to be made by a party to the contract, of which a. subsequent purchaser can not avail himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The decree is affirmed, -with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
