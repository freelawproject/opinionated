J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-X\">Appellant appeals the denial of his motion to suppress, contending that the trial judge erred in concluding that his detention was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-14\">On January 6, 2003, appellant was detained after being stopped by Officer Begley of the Daly City Police Department for a violation of Vehicle Code section 4000, subdivision (a) (driving with expired registration). Officer Begley noticed that appellant\u2019s car was traveling with an expired registration tag on his license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 3\">*Supp. 3</page-number>Officer Begley also saw, however, a \u201cnumber in the window which is temporary registration.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The car did have a \u201ctemporary registration for the month of January in the rear window of the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He said it \u201ccould come from anywhere and [in his mind] doesn\u2019t necessarily . . . mean that it had valid registration.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He testified that in his \u201ctraining and experience numerous individuals have been known to place the temporary registration stickers on the wrong vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his limited experience (one and a half years as a police officer) he has stopped approximately 30 to 40 vehicles displaying apparent temporary registrations stickers, with about half of them turning out to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Other than the registration issue appellant did not do anything to justify any stop. As a result of the stop, stolen property was found in appellant\u2019s possession. In the trial court he moved to suppress the discovery of this evidence, based upon the claimed illegal detention. Respondent argued that the stop was valid because all that is needed is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that a crime occurred. The trial court agreed and denied the motion to suppress. From that ruling, appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">There is no dispute about the evidence; therefore, the issue is solely one of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA traffic stop is justified at its inception if based on at least reasonable suspicion that the driver has violated the Vehicle Code or some other law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Do the facts present a reasonable suspicion that appellant violated the Vehicle Code?</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">If the sole issue were the expired registration tag on the rear license plate, then the answer would be surely yes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As long as the registered owner of a vehicle has timely applied for renewal of his car registration, however, the driver\u2019s car may be operated on the highway until new indicia of current registration has been received from the Department of Motor Vehicles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Proof of this temporary registration may be displayed in the lower right or left comer of the windshield or right-hand comer of the rear window, depending on its size.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>Obviously, the registration tag on the rear license plate is there so that a police officer may verify that the vehicle involved is lawfully on the roadways. Appellant\u2019s car had a temporary registration tag for the month of January in the window.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This, too, would be there for the police officer to verify that the vehicle is lawfully on the roadway. It would appear that appellant did all that was statutorily required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">Here, however, Officer Begley decided because of his personal experiences that he would stop the vehicle to verify the temporary registration was valid. Ordinarily, if he has time, he would call his department for a registration check. There was no evidence presented as to whether he did or did not check and if he did not, why he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Thus, may an officer\u2019s personal experiences be taken into account in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists? Generally, of course, special training and experience of a police officer may be taken into account in determining whether there is a reasonable suspicion a crime has taken place.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">Because of Officer Begley\u2019s experience, he decided to confirm that the temporary sticker was valid. He did not have any particularized belief that appellant\u2019s car was not validly registered; he only assumed based upon his experience that approximately 50 percent of the time the temporary registrations are not valid for the car on which they are placed. There was no evidence presented to suggest that appellant\u2019s temporary registration sticker was invalid. Officer Begley made no effort to ascertain if in fact the temporary sticker was invalid by checking with his dispatcher before intruding on appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be left alone absent particularized suspicion that he was committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Given the circumstances of this case, and based on a record that appellant did everything required of him to operate his vehicle lawfully on the highway, Officer Begley\u2019s stop without checking with his dispatcher to confirm that appellant\u2019s registration was invalid constituted an unlawful detention.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Otherwise, every motorist on the road who has attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>comply with the Vehicle Code regarding registration matters would be subject to a stop without more. As a result, the motion to suppress should have been granted. The trial court\u2019s denial is reversed. This case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Kopp, J., and Mittlesteadt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>Subject Matter Table This table contains, alphabetically by subject matter, cases reported in this volume.
