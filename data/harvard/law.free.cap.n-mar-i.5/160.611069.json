Santos (\u201cSantos\u201d) appeals the verdict and judgment entered on November 10, 1994, the December 29, 1994, sentencing order, the Superior Court\u2019s denial of his proposed jury instructions orally entered on November 9, 1994, and the Superior Court\u2019s denial of his oral motion for judgment of acquittal entered on November 9, 1994. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article IV, \u00a7 2 of the Commonwealth Constitution. N.M.I Const., art. IV, \u00a7 2 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">ISSUES PRESENTED AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\u00b62 Santos raises two issues for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"Ajy\">(1) Whether the Superior Court erred in denying Santos\u2019 motion for directed verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the Attorney General\u2019s (\u201cCommonwealth\u201d) case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">\u00b63 (2) Whether there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict Santos and whether the jury verdict was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"App\">\u00b64 Whether the Superior Court erred in denying Santos\u2019 motion for a directed verdict is reviewed de novo. <em>Commonwealth v. Cabrera, 4 </em>N.M.L 240, 248 n.53 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"ANc\">\u00b65 Whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo. <em>Aguito </em>v. <em>Northern Marianas Investment Group, Ltd., 4 </em>N.M.L 7, 9 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b171-20\">\u00b66 On or around the morning of December 6,1993, Pilar B. Corro (\u201cCorro\u201d) left her house. On her return, she found her door open and several items missing from her house. At about 9:30 a.m., a witness, Edward Ayuyu, saw Santos and Charlie Manglona (\u201cManglona\u201d) near Corro\u2019s house. Later he saw Santos driving away with Manglona.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u00b67 On March 18, 1994, the Commonwealth filed an information against Santos. Santos was arraigned on March 29, 1994, and entered a plea of not guilty to all charges. On November 7,1994, the Commonwealth filed its first amended information charging Santos with two counts of burglary and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u00b68 A jury trial was held on November 7, 1994. On November 9, 1994, after the Commonwealth rested its case, Santos moved for a directed verdict of acquittal. The court denied the motion. On November 9, 1994, the juiy returned a verdict finding Santos guilty of one count of burglary and one count of theft. On November 10,1994, the court entered a judgment of conviction for burglary and theft.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 29,1994, there was a sentencing hearing. The court entered a judgment and commitment order sentencing Santos to five years in prison and imposing a $ 10,000 fine for each count with the sentences to run concurrently. Santos timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-23\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b171-24\">\n<em>I. Whether the Superior Court erred in denying Santos \u2019 motion for directed verdict of acquittal at the conclusion of the government\u2019s case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-25\">\u00b69 At the conclusion of the trial, Santos moved for an order directing judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the Commonwealth had failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that Santos was guilty of burglary or theft. Santos alleges that the crimes were committed by Manglona and that he was only an innocent bystander. In the alternative, he claims that he was, at most, an aider and abetter. However, since he was not charged as an aider, Santos claims he is not guilty of any crimes and should have been acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-26\">\u00b610 The Commonwealth contends that the totality of evidence was sufficient to submit the case to jury since the evidence satisfied the elements ofthe charged crimes. The testimony of the witnesses, especially Mr. Ayuyu, was sufficient to prove that Santos was guilty of the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"ASL\">\u00b611 We consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the essential elements of the offense. <em>Commonwealth v. Ramangmau, 4 </em>N.M.L 227, 237 (1995). The motion for acquittal must be granted only if \u201cthere is no evidence upon which a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"ABD\">\u00b612 Therefore, if we find that there was some evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>where a reasonable person might conclude guilt, then we should affirm. Both parties have submitted a recitation of the facts in their respective briefs and have attempted to highlight the testimony of key witnesses in an attempt to recreate, for this Court, the proceedings upon which the jury rendered its guilty verdict. However, Santos has failed to provide the Court with a transcript of any testimony presented by the government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Absent the record, we cannot properly review the reasoning behind the Superior Court\u2019s decision to deny Santos\u2019 motion for directed verdict at the conclusion of the government\u2019s case. Accordingly, with what was provided to the Court, we find no error in the Superior Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">\n<em>II. Whether there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict Santos and the jury verdict was not supported by the evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b613 Santos argues that a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty of the charges because the verdict was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b614 The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argues that Santos was at Mrs. Corro\u2019s house for 45 minutes while someone else loaded his car up with small appliances and then they drove away together. A jury, therefore, properly inferred guilt based upon the evidence as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"Azu\">\u00b615 Whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the jury found credible Ayuyu\u2019s testimony that he \u201cobserved [Santos] and Charlie Manglona outside of the home of Pilar Corro,\u201d that \u201cCharlie Manglona was carrying out small appliances out of Pilar Corro\u2019s house and [Santos] was walking back and forth to the car with Manglona, and drove the car away with Mr. Manglona as a passenger.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ayuyu also testified that he had a clear and unobstructed view of Santos during this entire scenario and was able to provide an in-court identification of Santos.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was also testimony presented which showed Santos showing a Walkman, that was later identified by the victim as her property, to several individuals a few days after the burglary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based upon the evidence presented, we agree that a jury could have found Santos guilty of theft and burglary and, therefore, we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">\u00b616 Based upon the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-22\"> As amended by the passage of Legislative Initiative 10-3, ratified by the voters on November 1,1997, and certified by the Board of Elections on December 13,1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-30\"> Appellant also suggests in his discussion that there was an error in the jury instructions and submitted, in the excerpts of record, the government\u2019s proposed jury instructions as given; however, that issue is not before this Court in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AZ5p\"> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>Criminal Case No. 94-0033 (N.M.I Super.
