ORS 163.257. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In 1975 or 1976, defendant\u2019s daughter, Julie Bayse, began living with Michael Bohanan. The couple had two children: one born in 1981, and the other born in 1982. Bayse and Bohanan ceased living together in 1984 or 1985. Bohanan then began living with Phyllis Bounds. Although Bayse had legal custody of the children, Bohanan and Bounds had physical custody from 1986 until December, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In December, 1988, defendant decided to seek custody of her granddaughters. She retained an attorney, who advised her that she could obtain legal custody if Bayse would delegate it to her. In mid-December, 1988, Bayse signed a custody delegation that was valid for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">On December 27,1988, defendant visited Bohanan and Bounds. She did not inform them of the custody delegation. On December 28, defendant took the children to a nearby store where she had arranged for a friend, Lucille McCrady, to meet her. McCrady drove defendant and the children to Redding, California. Defendant then took the children by bus to Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Bohanan reported to the police that the children had been taken. He also obtained a temporary custody order. At a hearing on May 4, 1989, Bohanan was granted permanent custody of the children. Defendant, who was still in Arizona, spoke with McCrady by telephone twice that day. They deny discussing, or knowing of, the custody determination at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Shortly thereafter, defendant left Arizona with the children, because she believed that Bohanan had discovered her location. She drove up the California and Oregon coasts, and met McCrady in Newport, Oregon, in the second or third week of May, 1989. Defendant and the children continued north to British Columbia, and then made their way to West Palm Beach, Florida. In December, 1990, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>moved again, this time to Minnesota. Defendant was arrested there in March, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Defendant was indicted in Oregon, and brought to trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She intended to raise a \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense, ORS 161.200, and to present evidence that she took the children because Bohanan and Bounds were abusing them. Before trial, the state moved to preclude defendant from raising the choice of evils defense. That motion was granted. It also moved before trial to exclude all testimony, offered for any purpose, regarding alleged abuse of the children by Bohanan or Bounds. Defendant argued that the evidence was relevant to rebut the prosecution\u2019s case. The trial court ruled that the evidence was not relevant, and granted the state\u2019s motion to exclude all testimony regarding the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">At trial, defense counsel raised an objection early in the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks. While arguing that objection, defense counsel expressed displeasure with the court\u2019s pretrial ruling. The court admonished him. Defense counsel responded that he was \u201ctrying to get some guidance.\u201d After some discussion, the court concluded \u201cwhat you are attempting to do is [to] get into abuse, which has no relevancy here. Now you got the direction. Follow it. Clear?\u201d Defense counsel responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">During defense counsel\u2019s opening remarks, he told the jury that defendant\u2019s intent when she took the children was to keep them away from Bohanan. The prosecutor objected, and the court told defense counsel that he was \u201cgetting in too close to the area that I already forewarned you about.\u201d Defense counsel then explained to the jury that defendant needed to hide \u201cfor fear of what [Bohanan] would do.\u201d The prosecutor objected. Defense counsel retorted, \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything about child abuse.\u201d The court instructed the jurors to strike that comment from their minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>On direct examination, defendant testified that she did not show Bohanan her custody papers before taking the children \u201c[b]ecause to do so would have been dangerous.\u201d The prosecutor objected and asked to be heard. After hearing argument outside the presence of the jury, the court ruled that the testimony was admissible, because defendant had not indicated whether the danger she feared was to the children or to herself. However, the court warned, \u201cshe\u2019s putting herself in a position of being in contempt if she talks about danger to the children. I think she understands it.\u201d The following colloquy then occurred between the court and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: I take it you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201c[Defendant]: No, I do not understand that. You are allowing us to talk about danger to myself but I can\u2019t talk about danger to the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201c[Defendant]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201c[Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\u2018 \u2018THE COURT: * * * I think it is pretty clear * * * by now that your defense that you are trying to raise with regard to the children is totally out, period. No mention. Clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The jury returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">Later in his direct examination, defense counsel asked defendant why she left Arizona with the children. Defendant answered, \u201cthe safety of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The prosecutor objected. The objection was sustained, and the jury was told to disregard defendant\u2019s answer. The prosecutor then moved for a mistrial. A hearing was held outside the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: You heard what I said just a few minutes earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">\u201c[Defendant]: \u201cYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: You totally disregarded it. And I notice[d] when I got through telling you what you had to watch for you gave me a look of utter contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">\u201c[Defendant]: I am not sure what terminology I am allowed to use to describe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201c[THE COURT: I can\u2019t believe \u2014 you are an intelligent enough person to know just exactly what I said to you. Mistrial will be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Defendant was brought to trial a second time. She moved to dismiss on the ground that former jeopardy-barred the second trial. The court held that the mistrial was granted in the first trial for manifest necessity, and denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Evidence of abuse of the children by Bohanan and Bounds was again excluded. A jury found defendant guilty of both counts, and judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We first address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by denying her motion to dismiss on the ground that former jeopardy bars this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">There is no dispute that jeopardy attached at the first trial. Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offence.\u201d However, a former prosecution does not bar retrial if the state meets its burden of showing that a mistrial was granted for manifest necessity. <em>State v. Cole, </em>286 Or 411, 595 P2d 466, <em>cert den </em>444 US 968 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">At the first trial, defendant deliberately and repeatedly sought to undermine the court\u2019s pretrial ruling, and eventually circumvented it. It is essential to the judicial process that the parties obey the trial court\u2019s rulings. On these facts, we conclude that the motion for mistrial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>granted for manifest necessity. The former prosecution, therefore, did not bar defendant\u2019s retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Defendant also assigns error to the court\u2019s ruling excluding evidence of abuse of the children. She argues that the evidence was relevant to rebut the state\u2019s proof that she knew she was keeping the children without legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Proffered evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. OEC 401. As the Supreme Court recently noted, the proper inquiry is: \u201c \u2018Does the item of evidence even slightly increase or decrease the probability of the existence of any material fact in issue? If the item of evidence affects the balance of probabilities to any degree, it is logically relevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hampton, </em>317 Or 251, 254-55, 855 P2d 621 (1993) (quoting <em>State v. Gailey, </em>301 Or 563, 567, 725 P2d (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">A person commits custodial interference in the first degree, ORS 163.257, by committing custodial interference in the second degree under aggravating circumstances. A person commits custodial interference in the second degree if,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cknowing or having reason to know that the person has no legal right to do so, the person takes, entices or keeps another person from the other person\u2019s lawful custodian[.]\u201d ORS 163.245(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The state was required to prove that defendant knew or had reason to know that she had no legal right to custody of her grandchildren. The state\u2019s closing argument expressly urged the jury to infer from her flight that defendant knew that she lacked custody. By contending that defendant\u2019s flight was motivated by knowledge that she had no legal right to custody of the children, the state made defendant\u2019s motive for fleeing an issue in the case. The excluded evidence was relevant, because it provides an alternative explanation for why defendant tried to keep the children hidden from Bohanan and Bounds. The trial court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>excluding the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On this record, we are unwilling to say that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We need not address defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> The first indictment alleges that defendant committed custodial interference in the first degree by knowingly keeping the younger child from her lawful custodian between May 4,1989, and October 24,1989. The second indictment is similar, except that it refers instead to the older child. Both indictments are dated October 27,1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> ORS chapter 131 affords a similar protection. ORS 131.515(1) provides that, except as provided in ORS 131.525 and ORS 131.535, \u201c[n]o person shall be prosecuted twice for the same offense.\u201d ORS 131.525 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201c(1) A previous prosecution is not a bar to a subsequent prosecution when the previous prosecution was properly terminated under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">u# * s|c <em>Hr. </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">\u201c(b) The trial court finds that termination, other than by judgment of acquittal, is necessary because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">\u201c(C) Prejudicial conduct, in or outside the courtroom, makes it impossible to proceed with the trial without injustice to either defendant or the state[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">Although defendant cites that statute, her argument relies solely on constitutional jurisprudence. She does not argue that ORS 131.515 affords her any greater protection than the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\"> The state does not argue that the evidence was properly excluded on any ground other than its relevance.
