Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 288a, subd. (c)) and found true an allegation that Muniz inflicted great bodily injury on the victim within the meaning of section 12022.8. The jury acquitted Muniz of a second count of sexual penetration with a foreign object (\u00a7 289), which had an accompanying great bodily injury allegation. The trial court sentenced Muniz to the middle term of six years on the oral copulation count and imposed an additional five years for the great bodily injury enhancement for a total sentence of eleven years in prison. Muniz appeals, raising the following arguments: (1) improper rebuttal evidence was admitted; (2) the trial court erred by not instructing on a lesser-included offense and not giving the unanimity instruction on the act(s) constituting great bodily injury; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding on the great bodily injury allegation; and (4) the sentence was disproportionate. In a habeas corpus petition that has been consolidated with this appeal, Muniz contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial on the basis of his trial counsel\u2019s failure to (1) object to the introduction of improper rebuttal evidence and (2) move for a new trial because the trial court did not give the unanimity instruction with respect to the great bodily injury allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">After completing her work shift in the early morning hours of August 11, 1987, Sherri S. went to Popeye\u2019s Bar in Costa Mesa, where she remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>until the 2 a.m. closing. As she was leaving, she spoke to Todd Harding, an acquaintance who was talking with Muniz. Muniz, whom Sherri had never seen before, asked Sherri if she \u201csnort[ed],\u201d which Sherri assumed was a reference to cocaine. Sherri indicated she occasionally did and accepted Muniz\u2019s invitation. Muniz and Sherri drove in Sherri\u2019s car to the parking lot next door and parked near Muniz\u2019s truck. Muniz offered Sherri \u201cspeed\u201d (methamphetamine), but Sherri said she wanted to leave because she did not use \u201cspeed.\u201d Muniz grabbed the car keys from the ignition and told Sherri she was not going anywhere until she \u201csucked his dick.\u201d Sherri tried to leave the car, but Muniz grabbed her by the hair and held her inside. Sherri honked the car horn and screamed, but to no avail. In the ensuing struggle, Sherri fell out of the car onto the concrete parking lot and was rendered unconscious. Muniz exited the car, got on top of Sherri, and pulled her hair and hit her on the face and head. Muniz then pushed Sherri into the car and threatened to kill her and throw her body into a nearby ditch if she did not orally copulate him. Sherri complied out of fear. Sherri eventually arrived home that morning sometime after 4 a.m. She told her roommate what happened. Her eye was black, puffy and swelling shut; she had other marks on her face as well. She also sustained injuries to her right knee, right elbow and right buttock. A day or two after the assault, Sherri went to an ophthalmologist, but the doctor could not examine her retina until a few weeks later because her eye was closed shut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Muniz testified that when he met Sherri he asked her \u201cif she wanted to go outside and do a line,\u201d not mentioning any particular drug. Muniz testified Sherri wanted some cocaine for the following day and she offered to orally copulate him in exchange for his getting the cocaine. Muniz said he originally was going to \u201cgive\u201d Sherri some methamphetamine to use then, but Sherri wanted some \u201cextra\u201d methamphetamine to use the next day; the oral copulation was in exchange for the \u201cextra\u201d methamphetamine. Muniz said Sherri was orally copulating him when she abruptly bolted up and fell out of the car onto the parking lot pavement. Muniz said Sherri apologized for \u201cmaking a fool out of herself,\u201d voluntarily returned to the car and completed the oral copulation. He denied removing the car keys from the ignition and struggling with Sherri. Muniz also said Sherri had no visible injuries while she was with him and made no complaints about any injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\"> Muniz contends he was denied a fair trial because the trial court allowed improper and prejudicial rebuttal evidence. Specifically, he attacks (1) portions of Detective Darell Freeman\u2019s rebuttal testimony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>which Freeman related Muniz\u2019s confirmation that he had offered to pay for some of Sherri\u2019s medical expenses and (2) portions of Todd Harding\u2019s testimony during rebuttal that as he and Muniz were leaving the bar, Muniz pointed at Sherri and said he was \u201cgoing to get that girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Muniz\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the rebuttal testimony of either Freeman or Harding. Thus, any claim of error has been waived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 618, fn. 1 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mosher </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 379, 399 [82 Cal.Rptr. 379, 461 P.2d 659].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra, </em>our Supreme Court said: \u201cThe order of proof, however, lies within the sound discretion of the trial court under Penal Code section 1094. In this case the defense raised no objection to the rebuttal testimony of Dr. Rapaport. In the absence of an objection to the trial court, we certainly cannot hold that it abused its discretion in permitting Dr. Rapaport to testify on rebuttal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 399-400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">Nevertheless, we must address the propriety of Freeman\u2019s and Harding\u2019s rebuttal testimony because Muniz has again raised the issue in his writ of habeas corpus in connection with the argument he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney did not object to the testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Section 1093, which outlines the order of procedure to be used in criminal trials, includes subdivision (d), which allows presentation of a rebuttal case, unless the trial court, \u201cfor good reason, in furtherance of justice,\u201d allows the parties \u201cto offer evidence upon their original case.\u201d The trial court\u2019s discretion with respect to the order of proof is further given wide breadth by Evidence Code section 320, which provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the court in its discretion shall regulate the order of proof.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 814, 834-835 [163 Cal.Rptr. 601, 608 P.2d 689], vacated and remanded for reconsideration 449 U.S. 810 [66 L.Ed.2d 13, 101 S.Ct. 57], reiterated 28 Cal.3d 463 [171 Cal.Rptr. 505, 622 P.2d 950].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 737 [312 P.2d 665], our Supreme Court held \u201cproper rebuttal evidence does not include a material part of the case in the prosecution\u2019s possession that tends to establish the defendant\u2019s commission of the crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 753.) In <em>Carter, </em>a murder case, the prosecution did not present the defendant\u2019s red cap, which was left at the scene of the crime, until rebuttal. The defendant had testified he had not been at the scene and had not left anything there. The prosecution gave no reason for failing to produce the cap during its case-in-chief. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>Supreme Court disapproved of the prosecutor\u2019s tactics and observed rebuttal evidence \u201cis restricted to evidence made necessary by the defendant\u2019s case in the sense that he has introduced new evidence or made assertions that were not implicit in his denial of guilt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 753-754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Harding\u2019s testimony that Muniz pointed to Sherri and said he was \u201cgoing to get that girl,\u201d directly contradicted Muniz\u2019s testimony that (1) his intention was \u201cjust to give her ... a line or two . . . .\u201d and (2) the idea of romance or sex did not come up until Sherri asked for extra drugs for the next day. In presenting Harding\u2019s testimony in rebuttal, the prosecution did not withhold a material part of its case, but instead offered testimony that supported its case-in-chief after it had been controverted by Muniz. Under these circumstances, we find Harding\u2019s testimony was allowable as rebuttal evidence upon a point put into dispute by Muniz\u2019s testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avery </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 487, 492 [218 P.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Muniz argues Harding\u2019s testimony was unduly prejudicial since the trial court emphasized it during the sentencing hearing. Indeed, the trial court referred to Harding\u2019s testimony as evidence of Muniz\u2019s premeditation and subsequently cited premeditation as a factor in aggravation. This argument is somewhat unusual; typically, prejudicial effect is demonstrated with respect to lay juries. In any event, we do not find Muniz\u2019s argument persuasive; there is no showing that Harding\u2019s testimony had any undue influence on the trier of fact deciding Muniz\u2019s guilt on the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Muniz primarily attacks Freeman\u2019s rebuttal testimony that Muniz confirmed his offer to pay for some of Sherri\u2019s medical expenses as inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1152. His reliance on this statute is misplaced. Evidence Code section 1152 provides in part: \u201c(a) Evidence that a person has, in compromise or from humanitarian motives, furnished or offered or promised to furnish money or any other thing, act, or service to another who has sustained or will sustain or claims that he or she has sustained or will sustain loss or damage, as well as any conduct or statements made in negotiation thereof, is inadmissible to prove his or her liability for the loss or damage or any part of it.\u201d Muniz would have us read into the statute the word \u201ccriminal\u201d as an alternative modifier for liability yet he offers no reason for us to do so. Nor does the case law interpreting Evidence Code section 1152 supply any support for the notion that the statute has any application to criminal cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, even if we were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>assume Evidence Code section 1152 does have application to criminal cases, Freeman\u2019s testimony would still have been proper. Neither Muniz\u2019s statement to Sherri that he would help pay her medical expenses nor his confirmation of it to Freeman was \u201can offer of compromise\u201d as used in Evidence Code section 1152.  \u201c\u2018[T]he statements of a party . . . when not connected with an offer in compromise, may be proved as an admission against interest.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Truestone, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Simi West Industrial Park II </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 715, 725 [209 Cal.Rptr. 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\"> There was no error in allowing either Harding\u2019s or Freeman\u2019s rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\"> Muniz contends the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that (1) sexual battery is a lesser-included offense of forcible oral copulation and (2) to find true the great bodily injury allegation there must be unanimous agreement on which of Muniz\u2019s act or acts caused the great bodily injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">The basic definition of a necessarily included offense is set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510, 517, footnote 4 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055]: \u201c[A]n offense is necessarily included in the charged offense if under the statutory definition of the charged offense it cannot be committed without committing the lesser offense, or if the charging allegations of the accusatory pleading include language describing the offense in such a way that if committed as specified the lesser offense is necessarily committed.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 806, 809 [126 Cal.Rptr. 235, 543 P.2d 603], our Supreme Court noted: \u201c[W]here the accusatory pleading is couched in terms of the statutory definition of the greater crime and no additional factual allegations are included therein, the courts necessarily must rely solely upon the statutory definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">Thus, we apply the test by examining the elements of the two crimes and asking the following question: Can we conclude the greater offense could not have been committed without concomitantly satisfying the elements of the lesser offense? Here, a comparison of the statutory definitions of forcible oral copulation and sexual battery demonstrates sexual battery is not a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>The statutory definition of forcible oral copulation is \u201cthe act of copulating the mouth of one person with the sexual organ or anus of another . . . when the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person or where the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 288a, subds. (a) &amp; (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The statutory definition of sexual battery is \u201ctouching] an intimate part of another person while that person is unlawfully restrained by the accused or an accomplice, and if the touching is against the will of the person touched <em>and is for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse </em>. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 243.4, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Forcible oral copulation does not require a specific intent or purpose (see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Brocklehurst </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 473, 476 [92 Cal.Rptr. 340]); sexual battery does (\u201cfor the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse\u201d). Additionally, the definition of sexual battery includes the element of the victim being restrained; this element is not included in the definition of forcible oral copulation. Thus, sexual battery is not a lesser included offense of forcible oral copulation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the trial court did not err in not giving a lesser included instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">It is well established that the entire jury must agree upon the commission of the same act in order to convict a defendant of the charged offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1901) 133 Cal. 11, 13 [65 P. 13].)  Here, Muniz contends the testimony supported two alternative theories for Sherri\u2019s injuries: (1) she fell onto the parking lot because of a struggle with Muniz; or (2) Muniz struck her. This purported basis for disagreement among the jurors as to the cause of the injuries, Muniz claims, mandated the trial court to instruct the jury sua sponte pursuant to CALJIC No. 17.01<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with respect to the great bodily injury allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">However, it also is well established that a trial court is not obligated to give an instruction\u2014either requested or sua sponte\u2014if the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>presented at trial is such as to preclude a reasonable jury from finding the instruction is applicable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schultz </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 535, 539 [237 Cal.Rptr. 513].) \u201cA unanimity instruction is required only if the jurors could otherwise disagree which act a defendant committed and yet convict him of the crime charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 786, 791 [190 Cal.Rptr. 554], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kurtzman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 322, 330 [250 Cal.Rptr. 244, 758 P.2d 572].) In other words, \u201c[i]f under the evidence presented such disagreement is not reasonably possible, the instruction is unnecessary.\u201d (141 Cal.App.3d at p. 792; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Schultz, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at pp. 539-540 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Bergschneider </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 144 [259 Cal.Rptr. 219].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Here, the facts of this case lead us to the conclusion the trial court\u2019s failure to give CALJIC No. 17.01 was not error because the evidence was <em>not </em>such as to allow reasonable jurors to disagree as to which acts Muniz committed to cause Sherri\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">First of all, Sherri did not recall receiving any injuries when she fell onto the parking lot. The next thing she knew Muniz was on top of her, pulling her hair and striking her in the face with his fist. She believed it was Muniz\u2019s blows that caused her to lose consciousness. In essence, this case amounted to a credibility contest between Muniz and Sherri, and the jury obviously concluded Sherri was more credible. Second, the physical evidence of Sherri\u2019s various injuries belies the theory that they were caused by the fall of a few feet. In order for the unanimity instruction to be significant, there must be evidence of more than one cause for the injuries. Such evidence was not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Moreover, what the evidence did show was Muniz\u2019s actions\u2014from forcing Sherri to orally copulate him during the initial struggle in the vehicle to her falling onto the parking lot to his beating her as she lay on the parking lot\u2014constituted a continuous course of conduct.  The jury unanimity rule does not apply where the act or acts constituting the charged crime amount to a continuous course of conduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1014 [230 Cal.Rptr. 237].) As this court observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>McIntyre </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 899 [176 Cal.Rptr. 3], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 75, 80 [230 Cal.Rptr. 588]: \u201cThe fact that a second forced oral copulation occurred within a few minutes during this sexual attack does not necessarily make this another separate crime any more than it would be true there are separate crimes of battery if the actor throws a right-hand punch to his victim and immediately follows it with a left-hand punch. Similarly, if one punch lands on the victim, the law does not require the jury to agree on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>whether it was the right or the left-hand punch which reached its mark.\u201d (115 Cal.App.3d at p. 910.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in failing to give CALJIC No. 17.01 sua sponte with respect to the great bodily injury enhancement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Section 12022.8 provides: \u201cAny person who inflicts great bodily injury, as defined in Section 12022.7, on any victim in a violation of. . . oral copulation by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person as provided in Section 286 or 288a shall receive a five-year enhancement for each such violation in addition to the sentence provided for the felony conviction.\u201d Section 12022.7 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAs used in this section, great bodily injury means a significant or substantial physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Muniz contends there is insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of great bodily injury. Implicit in his contention is the argument that the injuries suffered by Sherri do not meet the legal standard for great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">We do not believe it is appropriate for us to decide whether Muniz inflicted great bodily injury as an issue of law.  As the court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Salas </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 600, 606 [143 Cal.Rptr. 755]: \u201cWhether the harm resulting to the victim of a robbery constitutes great bodily injury is a question of fact for the jury. [Citation.] If there is sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s finding of great bodily injury, we are bound to accept it, even though the circumstances might reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding.\u201d Similarly, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaramillo </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 830, 836 [159 Cal.Rptr. 771], observed there is \u201ca fine line\u201d between those injuries that are significant or substantial and those that are not. The <em>Jaramillo </em>court concluded: \u201cClearly it is the trier of fact that must in most situations make the determination.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolcott </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 92, 107 [192 Cal.Rptr. 748, 665 P.2d 520], our Supreme Court, citing <em>Salas </em>and <em>Jaramillo, </em>also declined to decide whether the defendant inflicted great bodily injury as an issue of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number> Here, applying the standards of appellate review to a claim of insufficiency of the evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination of great bodily injury. Sherri sustained severe injuries to her eye. It was \u201ccompletely black, blue, purple, completely swollen shut\u201d and \u201cthree to four times the size of a normal eye.\u201d The swelling protruded past the point of the nose. She went to an ophthalmologist a day or two after the assault, but the doctor could not examine the retina because the eye was closed shut. She had to return a few weeks later for a follow-up examination. Sherri\u2019s bruises had not completely healed at the time of the trial\u2014four months after the assault. Sherri testified she lost consciousness and she described the force of Muniz\u2019s blows as so severe that it \u201cfelt like splinters going through my skull. And I saw like white lights in front of my eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Muniz's reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274] is misplaced. <em>Caudillo </em>held that various physical effects\u2014gagging, vomiting, defecation and superficial cuts\u2014suffered during a violent sexual attack did not constitute great bodily injury. The <em>Caudillo </em>court described such injuries as \u201ctransitory and short-lived bodily distress\u201d (at p. 588), and concluded they did not fall within the statutory definition of \u201c \u2018a significant or substantial physical injury\u2019 \u201d (at p. 589). Here, Sherri\u2019s injuries, while not permanent, were more than merely transitory. Her bruises lasted four months. While the injury to her eye did not cause permanent damage, it can by no means be characterized as superficial. And as the court in <em>Wolcott, supra, </em>noted: \u201cSubsequent decisions, however, indicate that injuries slightly more severe than those sustained by the victim in <em>Caudillo </em>will qualify as \u2018great bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d (Wolcott, <em>supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 107.)
