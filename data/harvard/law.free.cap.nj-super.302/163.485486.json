(Hoffinann-La Roche) appeals from a judgment of the Law Division that awarded plaintiff Quality Guaranteed Roofing, Inc. (Quality Roofing) $162,366.48 due under a contract for goods and services rendered in connection with the installation of a watertight roof and that dismissed Hoffinann-La Roche\u2019s counterclaim for damages for breach of contract and warranty, negligence, and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Briefly, Hoffmann-La Roche entered into a number of separate contracts with Quality Roofing for the installation of foam roofs upon a number of buildings located at Hoffinann-La Roche\u2019s Nutley, New Jersey facility. After the installation of several roofs, the parties contracted for additional foam roofing work to be performed on Building 71. Upon or near completion of the installation of Building 71\u2019s roof, Hoffinann-La Roche suspended all remaining work and/or payments allegedly because it had discovered quality deficiencies with Quality Roofing\u2019s workmanship. Because of Quality Roofing\u2019s alleged poor performance, Hoffmann-La Roche refused to let Quality Roofing bid on the repair work and did not demand that Quality Roofing perform any repairs. Thereafter, Quality Roofing instituted this action against Hoffinann-La Roche to recover the balance due under the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tract pertaining to Building 71. Hoffmann-La Roche counterclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">At the conclusion of a bench trial, the trial court awarded Quality Roofing damages of $162,366.48 and dismissed HoffmannLa Roche\u2019s counterclaim. The trial court held that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governed the contracts involved in this matter. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court explained \u201cthat the dominating factor in the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant was the sale of materials which were identifiable and moveable at the time of contracting.\u201d The trial court also found that Hoffmann-La Roche had accepted the roofs of the buildings which had been completed by Quality Roofing and had paid for these roofs in full. The trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Now the absolute undisputed testimony by all of the witnesses who testified in this case, both for the plaintiff and the defendant, was to the effect that when the plaintiff was barred from the premises, no notice of any kind was given to the plaintiff of the alleged defects, nor was the plaintiff given any opportunity whatsoever to cure any such defects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Therefore, according to the UCC and the statute which I\u2019ve just read [, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-607], the defendant is barred from any remedy against the plaintiff for all of the roofs that were accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Hoffmann-La Roche appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Hoffmann-La Roche seeks a reversal of the judgment and a remand for a new trial, contending that the contracts were service contracts with any sale of goods being incidental thereto and that, therefore, its contractual relationship with Quality Roofing was not governed by the UCC. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (UCC-Sales), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-101 to -725, applies to \u201ctransactions in goods.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-102. The UCC-Sales does not, however, apply to service contracts. Neither party disputes that the contracts in question were \u201ctransactions\u201d and concerned \u201cgoods.\u201d Additionally, neither party disputes that the contracts in question also concerned service or labor. Thus, the contracts are mixed goods and services contracts. <em>See Newmark v. Gimbel\u2019s Inc., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>585, 593, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>258 A.2d 697 (1969). The question, of course, is whether the UCC-Sales applies to these mixed contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Whether the UCC-Sales governs a mixed contract \u201cdepends upon how the contract may be accurately characterized \u2014 as one for the sale of goods ... plus incidental services, or as one for ... services with the [service provider] furnishing materials as well as labor.\u201d <em>Meyers v. Henderson Constr. Co., </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 79, 370 A.2d 547 (Law Div.1977). <em>See also Custom Communications Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. E.F. Johnson Co., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 537, 636 A.2d 80 (App.Div.1993). \u201cThe legal analysis most frequently employed when courts are faced with such mixed contracts is that Article 2 of the UCC is applicable \u2018if the sales aspect predominates and is inapplicable if the service aspect predominates.\u2019 \u201d <em>Custom Communications Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. E.F. Johnson Co., supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537, 636 A.2d 80 (citation omitted). <em>See also Docteroff v. Barra Corp. of Am., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 240, 659 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1995); <em>Meyers v. Henderson Constr. Co., supra, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 82, 370 A.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Whether the goods aspect or the services aspect predominate in a mixed contract is a question of fact. <em>See Conopco, Inc. v. McCreadie, </em>826 <em>F.Supp. </em>855, 868 (D.N.J.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>40 F.3d 1239 (3d Cir.1994). <em>See also Docteroff v. Barra Corp. of Am., supra, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 240, 659 A.2d 948. When error in the factfinding of a judge is alleged, the scope of appellate review is limited. The court will only decide whether the findings made could reasonably have been reached on sufficient or substantial credible evidence present in the record, considering the proof as a whole. The court gives \u201cdue regard\u201d to the ability of the factfinder to judge credibility. <em>See Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In determining the predominant nature of a mixed contract, courts have found it \u201chelpful to look at the language and circumstances surrounding the contract____the compensation structure of the contract____ [and] the interrelationship of the goods and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>services to be provided; whether one is incidental to the other as well as the intrinsic worth of the goods being provided.\u201d <em>Conopco, Inc. v. McCreadie, supra, </em>826 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 868 (citations omitted). One court has also considered whether the nonsale aspects of the contract are viewed as intending to foster the dominant purpose of the contract. <em>See Custom Communications Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. E.F. Johnson Co., supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537, 636 A.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Within the contract pertaining to Building 71, Hoffmann-La Roche is described as \u201cOwner\u201d and Quality Roofing is described as \u201cContractor.\u201d The contract itself is termed \u201cConstruction Agreement.\u201d The contract price was to be paid on a scheduled basis as the installation work progressed. While the roofing materials and the installation service were inextricably linked to one another, the purchase of the roofing material was merely incidental to the dominant purpose of the contract: the installation of the roof. The goods aspects of the contract, the roofing materials, were simply to foster the dominant purpose of the contract, to wit, the construction of a new roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The result we reach here is supported by <em>Frommert v. Bobson Constr. Co., </em>219 <em>Mich.App. </em>735, 558 N.W.2d 239, 240 (1996). There, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that a contract for the removal of an old roof and for the installation of a new polybond roofing system \u201cwas predominantly one for services, rather than one for a sale of goods____\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">In this case, it is difficult to conceive of the goods being supplied, the roofing material, as the predominant purpose of the contract. That is, plaintiff needed to have a new roof installed, and the service of removing the old roof and replacing it with the new roofing system was clearly the predominant purpose of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">Further, the contract itself is specifically identified as a \u201chome improvement and installment contract\u201d and defendant is referred to as a contractor in the contract. Defendant essentially undertook to remove and replace a leaky roof. The goods were merely incidental to the purpose of the contract. Plaintiff was not contracting to purchase roofing material only, because the goods would have been of no value unless they were installed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\"><em>[Id. </em>558 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 240-41.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">In <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Dalton, </em>665 S.W.2d 507, 510 (Tex.App.1983), the plaintiffs entered into a written contract with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the defendant to install roofing on their house with the materials to be used and labor to be performed specifically described in the contract. The Texas court wrote: \u201cThe complaint made in this case related only to the manner of installing the shingles, the installation being handled solely by a subcontractor. The essence or dominant factor of the transaction before us was the furnishing of the labor to install the roof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511. Similarly, HoffmannLa Roche\u2019s complaint is not with the roofing materials used by Quality Roofing, but rather with Quality Roofing\u2019s installation of those materials to achieve the dominant purpose of the contracts \u2014 the installation of new roofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Analyzed in light of the foregoing principles, we are convinced that there was not sufficient or substantial credible evidence present in the record as a whole to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the contracts in question were for the sale of goods. Rather, the evidence supports the conclusion that the contracts were predominately for services \u2014 the installation of roofs. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in applying the UCC-Sales to resolve this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Accordingly, the judgment under review is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial on all issues raised by the complaint and counterclaim consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. In view of our decision, we need not reach the other issue raised by Hoffmann-La Roche.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
