As a result, a \u201cco-employee\u201d of an injured worker entitled to workers\u2019 compensation is ordinarily immune from common-law or other actions by the injured worker. <em>See, e.g., Maggio v. Migliaccio, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 115-16, 628 A.2d 814 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>563, 636 A.2d 521 (1993); <em>Linden v. Solomacha, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 556 A.2d 346 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>88, 563 A.2d 847 (1989). The issue presented by this appeal is whether the injured worker and responsible co-employee must both have been working for the common employer at the time of the act or omission giving rise to plaintiffs injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Plaintiff alleges that he was seriously injured while working on a computerized saw at the plant of his employer, Acme Plastics, Inc. (Acme). He was hired by Acme following the termination of defendant Peter Cadorette. Plaintiff alleges that the accident occurred because Cadorette improperly removed a safety device from the saw before the termination of his employment with Acme.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Following disposition by trial of plaintiffs claims against the saw\u2019s manufacturer and distributor, plaintiff appeals from interlocutory orders denying his motion to strike the \u201cfellow employee\u201d defense and granting defendant Cadorette\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that since the acts of defendant Cadorette were not committed \u201cwhile\u201d he was in the same employment as plaintiff, the \u201cfellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>employee\u201d or \u201cco-employee\u201d immunity of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 does not apply. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">For purposes of plaintiffs motion we must accept his assertion that approximately a year before the accident, Cadorette, a supervisor at Acme, allegedly removed the safety tape from the computerized saw on which plaintiff was injured. Plaintiff insists that he was \u201cnot in the same employ when Mr. Cadorette wrongfully removed the saw\u2019s safety tape.\u201d Cadorette was employed by Acme from 1983 until November 1988. Plaintiff was hired in March 1989 and the accident occurred two and a-half months later on May 31, 1989. Plaintiff contends that the \u201cco-employee\u201d immunity only applies if both he and Cadorette were simultaneously employed by the common employer at the time of the \u201cact or omission\u201d giving rise to the injury..</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Plaintiff reads <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 literally and contends that the immunity applies only to \u201can act or omission occurring while such person was in the same employ as the person injured____\u201d Plaintiff presses the significance of the word \u201cwhile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">In our view, the fact that both Cadorette and plaintiff worked for a common employer at the time of their respective conduct requires the immunity to apply. Certainly the legislation was designed to provide a workers\u2019 compensation remedy and, in exchange, to protect the employer and co-employee from common-law or other liability. And there is no reason to suggest that Cadorette did not perform his acts \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment in terms of the act which allegedly caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">The second paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8, quoted above, was adopted in 1961. As a result, the employer\u2019s immunity for work related accidents was extended to the co-employee. <em>See Volb v. G.E. Capital Corp., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>110, 117, 651 A.2d 1002 (1995); <em>Boyle v. Breme, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>569, 461 A.2d 1164 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">In <em>Thornton v. Chamberlain Manufacturing Corp., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>235, 300 A.2d 146 (1973), a petitioner, whose employment was terminated nine days before, was attacked by a co-employee who petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>had supervised. The Supreme Court held the petitioner, although a former employee at the time of assault, was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because \u201c[t]he attack obviously had its genesis in the employment____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 300 A.2d 146. The \u201caccident\u201d was deemed to \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment because it would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d petitioner\u2019s job with the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 300 A.2d 146. The Court also found that the \u201caccident\u201d occurred \u201cin the course\u201d of petitioner\u2019s employment because \u201cit had its origin there in the sense that it was the end-product of a force or cause set in motion in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 300 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">While <em>Thornton </em>dealt with whether a former employee was entitled to benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7, its rational is applicable here because the workers\u2019 compensation law affords a remedy for a worker whose injuries are caused by a person whose conduct occurred \u201cin the course\u201d of his employment with the same employer. By the same token, that person must be immune from suit for such conduct. We thus conclude that the rationale of <em>Thornton </em>provides an immunity because the accident had its \u201cgenesis\u201d in the common employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The fellow workers\u2019 employment need not be simultaneous for purposes of the immunity. As Professor Larson has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">The reason for the employer\u2019s immunity is the <em>quid pro quo </em>by which the employer gives up his normal defenses and assumes automatic liability, while the employee gives up his right to common-law verdicts. This reasoning can be extended to the tortfeasor coemployee; he, too, is involved in this compromise of rights. Perhaps, so the argument runs, one of the things he is entitled to expect in return for what he has given up is freedom from common-law suits based on industrial accidents in which he is at fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">[2 Arthur Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation, </em>\u00a7 72.22 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Thus, the co-employee is immune for his conduct occurring \u201cin the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 72.23; <em>see also Konitch v. Hartung, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 195 A.2d 649 (App.Div.1963), <em>certif. denied, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>389, 197 A.2d 15 (1964); <em>Thering v. Reinkemeyer, </em>117 <em>N. J.Super. </em>176, 181, 283 A.2d 923 (Law Div.1971). That the person who ultimately was injured had not been hired when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>negligent act occurred \u201cin the course\u201d of defendant\u2019s employment does not affect the policy behind the immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> Plaintiff's wife sued <em>per quod. </em>We refer to the injured employee as plaintiff. At argument before us, plaintiff acknowledged that he does not challenge the dismissal of his complaint against Acme.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
