The tortfeasor had minimal coverage and, pursuant to Longworth<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approval, plaintiff settled his claim against the tortfeasor for the maximum amount available. The owner of the host vehicle was insured by defendant/third-party plaintiff Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual) with UIM coverage of $100,000. Third-party defendant IFA Insurance Company (IFA) insured plaintiffs personal vehicle with UIM coverage of $250,000 per person/$500,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Plaintiff filed an action against Liberty Mutual seeking to declare it the carrier primarily responsible for UIM benefits and to compel UIM arbitration. Liberty Mutual answered and filed a third-party complaint against IFA. Liberty Mutual then moved for summary judgment relying upon <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>397, 658 A.2d 1246 (1995), for the proposition that IFA, as plaintiffs personal carrier, was responsible to pay his UIM benefits. IFA cross-moved for summary judgment contending that the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision of its policy renders Liberty Mutual\u2019s UIM coverage primary and IFA\u2019s UIM coverage excess. The trial judge granted Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion holding that IFA was the primary UIM carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>IFA appeals contending that <em>American Reliance Ins. Co. v. The American Cas. Co. of Reading, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 683 A.2d 205 (App.Div.1996), and <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994), provide for the enforceability of \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clauses in insurance contracts. We reverse and hold that Liberty Mutual is primarily liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">At the outset we note, as counsel have pointed out, that there are conflicting decisions rendered by different panels of this court with respect to the same or similar issues as here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In <em>Frankel v. Motor Club of America Ins. Co., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 689 A.2d 728 (App.Div.1996), the injured plaintiff was a passenger in the insured vehicle rather than the driver of a host vehicle as here. In <em>Frankel, </em>the injured plaintiffs personal insurer was Motor Club and her policy carried UIM coverage of $50,000. The vehicle in which she was a passenger was covered by a $100,000 UIM coverage policy issued by Harleysville Insurance Company. Primary coverage was denied by each. The Law Division ruled that the injured plaintiff was entitled to resort only to the Motor Club UIM coverage which she had purchased for herself. Motor Club appealed contending that the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision of its policy mandated that Harleysville be deemed the carrier primarily responsible for UIM coverage for plaintiff and placed reliance upon our <em>pre-Aubrey </em>decision in <em>Royal Insurance Co. v. Rutgers Casualty Insurance Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In <em>Royal, </em>the injured claimants\u2019 personal insurance policy with Royal contained an \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">For any covered auto you <em>mm </em>this policy provides <em>primary insurance. </em>For any covered auto you <em>don\u2019t own, </em>the insurance provided by this policy is <em>excess </em>over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">[Id. at 415, 638 A.2d 924.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Judge Michels, writing for the court in <em>Royal, </em>upheld the effect of the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause contained in the injured claimant\u2019s personal injury policy holding that the UIM coverage pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to the non-owned vehicle in which she was driving was primary. Judge Michels wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">[W]e recognize that underinsured motorist coverage has been characterized by some courts as being \u201cpersonal to an insured\u201d, apparently because this type of insurance is acquired solely at the option of the insured and \u201cprovid[es] as much coverage as the insured is willing to purchase for his or her protection subject only to the owner\u2019s policy liability limits for personal injury and property damages to others.\u201d However, this characterization of underinsured motorist coverage cannot overcome the dear and unambiguous language of a policy and render the policy\u2019s \u201cexcess\u201d dause void and unenforceable. <em>It is fundamental that in the absence of a statutory prohibition to the contrary, an insurance company has a right to impose whatever conditions it desires prior to assuming its obligations, including providing whether its policy shall be primary to or excess over other collective insurance</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 419, 638 A.2d 924 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL5\">Notwithstanding our holding in <em>Royal, </em>the <em>Frankel </em>panel suggested that <em>Royal </em>\u201cwas overruled <em>sub silentio </em>by <em>Aubrey </em>[ ]\u201d and upheld the trial court\u2019s determination that the injured plaintiff must resort to her personal insurance policy for UIM benefits. <em>Frankel, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 254, 689 A.2d 728. Nevertheless, the panel did recognize without comment our holding in <em>American Reliance Insurance Co. v. The American Casualty Company of Reading, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 683 A.2d 205 (App.Div. 1996). <em>Frankel </em>is not controlling on the issue here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">In <em>American Reliance, </em>the injured claimant was driving a van owned by her employer at the time of the accident. A dispute arose as to which insurance carrier, claimant\u2019s personal carrier or her employer\u2019s carrier, was responsible for UIM benefits after claimant had settled for the total available liability afforded by the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. Claimant\u2019s personal policy contained an \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause. The trial judge ignored the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause and, relying upon <em>Aubrey, </em>determined that the UIM coverage of claimant\u2019s personal policy applied. On appeal, we emphasized that the contractual terms of the insurance policies must be observed and noted that the critical terms of the respective policies there involved were identical to the terms construed in <em>Royal. </em>We saw no reason in <em>Aubrey </em>requiring us to reach a different holding than that reached in <em>Royal </em>and therefore re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>versed the trial court concluding that the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause in claimant\u2019s policy rendered the policy issued to the employer responsible for UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Subsequent to our decisions in <em>Frankel </em>and <em>American Reliance, </em>we decided <em>Koniecpolski v. Worldwide Ins. Group, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 690 A.2d 1088 (App.Div.1997). There, at the time of the accident, the injured claimant was driving his ex-wife\u2019s vehicle which was covered by insurance. The ex-wife\u2019s policy had UIM coverage of $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident and did not contain the claimant\u2019s name as an additional insured or as a resident spouse. The claimant had his own insurance policy with UIM coverage of $250,000 per person/$500,000 per accident. The claimant\u2019s policy had an \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause substantially identical to the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause contained in the IFA policy insuring plaintiff in this appeal. As in this appeal, a dispute arose between the two carriers as to which was obligated to provide the claimant with UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The panel of this court considering <em>Koniecpolski </em>relied upon <em>Royal </em>and <em>American Reliance </em>and held the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause of claimant\u2019s policy rendered his UIM insurance secondary to the UIM coverage insuring the host vehicle he was driving. Speaking for this court, Judge Shebell expressed the panel\u2019s keen sensitivity to the contractual wording of the applicable policies and wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">[A] clear provision of a contract between the insurer and the insured [should not] be abrogated so long as it is not contrary to established public policy or any statutory or Constitutional provision. Therefore, we conclude that the Supreme Court did not intend its holding in <em>Aubrey </em>to void \u201cOther Insurance\u201d language that is commonly found in insurance contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\"><em>[Koniecpolski, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 279, 690 A.2d 1088 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Significantly, the panel deciding <em>Koniecpolski </em>acknowledged the <em>Frankel </em>opinion and said: \u201cFinally, we disagree with the conclusion that <em>Royal Insurance </em>has been overruled <em>sub silentio </em>by the Supreme Court in <em>Aubrey.\u201d Id. </em>at 281, 690 A.2d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Liberty Mutual now urges that we follow certain <em>dicta </em>in <em>Taylor v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593, 599, 674 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>634 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>376, 678 A.2d 716 (1996), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">We read <em>Aubrey </em>as standing for the principle that if a person is injured while fortuitously using or occupying a vehicle covered by a policy under which the person is not a named insured, <em>that person\u2019s UIM recourse is defined by Ms \u201cown\u201d policy </em>and not by the policy covering the fortuitously occupied vehicle or, indeed, any other policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Therefore, the argument is made that since plaintiff was \u201cfortuitously\u201d driving the host vehicle, he may resort only to his personal UIM coverage. We do not read <em>Taylor </em>as either dictating or suggesting the result urged by Liberty Mutual. On the contrary, it suggests the result we reach in this case. The quoted language of <em>Taylor </em>clearly indicates that the injured claimant\u2019s UIM recourse is <em>defined </em>by his \u201cown\u201d policy. Under the facts involved in this appeal and following the quoted language of <em>Taylor, </em>plaintiffs own policy <em>defines </em>UIM coverage as being governed by the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause of the policy. An \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause was not the basis of the <em>ratio decideni </em>in <em>Aubrey, </em>in <em>Taylor, </em>or in <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Prudential Property and Cas. Ins. Co., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 686 A.2d 352 (App.Div.1996), also relied upon by Liberty Mutual. The decisions in those cases did not involve the applicability of an \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause. Moreover, in <em>Taylor, </em>the driver was named as an additional insured, clearly not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u201cGenerally speaking, courts construe insurance policies consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.\u201d <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>397, 404, 658 A.2d 1246 (1995); <em>Werner Indus. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35, 548 A.2d 188 (1988). However, specific wording of an insurance policy cannot be ignored. \u201cAn exclusion clause serves the purpose of delimiting and restricting coverage. An exclusion that is specific, plain, clear, prominent, and not contrary to public policy will be given effect.\u201d <em>Doto v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544, 559, 659 A.2d 1371 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Accordingly, we believe that paramount consideration must be given to the precise contractual language of the insurance policies involved in determining the applicability of UIM coverage. An insurance policy is interpreted according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992). While a court must be cautious in its enforcement of a highly technical contract generally not subject to bargaining over its terms, such as an insurance policy, it may, nevertheless, not lightly interfere with freedom of contract especially where public policy considerations do not apply. <em>See Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 334-35, 495 A.2d 406 (1985). We do not consider the decision in <em>Aubrey </em>as establishing public policy for the guidance of lower courts in deciding UIM coverage. <em>Aubrey </em>was decided on the grounds of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Our analysis leads to the conclusion that the more cogent reasoning, which we are constrained to follow, has been expressed by our court in <em>Royal, American Reliance, </em>and <em>Koniecpolski.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Liberty Mutual is the primary UIM carrier. The judgment below is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\"> <em>Longworth v.
