They made an air tour of the country trying to pass the bills. At least 15 were passed in Washington, Secret Service men said.\u201d Appellee moved for summary judgment, or in the alternative to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the publication was a fair report of an announcement of the Secretary of the Treasury. The District Court granted summary judgment. We think this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">The privilege of fair report is no broader than the public interest which creates it. That interest is in public knowledge of official conduct. We need not decide whether the privilege might extend to a report of such an \u201cannouncement\u201d as appellee now attributes to the Secretary of the Treasury. Appellee\u2019s newspaper mentioned no authority or source for its unqualified statements that appellants \u201care charged with making and passing * * * bogus money\u201d and that \u201cThey made an air tour of the country trying to pass the bills.\u201d It mentioned only \u201cSecret Service men\u201d as authority for its statement that \u201cAt least 15 were passed in Washington.\u201d It did not mention the Secretary of the Treasury or intimate that he had made an announcement. In other words it made no report of any announcement of the Secretary. Accordingly it is not entitled to the benefit of whatever privilege, if any, might have attached to a report of such an announcement. Undisclosed similarity or coincidence between a defendant\u2019s libelous statement and a public official\u2019s previous announcement is not enough to make the statement a report of the announcement. \u201cIt is well settled that the publication of any statement by a newspaper made upon its own authority, and not purporting to be a report\u201d of official proceedings or statements \u201cis not privileged * * *. The publication constitutes a charge by the person uttering it, and he is responsible therefor.\u201d Wood v. Constitution Pub. Co., 57 Ga.App. 123, 194 S.E. 760, 765, affirmed 187 Ga. 377, 200 S.E. 131. Storey v. Wallace, 60 Ill. 51; Ilsley v. Sentinel Co., 133 Wis. 20, 28, 113 N.W. 425, 427; Lewis v.
