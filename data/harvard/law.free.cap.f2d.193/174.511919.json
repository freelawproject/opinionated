Notwithstanding his attitude, counsel represented him as best they could and, in addition, he was permitted, with their assistance, to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-23\">The only defense offered, if it was a defense, was that he really did not intend to. escape, that he had taken so many pills that he did not know exactly what he was doing. The undisputed facts, however,' including his own testimony, Show that he left the hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, and was later arrested in Colorado, and that he did: actually escape, and the only defense which \u25a0he could have to the charge, if this was. a defense, was that he had taken so many pills .gotten from the pharmacy, where he was allowed :as a trusty to be, that he did not know what he was doing. This defense, if it was a defense, was. submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-24\">While it is unfortunate that the trial had to be conducted in an atmosphere of contention between appellant and his attorneys, it is quite plain that the record presents no reason for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-25\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-26\">. 185 F.2d 137.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
