He was acquitted on one count.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">He says, first, that the acquittal on the one oount required acquittal on all. In the one 'count it was charged that he \u201cContinuously during the period from about June \u00cd6, 1950 to&gt; about June 27, 1950\u201d was concerned in the lottery. In 'four of the other counts he was charged with selling a chance in a lottery on each of four different specific dates to a specific person. We think that he might well have sold the four chances on the four dates without being \u201ccontinuously\u201d so engaged over the eleven-day period. The sixth count related to possession of numbers slips. Obviously that was not negatived by the acquittal on the \u201ccontinuously\u201d operating count.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">Appellant claims entrapment, claims lack of sufficient evidence to go to the jury, and claims that it was not proven that the numbers slips involved in the sixth count were \u201clive\u201d slips. The difficulty with all these points is that none of them is substantiated in respect to the fifth count, and, since the sentence was no1 greater than the maximum on one count, the judgment must stand. As to the incident concerned in the fifth count the officer testified, \u201cI said, \u2018Put this quarter on 299/ and he said that he would\u201d; and appellant testified, \u201cWell, the 27th he came in and handed me a quarter and told me to put it on number 299, and I put the quarter in my pocket and I went on about my work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-20\">No semblance of entrapment appears in those accounts of the incident, and the evidence was ample to go to the jury. Slips were not involved in that count, so we do not reach the question whether the slips found on appellant were \u201clive\u201d or \u201cdead\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
