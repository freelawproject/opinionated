The sole question involved in the appeal is whether the libellant is entitled to retain the award for maintenance and cure made by the District Court, We think she is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-36\">The , respondent argues that libellant should have gone to the United States Marine Hospital in Pittsburgh for treatment and that her failure to do so prevents her from securing maintenance and cure. The short answer is that she had been discharged from that hospital. The respondent also argues that there is no evidence showing libellant\u2019s need for medical care during the period covered by the award. This is squarely contradicted by the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact No. 9 which is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-37\">The judgment is affirmed, 98 F.Supp. .174.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
