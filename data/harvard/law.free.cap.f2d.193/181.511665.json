Fast and Jerome Fast, as partners doing business under the firm name of Metered Appliances Co., filed their complaint in this court under \u00a7 408(a) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 798, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 2108(a), claiming to be aggrieved by an order of the Director of Price Stabilization dismissing their protest purporting to have been filed pursuant to \u00a7 407(a) of said Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 2107(a). Respondent has moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that dismissal of the protest was proper because the protest was not against a regulation or \u201corder relating to price controls\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 407(a) of the Act, and therefore that this court has no jurisdiction under \u00a7 408 to enjoin or set aside any administrative action. We think the point is well taken and that the complaint must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Complainants are engaged in the business of installing, servicing and operating coin-metered automatic clothes washing machines, driers and extractors in apartment or tenement houses in metropolitan New York, and as such are subject to Ceiling Price Regulation 34, 16 F.R. 4446, issued May 11, 1951, by the Director of Price Stabilization pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 402 of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 2102, and to authority thereunder delegated to him by \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 402 of Executive Order 10161, 15 F.R. 6105, 50 U. S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 2071 note, and Economic Stabilization Agency General Order No. 2, 16 F.R. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In June, 1951, the district enforcement director in the New York regional office of the Director of Price Stabilization asked complainants for an explanation of certain alleged price increases, over and above their highest prices in force during the base period December 19, 1950, to January 25, 1951, inclusive. \u00a7 5 of CPR 34. Complainants replied by memorandum prepared by their attorneys setting forth the factual background, and asserting that the price increases were authorized by the terms of \u00a7 12 of CPR 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Mr. Sol A. Liebman, the district enforcement director, wrote to complainants\u2019 attorneys under date of July 2, 1951, disputing their contentions as to the application of \u00a7 12 of the regulation, and concluding with the following: \u201cUnder all the circumstances disclosed by our investigation, and by your memorandum, we do hereby request that you immediately take such steps as may be necessary to roll back the prices currently charged by your client in each of the houses in which the prices have been increased since January 25th to the highest price which existed between December 19, 1950 and January 25, 1951; that within five days from the receipt of this letter, you furnish us with a complete self-audit of all of the overcharges charged and collected by your client since January 25, 1951, and that you be good enough to arrange with your client to be present in this office relative to the above subj ect matter at 10:00 A. M., July 10, 1951.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">On August 9, 1951, complainants filed a protest against what -they termed the \u201corder\u201d of the Office of Price Stabilization contained in the above-quoted paragraph of the letter of July 2, 1951. By order issued August 24, 1951, the Director of Price Stabilization dismissed the protest, for the following stated reason:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u201cThe aforesaid letter of July 2, 1951 is not, either in its terms or by its effect, an order. The letter merely \u2018requests\u2019 Protestant to \u2018take such steps as may be necessary\u2019 to comply with the aforesaid regulations and to \u2018be good enough\u2019 to come to the office of the Enforcement Director to discuss the matter further. This is not an \u2018order\u2019 within the contemplation either of Section 407(a) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, or of Price Procedural Regulation 1, revised. It therefore cannot form the subject matter of-a protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">\u201cIn essence, the letter constitutes a notification and warning to Protestant that it has .been and is in violation of regulations of the Office of Price Stabilization. It is an act of courtesy and is not the necessary predicate of an enforcement proceeding. The proper forum for determining the question of whether Protestant has violated the regulations is a court in which the District Enforcement Director brings proceedings against Protestant for violation of the regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>lations. The jurisdiction of such court cannot be by-passed through the device of a protest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">It is clear that the letter of the district enforcement director is not and does not purport to be an order fixing, of its own force, complainants\u2019 maximum prices. It does not indeed appear that the district enforcement director has any delegated authority to issue pricing orders. The letter of July 2, 1951, is in effect no more than a statement by the enforcement officer that, as he interprets the applicable regulation, certain price increases made by complainants were illegal and that the complainants, in order to get back into compliance, will have to roll back their prices to those charged during the base period. If complainants prove to be correct in their interpretation of the regulation, their refusal to roll back prices as requested by the enforcement officer will not involve them in any liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Of course, if complainants do not acquiesce in the enforcement officer\u2019s interpretation of the regulation, they may subsequently find themselves faced with enforcement proceedings under \u00a7 409 of the Act. But complainants are quite wrong in supposing that in such event the enforcement court would be bound to assume the correctness and validity of the enforcement director\u2019s interpretation of the regulation. The enforcement court would have to make its own independent determination of a question of law, as to whether \u00a7 12 of the regulation, properly interpreted, authorized the price increases in question, for it is the function of the enforcement court to determine all questions of fact and law bearing on whether the regulation, as written, has been violated. There would remain open the possibility that complainants might obtain from the enforcement court, pursuant to \u00a7 408(e)(1) of the Defense Production Act, leave to file a complaint directly in the Emergency Court of Appeals seeking a determination of the validity of the regulation as interpreted by the enforcement court. ' See Collins v. Bowles, Em.App.1946, 152 F.2d 760, 761-762; Conklin Pen Co. v. Bowles, Em.App.1946, 152 F.2d 764, 765-766; Van der Loo v. Porter, Em.App.1946, 160 F.2d 110, 112-cases dealing with the corresponding provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This court, and the Supreme Court upon review of our judgments on certiorari, as provided in \u00a7 408(d) of the Defense Production Act, \u201chave exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any regulation or order relating to price controls\u201d under Title IV of the Act. We have no jurisdiction as such to give declaratory judgments interpreting <em>a </em>price regulation. Only as incidental to the exercise of our jurisdiction to determine the validity of a regulation or. order relating to price controls do we have any occasion to interpret the meaning of a regulation or to determine whether it is applicable to a particular person or class of persons. The same was true of our function under the closely corresponding provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">One instance where this court may have to determine the interpretation of a regulation is the following: A general price regulation may lay down a formula by which individual pricing orders are to be issued by some subordinate official of the Office of Price Stabilization to whom such authority is delegated. In such a case, if the subordinate official issues an individual pricing order which itself purports to determine a maximum price, this court would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of such individual pricing order. The jurisdiction of this court might be invoked either by the protest route under \u00a7\u00a7 407(a) and 408(a) of the Defense Production Act, or, in case enforcement proceedings have been instituted, by a complaint filed with leave of the enforcement court granted under \u00a7 408(e)(1). The enforcement court would not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the pricing order, but would have to assume its validity, in the absence of a determination by the Emergency Court of Appeals that the order was invalid. We, of course, in order to determine such validity, might have to interpret the underlying price regulation to see whether the pricing order was in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>formity with the regulation; if it was not, then the pricing order would be set aside by us as not in accordance with law. See City Ice Delivery Co. v. Bowles, Em.App.1945, 150 F.2d 120; New Orleans Laundries, Inc. v. Porter, Em.App.1946, 157 F.2d 1013; Senderowitz v. Clark, Em.App.1947, 162 F.2d 912; Schwalb v. Turney, Em.App. 1948, 170 F.2d 76. But as we have already pointed out, the letter of the district enforcement director dated July 2, 1951, is not such an order establishing an individual maximum price.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">This court also had occasion to pass incidentally upon questions of interpretation in another type of case which came before us under the Emergency Price Control Act and which presumably might be presented to us under the Defense Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 2061 et seq.; that is, where the administrative agency, upon one interpretation of a price regulation, claimed that a person had committed violations of it and threatened enforcement proceedings, whereas the seller claimed that under another interpretation, which he thought was the proper one, either the regulation was inapplicable to him or he was in conformity with it. We held that the seller in such a case was entitled by way of the protest procedure to attack the validity of the regulation as interpreted by the Administrator. In order for us to reach the question of validity, we had first to determine which of the conflicting interpretations was the correct one. If we found that the regulation meant what the administrative agency claimed it to mean, we would then proceed to determine its validity as so construed. If we found that it meant what complainant urged, we would then dismiss the complaint, for complainant was making no attack on the validity of the regulation as so construed. See Marlene Linens v. Bowles, Em.App.1944, 144 F.2d 874; Alan Levin Foundation v. Bowles, Em.App.1945, 152 F.2d 467, 470; Conklin Pen Co. v. Bowles, Em.App.1946, 152 F.2d 764, 765-766. Our interpretation of the regulation in such a case, whichever way we found, would presumably be res judicata as between the government and the seller, be-cause such determination was a necessary preliminary to our judgment disposing of the complaint. See Collins v. Porter, 1946, 328 U.S. 46, 66 S.Ct. 893, 90 L.Ed. 1075; Fleet-Wing Corp. v. Clark, Em.App.1948, 166 F.2d 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In their answer to respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, complainants have sought to bring themselves within the line of cases just cited by asserting that they protested, or intended to protest, not only against the alleged order contained in the district enforcement director\u2019s letter of July 2, 1951, but also against the validity of \u00a7 12 of CPR 34, on the ground that the regulation, if it means what the district enforcement director has interpreted it to mean, is invalid as failing to conform with the requirements of \u00a7 402(d)(1) of the Defense Production Act. But inspection of the protest reveals that complainants\u2019 protest was directed solely to the letter of July 2, 1951, and contained not even the hint of a challenge to the validity of any provision of CPR 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 408(a) of the Defense Production Act is explicitly limited to a determination of the validity of the particular regulation or order relating to price controls against which the protest was directed; and further, we may consider no objection to a protested regulation or order \u201cunless such objection shall have been set forth by the complainant in the protest\u201d. This does not necessarily mean that the objection must be contained in the document called the \u201cprotest\u201d, if the objection was advanced in the course of the protest proceeding and was actually considered and disposed of on the merits by the administrative agency. In such a case, upon a complaint subsequently filed under \u00a7 408(a), we would proceed to consider the objection on the merits, treating it as if the administrative agency had allowed an informal amendment of the protest. But substantial compliance with the statutory provision is mandatory and jurisdictional. See Bowman v. Bowles, Em.App.1944, 140 F.2d 974, 977, discussing the rationale of the corresponding provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act prescribing the protest procedure as preliminary to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In the present case no objection as to the validity of any provision of CPR 34 was raised in the protest proceedings; the protest was not directed against any \u201corder\u201d to which complainants were \u201csubject\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 407(a) of the Act and \u00a7 31 of Price Procedural Regulation 1, Revised, 16 F.R. 4974; and the protest was properly dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 32 of said Procedural Regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">A judgment will be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
