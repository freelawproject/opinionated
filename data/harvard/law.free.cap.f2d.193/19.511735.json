The testator actually had relatives. But in the light of all the testimony we are not prepared to say the court erred in deciding that a jury would not be justified in finding the testator incompetent. The court might well think it clear that he knew of the existence of his relatives and merely adopted a picturesque way of saying that he preferred to ignore them. In our opinion there is no merit in appellant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
