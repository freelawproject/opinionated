Mugavero, 9 Cir., 188 F.2d 601, which was an appeal by the United States from the denial of its motion to dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus made by one of Oddo\u2019s co-defendants. In that case, Mugavero raised the same issues as to counts 3-8 of his indictment as are raised here by Oddo as to counts 2-8 of his indictment. The conviction under the indictment now before us and the total sentence of 15 years should be sustained for the reasons stated by the court in the Mugavero case. Consequently, it is unnecessary to decide the effect of a prior denial of a motion to vacate the sentence made by Oddo on the same grounds as in this habeas corpus petition. That denial was affirmed by the Second Circuit in Oddo v. United States, 171 F.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">Deciding then that a total sentence of 15 years is proper, Oddo\u2019s petition is premature, even though he were allowed all possible good time credit, since 'he did not begin his sentence until July 23, 1944. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161. Therefore, we do not reach the question whether the trial judge properly refused to review the revocation of good time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
