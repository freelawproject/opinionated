On the basis of a claim that those appellees required the property for their personal use, they got a judgment of eviction against him in the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court of Appeals affirmed. DeBobula v. Coppedge, 40 A.2d 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Appellant afterwards filed in the District Court the present suit against the appellees. His complaint does not appear to assert the claim we are about to discuss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the parties agreed at pretrial and trial to proceed on the theory that appellant\u2019s only claim against the present appellees is this: they conspired to evict him wrongfully by adducing false testimony, in the suit in the Municipal Court, that those appellees who owned the property required it for their personal use. The District Court dismissed the present suit on the ground that it was barred by the Municipal Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">We think the District Court was right. The suit in the Municipal Court settled the question whether the owners of the property required it for their personal use. The appellant cannot, by alleging fraud, reopen that question in the District Court. \u201cA judgment obtained by fraud or duress must be attacked in a direct proceeding, and not collaterally.\u201d Nelson v. Felsing, 32 App.D.C. 420, 428.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Judge Clagett said for the Municipal Court of Appeals in a similar case, the appellant is making a collateral attack on the judgment in the former suit, \u201cand such collateral attacks are not permitted even on the ground of fraud, where the alleged fraud is a fraud which was in issue in that suit. Here, construing the complaint most favorably to appellant, the fraud suggested is that appellee misrepresented his purpose in desiring possession of the premises and thus acted in bad faith. That issue was decided -in the prior suit and the decision may not be attacked collaterally.\u201d Simpkins <em>v. </em>Brooks, D.C.Mun.App., 49 A.2d 549, 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-20\">In our opinion the judgment of the Municipal Court concludes the appellant not only as against his landlords but also as against the other appellees. A conspiracy creates no civil liability unless it causes injury. A cause of action \u201c \u2018is not created by the conspiracy, but by the wrongful acts done by the defendants to the injury of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d Ewald v. Lane, 70 App.D.C. 89, 90, 104 F.2d 222, 223. The liability, if any, of all the appellees is therefore predicated upon the landlords\u2019 testimony in the eviction suit being false. But that suit determined that this testimony was true. Though the other appellees were not parties to that suit, \u201cit is quite generally held that [this objection does] not prevent an estoppel where, as here, the one exonerated was the immediate actor and his personal culpability is necessarily the predicate of the plaintiff\u2019s right of action against the other[s].\u201d Van Devanter, Circuit Judge, in Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Stratton\u2019J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Independence, 8 Cir., 158 F. 63, 65-66, 16 L.R.A.,N.S., 677; Adriaanse v.

The Municipal Court of Appeals affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s judgment in 1944. In 1950 the Municipal Court amended its Rule 53(b) so as to provide that \u201cOn mo- . tion, and upon such terms as \u00e1re just, the Court may relieve a party or bis legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for * * * fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic) * * *.
