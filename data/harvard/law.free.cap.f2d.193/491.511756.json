S. Patent No. 2,271,290 for a \u201cTool\u201d, granted January 27, 1942, which patent is now owned by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-25\">The opinion of the district court holding said patent \u201cinvalid for lack of invention\u201d appears in 96 F.Supp. 502, 505, where the case is more fully set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-26\">Briefly stated, the Echikson patent relates to the handle construction of a putty knife or wall scraper where there is a blade having a shank or tang and a handle is associated with the shank. The handle is made of two shell-like members. The shells here are made of a plastic material and may be formed to have flanges. The shells are arranged to be fitted complement-ally over the shank or tang of the tool so that the marginal edges of the shank are no longer exposed and posts or ribs serve to hold it in a relatively rigid or clamped position when the shells are secured by rivets or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-27\">The district court held that there is no invention \u201cin merely mounting or covering parts that might be exposed\u201d, or in molding plastic \u201cto the desired shape\u201d or \u201cin making the handle in two separate parts and riveting them together one on each side of the tang.\u201d It also pointed out that the prior art showed the \u201cuse of such ribs was already known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-28\">The findings of the district court \u201cshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d. Rule 52, Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A. B. F. Sturtevant Co. v. Massachusetts Hair &amp; Felt Co., 1 Cir., 122 F.2d 900; Green v. Electric Vacuum Cleaner Co., 6 Cir., 132 F.2d 312, certiorari granted 318 U.S. 753, 63 S.Ct. 858, 87 L.Ed. 1128, dismissed 319 U.S. 777, 63 S.Ct. 1163, 87 L.Ed. 1723. We cannot say on the record here that the findings of fact are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-29\">We do not believe that the Echikson- patent meets the test laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Great At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>lantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 130, 95 L.Ed. 162, where the court said: \" * * * The function of a \u00a1patent is to add to the sum of useful knowledge. * <em>* </em>*\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
