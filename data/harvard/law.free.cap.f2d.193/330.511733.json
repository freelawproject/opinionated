The plan was before the District Judge on two occasions. After the first hearing the matter was returned to the Referee for 'further testimony. D.C., 95 F.Supp. 723. Following the second hearing the Court below confirmed and approved the plan. Our independent scrutiny of the record leads us to the conclusion that the Referee\u2019s findings of fact, at the very least are not clearly erroneous and that the District Court\u2019s affirmance of those findings was not such' a plain mistake as would result in the defeat of justice. The judgment of the District Court will therefore be affirmed. In re Wolf, 3 Cir., 165 F.2d 707.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
