He was given no reason for these denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">The District Court rightly dismissed the petition. <em>\u201cA </em>prisoner is released on parole by the United States Board of Parole wholly as a matter of discretion when it is made to appear to said Board, from a report by the proper officers of any United States prison, or upon application by a prisoner for release on parole, \u2018that there is a reasonable probability that such applicant will live and remain at liberty without violating the laws, and if [when] in the opinion of the board such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society * * *.\u2019 \u201d Story v.
