The court held the Viking Co. had made no such contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-27\">The Assurance Co. 'had issued a comprehensive liability policy to the Austin Co., inter alia, insuring it against its own negligence. The Austin Co. was a prime contractor on the construction of buildings at Mills Field Airport and employed as subcontractor the appellee, the Viking Co., for installation of a sprinkler system in- these buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-28\">Two employees of the Viking Co. were injured through the sole negligence of the Austin Co. The Assurance Co. eventually paid the Austin Co. $19,458.24 under its policy in satisfaction of the claims of these workmen against Austin Co. and sues as its subrogee.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-29\">The relevant clause of the contract of Austin Co. with the Viking Co. provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201c7. Insurance. \u2014 It is understood and agreed that vendor [Viking Co.] is fully covered with Public Liability, Workmen\u2019s Compensation and Property Damage Insurance and agrees to protect and indemnify the Buyer [Austin Co.] against <em>all claims </em>for damages, lawsuits, etc., which may arise due to difficulties encountered while vendor is servicing this operation.\u201d (\u25a0Emphasis and bracketed matter supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The construction of the contract is controlled by the California law. The district court held that under that law the words \u201call claims\u201d presented an ambiguity as to its coverage of Austin\u2019s sole negligence, which may be resolved by evidence of the actual intent of the parties. We agree with the district court\u2019s holding. Southern Pacific Co. v. Fellows, 22 Cal.App.2d 87, 71 P.2d 75; Pacific Indemnity Co. v. California Electric Works, 29 Cal.App.2d 260, 84 P.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">At the trial below, the Assurance Co. offered to prove that after the contract was made Viking Co. had bought an insurance policy which had a contract rider covering Austin\u2019s sole negligence, arguing that this indicated Viking\u2019s intent that this was included in the words \u201call claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Upon objection, the trial judge excluded this evidence as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d because, he stated, persons 'frequently insure a wider area of coverage without reference to any contract liability. He further stated that this evidence of intent is offset by Austin\u2019s coverage of such liability, by its own insurance against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The burden of proof is on the Assurance Co. and the court held that it had not been sustained. The Assurance Co. contends that the district court erred in excluding the evidence of Viking\u2019s insurance on the ground of its immateriality. However, assuming that the Viking Co.\u2019s insurance of itself against claims from Austin\u2019s sole negligence were before the court, it is equally offset by Austin\u2019s insurance against the same liability and the finding of failure to sustain the burden of proof is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The finding is further supported by the evidence of the nature of the contract between the Austin Co. and Viking Co. This was on a cost plus basis, 10% being added for overhead and 8% profit. With Austin Co. having such insurance it would be most unlikely to intend to contract with the Viking Co. that the latter should pay for the same insurance and charge it back to Austin plus the 10% and 8% fees of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
