Field contends, and we agree, that any relinquishment by him of his Fifth Amendment (anti-self-incrimination) privilege in the proceedings in United States v. Field, Hammett, and Hunton, 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 92, decided today, did not constitute a relinquishment of that privilege in these separate grand jury proceedings. But, although at first he did, before the grand jury, refuse, on the basis of that privilege, to answer any questions bearing on his connection with the Bail Fund, subsequently he did tell the grand jury that, as one of the trustees of the Fund, he had actively participated in the retention of counsel by the Fund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With that admission, he was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>longer in a position to argue that the act of producing the Fund\u2019s papers might in itself involve self-incrimination. As an admitted trustee, he, together with the other trustees, held these papers merely in a \u201crepresentative capacity\u201d and could not interpose the \u201cpersonal privilege against self-incrimination, even though production of the papers might tend to incriminate * * * personally.\u201d Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367, 372, 71 S.Ct. 438, 441, 95 L.Ed. 344.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was obliged both (a) to produce the records and (b) to answer questions \u201cauxiliary\u201d to their production.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">2. All other questions he was asked before the grand jury were of the kind the answers to which this court today held not privileged in the companion case of United States v. Field, Hammett and Hunton, 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 92<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">3. Field, on this appeal, seems to assert, on behalf and as trustee of the Bail Fund, that the direction to produce all its books and records was so sweeping that it constituted a violation of the Fund\u2019s privilege, under the Fourth Amendment, to be free of any unreasonable searches and seizures. We doubt whether the Fund\u2019s privilege (as distinguished from Field\u2019s personal privilege) was urged on its behalf by Field as trustee (or by anyone else) before the grand jury or the district judge; if not so urged, we cannot consider that alleged privilege on this appeal. But we pass that point. For, having in mind the nature of the inquiry, we think the direction was not so unreasonably broad as to invade the Fund\u2019s Fourth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\">. \u201cQ. Mr. Field, who is the attorney for the bail fund? A. Mrs. Kaufman, Mrs. Mary Kaufman.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u201cQ. How long has she been the attorney for the bail fund? A. She\u2019s been the attorney since the beginning of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\u201cQ. You mean since the proceedings relating to the fugitive status of these four defendants? A. I think\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">\u201cQ. I\u2019ll change\u2014 A. I think it\u2019s perhaps a little earlier than that, Mr. Saypol.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">I\u2019ll h\u00e1ve to look that up.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">\u201cQ. Is there a written agreement of retainer? A. No, I don\u2019t believe there is.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">\u201cQ. At whose suggestion was she re- . tained? What were the circumstances for retaining her? A. I believe Mrs. Kaufman was brought in as a result of a discussion among the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">\u201cQ. WTiich trustees? A. Well, this \u2014 I was trying to think back. Certainly Mr. Green and I participated. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AHK\">\u201cQ. Coming, back to Mrs. Kaufman now, was there an extended conference that consumed about two hours and attended by several persons recently, in which she gave advice regarding the bail fund? A. I\u2019m not quite clear on the question. I mean, conference when, Mr. Saypol?</p>\n<p id=\"A8Z\">\"Q. Let\u2019s put it this way: Do you remember the first day that you conferred with \u2014 the first day that you discussed with anybody the question of retaining her? A. No, I don\u2019t think I do, very clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"AXr\">\u201cQ. Was that at about the time that the most recent crop' of defendants were brought before Judge Kaufman on the question of their bail? A. Let me an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>swer as accurately as I can remember. As I recall, I believe she was brought in\u2014 we brought her in at the time that your office questioned again the validity of the bail which the trustees were endeavoring to post. I\u2019m not perfectly certain that this is correct, but that\u2019s the best recollection that I have at the moment.</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u201cQ. Was there ever a time that Green talked to you about retaining her or you talked to him about retaining her? A. Well, I said, before, Mr. Saypol, that I think my recollection is, well, it must have been so; that the trustees, the available trustees, discussed this question.</p>\n<p id=\"AML\">\u201cQ. And thereafter was there a conference attended by other lawyers together with Mrs. Kaufman? A. In the course of this period we have consulted, yes, with a number of lawyers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\">. Field contends that he was never directed to produce the books. We cannot agree. On July 23, 1951, the grand jury so directed. On July 25, 1951, during the hearing before the district judge, Field\u2019s counsel asked the judge for \u201cclarification\u201d as follows: \"I understand that your Honor\u2019s direction relates specifically to the matter of the production of the books and the questions relating to the bail fund. * * * Your finding is directed primarily to the books and records?\u201d The judge replied: \u201cAnd to other matters concerning the bail fund.\u201d It is immaterial that, on July 24, the district attorney had mistakenly advised the judge that the grand jury had not ordered the production of any records.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac0\">On the morning \u2018of July 30, Field said before the grand jury that he would \u201chave to stand by my previous position and decline to produce them [the books and records] on the grounds that to do so might tend to incriminate me,\u201d and that, on those grounds, he would not \u201cmake any effort to produce the books and records.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Acb\">.
