Count one charged the substantive offense of selling one pound of opium in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 173 and 174. Count two charged a conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, to sell opium in violation of sections 2553(a) and 2554(a) of Title 26 as well as the above mentioned sections of Title 21. The appellant was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, the terms to run concurrently, and to a fine of $500 on count one. The appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, and asserts errors in the conduct of the trial and in the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">The indictment named two defendants, the appellant and Gong Len Ying. The latter pleaded guilty and testified for the government at the trial of the appellant. He testified that on January 22, 1950 he agreed to deliver to Benny Gim, an undercover agent of the Bureau of Narcotics, one pound of opium for $550; that Gim gave him the money which he turned over to the appellant, except $70 retained as his share, and that the appellant then got the opium and delivered it to him and he delivered it to Gim. The appellant took the stand in his own defense and denied having had anything to do with, or any knowledge of, the transaction. He admitted having been with Ying on the evening of January 22nd but said their meeting and conversation related only to the purchase of a laundry to whose owner Ying proposed to introduce him. Which story to believe was plainly for the jury. The appellant argues that .even accepting Ying\u2019s testimony in full, it proved merely a sale by appellant to Ying (not the crime charged) and a sale by Ying on his own account to Gim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But this interpretation of the transaction was foreclosed by the testimony of Agent Lee, if credited by the jury. Agent Lee testified that he heard the appellant admit in conversation with Chin Poy, a government informer, that the opium sold to Gim belonged to a syndicate of which the appellant was a representative and that he had employed Ying to make the sale. Without detailing more of the testimony, we think it obvious that the evidence as to both counts required submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">It is urged that error was committed in admitting Agent Lee\u2019s testimony concerning the above mentioned conversation between Chin Poy and the appellant. This conversation took place in appellant\u2019s laundry several weeks after his arrest and while he was enlarged on bail. Chin Poy carried a concealed radio transmitter and Agent Lee, who was outside the laundry, overheard the conversation by means of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>radio receiving device tuned to 'Chin Poy\u2019s transmitter. The testimony was received over the appellant\u2019s objection and it is now contended that disclosure of the overheard conversation is forbidden by the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 605.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contention is not sustainable. As the Supreme Court said in Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 133, 62 S.Ct. 993, 995, 86 L.Ed. 1322: \u201cThe protection intended and afforded by the statute is of the means of communication and not of the secrecy of the conversation.\u201d There was no \u201cinterception\u201d of a communication by wire or radio which is what the statute forbids. The radio device was merely a mechanical means of eavesdropping, just as the detectaphone was in the Goldman case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">As a second string to his bow the appellant contends that even if the use of the radio transmitter by Chin Poy and Agent Lee did not violate section 605, the evidence was inadmissible because it was obtained by a trespass and constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"> In Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647, a federal employee entered the office of one suspected of crime under the pretext of paying a friendly visit and while there surreptitiously extracted certain papers. This was held to be an unreasonable search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and the admission of the papers in evidence was held a violation of the Fifth Amendment. In commenting upon the Gouled case in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 463-464, 48 S.Ct. 564, 567, 72 L.Ed. 944, Chief Justice Taft remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\u201cGouled v. United States carried the inhibition against unreasonable searches and seizures to the extreme limit. Its authority is not to be enlarged by implication, and must be confined to the precise state of facts disclosed by the record * * * There was actual entrance into the private quarters of defendant and the taking away of something tangible. Here we have testimony only of voluntary conversations secretly overheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">\u201cThe amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material things \u2014 the personj the house, his papers, or his effects. The description of the warrant necessary to make the proceeding lawful is that it must specify the place to be searched and the person or <em>things </em>to be seized.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">In the last decade the Supreme Court has \u25a0expanded the protection of the private citizen against unreasonable interference with his home, his person or his effects, but none of these decisions has directly questioned Chief Justice Taft\u2019s analysis. <em>Dicta, </em>however, in Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 134, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322, indicate that where officers,- by a trespass, en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tered the accused\u2019s office, attached a listening device to his phone and used it successfully, evidence so obtained might be inadmissible because obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. One Court of Appeals has expressly gone beyond, the holding of the Olmstead case. In Nueslein v. District of Columbia, 73 App.D.C. 85, 115 F.2d 690, police officers entered a suspect\u2019s home while conducting an investigation of an automobile accident. When the homeowner appeared he admitted driving the car in question. The police were convinced by his appearance that he was intoxicated and they arrested him on a charge of drunken driving. Because the testimony of the police officers was admitted, the conviction of the accused was reversed. The opinion states, 115 F.2d at page 692: \u201cThe crucial thing \u2018found\u2019 in this \u2018search\u2019 was a declaration of fact by the defendant that has become decidedly incriminating.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But we are not disposed to follow the extension' adopted by the court in the Nueslein case in. view of the clear statement in the Olmstead case that only the taking of tangible things violates the Fourth Amendment. And this is especially so when we are confronted with the facts in the case at bar. If Agent Lee\u2019s testimony is to be excluded it would logically follow, in our opinion, that Chin Poy himself would not be allowed to testify as to the appellant\u2019s admissions. No case has been cited to us, and our own researches have found none, which would exclude, because of the Fourth Amendment, testimony of a government agent merely because he concealed from the suspect, when calling at his place of business, that he was such an agent and intended if possible to extract damaging statements from the suspect. Nor do we think that the Gouled case can be cited for the proposition that entry by a government agent under such circumstances invariably constitutes a trespass which would render evidence thereby obtained inadmissible. The crucial fact in the Gouled case, as Chief Justice Taft pointed out, was that there was both an entry by subterfuge and a taking of a tangible thing. It will be noted that in the Goldman and Nueslein cases which indicate that the taking of an intangible thing may violate the Fourth Amendment, there was no entry by subterfuge. We do not think the Fourth Amendment stretches so far as to prevent the admission of statements heard by a federal employee in the accused\u2019s home or place of business whose only \u201ctrespass\u201d is the fact that he conceals his true identity to gain information. It has long been customary for law enforcement agencies to obtain admissible evidence by this method of subterfuge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and until otherwise instructed by the Supreme Court, we shall not interpret the Amendment to require the exclusion of statements so obtained.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">In the conversation overheard by Agent Lee on March 30, 1950 the appellant told Chin Poy that the syndicate of which the appellant was the representative could supply opium in the future. The court at once told the jury to disregard this evidence. Shortly thereafter the testimony was repeated and counsel then moved for a mistrial. Apparently the court never ruled directly on this motion and counsel did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>press for a ruling. The prosecutor claims that the testimony was competent because the conspiracy was charged as continuing down, to the date of the filing of the indictment, April 26, 1950; hence the statement made to Chin Boy, although made after the appellant\u2019s arrest, was made during the period covered by the indictment and was evidence of the crime charged. Whether .this theory would justify admission of the testimony we need not say. Even assuming the evidence was incompetent, we think the court\u2019s instruction to disregard it cured the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">It is strenuously argued that prejudicial error was committed by admitting into evidence testimony that the appellant remained silent when an accusatory statement was made by Ying in the appellant\u2019s presence after their arrest. Detective Monahan testified that he first asked the appellant if he had sold the opium or delivered it to Ying and the appellant denied that he had anything to do with it. The detective then asked Ying where he got the opium and Ying replied he got it from the appel-. lant in the hallway of 79 Mott Street on the afternoon of January 22nd; the appellant said nothing. His counsel requested the judge to inform the jury that they should disregard the detective\u2019s conversation with Ying. No immediate ruling was made upon this request but a lengthy colloquy was had by court and counsel in the presence of the jury as to whether the appellant\u2019s silence could be considered against him as a tacit admission. The court reserved decision and asked counsel to submit authorities. Further discussion between court and counsel occurred later in the trial and at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s case counsel for the appellant moved for a mistrial because of th\u00e9 admission of the evidence and the court\u2019s comments as to the inference to be drawn from the appellant\u2019s silence when the accusatory statement was made. This motion was formally denied. But in charging the jury the court stated that no admission by Ying after his arrest could bind the appellant. After stating the general rule as to silence in the face of an accusatory statement, he said that the appellant having denied the charge once did not have to deny it again. \u201cHe has denied it once and that would be sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">In the light of this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Lo Biondo, 2 Cir., 135 F.2d 130, 131, the admission of .evidence as to appellant\u2019s silence when faced with Ying\u2019s accusation was erroneous, but in that-case the jury was told that the accused\u2019s silence was a \u201ccircumstance which they may consider.\u201d In the case at bar the jury was told emphatically that having already denied that he gave the,opium to Ying he was not obliged to deny it again when Ying made the charge in his presence. We think this cured any prejudice which might have resulted from the original admission of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Colloquies as to rules of evidence are not ordinarily regarded by juries as of much concern to them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Any unfavorable impression tire jury may have received from the court\u2019s remarks during the colloquies, we regard as swept away by the charge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The jury system is premised on the assumption that when the judge instructs the jury what evidence it may consider it will obey the instruction. In exceptional circumstances the -prejudice from improperly admitted evidence may be too serious.to be cured by a charge to disregard it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But we do not regard the present as such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Error is asserted in the court\u2019s refusal to give 16 of the defendant\u2019s 37 requests to charge. The appellant\u2019s main brief merely enumerates the 16 requests but does not point out wherein the charge as given was defective in respect to matters covered by the refused requests. This is not an adequate way to present an attack upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>charge. We have, however, examined the 16 enumerated requests and compared them with the charge as given. It will suffice to say that we perceive no substantial error in refusal of the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\">. Cf. United States v.

Appellant cites the dicta of the Supreme Court and this court in the Goldman case to support his position. In the Goldman case agents had entered the defendant\u2019s office and installed a listening device near his telephone. This device failed to work, however.

Sixty-five years ago, the case of a humble Chinese laundryman led to a decision involving the formulation of one of the most important constitutional principles.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Today On Lee\u2019s case, as I see it, presents the violation of one of the most cherished constitutional rights, one which contributes substantially to the distinctive flavor of our democracy. This appears from the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Chin Poy, a paid informer of the Narcotic Bureau, and himself a former drug addict, paid two \u201cfriendly\u201d visits to On Lee\u2019s four-room combined laundry and dwelling. During these visits, the two men were alone most of the time. Unknown to On Lee, Chin Poy carried, concealed inside his pocket, a 3-inch microphone which picked up everything the two men said, and transmitted it to a receiving set manned by a narcotic agent, three or four doors down the block. This government agent, almost a year later, testified at the trial to what he had thus heard. The two visits, made for the sole purpose of gathering evidence against On Lee to be used in that trial, took place after On Lee\u2019s arrest while he was at large on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">On Lee was convicted primarily on that agent\u2019s testimony. The informer, Chin Poy, did not testify. But the agent testified that, by means of the concealed radio, he heard On Lee admit in one of the conversations that ne had conspired with one Ying to sell opium, that On Lee represented a narcotics syndicate in the sale, and that he would make a future illegal sale to Chin Poy. Aside from this indirect testimony<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the conversation, the only evidence tying On Lee to the offenses was the testimony of Ying, the alleged co-conspirator, who turned \u201cstates evidence\u201d at the trial. Government agents testified to various meetings between On Lee and Ying, but the agent with whom Ying negotiated the only illegal sale proved at the trial, had never heard On Lee\u2019s name mentioned; and no opium was found on On Lee or among his belongings. He consistently denied, after arrest and on the witness-stand, any connection with dope-peddling. His frequent meetings with Ying, On Lee explained by saying that he was discussing the possible purchase of a wet-wash laundry 'from a business friend of Ying\u2019s \u2014 a not implausible story. Except for the agent\u2019s testimony about On Lee\u2019s incriminating conversation with Chin Poy, the jury might well have believed On Lee and acquitted him. In the circumstances, then, a court must look critically at the damaging testimony of the narcotic agent to see if it warrants the conviction, for that testimony is the guts of the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The agent who, at a distance, heard the conversation by means of the hidden microphone (a method seemingly fantastic and smacking rather of lurid gangster movies or the comic strips than of American realities) was engaged, I think, in a search violative of the Fourth Amendment. My colleagues, in rejecting this conclusion, make two arguments. The first runs thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">As nothing tangible was taken by any federal officer, no \u201cseizure\u201d occurred; therefore, even if there was an illegal entry on On Lee\u2019s premises, the Fourth Amendment was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">That argument means this: A federal officer, without a warrant, unlawfully breaks into a man\u2019s house. While there he overhears the house-owner utter a voluntary statement of his own criminal conduct. The officer, according to my colleagues, has not violated the Fourth Amendment since he has seized nothing, for an oral statement is an intangible, i.e., as one cannot grasp sounds, one cannot seize them. Therefore, at the trial of the house-owner, the officer, over the defendant\u2019s objection, must be allowed to testify as to that oral statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">But Chief Justice Vinson, when a circuit judge, speaking for the Court of Appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>decided precisely to the contrary in Nueslein v. District of Columbia, 73 App.D.C. 85, 115 F.2d 690, 692. There officers, entering unlawfully, overheard an incriminating oral statement. \u201cThe crucial thing \u2018found\u2019 in this \u2018search\u2019 \u201d said the court, \u201cwas a declaration of fact by the defendant that has become decidedly incriminating. * * * The IVth and Vth Amendments relate to different issues, but cases can present facts which make the considerations behind these Amendments overlap. The \u00a1officers violated the security of the defendant under the IVth by unlawfully coming into his home and by placing him in custody. * * * But how did the officers find themselves in position to pee and hear the defendant? The officers, in the pursuance of a general investigation, entered the home under no color of right.\u201d And so the court ruled that the \u201cofficers\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s declaration is inadmissible\u201d, adding that, although \u201c * * * the IVth Amendment was written against the background of the general warrants in England and the writs of assistance in the American colonies,\u201d the Amendment \u201cgives a protection wider than these abuses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">My colleagues criticize the Nueslein ruling as inconsistent with a statement, in the nature of <em>dictum, in </em>Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 568, 72 L.Ed. 944. There the Court held that wiretapping did not violate the Amendment, basing its decision in large part on the fact that interception of the phone message involved no entry. The Court said: \u201cThere was no entry \u00a1of the houses or offices of the defendants.\u201d This fact the Court noted five times. In passing, the Court also said, \u201cThere was no seizure. The evidence was secured by the use of the sense of \u00a1hearing and that only.\u201d Citing Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647, the Court said that in that case there was \u201cactual entrance into the private quarters of defendant and the taking away of something tangible. Here we have testimony only of voluntary conversations secretly overheard. The amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material' things \u2014 the person, the house, his papers, or his effects. The description of the warrant necessary to make the proceeding lawful is-that it must specify the place to be searched and the person or <em>things </em>to be seized.\u201d Since-the Court found no entry, those remarks, were, in every respect, superfluous. Doubtless for that reason, Vinson, J., twelve years' later, disregarded those remarks when he-wrote Nueslein. Nueslein has been cited1 by the Supreme Court in Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 153, 67 S.Ct. 1098,1102, 91 L.Ed. 1399, as a \u201ccase in which law enforcement officials have invaded a private dwelling without authority and <em>seized evidence of </em>crime.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">And the Nueslein doctrine finds support in an earlier and a later decision: Both Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319, and Zap v. United States, 328 U.S. 624, 66 S.Ct. 1277; 90 L.Ed. 1477 (order vacated on other grounds on rehearing 330 U.S. 800, 67 S.Ct. 857, 91 L.Ed. 1259) are based on the .assumption that an illegal search occurs whenever government officials unlawfully gain access to a man\u2019s books -in his home or office, and that it is immaterial that they get their information by reading, copying or ' photographing instead 'of by seizing the books and removing them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In rejecting the reasoning of Vinson, J., in Nueslein, my colleagues ignore the unbroken line of decisions holding that the Fourth Amendment forbids either (a) illegal searches <em>or </em>(b) illegal seizures. \u201cThe things here forbidden are two: search and seizure\u201d, said Miller, J., concurring in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 641, 6 S.Ct. 524, 538, 29 L.Ed. 746. For this reason, federal courts have generally excluded any kind of evidence obtained as the result of an illegal search and not merely the physical introduction in evidence of things actually seized from the defendant. In Boyd v. United States, supra, 116 U.S. at page 627, 6 S.Ct. at page '530, the Court said that Lord Camden\u2019s opinion in Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell\u2019s St. Trials 1029, was \u201csufficiently explanatory of what was meant by unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d in the minds of the men who framed the Fourth Amendment. It is notable, therefore, that Lord Camden referred to the removal of papers as but an \u201caggravation\u201d of the offense in unlawful search cases. \u201c(E) very invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass. * * * (W)here private papers are removed and carried away the secret nature of those goods will be an <em>aggravation of the trespass.\u201d </em>* * *<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I think, then, that it goes against 180 years of constitutional history to say that an illegal entry, for the purposes of procuring evidence, is not a violation of the Amendment unless something \u201ctangible\u201d is carried away.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Our highest court has never decided that a \u201csearch\u201d is valid merely because made 'by the eyes or the ears and not the hands. Indeed so to hold would be to disregard the every-day meaning of \u201csearch,\u201d i.e., the act of seeking. In every-day talk, as of 1789 or now, a man \u201csearches\u201d when he looks or listens. Thus we find references in the Bible to \u201csearching\u201d the Scriptures (John 'V, 39); in literature to a man \u201csearching\u201d his heart or conscience; in the law books to \u201csearching\u201d a public record. None of these acts requires a manual rummaging for concealed objects. \u201cIt is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property * * Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630, 6 S.Ct. 524, 532, 29 L.Ed. 746.<footnotemark>16a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">So, just as looking around a room is searching, listening to the sounds in a room is searching. Seeing and hearing are both reactions of a human being to the physical environment around him \u2014 to light waves in one instance, to sound waves in the other. And, accordingly, using a mechanical aid to either seeing or hearing is also a form of searching. The camera and the dictaphone both do the work of the end-organs of an individual human searcher \u2014 more accurately.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>True, some look-searches and listen-searches do not run up against the Fourth Amendment. If an officer stays outside the house (or other precincts protected by the Amendment), he is not engaged in an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search when he looks through a window or listens at a keyhole. His activity is a \u201csearch,\u201d but not an unconstitutional one \u2014 because he has not, without the owner\u2019s consent, barged in on the constitutionally protected area. Thus a searchlight-beam focused on a ship\u2019s deck is not an unreasonable search, United States v. Lee, 274 U.S. 559, 47 S.Ct. 746, 71 L.Ed. 1202; nor is watching a house from an open field on which the officer is trespassing so long as his trespass does not extend to the house, Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898; even peeking through a transom is apparently cricket; McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153. Similarly government agents may listen to conversations in a defendant\u2019s room through a detectaphone attached to their own side of the wall. Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322. The Goldman case (unless as I shall later suggest, it may have been modified) teaches that men must expect official eavesdroppers, flashlight beams, spyglasses, wall-penetrating X-rays, and detectaphones \u2014in short, every sort of attempt by officials on the outside to find out what goes on in the inside of one\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">But the Supreme 'Court has stood firm in protecting the inviolability of the inside from the physical presence of official outsiders, absent the insider\u2019s consent. The Amendment acts as a bar at the doorstep against such uninvited intruders. A man still has the right to be secure in his home, after he has drawn the shades, soundproofed the walls, and insulated the building against X-rays. He does not have to keep up a 24-hour watch against official invaders. If the policeman at the window opens it up to come in for a better look, see Davis v. United States, 328 U.S. 582, 587, 598-599, 66 S.Ct. 1256, 90 L.Ed. 1453; if the agents have to break and enter the building in order to look over the transom of the owner\u2019s bedroom, Jackson, J., concurring in McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 458-459, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153; if the listening-device is planted inside the defendant\u2019s room rather than on the adjoining wall, Goldman v. United States, 316 U.S. 129, 134, 62 S.Ct. 993, 86 L.Ed. 1322-in all such instances a violation of the Fourth Amendment occurs. See Raine v. United States, 9 Cir., 299 F. 407, 411; Foley v. United States, 5 Cir., 64 F.2d 1, 4; United States v. Phillips, D.C.N.D.N.Y., 34 F.2d 495, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In any such case, the man is no longer secure in his house: the outsiders have moved in on him. The Goldman case drew this distinction prettily \u2014 almost as if the Court had anticipated this very case. There the officers, illegally entering a room of Shulman, one of the defendants, planted a \u201clistening apparatus\u201d (a dictaphone) in that room with wires running to the adjacent room, which the officers entered lawfully. The dictaphone failed to work. The officers then resorted to a detectaphone which had no wires connecting it with Shulman\u2019s room and which was wholly within the adjacent room. Solely by means of this outside detectaphone, the officers heard defendants\u2019 incriminating conversation (carried on in Shulman\u2019s room) to which the officers testified. The defendants, said the Court, \u201ccontend that the trespass committed in Shulman\u2019s office when the listening apparatus was there installed, and what was learned as a result of that trespass,' was of some assistance on the following day in locating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>receiver of the detectaphone in the adjoining office and this connection between the trespass and the listening resulted in a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Whatever trespass was committed was connected with the installation of the listening apparatus [the dictaphone]. As respects it, the trespass might be said to be continuing and, if the apparatus had been used it might, with reason, be claimed that the connecting trespass was the concomitant of its use.\u201d [316 U.S. 129, 62 S.Ct. 996],</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Goldman case distinction is crucial here: If the government agent, on the.outside, unaided by any device smuggled into On Lee\u2019s premises, had heard what On Lee said, the agent\u2019s conduct would have been unethical (perhaps even unlawful under state law) but not unconstitutional.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The microphone, however, was brought into On Lee\u2019s establishment without his permission. It was just as if the agent had overheard the conversation after he \u2018had sneaked in when On Lee\u2019s back was turned and had then hidden himself in a closet. All the agent\u2019s subsequent evidence-gathering was a result of, a concomitant of, the unlawful invasion. As recognized in Goldman, such behavior is altogether different from that of an officer- merely listening in an adjoining room which is no part of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected precincts. Here the agent, in effect, came inside that area, and did so without On Lee\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The situation is no different than if 'Chin Poy had secretly installed the radio inside the house. On Lee agreed to Chin Poy\u2019s presence in .his laundry; he did not agree, nor was he given the chance to disagree with what, for all practical purposes, was the presence of someone else altogether. The invading microphone enabled a third person, about whom On Lee knew nothing, to be present at the conversations. It accomplished the same purpose as if, and should therefore be treated as if, the agent had smuggled himself into the room to listen behind closed doors, or as if the agent had been a midget and had been hidden in a bag carried by Chin Poy onto On Lee\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">I grant that, as long as the <em>Goldvian </em>doctrine endures the domain of Fourth Amendment privacy will be rather restricted, and that it will become more so as new distance-conquering devices for seeing, hearing, and smelling \u2019are' invented. But I believe that, under the Amendment, the \u201csanctity of a man\u2019s house and the privacies of life\u201d still remain protected from the uninvited intrusion of physical means by which words within th.e house are secretly communicated to a person on the outside. A man can still control a small part of his environment, his house; he can retreat thence from outsiders, secure in the knowledge that they cannot get at him without disobeying the Constitution. That is still a sizable hunk of liberty \u2014 worth protecting from encroachment. A sane, decent, civilized society must provide some such oasis, some shelter from public scrutiny, some insulated enclos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ure, some enclave, some inviolate place \u25a0which is a man\u2019s castle.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Were my colleagues correct, the Fourth Amendment would be inoperative if a government agent entered a house covered with a \u201ccloak of invisibility\u201d \u2014 a garment which ingenuity may soon yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">This brings me to my colleagues\u2019 second argument which runs thus: The introduction of the microphone, without On Lee\u2019s consent, did not render unconstitutional the act of the distant agent in listening to the conversation; for that agent was just like a spy who, gaining entrance by concealing his identity, hears and testifies to an admission made by a criminal; testimony so obtained by a spy (say my colleagues) has never been held inadmissible under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">All else aside, this argument not only wipes out the Goldman case distinction but also ignores the distinction between (a) entry with the owner\u2019s consent when the consent is procured by deception, and (b) lack of any consent to the entry. This case is of the latter kind. For all practical purposes (as I have tried to show), the agent entered On Lee\u2019s premises without On Lee\u2019s knowledge and therefore minus his consent. That uninvited entry constituted just as much of a constitutional infringement as if the agent had forced his way in. To hold otherwise is to turn the Amendment into a sorry joke. It is to say to a police-officer: \u201cTake a hint. Don\u2019t bludgeon your way in. Wait till the owner is not looking, and then skulk in. The Constitution forgives a sneak\u2019s entry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">This is not at all what the courts have said when they have given a limited sanction to evidence obtained by spies who, by kes, have procured an owner\u2019s consent both to enter and to acts done by the spies after entry. Typically, in such a case, the owner, engaged in an illegal enterprise, expressly or tacitly invited prospective customers (or the like) to enter without being required to satisfy any conditions; the invitation was not conditioned on the .entrant\u2019s not being a government official; the spy gained entry because the owner mistakenly trusted that this seeming customer would not disclose 'his observations to the government. These were the facts in Davis v. United States, 328 U.S. 582, 66 S.Ct. 1256, 90 L.Ed. 1453, and in Blanchard v. United States, 5 Cir., 40 F.2d 904. Trupiano v. United States, 334 U.S. 669, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 92 L.Ed. 1663, relied upon by my colleagues to support their spy analogy, involved an informer who was hired by the defendants as a workman in an illegal still and who reported his observations to the police. The workman, like the customers, had been invited by the owner onto the premises for a specific reason; and the former\u2019s entrance was not illegal because of the use to which he put his observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u2022It is one thing to hold that the Amendment does not safeguard a man from such errors in judging the character of those whom he lets into his house; it is another to hold that the Amendment does not protect him from officers who get in when he does not know it. We shudder at the nocturnal \u201cknock at the door\u201d by searchers armed with no warrants. How much worse is a secret search by a knockless, sneaky, unknown entrant. In the first case, the citizen has the opportunity to question the searcher\u2019s authority, perhaps to dissuade or resist. In the second, he is powerless against an unseen snooper.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The spy cases are, at best, difficult to reconcile with Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647, where it was held that a government agent, paying defendant a \u201cfriendly visit,\u201d conducted an illegal search when he went through defendant\u2019s papers without defendant\u2019s knowledge. Assuming, however, that Gouled has been virtually overruled, the spy cases must, I think, be deemed to go to the very edge of unconstitutionality. No upper court, up to today, has gone further. In Fraternal Order of Eagles v. United States, 3 Cir., 57 F.2d . 93, 94, \u2014 overruling in effect United States v. Wainer, D.C.W.D.Pa., 49 F.2d 789 cited by my colleagues \u2014 -entrance was limited to a special class possessing credentials, and the government spies used stolen credentials which gave them the false appearance of members of that special class. The court held inadmissible the- evidence they procured.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The practice of broadcasting private inside-the-house conversations through concealed radios is singularly terrifying when one considers how this snide device has already been used in totalitarian lands. Under Hitler, when it became known that the secret police planted dictaphones in houses, members of families often gathered in bathrooms to conduct whispered discussions of intimate affairs, hoping thus to escape the reach of the sending apparatus.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Orwell, depicting the horrors of a future completely regimented society, could think of no more frightening instrument there to be employed than the \u201ctelescreen\u201d compulsorily installed in every house. \u201cThe telescreen,\u201d he writes, \u201creceived and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained in the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live, did live, from habit that became instinct, in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Such a mechanical horror may soon be the dubious gift of applied science. My colleagues\u2019 decision, by legitimizing the use of such a future horror, invites it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> I think that the decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>wrong and that the invitation should not be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">2. I consider the decision -wrong because of the Fourth Amendment. I am not sure it is correct even aside from the Amendment. I have in mind the post-Olmstead doctrine of McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819, and Anderson v. United States, 318 U.S. 350, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. 829, i.e., that the federal courts will not receive evidence obtained by federal officers through violation of federal or state laws.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">3. Apart from the radio evidence, I think the conviction should be reversed on still other grounds. Early in the trial, a detective was allowed to repeat the accusatory statement of Ying (On Lee\u2019s alleged, co-conspirator) made against On Lee after his arrest, when he was present. The judge received this evidence on the theory that, since On Lee had not denied the statement, he had thus admitted by silence what he had not denied. The judge was wrong. In United States v. Lo Biondo, 2 Cir., 135 F.2d 130, we held that a defendant need not deny any accusations made to his face after his arrest, and that his silence in such circumstances cannot be construed as an admission of his guilt. The trial judge in the instant case later partly realized his mistake, and, by his charge to the jury, sought to correct the misimpression. In a case where the evidence against the defendant was particularly substantial or convincing, I might agree that such an error is harmless, if thus subsequently corrected. But in this case, the evidence was anything but overwhelming, and a misimpression of this sort might easily sway the jury toward conviction.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To make matters worse, the judge here, in seeking to correct his error, positively harmed the defendant\u2019s case in the jury\u2019s eyes: The judge announced that, if the defendant had denied his guilt <em>before </em>arrest, he did not have to repeat his denials later after arrest.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In the charge, this was the only ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ception to the general rule of guilt by silence. Since the record contained no evidence that Oil Lee had denied guilt <em>before </em>arrest, the jury might well have believed that On Lee did not come within any exception and must therefore have admitted his guilt by remaining mute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Such an error should be deemed harmless, if at all, only where the government\u2019s case against the defendant is \u201cstrong.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> But here it was not. As already noted, the pivotal evidence was the agent\u2019s testimony about conversations he overheard. The following is therefore important: Chin Poy, the informer, was not called by the government and therefore did not himself testify to those conversations. Had the agent attempted to testify to what Chin Poy told him of these conversations, his testimony would have been excluded as hearsay\u2014 weak hearsay, at that, since no reason was given for not calling Chin Poy. The sole basis of receiving the agent\u2019s testimony was that he stated he had heard the conversations, i.e., was not merely retelling what Chin Poy had told the agent out of court. Yet, in the course of cross-examination of the agent, it came out that he had to rely on Chin Poy\u2019s out-of-court statements about the conversations. Consider these facts: (a) The agent\u2019s receiving set, on at least one occasion, was supposed to have been hooked up with a recording device in a nearby truck which could have made a record that could have been played to the jury. But the agent testified that he had made no such record because \u201cthe recorder was not working that evening.\u201d (b) He also testified that the kind of radio-device he utilized often failed to work properly because of noisy surroundings or transmitted unintelligible noises, (c) Pie further testified that he did not take notes of all the conversations while they were going on. (d) Only an hour or so later, did he make notes and memoranda concerning what he had heard. And the memo was made after comparing his notes with those of Chin Poy, so that the agent\u2019s memo was, at best, a collaborative product, (e) To make matters far worse, the agent did not use his notes and memoranda to refresh or prompt his recollection,* although he deliberately tried to give the appearance of doing so. For, during his direct testimony, he kept referring to a written statement. On cross-examination, however, he confessed that this statement was not his own \u2014 since his own notes and memos, he said, had been \u201cdestroyed\u201d or \u201cfiled away.\u201d The paper he used to refresh his recollection in testifying was a written statement made by Chin Poy of his recollection of the conversations. So that, in order to testify, the agent had to use out-of-court statements of Chin Poy, a man never seen or heard by the jury and never subjected to cross-examination. Surely a case resting on the agent\u2019s testimony is not \u201cstrong.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">. Yick Wo v.

To say that the people, in requiring adoption of the Fourth Amendment, meant to restrict invasion of their' homes if government officials were looking for something, but not to restrict it if the officials were merely looking, is to ascribe to the electorate of that day and to the several legislatures and the Congress a degree of irrationality not otherwise observable in their dealings with potential tyranny.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b365-17\">.

Radin, pointing out that the common law recognized no such rule against the processes of the King, says that the true origin of the sanctity-of-a-man\u2019s-house idea lies in the Roman law where the maxim was honored in practice as well as theory: No Roman citizen could be dragged from his home by any law enforcement official. Digest, 2, 4, 18. The idea, says Radin, appears first in Gaius\u2019 Commentaries on .the Twelve Tables, and was later picked up by Cicero, De Doma Sua, \u00a7 109. Radin further notes that the idea of the inviolability of the house was also part of German and French law. According to Radin, the lawyers in the colonies were well acquainted with Roman and Continental legal writings.
