This appeal is from that refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">This court has long held that when property is conveyed to spouses jointly they own it \u201cby entireties\u201d and that it cannot be partitioned. Settle v. Settle, 1925, 56 App.D.C. 50, 8 F.2d 911, 43 A.L.R. 1079. But the question whether a limited divorce for cruelty creates an exception in regard to partition of property held \u201cby entireties\u201d is nearly or quite new. In Reilly v. Reilly, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 182 F.2d 108, certiorari denied, 1950, 340 U.S. 865, 71 S.Ct. 90, 95 L.Ed. 632, the complaint alleged and the answer admitted that the parties were \u201cjoint owners\u201d of a cooperative apartment. We affirmed a decree of limited divorce that ordered partition of the \u201cjointly owned cooperative apartment\u201d by sale of \u201cthe proprietary lease\u201d and the accompanying shares of stock. We did not discuss the nature of the tenancy or of the proprietary lease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 4We held that the District Court \u201chad jurisdiction under its general equity powers to adjudicate and settle a dispute between the parties concerning their respective rights in funds and property which had been acquired by them during marriage, or incident thereto.\u201d Apparently the only dispute about the apartment was over the question of partition. We think the case was rightly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Twenty-six years ago this court said: \u201cThe tenancy by entireties is essentially a joint tenancy, modified by the common-law theory that husband and wife are one person.\u201d Settle v. Settle, supra, 56 App.D.C. at 51, 8 F.2d at 912. We think we should recognize the obvious fact that persons one of whom has divorced the other for cruelty, although the divorce is only a limited one, are not one person and that refusal to partition their property may inflict an undeserved burden on the plaintiff, confer an undeserved benefit on the defendant, and serve no useful purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe interest of society * * * requires that the fact be recognized, and our common-law system does not require that its recognition await express legislative action\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but permits courts to deal with it by creating an exception to a rule they have themselves made.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In our opinion a -court that grants a limited divorce for cruelty may in its discretion provide for partition or sale of property held \u201cby entireties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-32\">. \u201cA legal separation from bed and board may be granted for cruelty * * * \u201d D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 16-403</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">.

There is no legislative obstacle. \u201cTitle 16, \u00a7 409, District of Columbia Code (1940) does not apply. Its provision for apportionment relates only to property in which a tenancy, joint or by entireties, dissolves by operation of the aforegoing statute through a decree for absolute divorce or nullity of marriage.\u201d Reilly v.
