The trial examiner found that the respondent had violated Section 8(a) (1), and that it had not violated Section 8(a)(5). The Board agreed with the trial examiner\u2019s finding in regard to Section 8(a)(1), but disagreed as to Section 8(a) (5). The Board\u2019s order requires respondent to cease and desist from engaging in the unfair labor practices found, and from unlawfully interfering in any other manner with the rights guaranteed to its employees by the Act. Affirmatively, the Board\u2019s order directs respondent to 'bargain with the unions and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The respondent now takes the position that the findings and decision of the trial examiner and the Board, wfch regard to interference, restraint, and coercion, under Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, are supported by substantial evidence; and it does not oppose the Board\u2019s petition for the enforcement of the order as to Section 8(a)(1). The sole question left for decision is whether substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that respondent refused to bargain in good faith in violation of Section 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Respondent was legally bound to negotiate with an open mind and sincere desire to reach an agreement in a spirit of amity and cooperation. National Labor Relations Board v. Express Pub. Co., 5 Cir., 111 F.2d 588; National Labor Relations Board v. Reed &amp; Prince Mfg. Co., 1 Cir., 118 F.2d 874, 875; Stonewall Cotton Mills, Inc., v. National Labor Relations Board, 5 Cir., 129 F.2d 629. The record as a whole, we think, supports the finding that respondent failed to do this; and our conclusion is that the petition for enforcement of the order should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
