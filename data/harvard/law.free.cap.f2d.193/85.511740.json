Ryan, 2 Cir., 182 F.2d 329, is not apposite, as there the district court refused to order a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>fer. For where, as here, the order directs a transfer, we have held that a petition for a writ of mandamus will not be entertained if it alleges merely an \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Magnetic Engineering &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Dings Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 178 F.2d 866.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If, however, the district judge lacked power to make his order of transfer, we will entertain such a petition. See Foster-Milburn Co. v. Knight, 2 Cir., 181 F.2d 949. In that case, the defendant, which could not have been served in the transferee district, objected to the transfer, and we issued a mandamus writ. But here, one defendant could have been served in the transferee district, while the pther defendant, which could not there have bgen served, has joined in the application for, and thus consented to, the transfer. That consent is a waiver of lack of venue; had such a waiver existed before plaintiff commenced suit, it could have been brought there. We think 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) covers such a case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paramount Pictures v.

The same rule must apply to a petition for a writ of prohibition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">. The writer of this opinion dissented from the decision in that case and still thinks it wrong, but feels obliged to abide by it until his - colleagues join in overruling it. See The Arrowhead v. S. S. Aimee Dykes, 2 Cir., 193 F.2d 83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-23\">. We left that question open in Ford Motor Co. v.
