The Commissioner increased the value to $49.875 per share which was the mean market value on May 23, 1946 as reflected by sales on the New York Stock Exchange on that day. The Tax Court affirmed the determination of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">The principal contention of the petitioner is that the so-called \u201cblockage\u201d rule was not given due effect in the light of the number of shares involved and the condition of the market for the stock on, or about, the gift date. That is, of course, one of the factors to be taken into account but it is only one of them. Richardson v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 102. Possible secondary distribution is one of the others. Bull v. Smith, 2 Cir., 119 F.2d 490. This valuation was based upon substantial, though in part conflicting evidence to which the Tax Court apparently gave due weight without disregarding the \u201cblockage\u201d rule. Its determination under such circumstances should not be set aside as clearly erroneous. See, Maytag v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 187 F.2d 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
