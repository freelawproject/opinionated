In the notice appellee alleged ownership and use by itself and predecessors in business of two registered trade-marks, the first being the notation \u201cV-8\u201d for a \u201ccombination of eight vegetable juices,\u201d which was registered in the name of New England Products, Inc., January 25, 1938, upon an application, serial No. 397,587, filed September 20, 1937, and the second being the same notation registered in the name of Standard Brands Incorporated as a trade-mark for \u201ccanned mixed vegetable juices which may be served cold or used as a soup preparation.\u201d The latter mark was registered October 15, 1946, upon an application, serial No. 498,803, filed January 25, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Appellee\u2019s ownership of the registrations by transfers, duly recorded in the Patent Office, is not questioned by appellant, nor was any question raised as to the matter of prior user.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">We think the respective marks may be visualized readily from the description of them given in the brief for appellant as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u201c * * * each of the lower case letters \u2018h\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 is approximately two-thirds of the height of the letter \u2018V\u2019 and the width of each of the lower case letters 'h\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 is approximately one-half of the width of the letter \u2018V\u2019, the over-all width of the lower case letters \u2018hy\u2019 being approximately equal to the over-all width of the letter \u2018V\u2019 and the over-all height of the letters \u2018hy\u2019 being nearly the same as the height of the letter \u2018V\u2019. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\u201c * * * [-In appellee\u2019s mark] the letter \u2018V\u2019 is positioned at a slightly higher level than the numeral \u20188\u2019, the letter \u2018V and the numeral \u20188\u2019 being of approximately the same size, separated by a hyphen, and shown in <em>two </em>dimensions; * * *. (Italics quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">From the descriptions so given it is obvious to an observer, whether he be a careful observer or a casual observer,\" that the letter \u201cV\u201d as arranged in both marks constitutes the conspicuous feature of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">So far as the goods of the respective parties are concerned \u2014 that is, the \u201ccanned fruit juices for food purposes\u201d of appellant, and the (1) \u201ccombination of \u25a0eight vegetable juices\u201d and (2) \u201ccanned mixed vegetable juices which may be served cold or used as a soup preparation\u201d of appellee \u2014 we regard them as goods having the same descriptive properties in the sense of the registration statute as the phrase \u201csame descriptive properties\u201d has been construed so often by this and other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">We think there was no error in the decisions sustaining the opposition and the decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">JOHNSON and WORLEY, JJ.. dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
