The Tax Court held that the beneficiaries under the trust were liable for the state inheritance tax under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>Pennsylvania law and rejected the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the primary obligation for such tax rested upon the trustees and was a charge upon the trust estate under Pennsylvania law. Accordingly the Tax Court held that the taxpayer was taxable upon the full $100,000 for the year 1943. We are in accord with the Tax Court\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
