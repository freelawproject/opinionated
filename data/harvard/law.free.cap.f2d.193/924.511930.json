He went absent without leave in 1943 and returned to duty in 1944. He was then given a dishonorable discharge under a medical officer\u2019s diagnosis, \u201cthe record indicating a mental condition.\u201d His discharge was \u201cbased upon desertion and physical fitness\u201d <em>(sic; </em>unfitness must be meant). He \u201cat no time was tried for the offense of desertion.\u201d He \u201cwas discharged without an opportunity to defend himself against this charge or to present competent testimony in his behalf, nor was he allowed counsel to advise him of his rights in the premises.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When he went absent without leave and when he was discharged, he was schizophrenic and incapable of having an intent to desert. \u201cThe type of discharge given to him was not in accordance with law nor in accordance with the army reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>ulations then in force.\u201d More than a year after his discharge, he was found to be schizophrenic and committed to a civilian mental hospital. He then applied to the Army Discharge Review Board for an honorable discharge. This application was denied in 1947. The Review Board granted him a second hearing but in 1948 again denied his application for an honorable discharge. The Board\u2019s action was arbitrary and without evidence to support it. The Board \u201cwas not properly authorized and constituted in accordance with the Act of Congress 'authorizing\u201d it. Appellee, the Secretary of the Army, failed to \u201cpersonally\u201d review the action of the Army Dis- \u2022 charge Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The complaint asks that appellee be directed to cancel appellant\u2019s dishonorable discharge and give him a medical or an honorable discharge. This appeal is from an order dismissing the complaint on appellee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The statement in the complaint that the Board was not properly authorized and constituted is a conclusion of law unsupported by any allegation of fact. . The statement that the Board\u2019s action was without evidence and arbitrary is not only unsupported by allegations of fact but is contradicted by the statement that the appellant was dishonorably discharged \u201cunder\u201d, i. e. in accordance with, a medical diagnosis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">It is immaterial that the Secretary of the Army did not \u201cpersonally\u201d review the Board\u2019s action. A statute provides that the findings of an Army Discharge Review Board shall be \u201cfinal subject only to review by the Secretary * * * \u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but \u201cthe disposition of official matters by an Acting Secretary is frequently necessary and the integrity of administration demands that credit be given to his action in that capacity.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Congress has provided that no enlisted man shall be discharged \u201cexcept in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Department of the Army, or by sentence of a general or special court-martial.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Army Regulations No. 615-366, paragraph 8, dated 21 October 1944, one month before appellant was discharged, authorizes the discharge of an enlisted man \u201cwithout trial, because of desertion and physical unfitness.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the quoted Regulation does not apply when the enlisted soldier \u201cdoes not possess sufficient mentality to distinguish between right and wrong and is consequently incapable of forming the intent which is an essential element of the offense of desertion.\u201d In the light of this Regulation, together with the statement in appellant\u2019s complaint that he was schizophrenic and incapable of having an intent to desert, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss should perhaps be regarded as admitting for present purposes that appellant\u2019s dishonorable discharge was based upon an erroneous finding of fact in regard to his mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">Our task would have been simplified if the appellee instead of moving to dismiss had filed a motion, accompanied by affidavits, for summary judgment. In our opinion this would have been the better practice. But we have reached the conclusion that the District Court was right in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">The Administrative Procedure Act withholds judicial review of administrative action \u201cso far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency . discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2022 Congress created the Army Discharge Review Board for the express purpose of reviewing Army discharges. Congress required the Board to hold a full hearing. The Board\u2019s review is to be \u201cbased upon all available records * * * relating to the person requesting such review, and such other evidence as may be presented by such person. Witnesses shall be permitted to present testimony either in person or by affidavit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>the person requesting review shall be allowed to appear before such board in person or by counsel * * *.\u201d After this full hearing the Board is authorized, \u201cexcept in the case of a discharge or dismissal by reason of the sentence of a general court martial, to change, correct, or modify any discharge or dismissal, and to issue a new discharge in accord with the facts presented to the board.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the statute expressly makes the findings of the Board \u201cfinal subject only to review by the Secretary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We think Congress intended that the Board\u2019s full and \u201cfinal\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> review should not be subjected to a further review, or series of reviews, in the courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We may suppose that Congress considered the heavy burden that would be imposed upon courts if they were required to review the findings upon which Army discharges are based. As the Supreme Court has said in regard to a type of dispute for which the Railway Labor Act provides, the \u201cintent seems plain\u2014 the dispute was to reach its last terminal point when the administrative finding was made. There was to be no dragging out of the controversy into other tribunals of law.\u201d Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, 320 U.S. 297, 305, 64 S.Ct. 95, 99, 88 L.Ed. 61. At the very least, we think the statute intends that merely erroneous findings of fact by the Discharge Review Board shall not be revised by a court. Stripped of self-contradiction and legal conclusions, all that the complaint alleges against the Board\u2019s action is that it was based on an erroneous finding of fact. In our opinion appellee\u2019s technical admission that the finding was erroneous does not create an exception to the rule of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Since we think the statute precludes judicial review in this case we need not consider whether, if this were not so, appellant\u2019s complaint would still have to be dismissed for failure to show exhaustion of administrative remedies because it does not say that he specifically<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> asked the Secretary for review in every name and form in which the Secretary could have granted it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-15\">. The complaint does not suggest that any of these privileges were denied at either of the two hearings which appellant afterwards had before the Discharge Review Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b978-9\">.
