United States, 6 Cir., 162 F.2d 314, dealing with a codefendant of appellant;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">And it further appearing that, on October 28, 1948, Honorable Theodore Levin, United States District Judge, entered an order dismissing counts 1 and 3 of the indictment upon which appellant was convicted, all four counts thereof being based upon violations by appellant of section 588b, Title 12 U.S.C.A.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and imposed sentences of 25 years respectively on counts 2 and 4 of such indictment, said sentences having been provided to run concurrently and to have been deemed to commence as of May 14, 1938, the date of the original sentence;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-19\">And it appearing that the maximum sentence which could have been imposed on count 2 of the indictment was 20 years, but that the maximum sentence permissible on count 4 is 25 years and both of these sentences.having been imposed simultaneously by the order of re-sentence entered by District Judge Levin and it thus appearing that the total punishment imposed did not exceed the permissible limit on one of the counts; and it being the evident intention of the re-sentencing judge that the prisoner should serve the full limit permissible by the statute, obviously appellant has not been prejudiced by the technical error in re-sentencing;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-20\">And it is accordingly ordered, in compliance with the procedure prescribed by this court in Remine v. United States, 6 Cir., 161 F.2d 1020, that the invalid sentence pronounced on count 2 of the indictment be expunged, because merged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>twenty-five-year sentence imposed on count 4; and, with this correction, the judgment of the District Court imposing the twenty-five-year sentence of imprisonment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-21\">. 1948 Revised Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
