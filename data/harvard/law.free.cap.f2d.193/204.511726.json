No. 251,327 granted it under its former name, Wells-Lamont Manufacturing Co., on January 1, 1929; that its trade-mark has never been abandoned and that said registration is still outstanding and uncancelled; that its gloves have been extensively sold and its trade-mark has long been familiar to the purchasing public as associated with op-poser\u2019s business and indicating gloves originating with opposer; that the goods of the respective parties are not only of the same descriptive properties but are identical goods and that both are sold through the same outlets and to the same class of customers; that the mark sought to be registered by appellant so closely resembles the trade-mark of opposer as to be reasonably likely to cause the purchasing public to confuse the source of origin of the goods; and, that the grant of registration to appellant of its aforementioned trade-mark is likely to cause great damage and injury to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">In its answer, dated June 11, 1948, appellant admitted the issuance to appellee of United States Trade-Mark Registration No. 251,327, but denied that appellee has been legally injured or that the public is likely to be confused by the concurrent use of the involved marks. Appellant denied all other allegations of appellee\u2019s notice of opposition and \u201cleaves the opposer to its proof thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">Neither party took testimony but it was stipulated by counsel for the respective parties that appellee has been in the business of manufacturing and selling work gloves from at least as early as 1919 continuously down to the present time; that appellee has continuously sold work gloves under its trade-mark since the latter part of 1927 continuously down to the present time; that such sales have been to the purchasing public, through retail stores through which work gloves are commonly sold, in large volume and nationally throughout the United States; that Trade-Mark Reg. 251,327 was granted to appellee January 21, 1929 under its former name Wells-Lamont Manufacturing Co. and is still outstanding and uncancelled; and, that a copy of appellee\u2019s trade-mark will be in evidence, as well as Exhibit 1, being one of appellee\u2019s work gloves and Exhibit 2, being one of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>lee\u2019s cartons in which its work gloves are sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Appellant has disclaimed the word \u201cWhite\u201d apart from its mark as shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Both appellant and appellee stated in their briefs before this court that the only-issue here is whether or not the trademarks \u201cWhite Ox\u201d and \u201cWhite Mule\u201d are confusingly similar as applied to work gloves. The stipulation of facts by the parties similarly confines the case to this particular issue. Thus it will be seen that the only issue here presented is whether or not the involved trade-marks so resemble one another as to be reasonably likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive customers, when applied to the same goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The examiner held the involved marks to be confusingly similar and in his decision stated: \u201cThese marks, considered in their entireties, are deemed to be quite similar in general significance, in that both suggest domesticated working animals noted for strength and durability; and this similarity in the general impressions conveyed thereby is considerably enhanced by the use as prefixes of the identical color designation \u2018White\u2019. In their essentials, it is believed that such notations are closely comparable to the marks \u2018Lion Head\u2019 and \u2018Wolf\u2019s Head\u2019 involved in the case of Gilmore Refining [Oil] Co. v. Wolverine Empire Refining Co. (445 O.G. 775, 69 F.2d 532 [21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 943.]) * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The commissioner agreed with the reasoning of the examiner and affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In the case of Gilmore Oil Co., Ltd., v. Wolverine-Empire Refining Co., 69 F.2d 532, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 943, cited by the examiner, the involved marks were both composite marks. One was comprised of a pictorial representation in full face of the head of a lion with wide-open mouth, together with the words \u201cLion Head\u201d which appeared to the immediate right of the lion\u2019s head. The other mark comprised a pictorial representation in profile of the head of a wolf with wide-open mouth, together with the words \u201cWolf\u2019s Head,\u201d the word \u201cWolf\u2019s\u201d being to the left, and the word \u201cHead\u201d to the right of the wolf\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">It will be noted that both marks involved were composite marks comprising a pictorial representation plus words, and each having a pictorial representation of the head of a wild animal with wide-open mouth. A careful reading of the opinion in that case, in which one judge dissented, leads us to believe that the majority of the court placed great weight on the over-all similarity of the arbitrary and fanciful pictorial representation of the animal head used by eadh party, and that it regarded this to be the dominant feature of each of these marks, especially when the word \u201cHead\u201d was used with it in the manner discussed above. This is shown by the following statement of the court: \u201cThe fundamental idea, we think, in the adoption and use by appellee of its mark, was to convey to the purchasing public that its oil could, and should, be identified by the <em>head </em>of an animal. [Italics the court\u2019s.] It chose as its symbol the head of a wolf, and, in connection therewith, used the words \u2018Wolf\u2019s Head.\u2019 Substantially the same motive actuated appellant in the adoption of its involved trade-mark, * * *. It chose the representation of the head of a lion and the words \u2018Lion Head,\u2019 in order that its oil might be sold, and become known, as \u2018Lion Head Oil.\u2019 Some purchasers desiring appellee\u2019s oil would, of course, remember the precise name \u2018Wolf\u2019s Head.\u2019 Many, however, <em>due to the arbitrary and peculiarly fanciful character of the mark, </em>would likely have in mind only that the oil they desired was known as an animal\u2019s head motor oil. [Italics ours.] Under such circumstances, * * * the registration and use by appellant of its mark would be likely to lead \u25a0 to confusion, * * The trade-marks in issue here, however, are simply composed of a plurality of words. In view of this, we consider the Gilmore case distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">We have repeatedly held that prior decisions are of little value in an opposition proceeding because each case must rest upon its own distinctive facts. Likelihood of confusion from similar marks is largely a matter of opinion. Crown Overall Manufacturing Company v. Desmond\u2019s, 182 F.2d 645, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1118; George <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Ziegler Company v. Tom Huston Peanut Company, 181 F.2d 237, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 947. In the case of Gilmore Oil Co., Ltd. v. Wolverine-Empire Refining Co., supra [69 F.2d 535, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 943] in discussing the inapplicability of prior decisions cited by the appellant, the court said: \u201c* * * in view of the fact that in this case, as in all cases of this character, the issues must be determined in accordance with the peculiar facts and circumstances of record, those decisions are not determinative of the issues here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The likelihood of confusion in the minds of the purchasing public as to origin of the goods it purchases because of the similarity of marks is the test applied by this court in opposition proceedings. Nestle\u2019s Milk Products, Inc., v. Baker Importing Company, Inc., 182 F.2d 193, 37 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1066; Standard Laboratories, Inc., v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 167 F.2d 1022, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The marks must be considered in their entireties, Apollo Shirt Co. v. Enro Shirt Co., Inc., 165 F.2d 469, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, <em>849; </em>Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. Foley &amp; Co., 144 F.2d 888, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The court in considering contested trademarks in their entireties may take notice of descriptive as well as disclaimed portions despite the rule that the validity of registered marks which are merely descriptive is not to be challenged in opposition proceedings. West Disinfecting Co. v. Lan-O-Sheen Co., 163 F.2d 566, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 706. A descriptive word, having little trade-mark significance, will not be regarded as the dominant part of a mark. Atlantic Seafood Packers v. Florida Fruit Canners, Inc., 166 F.2d 586, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We consider the words \u201cMule\u201d and \u201cOx\u201d to he the dominant part of the involved marks. The words \u201cMule\u201d and \u201cOx\u201d are not similar; they do not look alike or sound alike, and, considering the marks in their entireties, we do not consider them to be confusingly similar and do not think their concurrent use would be likely to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The decision appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Atf\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">O\u2019CONNELL, Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">.
