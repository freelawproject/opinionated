The claims were rejected by the respondent on the ground that the complainant was disqualified under Amendment No. 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Regulation No. 3 from receiving the extra compensation subsidy allowed by the regulation to unaffiliated nonprocessing slaughterers <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because of the fact that it was affiliated with D. W. Richards Sons, a partnership which was a processor or purveyor of meat. The fact was that during the period here involved two of the three partners of D. W. Richards Sons, each having a 37%% interest in the partnership each also owned 25% of the stock of the complainant corporation. Thus the owners of 75% of the partnership owned 50% of the stock of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">The complainant\u2019s claims were rejected by Defense Supplies Corporation, the respondent\u2019s predecessor, on June 5, 1945. The protest against the order rejecting them was not filed until December 12, 1950, more than 5% years thereafter. The respondent urges that the complainant\u2019s right to prosecute its protest was barred by its laches in filing it. We do not agree. Section 203(a) -of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, under which the protest was filed, expressly provides that it may be filed \u201cat any time.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This was as the result of an amendment3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which removed from the section the original limitation of 60 days for the filing of protests. Subsequently Congress reimposed a time limitation upon the filing of protests in certain types of cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *Likewise a time limitation upon the filing of protests was-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>incorporated in Section 407(a) of the Defense Production Act of 1950<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But no such limitation has been reimposed by Congress upon the filing of protests under Section 204(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act against subsidy regulations and orders. What Congress has expressly eliminated and failed to reimpose the respondent may not impose under the guise of applying the doctrine of laches.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover we think that the respondent itself recognized that no such limitation existed when it sought to impose by regulation the limitation that all protests must be filed on or before December 15, 1950<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since the complainant complied with this regulation of limitation its validity is, of course, not before us and we do not pass upon it. We cite it only to show that the respondent seemed to regard such a regulation of limitation as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The respondent also urges that this complaint, filed under Section 204(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, is barred by Section 2401(a) of Title 28 United States Code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That section can have no application here, however, even if we assume that this is a civil action against the United States. This is because by the express terms of Section 204(a) <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a complainant\u2019s right of action<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> does not accrue under the act until his protest is denied and his action must then be commenced by filing a complaint in this court within 30 days thereafter. Thus the short statute of limitations contained in the Emergency Price Control Act itself completely eliminates the possibility of Section 2401 (a) coming into operation in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">When we come to examine the merits of the complainant\u2019s case it becomes perfectly clear that the subsidy claims in question were rightly invalidated and that the complainant\u2019s protest against that action was properly denied. In Somerville Dressed Meat Co. v. R. F. C., Em.App.1947, 159 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>716, this court held that common ownership of a 50% interest in a retail meat partnership and a 50% stock interest in the slaughterer corporation rendered the slaughterer affiliated with a processor or purveyor.of meat and, therefore, disqualified it from receiving the extra compensation subsidy under Amendment No. 2 to Regulation No. 3. That case cannot be distinguished in principle from this one. Upon its authority the complaint must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Cz\">A judgment will be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-6\">.

In Charles R. Krimm Lumber Co. v. Turney, Em.App.1948, 168 F.2d 72, 73, the respondent dismissed protests on the ground of laches. This court set aside the order dismissing the protests, saying: \u201cIt is certainly not true as a general proposition, that an administrative agency has inherent discretionary power to decline to perform a statutory function, where the application for administrative action, though made within the statutory time limit, has been unnecessarily delayed and as a result of the delay the administrative agency now deems the performance of the administrative function to have become unduly burdensome, by reason of reduction of staff or otherwise. Such a discretionary power may, of course, be conferred by legislative act.
