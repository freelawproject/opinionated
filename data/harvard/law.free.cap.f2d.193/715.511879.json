The Capillo was an American merchant vessel, was owned by the United State Maritime Commission, was chartered by the Commission to American Mail Line, Limited, a corporation, hereafter called American Mail, and was operated by American Mail at the direction and under the control of the Commission. Before the Capillo reached Manila, Johnson became ill. He never recovered from that illness. On November 28, 1941, when the Capillo reached Manila, Johnson was taken ashore and placed in a hospital in Manila. He never returned to the Capillo. The Capillo never left Manila.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-24\">On December <em>7, </em>1941, war began between the United States and Japan. The Japanese bombed and destroyed the Capillo on December 29, 1941, interned Johnson and other members of the Capillo\u2019s crew on January 6, 1942, and detained them until Johnson\u2019s death. Johnson\u2019s detention was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>hospitals in or near Manila. The last of these was the Santa Catalina Hospital at the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. There, on August 6, 1943, Johnson died intestate, leaving a daughter \u2014 his only child \u2014 Betty Jane Grant, wife of Robert H. Grant. \u00a1</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\">Johnson\u2019s administrator, James G. Mulroy, a resident of Seattle, Washington, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington a libel in personam on April 3, 1946-, and an amended libel in personam, hereafter called the libel, on September 29, 1947, against Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, a corporation, hereafter called Fireman\u2019s Fund, and the United States to recover of Fireman\u2019s Fund or the United States for Betty Jane Grant, as insurance on Johnson\u2019s life, $5,000, with interest from August 8, 1943,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and costs. Fireman\u2019s Fund and the United States answered the libel, a trial was had, and on August 31, 1950, a decree was entered, ordering, adjudging and decreeing that Mulroy recover of Fireman\u2019s Fund $5,000, with interest from August 31, 1950, and costs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the libel be dismissed as to the United States. Fireman\u2019s Fund and Mulroy have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Mulroy\u2019s claim against Fireman\u2019s Fund was based on Policy No. 6622 issued by Fireman\u2019s Fund to American Mail on October 17, 1941. Policy No. 6622 provided:</p>\n<p id=\"Abv\">\u201c[Fireman\u2019s Fund]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> * * * by this policy of insurance does insure [American Mail] <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cIn consideration of [American Mail] promising to pay to [Fireman\u2019s Fund] the sum of seven hundred eighty dollars ($780) as a premium at and after the rate of % per cent for such insurance [Fireman\u2019s Fund] takes upon itself the burden of such insurance in the amount of one hundred and four thousand dollars ($104,000) and promises and agrees with [American Mail] in all respects truly to perform and fulfill the contract contained in this policy. And it is hereby agreed and declared that the said insurance shall be and is an insurance upon protection and indemnity risks in respect to liability of [American Mail] for claims for loss of life, injury or disability as per slip attached,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is warranted free of all other claims of and in the good steamer called the \u2018Capillo\u2019 or by whatsoever other name or names the said ship is or shall be named or called, lost or not lost, at and from Columbia River port or ports (sailing on or about October 15, 1941) to Shanghai,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hongkong, Philippine Islands port or ports, while there and return to Columbia River and/or Puget Sound port and/or ports or until the expiration of one hundred days <em>(100) </em>from moment vessel sails from first Columbia River port, whichever may occur first, or held covered. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">\u201cThis policy covers war risk only as follows and is warranted free of all other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">\u201cThis insurance covers only contractual liability of [American Mail] for 'claims for loss of life or injury to or disability of licensed personnel,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> not exceeding eight (8) and unlicensed personnel,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> not exceeding thirty-two (32), as result of capture, seizure, destruction or damage by men of war, piracy, takings at sea, arrests, restraints and detainments and other warlike operations and acts of kings, princes and peoples in prosecution of hostilities, whether be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>fore or after declaration of war and whether by a belligerent or otherwise, including factions engaged in civil war, revolution or rebellion or insurrection, or civil strife arising therefrom, and including the risks of aerial bombardment, floating or stationary mines and stray or derelict torpedoes. In no case shall liability of [Fireman\u2019s Fund] exceed $5,000 each in respect to licensed personnel nor $2,000 each in respect to unlicensed personnel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\u201c[Fireman\u2019s Fund] will pay, in case of loss, an amount to be determined by applying the percentage shown below to the amount for which the master, officer or member of the crew is insured, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">\u201cLife....................100% * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">\u201cLoss, if any, subject however to all the terms and conditions of this policy, is payable to [American Mail] for distribution by it in accordance with agreement made with each seaman concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">From these provisions, it is clear that, if any insurance on Johnson\u2019s life was payable under Policy No. 6622,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> such insurance was payable by Fireman\u2019s Fund to American Mail and was not payable by Fireman\u2019s Fund to Mulroy. Hence Mulroy was not entitled to recover such insurance of Fireman\u2019s Fund. Hence the libel should have been dismissed as to Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Mulroy\u2019s claim against the United States was based on a Second Seamen\u2019s War Risk Policy<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> alleged by Mulroy to have covered Johnson. Actually, no Second Seamen\u2019s War Risk Policy was ever issued or authorized to be issued as to any voyage the articles for which were opened before 12:01 A.M. of March 15, 1943.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Articles for the Capillo\u2019s last voyage \u2014 the voyage during which Johnson was a member of the Capillo\u2019s crew \u2014 were opened on October 10, 19'41. Hence Johnson was not covered by any Second Seamen's War Risk\u201d Policy. Hence the libel was properly dismissed as to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Decree reversed as to Fireman\u2019s Fund and affirmed as to the United States.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-25\">.
