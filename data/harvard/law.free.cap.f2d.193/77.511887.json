For the last ten years it has concentrated its manufacturing and advertising efforts on its root beer product, Dad\u2019s Old Fashioned Root Beer. Though itself marketing this product only in the Chicago area it grants franchises to bottling concerns elsewhere, which then buy the concentrate from it and sell the mixed root beer locally. This is pursuant to a market expansion program begun in 1938 upon which it has spent over $1,000,000 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>nationwide advertising. The defendants are two New York corporations and their four principal officers, all residents of the state of New York. In 1941, plaintiff granted to defendant Harkavy Beverage Co., Inc., the franchise for the Borough of Bronx and the County of Westchester in New York. For the next six years this concern continued to sell there plaintiff\u2019s product which it manufactured from concentrate purchased from plaintiff. In 1946, however, the individual defendants formed Doc\u2019s Beverages, Inc., the other corporate defendant, and began sometime later to substitute their own product, Doc\u2019s Old Fashioned Root Beer, bottled, labeled, and boxed in strikingly similar fashion, on orders for plaintiff\u2019s root beer. When plaintiff discovered this fact in March, 1947, it terminated the franchise, and in October of that year filed the complaint in this action in the district court. This complaint charged defendants with trademark infringement and unfair competition through appropriation of good will, corporate name, trademark and distinctive labels, advertising, and bottle shapes, and sought injunctive relief, the profits realized from the sales of Doc\u2019s, and general damages. A trial of issues resulted in findings of fact and an interlocutory decree favorable to plaintiff on July 25, 1949, in which the court granted an injunction and directed an accounting before a master.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The district court based its jurisdiction, as the plaintiff had alleged, both on the diverse citizenship of the parties and because the action arose \u201cunder the trademark laws of the United States (15 U.S. C.).\u201d It then found \u201cgood and valid\u201d and owned by the plaintiff two trademarks registered in the United States Patent Office, one No. 364,823 registered February 14, 1939, and the other No. 399,605 registered January 19, 1943. The first is for the mark \u201cDad\u2019s Old Fashioned\u201d for use upon root beer; the second is for a mark using the label \u201cDad\u2019s Old Fashioned Draft Root Beer,\u201d accompanied by the bust of a man marked \u201cPapa.\u201d Although the copying of labels by defendants was almost identical except for the change from \u201cDad\u2019s\u201d to \u201cDoc\u2019s,\u201d the court made no finding as to infringement or with reference to interstate commerce, but did find unfair competition with plaintiff and with plaintiff\u2019s products sold under its two registered trademarks. And in its detailed findings, it recited unfair competition by defendants\u2019 advertising in imitation of plaintiff\u2019s labels, billheads, bills, and the like, including particularly an imitation of plaintiff\u2019s second or more detailed trademark as \u201cintended to lead to confusion.\u201d But the findings went somewhat beyond the trademarks to include plaintiff\u2019s use of the terms \u201cPapa,\u201d \u201cMama,\u201d and \u201cJunior,\u201d covering different sized bottles or the three together as the \u201cFamily\u201d or \u201cDad\u2019s Root Beer Family,\u201d as against defendants\u2019 use of the terms \u201cParty,\u201d \u201cFamily,\u201d and \u201cHandy\u201d to differentiate the sizes. The injunction, too, was broader than a mere prohibition of trademark infringement and went to the various acts of unfair competition found.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Defendants did not appeal from this interlocutory decree, nor do they now challenge the injunction or the findings upon which it was based. On the proceedings before the master, plaintiff waived all claim for damages other than defendants\u2019 profits. The master found that profits had accrued to Doc\u2019s Beverages, Inc., in the sum of $3,633.89, and to Harkavy Beverage Co., Inc., in the sum of $2,641.80, during the infringing period from February 1, 1947, to December 31, 1949, and that no profits accrued to the individual defendants. The court overruled defendants\u2019 exceptions to the master\u2019s report in a reasoned opinion, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 94 F.Supp. 121, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for these profits, together with interest, making the total sum of $6,840.50 and costs, including the cost of the reference. Defendants do not now challenge the findings as to the amount of profits, but bring before us for review only the legality of the award of profits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This issue is presented by the court\u2019s unchallenged findings that defendants had engaged in unfair competition, leading to its conclusion that plaintiff was entitled to an accounting of all profits from the sales of its competing root beer. From the evidence it appeared that there was no direct competition between plaintiff and defendants in the New York consuming market, and hence no lost sales of plaintiff\u2019s root beer. The nearest distribution points for plaintiff\u2019s product were as distant as Buffalo, N. Y., Newark, N. J., and Philadelphia, Pa. Although there was no explicit finding, it seems accepted that defendants limited their sales to the Bronx and Westchester County. Plaintiff asserts an inability to obtain a new bottler for this New York territory because of defendants\u2019 acts of unfair competition, but there was no definite proof as to this in the record. Defendants contend that under these circumstances an award of their profits is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">While the district court reached its conclusion as a matter of state law, which it held controlling, plaintiff argues that the case is controlled by the Lanham TradeMark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127. This act took effect July 5, 1947, or some five months after the beginning of the accounting period here. In its grant of remedies for violation of any right of a trademark registrant established in any civil action arising under it, it provides, <em>inter alia </em>\u201cand subject to the principles of equity,\u201d for the recovery of \u201cdefendant\u2019s profits,\u201d together with plaintiff\u2019s damages sustained and costs. The statute further states: \u201cIn assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant\u2019s sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed,\u201d and goes on to authorize an award up to three times actual damage and, where recovery based upon profits is cither inadequate or excessive, a judgment in the court\u2019s discretion for such sum as is found \u201cto be just, according to the circumstances of the case.\u201d \u00a7 35, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1117. This is a broad grant of power, sufficient to authorize the present award if the statutory provision governs. It is obviously intended as an all-inclusive authorization; the reference to the principles of equity is not a throwback or limitation to earlier law, such as Hostetter v. Vowinkle, Fed.Cas.No.6,714, 1 Dill 329, where plaintiff had to adduce evidence of his own lost sales before he could recover defendant\u2019s profits. It is, however, derived from, and a broadening of, the provision for remedies for wrongful use of a trademark under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 15 U.S. C. \u00a7 99, where the infringer\u2019s profits on sales went to the owner of the mark unless the infringer showed that his infringement had no cash value in sales made by him, Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 206, 207, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381; and plaintiff was entitled to them, even though it was not carrying on its business itself in the same territory. Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bfos. &amp; Co., 240 U.S. 251, 269, 36 S.Ct. 269, 60 L.Ed. 629; Lawrence-Williams Co. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Enfants Gombault et Cie, 6 Cir., 52 F.2d 774, 777, certiorari denied Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Enfants Gombault et Cie v. Lawrence-Williams Co., 285 U.S. 549, 52 S.Ct. 406, 76 L.Ed. 940; L. P. Larson, Jr., Co. v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co., 7 Cir., 20 F.2d 830, certiorari denied Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co. v. L. P. Larson, Jr., Co., 276 U.S. 616, 48 S.Ct. 207, 72 L.Ed. 733; Century Distilling Co. v. Continental Distilling Corp., D.C.E.D.Pa., 86 F.Supp. 503, 505. The phrase in the former statute which also provided for the grant of an injunction \u2014 now covered by \u00a7 34, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1116 \u2014 was \u201caccording to the course and principles of equity\u201d; it clearly refers to the general principles which may condition or limit relief, such as the \u201cequitable principles of laches, estoppel, and acquiescence\u201d mentioned earlier in the act. \u00a7 19, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1069; and compare holdings that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>award of profits to one engaged in an entirely different business \u2014 magazine publication as opposed to retail sales \u2014 is inequitable. Triangle Publications v. Rohrlich, 2 Cir., 167 F.2d 969, 974; Time, Inc., v. Life Color Laboratory, 198 Misc. 1038, 101 N.Y.S.2d 586, 588; Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders, 331 U.S. 125, 131, 67 S.Ct. 1136, 91 L.Ed. 1386. Our first task, therefore, is to determine whether federal or state law governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Until the advent of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, 114 A.L.R. 1487, in 1938, federal law was accepted as controlling issues of both trademark infringement and unfair competition. But since the advent of the energetic doctrine which takes its name from that case the situation has been confused. Some vigorous judicial claims are still heard for a uniform law; but the major view at least nods in the direction of a state rule, usually hazy, before resorting to the more complete and pertinent federal precedents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Lanham Act, however, executes a new turn back to uniformity; Judge L. Hand has succinctly pointed out that the \u201cact did indeed put federal trade-mark law upon a new footing,\u201d that \u201cit is no longer open to doubt that the present act created rights uniform throughout the Union,\u201d and that \u201cClearly a change, and a most substantial change, was intended, and the question is what that was.\u201d S. C. Johnson &amp; Son v. Johnson, 2 Cir., 175 F.2d 176, 178, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 527. (While the present writer dissented from the decision therein as not giving adequate scope to the new act, his agreement with the quoted views is obvious.) In the same fashion the law of unfair competition with respect to trademarks was expanded. Sec. 43(a), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1125(a), now gives a remedy for use of \u201ca false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same\u201d on goods in commerce, in favor of \u201cany person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation.\u201d Since the federal courts are given jurisdiction of all actions arising under the act, \u00a7 39, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1121, this remedy, too, is now definitely federal. See California Apparel Creators v. Wieder of California, 2 Cir., 162 F.2d 893, 900, note 12, 174 A.L.R. 481, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 816, 68 S.Ct. 156, 92 L.Ed. 393; Callmann, False Advertising As A Competitive Tort, 48 Col.L.Rev. 876, 885; Bunn, The National Law of Unfair Competition, 62 Harv.L.Rev. 987, 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">More question has arisen as to the extent and meaning of \u00a7 44, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126, which in subsection (h) states that nationals of foreign countries which are parties to certain named international conventions and treaties involving trademarks \u201cshall be entitled to effective protection against unfair competition\u201d and goes on in (i) to specify that citizens or residents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>United States \u201cshall have the same benefits\u201d as are granted such nationals by the section. Relying particularly upon legislative history, various text writers have found in these provisions a broad grant of a national power of protection against unfair competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This construction was accepted and followed in Stauffer v. Exley, 9 Cir., 184 F.2d 962,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and approved in In re Lyndale Farm, C.C.P.A., 186 F.2d 723, 726, 727. To the contrary is Ross Products v. Newman, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 94 F.Supp. 566, holding that subsection (i) does not create any additional rights beyond those conferred earlier in the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue was not passed upon in Cutting Room Appliances Corp. v. Empire Cutting Machine Co., 2 Cir., 186 F.2d 997, or Kleinman v. Betty Dain Creations, 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 546, which, however, were patent cases. We need not settle this issue here, since the main prohibition against infringement in the act, \u00a7 32, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the quoted provision prohibiting false descriptions of the goods, \u00a7 43(a), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1125(a), seem entirely adequate to justify the award absent difficulty with regard to \u201ccommerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">By the express requirement of the two cited sections and the assumption in Stauffer v. Exley, supra, as to any right under \u00a7 1126, the infringing use must occur in or affect \u201ccommerce,\u201d as defined in the act. Before the Lanham Act it was well settled that federal remedies for trademark infringement applied only when defendants\u2019 infringing acts were themselves in interstate commerce. United States Printing &amp; Lithograph Co. v. Griggs, Cooper &amp; Co., 279 U.S. 156, 49 S.Ct. 267, 73 L.Ed. 650; Pure Oil Co. v. Puritan Oil Co., 2 Cir., 127 F.2d 6. The definitions of the act show an intent to extend the federal power; but how far is not yet settled. Thus it is stated: \u201cThe word \u2018commerce\u2019 means all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.\u201d \u00a7 45, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127, which also sets forth the intent of the act \u201cto regulate commerce within the control of Congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce * * *; to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud and deception in such commerce by the use of reproductions, copies, counterfeits, or colorable imitations of registered marks; * * <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Nevertheless in certain cases under the act, the older requirement seems to have been applied more or less explicitly without the need of careful differentiations. See Samson Crane Co. v. Union Nat. Sales, D.C. Mass., 87 F.Supp. 218, affirmed per curiam 1 Cir., 180 F.2d 896; R. P. Hazzard Co. v. Emerson\u2019s Shoes, D.C.Mass., 89 F.Supp. 211; C. B. Shane Corp. v. Peter Pan Style Shop, D.C.N.D.Ill., 84 F.Supp. 86; cf. Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour &amp; Co., 3 Cir., 175 F.2d 795, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 847, 70 S.Ct. 88, 94 L.Ed. 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The point -is, however, considered with some care in Stauffer v. Exley, supra, and the conclusion is reached that while the defendants need not themselves be acting in interstate commerce yet their activities must cause some injury to plaintiff\u2019s interstate business. The case was sent back for findings upon this issue. See also Chamberlain v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 9 Cir., 186 F.2d 923. At least so much extension would seem requisite in the light of the so strongly stressed intent of Congress. But this still does not leave entirely clear how much evidence of such injury is requisite before the remedies under the act are available. As we have seen, carrying on the same business in a different territory was sufficient to show a wrong even under the former act; and it was to be inferred \u201cthat there was a latent demand for plaintiff\u2019s goods which it would eventually have supplied, except for the infringement.\u201d Lawrence-Williams Co. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Enfants Gombault et Cie, supra, 6 Cir., 52 F.2d at page 777.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, although the trial court had made no explicit findings on the matter, it is so apparent that the plaintiff\u2019s trademarks are used in interstate commerce that returning the case for a finding to that effect would be a pure formalism. Moreover, the inference from the peddling of the same goods is all the stronger here because it does appear that there had been an actual demand which plaintiff had supplied through defendants\u2019 franchise until defendants\u2019 own breach of faith terminated the supply. In the view of the writer hereof this is a sufficient showing to make the statutory remedies and damages applicable for the period following the effective date of the Lanham Act. If that is so, then the act must apply to the exclusion -of state law.8 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the earlier period, in any event we are thrown back to state law. We agree with the district judge in his conclusion, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 94 F.Supp. 121, that under the New York law the result should be the same; and my colleagues feel that, for lack of findings, affirmance generally should be put upon this ground, rather than that stated above by the writer.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">As the district judge pointed out, it is well settled in equity that a trademark infringer is liable as trustee for profits accruing from his illegal acts, even though the owner was hot doing business in the consuming market where the infringement occurred. See the specific holdings in Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. &amp; Co., and companion cases cited supra, as well as the principle set forth in Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., supra. New York has expanded this rule to permit injunctive relief against unfair competition, even where no lost sales are shown. Michel Cosmetics v. Tsirkas, 282 N.Y. 195, 26 N.E.2d 16. See also Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co., 6 Cir., 300 F. 509, certiorari denied 273 U.S. 706, 47 S.Ct. 98, 71 L.Ed. 850; Lady Esther, Ltd. v. Lady Esther Corset Shoppe, 317 Ill.App. 451, 46 N.E.2d 165, 148 A.L.R. 6, and cases collected in annotation following at page 12; Note, 38 Harv.L.Rev. 370. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>True, recovery of defendant\u2019s profits seems thus far to have been associated with the working hypothesis that they are a valid measure of plaintiff\u2019s lost sales. See Westcott Chuck Co. v. Oneida Nat. Chuck Co., 199 N.Y. 247, 92 N.E. 639; Michel Cosmetics v. Tsirkas, supra. This affirmation does not of itself require the negative, however \u2014 that without direct competition in the same geographic area there can be no recovery of profits. We think the force.of the precedents cited, re-enforced by the widely quoted and applied federal rule, leads to the contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">For it is well settled that the court \"will endeavor to adapt its relief to the general equities of the particular situation, as nearly as it is possible to do so,\u201d in designing relief for unfair competition. J. C. Penney Co. v. H. D. Lee Mercantile Co., 8 Cir, 120 F.2d 949, 958. So the New York courts have declared adherence to the principle that the relief is to be a flexible one. Underhill v. Schenck, 238 N.Y. 7, 143 N.E. 773, 33 A.L.R. 303. Here, as in the case just cited, mutual dealings and a contractual business relationship existed prior to an unexcused program of palming off which was intended to, and did, result in purchase-confusion. Of course plaintiff also had the loss of its franchise commissions and concentrate sales which it was enjoying until defendants substituted spurious \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d root beer for the trademarked product. Moreover, plaintiff suffered through the possible deterioration of its advertising effectiveness by the appearance on the public market of a similarly named, but separate, product of the same substantial make-up. A limitation of plaintiff\u2019s remedies to an injunction against further appropriation of its labels, devices, and advertising good will, leaving to the defendants the actual profits made through their wrongful acts, would be inequitable and contrary to the general state principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-5\">. Plaintiff does appear to question \u2014 as \u201cwith poor grace\u201d \u2014 the present appeal as raising issues settled by the interlocutory decree. But whatever issues might have been raised \u25a0 on an appeal from the grant of an injunction, had defendants then sought review, it is clear that in any event all substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>issues are fully open on appeal from the final judgment.

Relying, <em>inter alia, </em>upon the later statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(b), conferring \u201cpendent jurisdiction\u201d upon the federal courts \u2014 an unnecessary grant, it is asserted, if the view of the Stauffer case is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b133-17\">. While the district court did not explicitly find that defendants had knowledge or notice of the registered marks, yet it was clear that they did, not merely from the correspondence between the parties in the spring of 1947, but also from the notice on the labels which the defendants used during their holding of the franchise and thereafter copied. The intent to confuse by the copying was of course patent, as the court did find.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b133-18\">. This is in accord with the statement in the Senate Committee Report on the bill that \u201csound public policy requires that trade-marks should receive nationally the greatest protection that can be given them.\u201d U.S.Code Cong.Serv., 79th Cong., 2d Sess.1946, p. 1277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b134-4\">. This would seein in substance the view presented in March, Territorial Scope of the Trade Mark Act of 1946, 38 T. M.R. 955, 962-966, at least wh,ere the plaintiff\u2019s mark is itself first in the field. Another writer suggests, more \u25a0 confidently, that \u201cfor the first time their [i. e., federal courts\u2019] jurisdiction clearly extends to the intrastate user of a mark which infringes a mark registered under the Federal Act, as well as to intrastate acts of unfair competition irrespective of the amount in controversy or diversity of citizenship.\u201d Robert, Commentary on the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C. A. at p. 269 before \u00a7 1051.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">. Conceivably there may be some distinction between the unrestricted language of \u00a7 1126 and \u201cthe sale in commerce\u201d of goods carrying imitation or counterfeit labels of \u00a7 1114(1), as well as the causing of falsely described goods \u201cto be transported or used in commerce\u2019\u2019 of \u00a7 1125 (a), making the first named the more complete remedy. But that is believed doubtful under the broad definitions of \u00a7 1127 quoted in the text. Since commerce itself means all commerce which Congress may lawfully regulate, and the legislative intent is to give remedies for all deceptive use' of marks in such commerce and to protect persons engaged therein against unfair competition, it would follow that a use to the injury of marks which are in commerce is a use in commerce.

Judge Clark concludes that to make the Lanham Act applicable here, it suffices to show some injury to plaintiff\u2019s interstate business. Whether that is enough, I do not care to consider, since there is no finding of such injury. I therefore follow the trial judge. That is, I rest my concurrence on state law alone. Because, then, on my view of the case, the Lanham Act is irrelevant, I do not join in \u2014 I neither concur in nor dissent from \u2014 that part of Judge Clark\u2019s opinion (running from the fifth paragraph through the ninth) which discusses the meaning and scope of that statute.</p>\n<author id=\"b135-10\">SWAN, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Abx\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">I concur in Judge FRANK\u2019S opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">I concur, to the extent indicated, in Judge CLARK\u2019S opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
