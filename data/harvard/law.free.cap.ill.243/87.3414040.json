Contingency either as to time or condition of payment in the terms of a promissory note is fatal to its negotiability. Kingsbury v. Wall, 68 Ill. 311; Smalley v. Edey, 15 id. 324; Gillilan v.

Emmons Davis prosecuted an appeal to the Appellate Court for the Third District. The judgment was affirmed by that court, and he has brought the case to this court by further appeal.</p> <p id=\"b89-13\" pgmap=\"89(89) 90(127)\">The transaction and circumstances out of which the execution of the instrument sued upon arose were as follows : H. V. Davis was the father of appellant, three other sons and Elizabeth Gamble. In September, 1893, H. V. Davis made appellant a warranty deed, conveying to him one hundred and fifteen acres of land in Champaign county for an expressed consideration of $100. By the deed the grantor reserved to himself a life estate in the lund conveyed. He also appears to have made deeds for other lands to his other sons but none to the daughter. Mrs. Gamble was dissatisfied with this and claimed that the sons had by fraud and undue influence secured the deeds from their father, and she insisted upon her brothers making good to her a portion of the estate of her father which she would be entitled to as one of his heirs at the time of his death. Mrs. Gamble claimed that each of her brothers ought to give her a note for $1500, and the instrument sued on was executed by the appellant and delivered to Mrs. Gamble. H. V. Davis died in July, 1906, and within twelve months after that time the instrument sued on was endorsed and transferred by Mrs. Gamble to appellee. .</p> <p id=\"b90-5\" pgmap=\"90\">Appellant states in his brief that the vital question in the* case is, was the instrument sued on a negotiable instrument?\u2014and that the decision of that question will be decisive of the case. No other question is discussed in his brief and argument.</p> <p id=\"b90-6\" pgmap=\"90(207) 91(319)\">In Dorsey v. Wolff, 142 Ill. 589, it was said a promissory note \u201cmay be defined to be a written promise by one person to pay to another person therein named, or order, a fixed sum of money at all events and at a time specified therein or at a time which must certainly arrive.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention is that the instrument sued on is not a promissoiy note because it is not payable at a specified time which must certainly arrive, but is payable upon a contingency which may or may not happen. The contingency upon which it is argued the payment depends is the actual ownership and possession of the land by appellant, and it is said this may never happen, because it may be that the grantor in the deed had no title to the land, or that appellant might fail to record his deed and the grantor make another deed to an innocent purchaser, or that appellant might before the death of his father have joined with him in a conveyance to a third person, thereby destroying appellant\u2019s estate and interest in the land before the life estate of his father was terminated. We think there is no merit in this position of appellant. It is not claimed that there is any basis for the contention that it might possibly turn out appellant\u2019s father had no title to the land conveyed, and as to the other alleged contingencies it was in the power of appellant to prevent them happening. Besides, we do not consider them contingencies, within the meaning of the law, that could affect the certainty of the time for the payment of the instrument sued on. Properly analyzed and understood, that instrument recites that H. V. Davis had conveyed to appellant one .hundred and fifteen acres of land, reserving a life estate therein; that appellant was to become the owner in fee and possessed of said land upon his father\u2019s death, and he promised to pay Elizabeth Gamble $1500 within twelve months after he became such owner of said land,\u20142. e., within twelve months after his father\u2019s death. The payment was not dependent upon a contingency that might never happen. The death of H. V. Davis would entitle appellant to the possession of the land, and his death was certain to happen. If the instrument was uncertain and ambiguous, which we think it is not, it is framed in the language of appellant and must be construed most strongly against him. \u201cWhere the language of an instrument is susceptible of two constructions, one of which requires the performance of the impossible or involves a forfeiture or renders it unreasonable or unjust, the construction which makes a performance possible or avoids a forfeiture or is reasonable or just will be adopted.\u201d (Rankin v. Rankin, 216 Ill. 132.) It seems to us it would be an absurd and unreasonable construction of this instrument to \"say that the parties did not understand or intend that the money was to be paid absolutely and within a definite, certain and fixed time.</p> <p id=\"b91-4\" pgmap=\"91(43) 92(341)\">What was said in Massie v. Belford, 68 Ill. 290, is so pertinent to this discussion that we quote what the court there said as not only applicable to the instrument here sued on, but as conclusive' of the correctness of the construction placed on the instrument by the trial and Appellate Courts. In that case the note sued on was payable \u201con or by the first of March, eighteen and sixty-eight,\u201d and it was contended that the time of payment was not definite and certain. The court said: \u201cIn the construction of written contracts it is a well known rule of law that the intention of the parties who made the contract is to be determined from the whole instrument, and when the intention can be so ascertained it is the duty of courts to carry it into effect. If a contract contains ambiguous words or words of doubtful construction, such are to be construed most strongly against the party who executed the contract. If the contracting party uses, over his own signature, language of doubtful meaning, he cannot complain when the construction is favorable to the other contracting party, who is not presumed to have chosen the expression of doubtful meaning. (Walker v. Kimball, 22 Ill. 537; McCarty v. Howell, 24 id. 342.) What, then, did the defendant intend and what did the plaintiff expect when the promissory note was executed in and by- which the defendant promised to pay the amount therein named on or by the first of March, eighteen and sixty-eight? There can be no doubt in regard to the intention of both payer and payee. They undoubtedly intended by the language used to make the note due on the first day of March, 1868. The word \u2018hundred\u2019 was omitted, but the intent of the parties is so manifest that the law will enforce the contract as was intended, and hold that the note was due on the first day of March, 1868. It is not the policy of courts to give such a construction to contracts as will defeat the ends of justice upon a technical question, but rather enforce contracts according to the intention of the makers thereof, when, as in this case, the intent is so apparent.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b92-6\" pgmap=\"92\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b92-7\" pgmap=\"92\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
