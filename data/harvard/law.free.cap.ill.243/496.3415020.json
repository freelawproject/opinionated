Pleading\u2014jurisdiction of court to permit an amendment of pleadings on remandment before notice of re-insfatemeni. Where a chancery cause is remanded and the remanding order is filed in the trial court the court has jurisdiction to permit formal amendments to the bill, even though the ten-day notice of re-instatement of the cause, required by section 113 of the Practice act, has not been served. (Austin v. Dufour, 110 Ill. 85, explained.)</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496\">2. Parties\u2014when adding necessary party to a bill to contest will is not the beginning of a new suit. Where all the necessary parties in being at the time a bill to contest a will is filed are made parties the court has jurisdiction of the proceeding, and the addition of another necessary party, born after the filing of the bill, after the one year limitation for filing such bills has expired, is not the commencement of a new suit, such as deprives the court of jurisdiction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-9\" pgmap=\"496\">3. Wills\u2014when it is not necessary for evidence to sustain all charges of the bill. Where a bill to contest a will is predicated upon the three distinct grounds of general want of testamentary capacity, undue influence and the existence of an insane delusion, it is not necessary that the evidence shall sustain all of the charges, and if it is sufficient to sustain any of the grounds so alleged the will should be set aside.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-10\" pgmap=\"496\">4. Same\u2014general definition of insane delusion. In general, an insane delusion may be said to exist where a testator, without evidence of any kind, imagines or conceives something to exist which does not, in fact, exist, and which no rational person would, in the absence of evidence, believe to exist.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-11\" pgmap=\"496\">5. Same\u2014belief in existence of facts based upon some evidence is not an insane delusion. If a testator has some actual grounds for the belief which he has, though they are regarded by others as wholly insufficient, his mere misapprehension of the facts or his unreasonable and extravagant conclusions drawn therefrom do not establish such a delusion as will invalidate the will.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-12\" pgmap=\"496(46) 497(45)\">6. Same\u20141when injustice, unfairness, prejudice and unreasonable anger afford evidence of mental derangement. While injustice, unfairness, prejudice and anger without reasonable cause do not disqualify a person from making a valid will, still where such manifestations habitually appear in respect to the same subject without any reason and are adhered to after their falsity is demonstrated they become strong evidence of mental derangement, and evidence of their existence, without cause, in respect to an only son is of more weight than if the parties were not closely related.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-5\" pgmap=\"497\">7. Same\u2014what evidence tends to establish an insane delusion. Proof that the testator believed certain things concerning his only surviving son; that he had no evidence on which to base this belief; that the things he believed were such things as no rational person would believe without evidence, and that he refused to give up his belief in the face of such reasonable evidence as would convince any person of sound mind that it was unfounded, tends to establish an insane delusion.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-6\" pgmap=\"497\">8. Same\u2014when jury may consider apparent inequality of distribution. The apparent inequality and unreasonableness of the distribution of a vast estate by a will which practically disinherits the testator\u2019s only son may be considered by the jury upon the question of the testator\u2019s testamentary capacity, in connection with other evidence upon that question.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-7\" pgmap=\"497\">9. Instructions\u2014the fact that hypothetical facts may not be proven by weight of evidence is no objection. If the facts stated hypothetically in an instruction presenting the contestant\u2019s theory upon one point in a will case have a basis in the evidence, which is conflicting upon that point, the fact that the proponents contend the weight of the evidence tends to show the facts were not as hypothetically stated is not a valid objection to the instruction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-8\" pgmap=\"497\">10.

Under the issues made in this case and in view of the context of the instructions complained of, the words \u201csubjects connected with the testamentary disposition of his property,\u201d used in such instructions, mean .any person, matter or thing connected with the testamentary disposition of the testator\u2019s property, and include devisees as well as the things devised.</headnotes><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b497-9\" pgmap=\"497\">Cartwright, Hand and Dunn, JJ., dissenting.</p><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-10\" pgmap=\"497\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of DeWitt county; the Hon.

On the first trial of the cause the jury failed to agree and were discharged without a verdict. On the second trial there was a finding for the complainant, and against the will, on all of the issues presented. A 'decree was entered in accordance with the verdict setting aside the will, from which the executor appealed to this court. The decree of the circuit court was reversed because of several errors which are pointed out in the opinion of this court, which is reported as Snell v. Weldon, 239 Ill. 279. After the remanding order of this court was filed in the circuit court, but before any notice had been given to appellant that the cause would be re-docketed for trial, an application was made to one of the circuit judges, in vacation, for leave to amend the bill, making a child that had been born to the testator\u2019s grandson, Harry C. Snell, after the commencement of the suit, a party defendant. This leave was granted and the child was made a party and brought into court by summons, and the child answered the bill through a guardian ad litem. Upon the third trial of the cause a verdict was returned finding\u2019 that the alleged will, and each of the three codicils thereto, purporting to be the last will and testament of Thomas Snell, were not his last will and testament, and specifically fiiiding that at the time when the will and the several codicils thereto were executed the testator was laboring under an insane delusion concerning his son, Richard Snell. The circuit court entered a. decree setting aside the will, after having overruled motions to set aside the general and special verdicts and for a new trial. The executor has again brought the record to this court for review and asks a reversal for several reasons, which will be hereinafter considered.</p> <p id=\"b499-3\" pgmap=\"499\">When this cause was before this court on the previous hearing the circumstances attending the execution of the will were stated, but in view of the issues then presented and the conclusion reached by this court in respect thereto we did not deem it necessary to set out the will and the three codicils at large, but as the case is now presented it is necessary to a proper discussion and understanding of the questions involved to set out the entire will and the three codicils thereto. Before doing so a few of the leading facts will be stated.</p> <p id=\"b499-5\" pgmap=\"499\">The testator was born in December, 1818, and died June 19, 1907, at the age of eighty-eight years. He had lived the greater part of his life in DeWitt county. He had been exceptionally successful in accumulating a large fortune, and at the time of his death his estate was valued at approximately $1,500,000, which consisted largely of valuable real estate in McLean and DeWitt counties, in this State, and lands in Iowa and Missouri.\u2019 At the time of his death he left one child, Richard Snell, the appellee herein, and three grandchildren, Thomas Thornton Snell, Harry C. Snell and Lena E. Dinsmore, children of his deceased son, James Thornton Snell, as his only heirs-at-law. The testator\u2019s wife died many years before the will was executed. Other facts ^ and circumstances which have a bearing upon the issue in regard to the existence of an insane delusion in the mind of the testator will be stated hereinafter in connection with the consideration of that question.</p> <p id=\"b499-8\" pgmap=\"499\">The will of Thomas Snell is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b499-9\" pgmap=\"499\">\u201cI, Thomas Snell, of the county of DeWitt and State of Illinois, do make, publish and declare this to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking all former wills by me made at any time.</p> <p id=\"b500-4\" pgmap=\"500\">\u201ci. I give, bequeath and devise all my property, real and personal, wherever the same may be, to Lincoln H. Weldon and his successor or successors, in trust for' the uses and purposes herein expressed and specified, until the time hereinafter named for the final distribution of my estate.</p> <p id=\"b500-5\" pgmap=\"500\">\u201c2. It shall be the duty of said Lincoln H. Weldon (who is also hereinafter named as the executor of this my will) to pay my funeral expenses and all my just debts in due course of administration, and in case a contract for building a vault or tomb for ntyself and family, now in contemplation, is not let or made before my decease, I hereby authorize, direct and require the said trustee to let or make such contract within six (6) months from my decease, the contract price to be not less than seven thousand ($7000) dollars and not more than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars. It shall be the duty of said trustee, and each and every 1 trustee for the time being under this will, to keep my burial vault and cemetery lots in good repair and order, the grounds in blue grass and suitable flowers at the proper' seasons.</p> <p id=\"b500-6\" pgmap=\"500\">\u201c3. I authorize and direct the said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, to pay annually to my daughter-in-law, Hannah A. Snell, the sum of one thousand ($1000) dollars on the first day of January of each and every year, so long as she shall live, in accordance with contract with her dated on or about the 25th day of July, A. D. 1899.</p> <p id=\"b500-7\" pgmap=\"500(95) 501(16)\">\u201c4.

I authorize and direct the said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, to pay annually to my son, Richard Snell, the sum of one thousand ($1000) dollars in the month \u00f3f March of each and every year after the year of my decease, so long as he shall live; provided that no such annual payment shall be made prior to 1905.</p> <p id=\"b501-5\" pgmap=\"501\">\u201c6. I authorize and direct the said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, to pay annually the sum of one thousand ($1000) dollars to each of my three grandchildren, Lena E. Dinsmore, Thomas Thornton Snell and Harry C. Snell, in the month of March in each and every year after my decease, until improvements in East Fort Dodg'e, Iowa, to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) dollars,, as hereinafter directed, have been made and paid for.</p> <p id=\"b501-6\" pgmap=\"501\">\u201c7. I authorize and direct the said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, to pay annually the sum of three thousand ($3000) dollars to each of my three grandchildren, Lena E. Dinsmore, Thomas Thornton Snell and Harry C. Snell, in the month of March in each and every year, for the period of five (5) years next after said improvements in East Fort Dodge, Iowa, to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) dollars have been made and paid for; provided that in case any business house or houses of considerable value should during said period of five (5) years be destroyed by fire, it shall be the duty of said trustee, his successor or successors, to rebuild the same, and until this is done and the same paid for, the annual payments to each of said three grandchildren shall be reduced to the sum of one thousand ($1000) dollars.</p> <p id=\"b501-7\" pgmap=\"501(32) 502(55)\">\u201c8. It shall be the duty of said trustee, his successor\u2019 or successors in trust, to pay promptly all taxes and assessments on said property, to keep all business hpuses reasonably insured, and to keep all the real property belonging to said trust estate (except vacant lots) well rented for cash, but not for more than five (5) years in any one term, except property used for hotel or bank business, which may be rented for not exceeding ten (10) years in any one term.</p> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502\">\u201c9. I hereby authorize, empower and direct said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, from time to time within four (4) years from my decease, to expend from my personal property, from the rents and profits of my lands and tenements, and from the proceeds of the sales of such of my real property as hereinafter authorized to be sold, moneys to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) dollars in erecting business houses and making improvements in blocks nine (9), ten (10) and eleven (11) in East Eort Dodge, Iowa, on my lots fronting on Central avenue, once called Market street. The business houses must be of stone or brick, or partly of each, and in other respects the character and style of the buildings and improvements are to be determined, by the trustee and my said three grandchildren, or, if they do not all agree, by the trustee with the written consent of any of my said grandchildren. I direct that these buildings and improvements shall be erected and made as soon as is reasonably practical after my decease, due regard and care being had and taken for the regular payment of the special sums of money and legacies provided for and directed to be paid by this will. But should I, myself, erect buildings and make improvements on said lots in East Eort Dodge, Iowa, the said trustee shall be required to erect buildings and make improvements on said lots only to the amount of the difference between the cost of the buildings erected and the improvements made by me and the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) dollars.</p> <p id=\"b502-6\" pgmap=\"502(19) 503(152)\">\u2018To. I hereby further authorize and empower the said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, with the written consent of my said three grandchildren or any one of them, from time to time within the period of five (5) years next after said improvements in East Fort Dodge, Iowa, to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,-000) dollars, have been made and paid for, to expend from the rents and profits of said trust property and the proceeds of the sales of such portions thereof as are hereinafter authorized to be sold, the further sum of one hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars in erecting such buildings and making such improvements on any of the lands and tenements held in trust under this will as they, or any one of them, may agree upon with the trustee, provided this may be done without delaying the regular payment of the special sums of money and legacies as provided for and directed by this will.</p> <p id=\"b503-5\" pgmap=\"503\">\u201c11. In order to raise money when needed for any improvements herein directed or authorized or other purposes of said trust, I hereby authorize and empower said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, to sell any promissory notes belonging to said trust estate, whether due or not due, at their face value or then present worth, and to transfer any of theni as collateral security.</p> <p id=\"b503-6\" pgmap=\"503(143) 504(23)\">\u201c12. I hereby authorize and empower said trustee, and any trustee for the time being acting under this will, to raise, by mortgage or mortgages, any sum or sums of money which he, with the written consent of at least one of said three grandchildren, shall think necessary or expedient to expend in the erection of buildings, the changing of their style and making new improvements on any real property belonging to said trust estate. But the total amount of such sums of money at any one time shall not exceed fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars, and every such mortgage shall be given only on the real property to be improved, and shall be made to mature at not more than five (5) years from the date. And the property to be thus built upon, changed or improved, and the character and style thereof, are to be determined by said trustee, with the written consent of at least one of my said three grandchildren.</p> <p id=\"b504-5\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201c13. I hereby authorize and empower said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, to sell and convey all my lots in the city of Chicago, Illinois; in El Paso, Wood-ford county, Illinois; in Aurora, Kane county, Illinois; in White Heath, Piatt county, Illinois; in the town of Weldon, DeWitt county, Illinois, and in blocks and lots and what is called the border property in or adjoining the town of Weldon; and also all my lands in Putnam county, Missouri, in Sioux county, Iowa, in Hancock county, Iowa, in Boone county, Iowa; and also all my lands and lots in and adjoining East Eort Dodge, Iowa, except all my lots in blocks nine (9), ten (10), eleven (n), thirteen (13) and twenty (20) in said East Eort Dodge, Iowa. Each and every one of such sales shall be made for one-f\u00f3urth ()4) cash down, and the balance in equal installments in one (1), two (2) and three (3) years, respectively, with interest and mortgage on the property sold.</p> <p id=\"b504-6\" pgmap=\"504\">\u201c14. I do hereby authorize and empower said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, with the written consent of at least one of my said grandchildren, to lay out and plat any of the lands belonging' to said trust estate which may lie in or near any city, town, village or railway station, into blocks and lots and dedicate reasonable parts thereof for streets, alleys and parks, and sell such lots upon the terms and conditions hereinabove stated.</p> <p id=\"b504-7\" pgmap=\"504(85) 505(120)\">\"15. It is my will, and I so direct, that at the time or times within the period of five (5) years next after said improvements in East Eort Dodge, Iowa, to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) dollars have been made and paid for, when said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, may have on hand, from the rents and profits of said trust property and the sales of portions thereof, a surplus of moneys over and above the amount required for the erection of building's and making' improvements as directed or authorized, for the payment of mortgage debts, interest thereon, said annual special sums and annuities, taxes and assessments, for insurance, compensation of trustee, and any other outlays authorized or necessary for the proper administration of said trust estate, he, the said trustee, his successor or successors in trust, shall invest such surplus in lands, improved or unimproved, in DeWitt_ county or McLean county, Illinois, or in Webster county or Hamilton county, Iowa, as in his judgment is or may be for the best interests of said trust estate, and the same shall thereafter be held as part of the principal of said trust estate.</p> <p id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">\u201c16.

But if they are unable to agree as to the amount to be expended in such improvements and repairs, and fail to make what, in the judgment of the trustee for the time being and of those entitled to one-third (y\u00a7) of such net income, would be necessary improvements and repairs to fit the lands and buildings in Illinois and Iowa for rent for fair prices, it is my will, and I so direct, that such trustee shall make, or procure to be made, such improvements and repairs and deduct the same from the rents and profits thereof before making distribution of the annual net income.</p> <p id=\"b506-5\" pgmap=\"506\">\u201c20.

By said clause I mean to direct that upon the death of my said son and all of my grandchildren and great-grandchildren who were living at the time of my death, that all the principal of said trust property shall go to and vest absolutely, free of trust, among my descendants then living, in equal pafts, whatever may be their. respective degrees of relationship, such descendants taking per capita and not per stirpes; that is to say, such distribution shall be when my said son, and when my grandchildren living at the time of my death, and my great-grandchildren living at the time of my death, are all deceased.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b515-6\" pgmap=\"515\">Again on October 9, 1906, the testator executed the third and last codicil, which is in the following words:</p> <p id=\"b515-7\" pgmap=\"515\">\u201cI, Thomas Snell, of the county of DeWitt and State of Illinois, being of sound mind and memory, do hereby make, ordain, publish and declare this as a third codicil to my last will and testament made by me on the 10th day of December, A. D. 1901.</p> <p id=\"b515-8\" pgmap=\"515\">\u201cI hereby modify the first clause to the first codicil of my said last will and testament in this: I hereby will and bequeath to my great-niece, Mab'elle Snell, the daughter of my nephew, Thomas Snell, annually, so long as she may live, the sum of twelve hundred ($1200) dollars in lieu of the six hundred ($600) dollars which I willed and bequeathed to her in the said first clause of the first codicil to my said last will and testament.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b515-9\" pgmap=\"515(29) 516(238)\">First\u2014Appellant contends that the court had no jurisdiction of the person of Harry W. Snel^ and that the court erred in overruling his plea to the jurisdiction. It was held by this court on the former hearing that Harry W. Snell was a necessary party to the bill. After the remanding order had been filed in the circuit court, but before the notice had been served that the cause would be re-instated for trial, appellee gave notice of his intention to apply to a judge of the circuit court, in vacation, for leave to amend the bill by making Harry W. Snell a party defendant. Leave was obtained and this defendant was brought in by summons before the case was re-instated for trial and before the ten-day notice required by section 113 of the Practice act was served. The infant defendant thus brought into court, by his guardian ad litem filed a plea setting up that he was born on December 31, 1907, and that the appellee was duly notified of his birth within one week thereafter; that he was a necessary party to said bill, but that no steps were taken by appellee to make him a party to said bill until April 22, 1909, when he was made a party as above stated. The circuit court held this plea was insufficient, and thereupon the guardian ad litem filed an answer for the infant defendant. More than a year having elapsed before Harry W. Snell was made a party, appellant contends that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the bill.</p> <p id=\"b516-4\" pgmap=\"516(135) 517(197)\">There was no irregularity in the manner of making Harry W. Snell a party. The statute authorizes amendments to pleadings, upon notice, in vacation. After the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded and the remanding order filed in the circuit court the cause was then pending in that court, and the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the cause but could not properly proceed to the trial of- it until the ten-day notice required by the Practice act was given to the opposite party. (Austin v. Dufour, 110 Ill. 85.) The situation of the cause at that time was similar to a case pending in the court before service of the defendant. Where a person files a declaration at law or a bill in chancery the court thereby acquires jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person bringing the suit. While the case is in this condition, and before the defendants are served or otherwise brought within the jurisdiction of the court, there is no doubt of the power of the court to permit amendments to the plaintiff's pleadings, and we see no reason why the same rule would not apply to a catise after it has been remanded by an appellate tribunal. When a cause is reversed and remanded for a re-trial it is the duty of the court to allow such amendments as will obviate errors pointed out by this court. (Dinsmoor v. Rowse, 211 Ill. 317.) The original bill was filed within the time required by the statute, and all persons then in being who had any interest in the subject matter of the suit were made parties. The amendment of the bill making a new party one who came into being after the commencement of the suit was not the commencement of the suit, hence the plea to the jurisdiction of the court setting up these facts presented no defense and was properly overruled.</p> <p id=\"b517-5\" pgmap=\"517\">The language of this court in Austin v. Dufour, supra, which is relied on by appellant as sustaining the contention that any order made by the trial court prior to the giving of the ten-day notice and the entry of the order re-instating the cause was void, has no reference to an ex parte order for leave to make a formal amendment, which is granted as a fnatter of course, and upon which the opposite party could not assign error even if he were in court and objecting to the entry of such order.</p> <p id=\"b517-6\" pgmap=\"517(78) 518(253)\">Second\u25a0\u2014-When this case was before this court on the former hearing we had occasion to consider the evidence then in the record bearing upon the question whether the \u25a0will was shown ,to have resulted from the undue influence of Mabelle Snell, and the conclusion was reached that the evidence wholly failed to establish that charge. The question of general mental capacity of the testator was also considered in the light of the evidence then in the record, and our conclusion was, in respect to this issue, that the evidence would not support a decree setting aside the will on that ground. The question of the existence of an insane delusion in the mind of the testator in regard to his son, Richard Snell, was not considered or discussed by this court at that time. On page 294 of the opinion then rendered, upon the question of the existence of an insane delusion, this court said: \u201cUnless the testator\u2019s conduct proved the 'existence of an insane delusion it would be no reason for setting aside the will. Injustice, unfairness, prejudice or anger, without a reasonable cause, does not disqualify any person from making a valid will. Since the cause is to be remanded for a new trial we express no opinion as to the weight of the evidence on the question of the existence in the testator\u2019s mind of an insane delusion with reference to his son.\u201d The evidence in regard to undue influence and general want of testamentary capacity is not materially different in the present record from that contained in the former. Therefore we do not deem it necessary to reconsider those questions, since no different conclusion could be drawn from the present record. The general verdict of the jury finding the instruments in question were not the last will and testament of the testator includes a finding for contestant upon all the issues presented by the pleadings and submitted to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b518-6\" pgmap=\"518\">The special findings in the present record are limited to the question of an insane delusion. The bill being predicated upon three distinct grounds, any one of which, if sustained, entitles the contestant to a decree setting aside the will, it is not necessary that the evidence should sustain all of the charges in the bill. If there was either want of general testamentary capacity or wrongful and undue influence shown or an insane delusion established by the testimony, appellee would be entitled to a decree notwithstanding the \u25a0 evidence might be wholly insufficient to establish the other charges in the bill.</p> <p id=\"b519-4\" pgmap=\"519\">In considering the charge of undue influence on the former hearing, in connection with the request to instruct the jury that there was no evidence upon which a finding could rest as to that issue, we concluded our discussion on that question by the statement that the instruction should have been given and that the court erred in refusing to give the same. There was at that time no specific finding that testator was laboring under an insane delusion, and the finding upon that question was necessarily included in the general verdict. There were, however, specific findings that the testator did not have testamentary capacity and that the will was the result of undue influence exercised over the testator. The bill being drawn with a triple aspect, if either ground is established the decree setting aside the will should be affirmed. 3 Ency. of Pl &amp; Pr. p. 365; Story\u2019s Eq. PL sec. 254; Robinson v. Robinson, 73 Mo. 170; Shipman v. Furniss, 69 Ala. 555; McConnell v. McConnell, 11 Vt. 290.</p> <p id=\"b519-5\" pgmap=\"519\">The decree in this case must necessarily rest upon the existence of an insane delusion in the testator in respect to appellee. An insane delusion which will render one incapable of making a will is difficult to define with exact precision. In its simplest form, a delusion may be said to be a belief in a state or condition of things in the existence of which no rational person would believe. (Schneider v. Manning, 121 Ill. 376.) If, without evidence of any kind, a testator imagines or conceives something .to exist which does not exist in fact, and which no rational person would, in the absence of evidence, believe to exist, he is afflicted with an insane delusion. (Middleditch v. Williams, 45 N. J. Eq. 726; 4 L. R. A. 738.) A person who believes supposed facts which have no existence except in his perverted imagination and which are against all evidence and probability, and conducts himself, however logically, upon the assumption of their existence, is under an insane delusion. In re White, 212 N. Y. 406.</p> <p id=\"b520-4\" pgmap=\"520\">In analyzing the legal conception of an insane delusion it is necessary to keep in mind that the ultimate and essential thing to be established is that the testator had, at the time the will or instrument was executed, such an aberration as indicates an unsound or deranged condition of the mental faculties, as distinguished from the mere belief in- the existence or non-existence of certain supposed facts based upon some sort of evidence. A belief which results from a process of reasoning from evidence, however imperfect the process may be or illogical the conclusion, is not an insane delusion. If, under the facts shown, the court is able to see how a rational person might have believed all that the testator believed and still be in the possession of all his senses, an insane delusion is not established. Where a testator has some actual grounds for the belief which he has, though regarded by others as wholly insufficient, the mere misapprehension of the facts or unreasonable and extravagant conclusions drawn therefrom do not establish the existence of such a delusion as will invalidate his will. Stackhouse v. Horton, 15 N. J. Eq. 202; Martin v. Thayer, 37 W. Va. 38; Wait v. Westfall, 161 Ind. 648; 68 N. E. Rep. 271; Owen v. Crumbaugh, 228 Ill. 380.</p> <p id=\"b520-5\" pgmap=\"520(120) 521(21)\">The establishment of an insane delusion involves proof that the testator in this case believed certain things concerning his son which did not exist; that he had no evidence on which to base such belief; that the things which he believed were false and were adhered to by the testator after their falsity had been shown by reasonable evidence; that the things which the testator believed were such things as no person of sound mind would believe; that the testator refused to yield or give up such irrational belief in the face of such reasonable evidence as would convince an ordinarily sound and healthy mind; and lastly, that the existence of such delusion was present in the mind of the testator and exercised a controlling influence over him at the time the will was executed.</p> <p id=\"b521-5\" pgmap=\"521(332) 522(374) 523(130)\">The evidence bearing upon the several elements of an insane delusion in this record is very voluminous. It would not be practicable to discuss it in detail without extending this opinion to an unreasonable length. The evidence establishes the fact that prior to the year 1896 the testator regarded Richard Snell with paternal confidence and affection. He trusted him to manage large landed interests in the State of Iowa, and frequently used expressions showing his appreciation of the ability and integrity which the appellee had exhibited in managing his father\u2019s important affairs. If prior to this time the testator had ever used any harsh words in regard to appellee, it is clear that such expressions were the outbursts of temporary anger and did mot indicate any fixed or settled belief in the testator\u2019s mind that the appellee possessed such character as might have been implied from such heated expressions. It is clearly shown that the testator was of a nervous and excitable temperament. Prior to 1896 the testator had another son, Thornton Snell, to whom he was very much attached. Thornton Snell was connected with a bank in Bloomington in which the testator was interested as a stockholder. In 1896 the testator was suddenly called to Bloomington on account of the serious illness of his son Thornton. He went immediately. Upon arriving at the station he was informed that his son was dead. Thornton had died very suddenly, having taken sick at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon and died at six that evening. The news of the sudden death of Thornton was a great shock to the father. He fell prostrate upon the platform and became almost a maniac with grief. He screamed and beat the platform with his artns and refused to be taken to Thornton\u2019s home. He was apparently in a dazed condition for some time after the death of his son. Some days after Thornton\u2019s death the testator said, while weeping over his son\u2019s death, that he had lain there in the house for a day and a half before his death with no one to talk to him. He was greatly troubled and depressed in spirit and spoke of being blue, and said that all of the boys were now gone. The evidences of a mental break-down began to manifest themselves soon after the death of Thornton. He sent for his son Richard to come from Kansas City to Clinton to become president of the DeWitt County National Bank. He gave him fifty shares of his stock in the bank and assured persons interested that Richard would prove to be a success in the bank. He said that he was the best boy he ever had; that he had made him more money than any of his boys, and that he would make a first-class president of the bank. The intimate friends and associates of the testator testified to the marked change that they soon discovered in the manner and disposition of the testator. He grew melancholy and seemed to shun the company of his old friends. He became careless and indifferent about his dress. He muttered to himself almost constantly and was frequently heard talking to himself after Thornton\u2019s death. He wandered aimlessly about the public square in Clinton and would sit for hours talking to himself in front of the bank. He would walk the streets with his shoes unlaced, sometimes without a coat and with the balance of his clothing improperly adjusted. He would pray at times' and in a few moments afterward would be cursing. Before the death of Thornton he was a man who joked a great deal, but afterwards this spirit gave way and he became cross and morose. All of these conditions grew gradually worse from the time of his son Thornton\u2019s death until the testator died. He became quarrelsome and hard to get along with. He was very irritable, and would fall out and quarrel with his most intimate friends and want to fight over matters of the most insignificant nature. He would get up from his bed in the night time and walk the floor, sometimes singing, some-' times crying, sometimes praying and sometimes cursing. These manifestations were very marked in the years 1900, 1901 and 1902, when the testator lived at the home of Mrs. Thornton Snell. He had a habit of writing letters and talking to himself while writing, and would sit on the floor and read letters and chuckle over them as a child Would over its playthings. He would go out and sleep on the ground, without his shoes or coat on, by the side of the pavement, where people were constantly passing. At one time he bought some medicine from Dr. Meyers and afterwards complained that the medicine had done him no good, and upon examination the medicine was found in his pocket, no part of which had ever been taken by him.</p> <p id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">The evidence shows beyond controversy that Richard Snell never mistreated his father; that he bore patiently the unrelenting and offensive abuse which the testator heaped upon him, and on one occasion when the testator, without any cause, assaulted the appellee in the bank, he mildly asked his father not to make so much noise in the bank. The evidence further shows that the appellee has always sustained an unimpeachable character for honesty and integrity in the . community where he has always been known; that appellee has never been suspected of any dishonorable conduct toward his father or any other person; that he is a lawyer by profession and enjoys the confidence and respect of the members of his profession.</p> <p id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523(102) 524(247)\">After the death of Thornton Snell, Richard was the only surviving child of the testator. His wife died in 1875. Ordinarily and in the usual and natural order of things we would expect to see this father clinging closer to the last survivor of his family in the declining years of his life than would be expected had his wife and other children lived to share his love and devotion. But the evidence shows quite the contrary. About the year 1899, without any cause so far as the evidence shows, the testator\u2019s feelings for his only son underwent a marked and unnatural change. He was seized and dominated by an unreasoning and unnatural hatred toward his son. So far as the evidence shows, after this morbid feeling of antipathy fastened itself upon the mind of the testator it never thereafter relinquished its grasp upon him,, even for one single moment. He seems never to have spoken another kind word to or of his son. While the fire of his unnatural hatred was not always in a state of eruption, it is certain that it was always smouldering, ready to break out at the slightest provocation. At all times and under all circumstances, in public and private places and in the presence of all classes of people, whenever the testator had occasion to refer to appellee he heaped upon him the vilest epithets known to the English language. To repeat any considerable portion of the language employed by the testator in reference to appellee, as repeated by the witnesses, would serve no good purpose. Suffice it to say that he repeatedly and habitually called appellee a g-d-s-of a b-, a bastard, a thief and a robber, almost as often as his name was mentioned in his presence. He threatened to kill appellee, and said he had robbed him. Sometimes he would say appellee had stolen $10,000 from him; at other times, $20,000; at other times, $40,000, $150,000, and sometimes he would mention $500,000 as the amount that appellee had cost him.</p> <p id=\"b524-8\" pgmap=\"524(117) 525(352)\">These expressions were used by the testator so frequently and so persistently that it is impossible to account for them upon any theory consistent with the soundness and sanity of the testator. It is not a case of an excitable old man getting angry and giving vent to his feelings by the unrestrained abuse of another and afterwards regaining his equilibrium so as to take a rational view of the matter, but it is rather the case of one who is laboring under a mental disorder which, without any apparent reason, produced in his mind a fixed and unreasonable belief that his only son was one of the vilest of men. This belief. came upon the testator without any reason and remained in spite of the most conclusive proofs that it was groundless. On one occasion, in Judge Hill\u2019s office, the testator asserted that the appellee had stolen two $1000 notes of his and that he was going down to the bank to kill him. Judge Hill reasoned with him and told him that he did not believe that Dick had stolen the notes, but he persisted in making the accusation and the threat that he was going to kill the appellee. While this conversation was going on, Argo, who was the confidential agent of the testator, came in and exhibited to the testator the identical notes which he said appellee had stolen. Notwithstanding this demonstration the testator persisted in accusing appellee of stealing and called him vile names, and started off, saying that he was going down to the bank to kill him. The testator was reasoned with by various persons in regard to the charges that he was continually making against appellee, but it had no effect on the testator\u2019s mind. On one occasion in the year 1900 a Methodist minister called upon the testator concerning religious matters and the importance of making his peace with his Maker, and in the course of conversation he mentioned the appellee\u2019s name. The testator immediately flew into a fit of anger and commenced swearing and calling appellee vile names. Nothing that the minister could say had any effect upon him. When the testator had used vile and profane language concerning appellee to Dr. Meyers, the doctor pointed out to him that appellee sustained a first-class reputation apd enjoyed the confidence of his neighbors, but it made no impression on the mind of the testator. He persisted in asserting to Dr. Meyers that appellee had stolen $200,000 of his money. There are many other instances in the record of a similar character, which show conclusively that the delusion which had fastened itself upon the mind of the testator would not yield to any evidence that might be presented to him.</p> <p id=\"b526-2\" pgmap=\"526\">\u2022 Under these facts, and many others not herein stated, of the same general character, the jury has found that the testator was laboring under an insane delusion in regard to appellee, who is the natural beneficiary of the testator\u2019s bounty and his only living child. We cannot say that this finding is not well supported by the evidence. Did the existence of such delusion influence the testator in making the will and codicils thereto?</p> <p id=\"b526-3\" pgmap=\"526\">By reference to the provisions of the will it will be seen that, by the original will appellee was given $1000 per annum during his natural life. In view of the amount of the, testator\u2019s estate it must strike the mind of any reasonable person as very unusual and extraordinary that a man with an estate worth approximately a million and a half dollars would make a will' and give his only son $1000 per annum during his life. The annual income of the testator\u2019s estate was between $40,000 and $50,000. If the testator had conceived some charitable purpose which he was anxious to promote, and his anxiety and solicitude for some cherished object of that sort had led him to devise the bulk of his estate for such purpose, it might be said that the testator preferred the promotion of such cher- ' ished object of his life to bestowing his estate upon his natural beneficiaries. But there is nothing of that kind present here. There is no rational theory apparent upon this record why appellee should have been virtually disinherited except the explanation afforded' by the delusion which the testator had in regard to him. Afterwards, when the unnatural hatred of the testator for appellee had progressed further, he added a codicil to the will reducing appellee\u2019s annuity to $50.</p> <p id=\"b526-4\" pgmap=\"526(47) 527(65)\">While it is true, as said by this court in the former opinion in this case, that \u201cinjustice, unfairness, prejudice or anger without a reasonable cause does not disqualify any person from making a valid will,\u201d still, where these manifestations habitually appear in respect to the same subject without any reason and are adhered to after their falsity is demonstrated, they become strong and satisfactory evidence of a mental derangement, and evidence of their existence, without any cause, in respect to one so nearly related as to be naturally entitled to the testator\u2019s bounty is entitled to greater weight than it would be if the parties were not so closely related.</p> <p id=\"b527-5\" pgmap=\"527\">The books afford many parallel cases where wills and deeds have been set aside because of an insane delusion, the manifestations of which were similar to those in the case at bar. Thus, in Barbo v. Rider, 67 Wis. 602, the court says: \u201cNo argument is required to prove that such a change in the nature and conduct of Barbo, such unreasonable and unfounded hallucinations respecting the chastity of his wife, and his causeless hostility to' his family, which yield to no reason or persuasion, are sufficient evidence that he is the unfortunate victim of insane delusions.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b527-6\" pgmap=\"527\">In Broughton v. Knight, 3 L. R. (P. &amp; D.) 75, it is said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that fathers and mothers take unduly harsh views of the character of their children, sons especially. That is not unknown. But there is a limit beyond which one feels that it ceases to be a question of harsh, unreasonable judgment of character, and that the repulsion which a parent exhibits toward one or more of his children must proceed from some mental defect in himself. * * * I-say there is a point at which such repulsion and aversion are themselves evidence of unsoundness of mind.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b527-8\" pgmap=\"527(72) 528(101)\">In the case of Ballantine v. Proudfoot, 62 Wis. 216, the court says: \u201cShe carried her dislike to that extent that she did not wish her daughter to see her while alive. In view of these incontestable facts we must consider her insane and incapable of making a will, notwithstanding she may have a sound mind in other respects. * * * It is rare that a mother, without the greatest provocation, entertains such an aversion to a daughter that she refuses to see her in her last illness; and yet but a few hours before she died Mrs. Stewart was asked if her daughter should not be sent for, and she replied she did not wish to see her daughter; that the Proudfoots might come and look upon her after she was dead. Such unnatural feelings are so contrary to human nature that we are inclined to account for them on the ground that the mother at the time was not herself but was laboring under some mental disorder.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b528-3\" pgmap=\"528\">In Hardenburg v. Hardenburg, 133 Iowa, 1, the Supreme Court of that State used the following language: \u201cFrom a careful examination of the evidence we are fully satisfied that these delusions were insane in nature and quality. At the time of .the contest the daughters were women of high standing and respectability in the community where they resided. There had been nothing in their conduct, either in their private life or in public, indicating that they were not women of the severest virtue, and yet the charges of unchastity were frequently made against them. It is true, the charges were not made to the public but were confined to the members of his own family, and oftentimes made direct to the persons accused.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b528-4\" pgmap=\"528\">Since every case of this character is to be determined from its own facts, the multiplication of parallel cases would serve no useful purpose. Our conclusion from a careful consideration of all of the evidence in this record is, that the testator was the victim of some mental disorder which was manifested by his unreasonable and unfounded hatred of his son, and that this mental disease affords the only reasonable explanation of the character of the will in question, and that the decree of the court setting aside the will is sustainable, under the evidence, on the ground that the testator was disqualified, by reason of such delusion, from maJfcfog a valid will.</p> <p id=\"b529-4\" pgmap=\"529\">Third\u2014Appellant contends that the court erred in giving instructions Nos. i to 6, inclusive, for appellee. The same objection is made to instructions I, 3 and 4, and they may be considered together. These instructions told the jury that if the testator was laboring under an insane delusion upon \u201csubjects connected with the testamentary disposition of his property and the natural objects of his bounty when he made the will,\u201d he was not of sound mind and memory and that the jury should find against the will. The objection pointed out to these instructions is, that there was no charge in the bill that the testator had an insane delusion upon \u201csubjects connected with the testamentary disposition of his property\u201d and that no evidence on that question was submitted to the jury. These same instructions were given on the former trial, the record of which was reviewed by this court, and they were then objected to by appellant The giving of erroneous instructions was not among the reasons given for the reversal of the former decree. Since the case had to be reversed and remanded for another trial, if any serious objection had been pointed out to the instructions this court would have noticed them for the guidance of the court on the re-trial of the case. The fact that none of the objections were discussed may not amount to an express approval of them, yet it is at least fairly to be implied that the court did not regard the objections as sufficiently serious to require a reversal of the decree.</p> <p id=\"b529-5\" pgmap=\"529(88) 530(255)\">But conceding that appellant is entitled to again urge these objections, there are no just grounds of complaint against either of the three instructions now under consideration. The bill charged that the testator was of unsound mind and memory. The answer denied this charge, and this made the issue. The bill went further and charged that the testator had an insane delusion in regard to his son. This was merely an amplification of the main charge that the testator was of unsound mind and memory or a pleading of evidentiary facts. It was not necessary to set out the particular manner in which such unsoundness of mind manifested -itself, and if the pleader should allege some of the evidentiary facts bearing upon the main issue he would not be precluded from introducing other evidence of mental unsoundness. In American Bible Society v. Price, 115 Ill. 623, this court said (p. 635): \u201cThe instructions given at the instance of the proponents are claimed to be erroneous because insane delusion in respect of the contestant [testator] is not specifically charged in the bill.. It is contended that the jury are directed by these instructions to find a verdict upon an issue not made by the bill and answer. The bill, it has been seen, charges that the testator had become, and was at the time of the making of the will, of unsound mind and memory,' thus, in effect, simply putting in issue his testamentary capacity, which by our statute is defined to be that of being of a prescribed age and \u2018of sound mind and memory.\u2019 The only material question, manifestly, under this allegation, was whether the writing produced was the product of an unsound mind and memory. The specific name applied to describe that unsoundness, the means whereby the unsoundness was caused, or how it came about that the unsound mind and memory caused this writing to be drawn and signed, were matters of evidence that need not be alleged, and \u2022 if alleged need not be proved.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">A further reason why appellant\u2019s objections to these instructions are not tenable is, that the objections are based on a misapprehension as to the true meaning of the instructions. The words \u201csubjects connected with the testamentary disposition of his property,\u201d when read in connection with the context of the instructions, means any person, matter or thing connected with the testamentary disposition of his property, and includes the persons to whom devises are made as well as the things devised. There was no error in the giving of these instructions.</p> <p id=\"b531-4\" pgmap=\"531\">Appellant finds fault with instruction No. 2 given for the appellee. That instruction relates to that phase of the evidence concerning the legitimacy of appellee, and tells the jury that if the testator doubted and denied his paternity of the contestant, and that his belief, if any, upon this subject was based upon some delusive idea or ideas without any evidence of its truth but which existed only in his imagination, and that such belief was without cause or reason and false in fact and led the testator to make a will and codicils which he would not otherwise have made, then in that event the jury would be warranted in finding that the testator did not know who were the natural objects of his bounty, and that he was of unsound mind and memory. The only objection pointed out to this instruction is, that the weight of the evidence shows that the testator did know who were the natural beneficiaries of his bounty. 0 Our attention is called, in this connection, to the fact that appellee is several times mentioned in the will as the son of the testator. There were two theories on this point presented by the evidence: that of appellee that the testator had uniformly for several years, both before and after the making of the will, spoken of appellee as a bastard; the other theory was that the testator recognized appellee as his son. The evidence was conflicting,\u2014at least to the extent that in the will appellee is referred to as the testator\u2019s son. Appellee was entitled to present his theory of this evidence to the jury by the instruction, and the mere fact that appellant may contend that the facts are not as stated 'hypothetically in the instruction is no objection to the instruction so long as it is based upon the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531(46) 532(41)\">Instruction No. 5 is objected to because it authorizes the jury to consider the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the bequests in determining whether the testator was of sound mind and memory. Under the situation presented by the evidence in this case the apparent inequality or unreasonableness o-f the disposition made of this vast estate was proper to be considered, in connection with the other evidence, on the question of testamentary capacity. Kimball v. Cuddy, 117 Ill. 213; Schneider v. Manning, supra, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b532-5\" pgmap=\"532\">Appellant also criticises instruction No. 6 given for appellee. That instruction is not. open to the criticism made against it. The observations already made in disposing of the objection to instruction No. 2 will answer appellant\u2019s objection to this instruction.</p> <p id=\"b532-6\" pgmap=\"532\">Appellant also complains of the refusal of three instructions requested by him. There was no error in refusing these instructions. The law applicable to appellant\u2019s theory of the case was fully covered by the instructions given on his behalf. We have no doubt that the jury were fully and fairly instructed upon all the rules of law applicable to the issues involved.</p> <p id=\"b532-7\" pgmap=\"532(179) 533(31)\">Foiwth\u2014The appellant makes numerous complaints respecting the rulings of the court upon the admission and exclusion of evidence. On the former hearing of this cause numerous errors were assigned upon the rulings of the court upon the evidence, and they were discussed and decided and the rules to be applied were stated. Without going into a discussion, in detail, of appellant\u2019s several objections, we find upon examination that the trial court followed our former opinion in this regard. True, appellant now raises some points not then involved, but we do not think there was any serious error committed in the .rulings upon them. The trial of this case occupied the time of the circuit court for two weeks, during which about one hundred and twenty-five witnesses were examined. It would be remarkable if during such a trial, involving many objections to the testimony, there were not some errors committed. We do not, however,' find any which are of a serious character. Appellant makes some objections to the hypothetical questions put to the expert witnesses and also complains of certain remarks made by counsel for appellee in their argument to the jury. These objections are trivial and do not affect the substantial merits of the case.</p> <p id=\"b533-5\" pgmap=\"533\">The case appears, on the whole, to have been tried with great care by the court. It has been twice tried by the jury and in both instances the finding was against the will. In our opinion it is time that this litigation should come to an end. We find no error of such magnitude as to require us to reverse the decree. It is therefore affirmed. ,X J</p> <p id=\"b533-6\" pgmap=\"533\">,X J Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b533-8\" pgmap=\"533\">Cartwright, Hand and Dunn, JJ.,</author> <p id=\"ACG\" pgmap=\"533\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b533-9\" pgmap=\"533(260) 534(140)\">The appeal removed the cause to this court and deprived the circuit court and the judge thereof of jurisdiction in the cause and of power to make any order or take any step in the litigation until the cause should be reinstated in that court. Section 113 of the Practice act provides the method of re-investing trial courts with jurisdiction of a cause after a reversal and remandment, and questions as to what may be done in a suit before service of summons have no relation to the power of the court or judge to proceed in such a case. Section 113 provides, that upon a transcript of the order of the Supreme Court remanding the cause being filed in the court in which the cause was originally tried, and not less than ten days\u2019 notice thereof given to the adverse party or his attorney, the cause shall be re-instated therein. That language can mean nothing else than that the cause is re-established in the court from which it was removed only by filing the transcript and giving the notice. Until the cause is so reinstated it cannot, in our opinion, be said to be pending - in the trial court and any order in the cause would be void for want of jurisdiction. That is the effect of the decision in Austin v. Dufour, 110 Ill 85, and no distinction was there made between the order permitting an amendment and the proceedings in term time. Of course, if a suit is not re-instated in a court so as to give jurisdiction in term time, there can be no power in the judge to malee an order in vacation. The question in this case is whether the circuit court obtained jurisdiction of the minor by the vacation order, and if it did not, the want of jurisdiction could not be waived by the minor or his guardian ad litem. The fact that an objection to the amendment could not have been successfully interposed in a court or before a judge having jurisdiction affords no aid in deciding whether there was jurisdiction to make any order in the case. We think the judge had no jurisdiction to make the order until the cause was re-instated, and therefore the court had no jurisdiction of the infant, who was a necessary party.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
