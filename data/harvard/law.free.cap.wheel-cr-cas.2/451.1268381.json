He said the murder was committed on the high seas, in 1818. The brig Holkar sailed from the port of N. Y. in Oct. 1818, under Captain Brown, and a coloured crew, with the exception of one man. The brig sailed for Curacoa, and reached the port of her destination. She took in a return cargo ; and while on the high seas, the crew rose, mutinied, and murdered Captain Brown, the mate of the vessel, and a Captain Humphreys, who was a passenger on board.

(Haines objected to the competency of the witness, on the ground that he had been in the State Prison. It appeared that he had been indicted for grand larceny, and convicted on the 7th of October, -1819, when he was sentenced to the State Prison for three years, and had served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>his time out. The counsel for the prosecution replied, and produced a pardon from the governor, dated the 9th of April 1824. (See the judge's charge.) The objection was overruled by the court, and the examination proceeded.)- Witness shipped on board the brig Hollcar, in 1818, commanded by Samuel Brown. He shipped with Alexander Oheevers (or Shivers,) Charles Moutiza, Patrick .Butler, (his right name was Harry Cook, called Cook or Doctor,) James Irving, John Eobinson, (the prisoner) .John Williams, (white man) and himself and mate. They were all coloured people except John Williams. Sailed on the morning of Sunday for Ouraeoa, where they arrived and discharged, and took in,a return cargo, and started for Hew York. At Ouraeoa, Shivers had a dispute with the Captain. Captain Humphries, a passenger, took charge of the vessel; the captain and mate being sick, the men refused to work under him, when they were put in prison, except Eobinson, Jones, and the cook, but Eobinson was afterwards taken up for stealing part of a barrel of beef from the vessel, and remained in prison till the brig sailed. The night before, Alexander Oheevers, and Charles and James ran away but were taken up and carried on board, the morning she sailed. John Williams was left at Ouraeoa, where he went in a Dutch man of war. Capt. Humphries came passenger in the brig, but used to do Captain\u2019s duty sometimes. When they had been out seven or eight days, the captain sent them up to bend another topsail about dusk; John, James, Charles, Alexander, and witness. They had some dispute aloft, and being reproved, they made some answer which induced the captain to go down and load his pistols. James and Charles pretended to be sick, and went below and staid in their berths. The captain made tea and coffee, and sent to them from the cabin. Charles was sick at this time. Charles and James and witness were in the captain\u2019s watch. The prisoner and Alexander Shivers were id the mate\u2019s watch. The witness was in his berth and nearly asleep, when Alexander came down and asked Charles whether he was ready, Charles said \u201c yes. \u201d Witness asked what they were going to do <em>1 </em>Charles answered none of your business. Eobinson said he was going to call the mate forward and tell him there was something wrong there. Charles then told witness that they were going to kill the captain, the mate and the passenger. Eobinson (the prisoner) went and called the mate forward. He came forward, and Charles and James jumped out of the forecastle; Charles and James with a crowbar, and James with a hand-spike. Witness then heard somebody strike, and heard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>mate cry out \u201c Murder !\u201d and stamp on the deck ; witness was below; when witness got upon deck, the mate was fallen. Witness cried out, <em>\u201c </em>For G-od\u2019s sake, what are you doing!\u201d Charles then answered, \u201c You son of a\u2019bitch, if you say a word, I will knock your brains out.\u201d Alexander took Ms (the mate\u2019s) watch out of his pocket, and Charles, Alexander and James hove him overboard. They then went aft, and witness followed them. The prisoner said he would call captain Humphries up, for ho used to do captain\u2019s duty. He went down, but captain H. would not get up. He then went down and told captain Brown the mate wanted him forward. Captain B. got up, and went forward as far as the windlass, when he started back, and all at once began to walk aft. Charles ran out from behind the camboose, and struck at him with a crowbar, which the captain caught in his hand, exclaiming, \u201c Charles is that you ?\u201d Charles said <em>\u201c </em>Yes.\u201d Alexander Oheevers now ran around the longboat and struck him twice on the head with a hatchet. James then took the handspike and struck him over the face: the prisoner then came with \u00e1 harpoon, struck the captain in the left side. His head was lying towards the starboard. The Captain put his hand upon his breast, and then they picked him up and threw him overboard, and told witness to take the helm. At the time the mate was killed, the prisoner had the helm ; and while they were killing the captain, the witness had the helm, but part of the time left it to see the fray. This done, Charles said, let us go down now and kill that damned privateer son of a hitch Captain Humphries; upon which all wont down into the cabin, and told witness to keep the helm. Witness heard Capt. Humphries crying murder for some time; and then all four .came up from the cabin, bringing Captain Humphries with them, and laid him down ; and then hove him overboard. The cook .came up after they had thrown Captain Humphries overboard. They told him to go down and clear up the blood in the cabin; he went and got a bucket of water and did it. They said Captain Humphries was getting the captain's pistols out, when they struck at him, and broke one of thorn- in his hand. Alexander Shivers took charge of the brig. They then ran near Porto Rico, to the Mona Passage, and from thence to St. Domingo. Prisoner then bored holes in the brig to scuttle her, and they intended to go ashore in the boat. About two o'clock in the afternoon, a vessel was near them, and they were frightened, and took out the boat, and put aboard some provisions .and clothing, and they all got in, except the witness, who at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>first refused to go, until Charles took a pistol and threatened to shoot him if he did not. They went ashore about Jaequemel. After the murder, they found on board a box of gold, buckles, &amp;c. : They also found 115 dollars, and a masonic apron, which was thrown overboard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdQR\">Cross-examined.\u2014Witness was horn in Orange county; his mother belonged to Bonj.

He went by the name of John Robinson ; never heard him called Jones ; came back in schooner, called the American, of Kennebeck\u2014 When they landed at St. Domingo, they went to Bennet, a town inhabited by blacks. Witness said nothing to any body about the murder, as he was afraid. They got one hundred and fifteen dollars, of which they gave witness 12 or 15. From Ben-net they went to Jaequemel, where he walked. Alexander went' up first, when they were all sent for by the pommandant, but did nob go then. Witness went on board the barque J&amp;riepica, of Kennebeck, and went to the Havana ; said nothing of it to the captain, as he was afraid 'of being tried in Havana, Saw the mate of the George Washington, (whom he had seen at Curacoa) and told\"\"him all about it; wanted fitness to go to Africa with them for slaves.

It is for you to say whether he is guilty or not guilty. The material point in this case is, whe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ther the prisoner at the bai- is the person who shipped on |10\u201eu.c] fjolkar, in 1818, as sworn to by David Valentine, Oliver King, Peter Willis and Mr: Bogart,</p>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">The offence as charged in the indictment, if committed at all, is an aggravated piratical murder. It took place upon the high seas, and is therefore within the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">It satisfactorily appears by the evidence, that the Holkar cleared for Cnraco\u00e1 in October, 1818. There can be no doubt of this fact: indeed, it is not denied.- It appears also that the vessel was commanded by Captain Brown ; 'that her crew, with the exception of one person, was composed of coloured people. This appears by the testimony of Diana, King, Willis, Mr. Bogart and Mr. Conklin, ' It Appears by the register of the ship and Kotariallist of Mr. Bogart, (\u2019which -agree with each other) that Alexander Cheevers, Charles Montiza, Patrick Butler, (called Cook) James Irving, Charles Robinson, (the prisoner,) King, the witness, and the mate were the crew of the vessel. The vessel sailed for Curacoa, since which time nothing has been heard of her. The insurances upon the Holkar, and her cargo have long since been paid. There is no doubt therefore the vessel has been lost, whether in the manner \u25a0related by King, or not, remains for you to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Before his honour recapitulated King\u2019s testimony, he \"called th\u2019e attention of the jury to the infamy of his character. It appears (said he) by the record of the General .Sessions that King has been convicted of a larceny, and \u2022has been sentenced to the state prison-\u2014has served out his time, and has received a pardon from the Executive Of -the estate, for the' purpose of- making him a witness against -the prisoner\u2014all since the commission of the ah<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>leged murder. His honour observed; he had no doubt of the efficacy of the pardon, and that he was now a competent witness; his credibility, however, Was still a subject for the consideration of the jury. The law haS made him a competent witness; but the jury were not compelled to believe him, and he should advise the jury to give no weight to his testimony where he was not corroborated by others. He averted to the examination of King, made on the 3d of June, 1819, immediately on his arrival in this country. The objection then to his credibility did not exist. That examination, and his testimony here to day, appear to agree in all essential particulars'; and it appears by justice Hopson, that it was not possible for him to have had access to that p\u00e1'per.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">His honour instructed the jury, that the testimony of King ought to have no - weight in their minds, unless corroborated by others, or by the circumstances of the case \u2014arid proceeded to detail the principal facts of the loss of the vessel, and the murder of Captain Brown, the mate, and Captain Humphries, as related by King, (see his testimony.) He remarked upon the consistency of King\u2019s story\u2014the minute history of the circumstances he had given\u2014the difficulty, not to say impossibility of King\u2019s framing such a connected chain of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It could not have escaped the jury (said his honour) that the case depended materially upon the circumstam ces. Before hs enumerated them; he remarked upon the nature of circumstantial evidence. A number of cases \u25a0have been cited and read, to show you the dangerous tendency of this kind of proof. It is possible an innocent person may have suffered, but such cases, (if any \u2018such there were;) could be no objection to this kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>evidence ; if jurors were to disregard it, there would be an end to the administration of law, and to government. It was (he observed) the duty of the jury to weigh all the evidence for and against \"the prisoner, and that fair and legal inferences were to be made from facts and circumstances proved\u2014they were often more satisfactory and conclusive than the testimony of witnesses.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Then as to the identity of the prisoner. Notwithstanding he shipped on board the Holkar by the name of Charles Robinson, and was known only by the name of Tom Jones, yet it appeared by the testimony of a number of witnesses he was the same person. Diana Valentine swears positively, that she was well acquainted with the prisoner; that she had boarded in the same house with him before the Holkar sailed. Peter Willis has known the prisoner for ten years, and testifies he shipped on board the Holkar; he knew him in this city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>by the name of Tom Jones. Julia Freeman, Mary Adams, (see the testimony) swear they knew the prisoner; he was called Jones. There was no doubt, continued his hon-our, that the prisoner at the bar was the same person who ' x <em>1 </em>shipped on board the Holkar by the name of Charles Robinson, and that he is the same person known by the witnesses by the name of Tom Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">His honour then proceeded to recapitulate the circumstances of the case\u2014the sailing of the Holkar\u2014no information having since been received of her\u2014King\u2019s examination\u2014his connected story\u2014the recognition and arrest of the prisoner\u2014King's testimony, &amp;c. -and concluded that the case depended almost entirely upon his testimony\u2014as he was proved to be \u00e1 convicted felon, although restored to competency by the clemency of the executive, it was the duty of the jury to sift his teslimony\u2014that where he was not corroborated on the main points, by testimony of witnesses, or by the circumstances, they ought to pay no regard to it, and that if after a full and impartial view of the case, they were satisfied the evidence did not support the indictment, or if they had a fair and reasonable doubt, it was their duty to acquit; but if they were satisfied that King was corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by the circumstances of the case, and they had no reasonable doubt of the prisoner\u2019s guilt, it was their duty to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">He was found guilty, and sentenced to be executed on the 11th-June, 1824.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\">See the note preceding How\u2019s case, ante, page 410. The remarks of. Justice Park, in his charge to the jury in the case of the King v. John Thurtell, for the murder of Mr. Weare, Hertford assises, January 1824, are too beautiful and appropriate -to be omitted, He says, remarking upon circumstantial evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The eye of Omniscience can alone see the truth in all cases; .circumstantial evidence is there out of the question ; but clothed as we are with the infirmities of human nature, how are we to get at the truth without a concatenation of circumstrnees ? Though in human judicature, imperfect as it must necessarily be, it' sometimes happens, perhaps in the course of one hundred years, that in a few solitary instances, owing to the minute and curious circumstances which sometimes envelope human transactions, error has been committed from a reliance on circumstantial evidence; yet this species of evidence, in the opinion of all those who are most conversant with the administration of justice, and most skilled in judicial proceedings, is much more .satisfactory than the testimony of a single individual, who swears he has seen a fact committed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
