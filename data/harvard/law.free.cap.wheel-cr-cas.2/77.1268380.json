An auctioneer could not now be appointed \u201cby and with the advice and consent of the council of appointment, such a power not being in existence, having been abrogated by the constitution, and by \u00a3&lt; an act directing the mode of appointing certain officers,\u201d which defined the manner of appointing auctioneers, to wit, \u201cthat the person administering the government of this state shall nominate, and with the consent of the senate, appoint.\u201d It was entirely silent as to any penalties for selling goods at public auction, without such appointment. It was a <em>casus </em>omissus, not provided for by ;any law in the state. Every man who chose might sell .at public auction without being amenable to the penalties of the act of the 15th of April, 1817, or any other act.
