The defendants also assembled there, and commit-ed several acts of improper conduct in and about the house, such as disputing with, and contradicting <em>the </em>preachers, using opprobrious language, and finally beating them. This being a case involving the question, not whether the \u201c Albrights\u201d are perfectly right in their doctrine and discipline, but whether any people, any sect and denomination of Christians, have a right under our law and constitution to <em>\u201c </em>assemble and meet together,\u201d and worship God without molestation; it excited not a little interest. The testimony having been closed on the part of the commonwealth, as well as for the defendants, Judge <em>Hamilton </em>delivered a very able charge to the jury; in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-10\">i: That if there be any one blessing which, more than another, distinguishes this country from all others, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that of religious liberty; that in other countries there is an established religion, a religion of <em>state, </em>and all others, differing from it, are either considered as heresy, and are merely tolerated, without any rights, without the hope of protection from outrage and molestation. In a word, that other countries protect one sect, and tolerate or suppress the rest, according as it may suit their prejudices, while this country gives equal protection to all; that nevertheless, such is the proneness of our nature to oppress those who differ -from, us in point of religious doctrine and discipline, that sects, which have themselves been persecuted, become the most violent of persecutors in their turn, when the arm of civil authority is on their side. Civil and ecclesiastical history are full of examples. Even the celebrated Knox, the father of the Presbyterian Church, was so eager to suppress all sects not worshipping as he did, that he is said to have exclaimed, that he would not advise to wait the form of legal process,' but that they should be cut off unheard and untried. That this court is not only bound to execute our laws in favour of religious liberty, but would be bound to declare unconstitutional any act made to abridge it. That the world is strangely apt to persecute * any sect professing to be more rigid, and endeavoring to live a more pure life, than those about them; that we are not to condemn, much less molest them; we do not know but they are, as we profess to be, the sincere followers of Jesus Christ. In a word, all denominations .of worshippers of Almighty God, whose doctrine and mode of worship are not subversive of morality, are to be protected in this country. That it is true, in a neighbouring state, the sect of Christians called Shaking Quakers.'had ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>cited the public attention of late, and it did appear that their tenets were such as tended to break down all the distinction of sex and condition, and struck at the very root societ7= and were apparently subversive of civil government. But, whatever may be the effects of their tenets, we are not now called' upon to give them a judicial investigation; it is clear, however, that the \u201c Evangelical Society,\u201d or \u201c Albrights,\u201d are not such. Their doctrin\u00e9is that of the greatest portion of the Christian \u25a0world. They appear to correspond with the form of Gospel Truth, &amp;c. &amp;c., and are, therefore, entitled to protection.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Note.\u2014In this country, where the utmost latitude is allowed in religious opinions and modes of worship by the constitution of the United States, and of the states respectively, it might reasonably be expected that every one would see and feel the necessity of that forbearance which provisions of such a salutary nature are calculated to produce. The expectation, however, has not perhaps been realized.\u2014\u201cSomebody must be persecuted when all are persecutors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In this country we not only enjoy a greater share of religous liberty than in any other, but we are absolutely free; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>nor can it be otherwise whilst the constitution of the United States retains its present form, nor even after that instrument is impaired or destroyed ; for so careful have we been upon this subject, that religious liberty has been carried into, and is made a fundamental principle of the constitutions of the respective states.</p>\n<p id=\"A7bT\">\u201c This first good and last hope of mankind \u201d has been protected with great care by the common law, i ndependent of any statute.
