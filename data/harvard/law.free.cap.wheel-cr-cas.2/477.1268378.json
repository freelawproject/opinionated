They were sent into the interior of the country together with a deserter. As soon as they were missed, they were demanded by the British commander, under a threat that the town should be destroyed if they were not obeyed.' Communications passed between the two parties, the result of which was that the men were restored to the enemy. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyF\">It appeared by the testimony of John Randall and others, that on Saturday alter the engagement at Bladensburgh, General- Bowie brought three prisoners to ^ <em>1 </em>\u00b0 <em>r </em>\u2014 Queen Anne, and asked Randall to stand guard over them, which he did. During - the night Mr. William Lansdale brought another. Early in the morning the prisoner and his brother appeared and demanded them ; they said that the British had threatened to destroy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>town, unless this requisition was obeyed before 12 o\u2019clock, &amp;c- and that they would hold their wives and children as hostages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ars\">The witness sent for General Bowie, who at first refused to suffer them to go; upon an explanation of the threat, \u2022he said it was hard, but he supposed they must be returned. They were delivered up to the prisoner, who surrendered them to the British.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\"><em>Mr. Pinckney </em>on behalf of the prisoner, read an address from the grand jury to the President of the United States, in which the jurors expressed their respect for the motives of the prisoner, and prayed a nolle prosequi.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\"><em>Mr. Glenn </em>prayed- the court to direct the jury that the mere act of delivering up prisoners or deserters, is an -overt act of high treason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-9\"><em>Pinckney. </em>There is no law in this prayer, for it excludes that which is the essence of the offence, intention ; and if <em>it was </em>otherwise, the court has no right to instruct \u00a1the jury, as .if this were a civil case. No instance has .occurred in modern times of an attempt to bind the jury in such a case by the opinion of the court. What remedy is there for the party if you err? We may appeal to a higher tribunal, it is true, but what is the consequence ? The man is hanged, and your judgment is reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-10\">In England, did their courts interfere in this mode in the celebrated cases of Hardy, and Horne Tooke and others ? No, it would not have been endured. The best security for the rights of individuals is to be found in the trial by jury. But the excellence of this institution consists in its exclusive power. The jury are here judges of law and fact, and are responsible only to God, to the prisoner, and to their own consciences. After the case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>closed, </em>you may indeed <em>advise </em>the jury, if they ask it, or if you think proper to do so: without being asked by them. But to interrupt the progress of the trial in the way proposed would be monstrous. Suppose the court to give the direction, I shall not submit to it as the prisoner\u2019s counsel. I will, on the contrary, tell the jury that it is not law. It is my right to do so, and in a case of blood, I dare not forego the exercise of it. I trust I shall not be placed in a predicament which will thus set my duty to a man whose life is in my charge, against my respect for this tribunal.

He never knew an instance, while he was prosecutor for the state, of praying a direction on behalf of the state, though it was frequently done by the traverser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APY\">The court said, they were bound to declare the law whenever they were called upon, in civil or criminal cases; in the latter, however, it was their duty to inform the jury that they were not obliged to take their direction as the law. In the case at bar, they declined giving any opinion at present, being desirous to hear counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akc\"><em>Glenn </em>then said he would not now address the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABX\"><em>Pinckney </em>regretted that his learned friend across the table had not seen fit to come forward in support of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>case, as he wished to have delivered a brief homily on the law of treason; not indeed for the - benefit of. his client, but for the instruction of others,, who appeared to stand in neec[ 0f r.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqt\"><em>Mr. </em>Glenn, in support of his prayer, read to the court the following authorities: 1.

This was an indictment for high treason, in levying war against the United States, Patterson, who presided in that case, said there were two points for consideration\u2014the facts and the intention. He stated the evidence and the design, and concluded .that the combination of these facts with this design, consummated the crime of high treason in the contemplation of the constitution and law of the United States. It may not, said the judge, be useless, on this occasion, to observe, that the fear which the law recognizes as an <em>excuse </em>for the perpetration of an offence, must proceed from an immediate and actual danger, threatening the life of the party. The apprehension of any loss of property, by waste or fire, or even an apprehension of a slight or remote injury to the person, furnish no excuse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Atk\">The counsel then read Cranbourn\u2019s case from Salk, p C33.\" He then admitted that he must prove a certain portion of the intention, and that in the present case there was but two inquiries to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>1st.

Did he intend to do so?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3n4\">Both these questions must be answered affirmatively; :,n\u00bf. therefore the treason was proved, and he had no more to^ay upon the subject, '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnY\"><em>Pinckney.^, </em>Nothing but an utter confusion of ideas could have introduced a doubt upon the subject. The gentleman\u2019s prayer excluded all ide- of criminal intention ; or it relied upon the influence ofoummal motive, as a necessary corollary from the naffi-d nxiri charged, as the overt acts in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AitE\">It might be affirmed as fii \u2019tvx-srJ proposition-, that criminal intention is the essence r.'i cry species of crime. All indictments commence with an assertion of corrupt motives ; and in indictments for treason, the overt acts laid are to show the manner in which the wicked intention is carried into execution. In the speed es Lord Erskine, to whom the world is so , largely indebted for a correct knowledge of the principles of civil liberty and the law of treason, you will find him perpetually contending, and contending with effect, that although \u00edh ~ crown had proved the facts charged, it had not shown the evil design, the corrupt purpose, without which the facts are nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A11\">The Counsel then referred to, and read pari -f Mr. Erskine\u2019s remarks in the case of Lord 3e0 \" Gordon. In that case it was proved that the prisoner incit./i the acts which produced the consequences complained of, yet he was acquitted, because he was not the enemy of the king, nor the friend of any man who was his enemy.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajh\">Take the case of a man who, in time of war, is charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>with the defence of an important fortress or castle, which he surrenders to an incompetent force. What more effectual' means could he have adopted to aid the enemy than the delivery of this fortress <em>1 </em>The books will tell you, thaj^ff he was bribed to this desertion of his duty\u2014if did it with a view to benefit the enemy,, he is guilty of treason. But if pusillanimity was the cause, or if if'arose from a false calculation of his own means, or tlygtbrce of the enemy, he is not a traitor. You may banish him with ignominy from the ranks which he has djsgy\u00e1ced, or try hint by martial law as a coward or a fool; but he has committed no treason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4c7\">Suppose a powerful force to invade the country, to which resistance is hopeless ; they levy contributions ; they do not proclaim that they will, hang me if I neglect to\" comply with this order; butjthey threaten plunder and desolation. I know they have tfie power to execute that threat\u2014and I \"comply accordingly.., Now the paying of money, or the furnishing of provision..-, is an assistance; it is_ \u201c giving aid and.comfort\u201d mucb/more effectually than the delivery of a-few prisoners or a deserter. Yet no man will call this treason ; because fViere is no evidence of hostility to the interests of the cot ntry. The authorities say it is not treason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ad-O\">In <em>Stone's </em>case (1 Bast\u2019s C. L. 79.) the indictment charged as an overt act of adherence to the enemy, that the prisoner conspired, with others to collect intelligence within England and Ireland, of tiie disposition of the king\u2019s subjects, in case of an invasion of either country, and to communicatty'such intelligence to the enemy. The tendency of par\u00eds &lt;ff the correspondence, which was given in evidence, wafi to advise the enemy against an invasion of England, \u2019by representing the improbability of its being attended with any success, from the general disposition of the people.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AId-\">Now it was scarcely possible that such a correspondence could have been opened and maintained with other than cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>rupt motives. Yet the counsel were allowed to argue that the letters were transmitted with a good intent, in order to avert the danger of so great a calamity as an invasion. And the Court said, the jury were to judge from all the circumstances, whether the intelligence had been sent with \u25a0that view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Arlz\">My client is charged, as Stone was charged, with being an <em>adherent; </em>and like him is entitled to be sheltered by his motives from the imputation of treason : The District Attorney confounds the indictment which you are now trying with an indictment for levying war. I admit that it has been decided, that if a man becomes an integral part of the enemy\u2019s force, and acts with it, he necessarily levies war, and is guilty of treason, unless it appears that he did so <em>pro terrore mortis. </em>The law will suffer no other exculpation of such conduct; it will excuse it upon no other motive. But will the gentlemen refer ps to some authority which declares, that if a man, without joining the enemy so as to levy war, does, upon virtuous or even pardonable inducements, (having no reference to the promotion of the enemy\u2019s views) that which happens, or is calculated, to be advantageous to the enemy, he is therefore a traitor <em>1 </em>What is an <em>adherent ? </em>Can he be any thing \u2022less than a willing partisan, a corrupt auxiliary of the enemy ? Such, at least, is the natural and ordinary import of the word ; and you cannot strain it beyond that import by the refinements of construction, to the prejudice of the accused, without reviving the ferocious and appalling doctrine of constructive treason, which once made England bleed at every pore, and stained the palace and the cottage with judicial murder. The protecting spirit of the constitution, and of the statute which acts upon it, as well as humanity and justice, would be outraged by such a course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Azvq\">Unlike the conduct of Stone, the conduct of Hodges presents nothing ambiguous to the most zealous scrutiny. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>honourable feelings and intentions are acknowledged by \u00b0 ah : he was Urged by the solicitation of those whom heres- : he was led by a generous sympathy for the situation of one who is deservedly dear to all who know him : he was actuated by an apprehension, by no means unreasonable, for the quiet and safety of the affrighted women and helpless children of the neighbourhood, and for the security of the persons and property of the whole district. The treason of adherence cannot be committed by one whose heart is warm with all the honourable feelings of the man and the patriot. \u201c Overt acts undoubtedly do discover the man\u2019s intentions ; but I conceive they are not to be considered merely as evidence, but as the means made use of to effect the <em>purposes of the heart.\u201d </em>Foster, 203.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALS\">This is the master key which lets you into the whole secret of this title of the criminal law. b'ir Walter Tyrrel, who, in shooting at a deer, killed the king, could not be convicted of treason. The killing was <em>per </em>infortunium. So, where a person <em>non compos </em>slays another designedly, still he is innocent, because there is no malignity in his heart. So in every homicide, it is felonious, justifiable or excusable, according to the purpose with which the act was perpetrated. It is <em>murder </em>where it is done through malice ; <em>manslaughter, </em>if without malice ; where it is done through misfortune, or in self defence, it is excusable, and it is <em>justifiable </em>when done in advancement of public justice, in obedience to the laws. - If the heart be uncoutaminated by corrupt intentions, the man is innbeeut, for it is motive that qualifies actions. As it will be with God, so it is with the man: the latent intention of the heart must be searched.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_r6\">Look at the <em>locus in </em>quo\u2014the scene where the plot of this treason is laid. A hostile force, but the day before, had traversed the country in all the pride of victory. <em>The jus. belli </em>was lord of the ascendant. The army, if such a force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>may deserve the name, which had been relied upon for the v 1 defence of the cap\u00edtol, had been broken up and dissipated to every quarter of the compass. The country was menaced by an enemyr with whom, to adopt the language of Cassar, it was easier to do than to say. If I were addressing the jury I might appeal to their love of country. I might remind them that they are administering law for posterity as well as for us. But I am addressing a tribunal where these considerations have their full weight, and I ekpect with confidence that the court will vindicate the doctrines which I have had the honor to advance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALl\">[After considerable delay, occasioned by the examination of the authorities, the court proceeded to pronounce an opinion.]</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ALJ1\">Duvall, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATd\">The Court would have been better satisfied if the whole case had been gone through in the usual way ; but as the District Attorney has prayed an opinion on the law, the-Court will give their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AgXr\">1 st. Hodges is accused of adhering to the enemy, and the overt act laid consists in the delivery of certain prisoners, and I am of opinion that the overt act laid in the indictment and proved by the witnesses, is high treason against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AFK\">2d. When the act itself amounts to treason, it involves the intention, and such was the character of this act. No threat of destruction of property will excuse or justify such an act; nothing but a threat of life, and that likely to be put into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"Aar\">3d. The jury are not bound to conform to this opinion, because they have a right, in all criminal cases, to decide on the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"AID\"><em>Houston J. </em>said he did not entirely agree with the chief justice in any, except the last remark.</p>\n<p id=\"A02\"><em>jPinckney </em>then rose again, and addressed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A3P\">The opinion which the chief justice has just delivered is not, and I thank God for it, the law of the land. If you have the slightest doubt on the subject, I will undertake to remove it, to show you that the cases have been misconceived, and that the conclusions drawn from them are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AEl\">Mo man can feel for the learned judge who has just given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>you. his instruction, a reverence and affection more sincere than I do. But reverence and affection for him shall not stand in -\u00a1\u00bfe way of the great duty which I owe to a fellow citizen who relies on me to shield his innocence from the charge of guilt, and his life from an attainder for treason. I had hoped that, since his motives were admitted, on all hands, to be entitled to praise^ since the grand jury had associated with their indictment a certificate of the purity of his views, and a solemn recommendation that the prosecution should be abandoned, he would at least have been left by the District Attorney, and the Court, to obtain from you, as be could, a deliverance from the danger that encompassed him. In that hope I have been disappointed. As if the salvation of the state depended upon the conviction of this unfortunate man, whose situation, one would think, an inQuisiTon might deplore\u2014the District Attorney has gone out of his way to bring down vengeance upon him; and one of the Court has told you that he is a traitor, and that you ought to find him so. .</p>\n<p id=\"AKxW\">In a case where justice might be expected to be softened into clemency, and even to connive at acquittal, where every generous sentiment must take part with the accused, and law might be thought to fear the reproach of tyranny, if'it should succeed in crushing him;.in such a case the established order of trial is .deserted, a pernicious novelty is introduced, the court is called upon to mix itself in your deliberations, to mutilate the defence of the prisoner\u2019s counsel, to harden your consciences against the .solicitations of an enlightened mercy, and to sacrifice the pris\u2022oner to gloomy and exterminating principles, which would render the noble and beneficent system of law, for which we are distinguished, a hideous spectacle of cruelty and oppression.\u2014 For the sake of the country to which I belong, as well as of my iclient, I will not only protest before you against these principles, but will examine and speak of them with freedom, restrained only by the decorum which this place requires..</p>\n<p id=\"AcM\">[After several introductory observations, Mr. Pinckney proceeded thus:]</p>\n<p id=\"A0L7\">In my argument to the court, I showed that if it be done treacherously, it is treason ; but that if the commander act from any motive not corrupt, no indictment can touch him. If the fort be as impregnable as Gibraltar, and j be garrisoned with 50,000 men, and it is surrendered to a force of half that number, from motives of fear, the commander cannot be punished as a traitor. What can be more strong to show that upon an indictment for adherence, the law looks into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>heart, and adapts its penalties accordingly <em>7 </em>Has that authority been answered ?</p>\n<p id=\"ASQ9\">In the case of Stone, which was parallel with the point, the Court said expressly, if the heart be pure, it matters not how incorrect the conduct. So the counsel argued; and Stone was acquitted. Has any answer been given to that authority <em>1 </em>Has any been even attempted ?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">This indictment charges Hodges with having done certain things, <em>wiclcedly, maliciously, and traitorously. </em>Must not the-United States prove what they allege ? When the law allows even words to be given in evidence, as explanatory of intention, to exculpate, it admits that exculpation may be made out by proof of innocent motives:\u2014that overt acts <em>alone </em>do not furnish a criterion\u2014that concomitant facts, illustrative of the state of the heart, must not be neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">A military force levies contributions.\u2014If you pay them, for the purpose of saving\u2019the country from farther mischief, although there be no fear or danger of death, the law says this is not treason. By the doctrine of the chief justice, however, it is treason,, and consequently his doctrine is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On this occasion, the .enemy were in complete power in the'district where the transactions occurred, which are complained of in the indictment. They were unawed by the thing which, we called an army, for it had fled in every direction. They were omnipotent. The law of war prevailed, and every other law was silent. The domestic code was suspended. They menaced pillage and conflagration ; and after they had wantonly destroyed edifices -which all civilized warfare had hitherto respec - ted, was it to be believed that they would spare a petty village, which had renewed hostilities, before the seal of its capitulation-was dry <em>1 </em>There was menace\u2014power to execute\u2014probability\u2014 nay, certainty, that it would be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">How, then, can you find a wicked and traitorous motive in the breast of my client <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">There is not only the absence of any wicked motive, but there.is the visible presence of those which are laudable: an attachment to Dr. Beanes-\u2014anxiety for the defenceless people about, him\u2014a desire to preserve the country from the afflictions which hung over it. In conduct so characterized, so produced, we discover the operations of an excellent heart, upon a mind which virtuous inducements could betray into error ; but what way we can distort it into treason, I have not yet been able distinctly to learn.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The <em>conduct </em>is in itself treasonable, says the chief justice, it necessarily imports the wicked intention charged by the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>indictment. The construction makes it treason, because it <em>aids and comforts the enemy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">These are strong and comprehensive positions ; but they have not been proved ; and they cannot be proved until we relapse into the gulf of constructive treason, from which our ancestors in another country have long since escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Gracious God ! In the nineteenth century, to talk of constructive treason ! Is it possible that in this favoured land\u2014 this last asylum of liberty\u2014blest with all that can render a nation happy at home and respected abroad\u2014this should be law? No. I stand up as a man to rescue my country from this reproach. \u2022 I say there is no colour for this slander upon our jurisprudence.. Had I thought otherwise I should have asked for mercy\u2014not for law. I would have sent my client to the feet of .the president, not have brought him, with bold defiance, to confront his accusers, and demand your verdict. He could have had a <em>nolle prosequi. </em>I confirmed him in his resolution not to usk it, by telling\"him that he was safe without it. Under these \u2022circumstances I may claim some respect for my opinion. My \"opportunities for forming a judgment upon this subject, I am compelled to say, by the strange turn which this cause has taken, are superior to those of the chief justice. I say nothing of the knowledge which long study and extensive practice enabled mo to bring to the consideration of the case. I rely upon this; my opinion has not been <em>hastih/ formed\u2014since the commencement of the trial. </em>It is the result of a deliberate examination of all the authorities, of a thorough investigation of the law of treason in all its forms, made at leisure, and under a deep sense of a fearful responsibility of my client. It depends upon me whether he should submit himself to your justice, or use with the chief magistrate the intercession of the grand jury, which could not have failed to have been successful. You are charged with his life and honour, because I assured him that the law was a pledge for the security of both. I declared to him that I would stake my own life upon the safety of his; and I declare to you now that you have as much power to shed the blood of the advocate as to harm the client whom he defends.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">If the mere naked fact of delivery constitute the crime of treason, why not hang the man who goes under a flag of truce to return or exchange prisoners? According to the doctrine of the Chief Justice, this man is equally guilty with him who stands at the bar, if you are forbidden to examine his mind, but are 'commanded by the.law to look only to his acts. I ask you to consider this, in the spirit of Stone\u2019s case: that doctrine, I pledge myself, goes through every nerve and artery of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>If the doctrine of the Chief Justice be the law of the land, every man concerned in the deeds of blood, that were acted during our recent wav, was a murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"AMT\">Our gallant soldiers who had repulsed the hostile step whenever it trod upon our shores ; our gallant tars who unfurled our flag, acquired for us a name and rank upon the ocean which will not soon be obliterated\u2014these arc all liable to bo arraigned at this bar. Those men have carried dismay and death into the ranks of the foe ; blood calls for blood. You dare not inquire into the causes which produced the circumstances; which attended the motives; which prompted the deeds of carnage. The act, you are told by the Chief Justice, and such is the reasoning of the attorney general, involves the intent.</p>\n<p id=\"AJVZ\">Gentlemen! this desolating doctrine would sweep us from the face of the earth. Even when we deserved to be crowned with laurels, we should be stretched on a gibbet. I tremble for my children, for my country, when I reflect upon the consequences of these detestable, tenets which reduces indiscretion and wickedness to the same level. Which of j-ou is there that in some unguarded moment may not, with honest motives, be imprudent? Which of you can hope to pass through life without the imputation of crime, if your motives may be separated from your conduct, and guilt may be fastened upon your actions, although the heart be innocent?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Gentlemen ! so solemnly, so deeply, so religiously do I feel impressed with this principle, that I know not how to leave the case with you, although at the\" present moment it strikes my mind in so clear a light that I know not how to make it more -clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">If this damnable jDrosecution should prevail, it would be the duty of the district attorney instantly to arraign Gen.
