The witnesses appeared to be men of veracity\u2014 he credit of none has been impeached. It does not appear hat either of them has had the least personal animosity owards Mr. Dormenon, or that they were actuated by moives of revenge or \"prosecution, or felt any other sentiment han that which the recollection of their past sufferings, n the presence of the person whom they considered to be he principal author of them, was calculated to inspire. Lnd their testimony, if true, fully substantiates the fact harged in the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">To repeal the force of this testimony, Mr. Dormenon has iroduced testimonial proof, (which is not denied,) that in he various public employments in which the witnesses \u00edave known him, his conduct has been without reproach, ,nd in his private life exemplary and much esteemed; and, s an additional evidence of his having enjoyed public condence, he has exhibited a list of appointments in the juiciary made by General Rochambeau, in the year n which his name appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">This may bo all true, but as it relates to an epoch some onsiderable time subsequent to the year 1793, does not ontradict the witnesses, who speak of his conduct only in lat year.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Mr. Dormenon, in his defence in writing, has laboured \u2022tally to discredit the witnesses against him, by attempt\u2122 ig to show gross contradictions and absurdities in their stimony. If there be not a perfect coincidence in the witesses in all the details of their testimony, they certainly greed upon the important fact.</p>\n<p id=\"ABO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>It is proved that Mr. Dormenon was a municipal officer . , ... under the commissaries Poiverell and Santhonax, in the year 1793, when tiie general freedom of the slaves wat Proclaime(3. This Mr. Dormenon admits.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">It is proven, also, that in that character, wearing a scarf his badge of office, he marched at th\u00e9head of the brigands acting in concert with their leaders, whose sole purpose anc employment was the .indiscriminate murder and massacre of the whites who refused to conform to the orders of the commissaries; and that their conduct in various exped\u00ed tions in pursuit of the whites was marked with unexampled cruelty and barbarity. It is. equally in testimony, tha Dormenon associated with, and was the intimate friend o Pe Lisle, Brisot, Faubert,and Gai, who headed the brigand; in the quarter of Jacmel and Jeremy and its dependencies</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">There are many circumstances detailed by the witnesse which warrant a belief of these facts. In fact, they are a satisfactorily proven as that Dormenon was a municipa officer, and can with as little plausibility be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Had the same evidence of these facts accompanied Mi Dormenon\u2019s application for admission to the bar, I have n doubt he would have been refused. The-court now being possessed of it, it is equally their duty to exclude him. I is considered that the safety of this country requires tha no person who has acted in concert with the negroes an mulatoes of St. Domingo in destroying the whites, \u00f3ugh to hold any kind of office here, however fair his conduc may since have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">And, from the evidence, no unprejudiced mind can doul that such has been the conduct of Mr. Dormenon. It i; therefore, ordered that the rule be made absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
