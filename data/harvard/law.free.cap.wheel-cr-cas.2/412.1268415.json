After an able and impartial charge by Judge j^chester, jury retired about two o\u2019clock on Tursday night, and returned before six on Friday morning with a verdict of guiltv. He was sentenced to be hanged on the <em>o j </em>... 19th of March, which sentence was carried into execution. After the sentence, and before the execution, he confessed the murder, as appears by Messrs. Cruger &amp; Wells\u2019 report of his case. He tells the story in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">\u201cI shall now describe the Murder of Othello Church. Yes, in a cool, deliberate manner <em>I murdered him!! </em>Called him from his sweet slumbers, and from the bosom of his wife\u2014never more to return to her fond embrace\u2014to sink him in the grave. Yes, his own floor I bathed with his warm blood, and his soul I hurried oif to another world. I heard the new-made widow\u2019s groans, and the wretched orphan\u2019s cries, which pierced my flinty heart. May God forgive me, and wash the crimson stain from my afilicted soul.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">\u201c I was aggravated 'to this crime \u2022 by injuries, personal abuses, and insults: -but they are no excuse for me. . I had some time calculated on his destruction, and one day, a few weeks before his death, he went to Angelica, and I expected him to .return in the evening. I loaded a guu and way-laid the road between his house and mine, in the woods west of M\u2019Coy\u2019s tavern. Here I tarried until late at night, awaiting his return; but he did not come. I first took my stand behind a root, and then, for my better accommodation, behind a large pine tree, and had he come, I surely should have shot him. While I here stood I had some reflections; the sweet evening breeze gently pressed the lofty forest, and the tall pines could bend beneath the power of Heaven\u2014but my obdurate heart remained unmoved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201c The next day I went to Angelica, and there I saw Mr. Church, and I felt very glad he had escaped. After re-fleeting on the subject, and getting no satisfaction, I fixed my eye on him again, and I could not spare him. Accordingly, in December I watched the state of the snow, that I might not be tracked, and on the 29th I thought the thing was ripe. In the afternoon I loaded a rifle, and placed it in a bed-room where no person slept, and where I could reach it from the window if occasion should require. I then rode to Angelica, four miles east; Mr. Church lived about 6 <em>miles </em>west of my house ; I put my horse up at Mr. Sherman\u2019s tavern, and fed it. I was about the village until after 10 o\u2019clock at night. At Mr. Dautrement\u2019s I drank considerable brandy, and calculated to take as much as I could, and do business regular. I then rode home, stopped at the bars opposite my house, and dismounted, and had serious reflections on the course I was pursuing. After a considerable pause I resolved to go, for I never allowed myself to give back in any undertaking. I then went to the bed-room window, and took out the gun; no one of my family knew it, and rode .a smart trot to Church\u2019s. I hitched my beast near Mr. Spear\u2019s shop\u2014took out my knife and rubbed my flint, that it might not miss fire. I took the mitten from off my right hand, and put it in my pocket. I was careful not to drop any thing whereby I might be detected. I then stepped to his kitchen door, which opened near the head of his bed, and stood 5 or 6 minutes on' his door stone. All creation seemed' locked in slumber, and one dread silence reigned through all the works of God.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0u\">\u201c Now my bold heart even trembled at the thought of an act so desperate, and every vibration of my soul seemed shrinking beneath the horrors of the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>111 rapped at his door, and shuddered at the very noise I made ; and was on the very point of retiring, when his wife, I think, awoke him, and' he exclaimed \u201c <em>Who is there 7 </em>I .endeavored to alter my voice, and answered, <em>\u201c I have a letter for you /' </em>he then said, \u201c <em>walk in.\" </em>I answered, \u201c <em>have the goodness to open the door and take it.\u201d </em>He arose, and as he opened the door, as soon as I saw the appearance of his white shirt, I shot at venture. I took no sight, and had the gun by my side. \u25a0 I think the muzzle was not more than 3 or 4 feet from him. I then heard him exclaim, \u201c <em>Oh! my God, my God!!\" </em>I heard no more of him. . I then returned to my beast, and every step was marked with care, lest I should fall or lose something, as it was slippery. The shocking cries and shrieks of the family broke the midnight silence, and rent the air with horror, which I heard a considerable distance. I then rode with great speed home. I dismounted and loaded my gun in haste, \u00e1nd set it into the window whence I had taken it; then I put out my beast, went to bed and went asleep. Before day the neighbours of Mr. Church called on me, and informed me he was murdered in his own house.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
