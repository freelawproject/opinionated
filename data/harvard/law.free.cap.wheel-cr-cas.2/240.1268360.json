Why is he examined ? Is it for the exclusive benefit of the state <em>1 </em>Certainly not. All the English authorities go upon the principle that the examination is taken for <em>his </em>benefit. It is said the examination has been considered rather as a privilege in favour of the party accused <em>afforded by law </em>for the benefit of an innocent man, who perhaps may on examination clear himself from suspicion, and then he will immediat\u00e9ly regain his freedom, than as any additional peril. 1 Chitty\u2019s Cr. L. 68. And another fact, from which an argument might be drawn to show the examination should be read in evidence upon the trial when demanded by the prisoner is, that if the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>insist upon it the magistrate is <em>compelled </em>to take his examination. Fortes. 142. It therefore appears that it is for the prisoner\u2019s benefit, and it appears equally true, that if the examination is not read he loses the benefit of that privilege the humanity of the law has allowed him. Should not the examination, if requested, be read ? and if it contains matter in favour of the prisoner, like every other species of evidence, its credibility may be judged of by the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
