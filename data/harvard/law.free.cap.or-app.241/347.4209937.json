ORS 813.010. He argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his breath test, which an officer administered before defendant had a chance to seek advice from counsel. The state concedes that the officer did not provide defendant a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before submitting to the test and that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence. We agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 74-75, 750 P2d 147 (1988); <em>State v.
