Because the parties do not dispute the relevant facts, we review the board\u2019s order for legal error. ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8)(a). We agree with insurer and, accordingly, reverse the order. Claimant cross-petitions, contending that he is entitled to his attorney fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) (2007) as a result of insurer\u2019s unreasonable refusal to close his claim. In light of our disposition, we dismiss claimant\u2019s cross-petition as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Claimant injured his cervical spine in May 2005 and filed a claim for compensation. After several surgeries, claimant\u2019s treating surgeon, Dr. Van Pett, released claimant to return to work on April 14, 2006, with several restrictions. As a result of that release, insurer asked Van Pett to clarify whether claimant\u2019s return to work was a return to regular or modified work. Van Pett responded that insurer would have to compare the restrictions she imposed with the job description for claimant\u2019s position to answer its inquiry. Insurer engaged in various efforts to determine whether claimant had returned to regular work, including an examination by an orthopedic surgeon, and, on October 11, 2006, it sent another letter to Van Pett inquiring as to whether claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>would have permanent restrictions performing his normal job.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On November 3, 2006, insurer received a letter from claimant, which stated, \u201cPlease consider this claimant\u2019s request that you close this claim <em>as soon as you have sufficient information to rate his permanent </em>disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After several attempts to reach Van Pett, insurer received a written response to its October 11 letter from her in late January 2007 that advised that claimant\u2019s restrictions were permanent, and, on February 9, 2007, insurer issued a notice of closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Before Van Pett\u2019s January response, claimant requested a hearing, arguing that he was entitled to a penalty against insurer under ORS 656.268(5)(d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for its unreasonable refusal to close his claim, which included insurer\u2019s failure to respond to claimant\u2019s November 3 letter. In response, insurer argued that claimant\u2019s letter was insufficient to trigger an obligation to respond under ORS 656.268(5)(b) and that, alternatively, if the obligation to respond was triggered, then insurer acted reasonably even though it did not respond until February. An administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an order concluding that, although claimant\u2019s letter was sufficient to trigger insurer\u2019s obligation to respond, insurer\u2019s failure to respond with a notice of closure or refusal to close was not unreasonable. Accordingly, claimant was not entitled to a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Claimant appealed to the board, renewing his arguments before the ALJ, and the board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order. The board agreed with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s letter triggered insurer\u2019s obligation to respond under ORS 656.268(5)(b); however, it disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s reasonableness determination. In that regard, the board concluded that \u201cinsurer acted reasonably in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>close the claim within 10 days [of] its November 3, 2006, receipt of claimant\u2019s closure request.\u201d Notwithstanding that conclusion, the board then determined that the delay between insurer\u2019s receipt of Van Pett\u2019s letter in late January 2007 and the issuance of the notice of closure on February 9, 2007, was unreasonable, and, therefore, claimant was entitled to a penalty under ORS 656.268(5)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">On judicial review, insurer assigns error to the board\u2019s ruling, renewing only its argument that claimant\u2019s letter did not trigger its obligation to respond to claimant with a notice of closure or refusal to close. For the reasons below, we agree with insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">As insurer contends, claimant\u2019s request for closure was premised on the satisfaction of a condition precedent, <em>viz., </em>insurer obtaining sufficient information to close the claim. ORS 656.268(5)(b) creates an independent avenue for a claimant to force the insurer to make a decision regarding closure. The statute prevents unnecessary delays by the insurer in closing a claim by creating a present obligation for the insurer to respond with its decision when the claimant properly requests closure of the claim. Further, OAR 436-030-0020 creates a wholly separate, mandatory obligation to close a claim when certain conditions are satisfied. The rule provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201c(1) Provided the worker is not enrolled and actively engaged in training, the insurer must issue a Notice of Closure on an accepted disabling claim within 14 days when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c(a) Medical information establishes there is <em>sufficient information to determine the extent of permanent disability </em>* * * and indicates the worker\u2019s compensable condition is medically stationary[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Here, claimant\u2019s letter requesting closure when insurer has \u201csufficient information to rate [claimant\u2019s] permanent disability\u201d tracks the conditional language used in the rule and, therefore, merely served as a reminder to insurer of its legal obligation to close claimant\u2019s claim when that condition is satisfied; the letter did not convey a request by claimant for <em>present </em>closure under ORS 656.268(5)(b). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>condition expressed in claimant\u2019s letter shows that claimant knew that the other requirements for closure \u2014 those imposed by OAR 436-030-0020 \u2014 might not have been satisfied at the time that claimant wrote the letter. Accordingly, we conclude that the letter did not trigger an obligation under ORS 656.268(5)(b) for insurer to respond with a notice of closure or refusal to close, and the board erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Reversed on petition for review; cross-petition dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\"> ORS 656.268(5)(b) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cIf the insurer * * * has not issued a notice of closure, the worker may request closure. Within 10 days of receipt of a written request from the worker, the insurer * * * shall issue a notice of closure if the requirements of this section have been met or a notice of refusal to close if the requirements of this section have not been met.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> ORS 656.268(5)(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cIf an insurer * * * has closed a claim or refused to close a claim pursuant to this section, if the correctness of that notice of closure or refusal to close is at issue in a hearing on the claim and if a finding is made at the hearing that the notice of closure or refusal to close was not reasonable, a penalty shall be assessed against the insurer * * * and paid to the worker in an amount equal to 25 percent of all compensation determined to be then due the claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
