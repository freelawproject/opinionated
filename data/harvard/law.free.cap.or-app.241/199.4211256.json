Yamhill County, </em>240 Or App 285, 246 P3d 493 (2010), to clarify the disposition of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We grant reconsideration to remove a sentence of the opinion that is inconsistent with our affirmance of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) opinion and order under review, and otherwise adhere to the opinion as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In <em>Waste Not of Yamhill County, </em>we affirmed a LUBA opinion and order that had reversed the county\u2019s approval of a comprehensive plan amendment, zone change, and an exception to Statewide Planning Goal 3 (Agricultural Lands). LUBA had directed that the local land use decision be reversed because it concluded that the goal exception was \u201cprohibited as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Waste Not of Yamhill County v. Yamhill County, </em>61 Or LUBA 423, 427 (2010). Under OAR 661-010-0071(1), LUBA is authorized to reverse a land use decision when the local government governing body exceeds its jurisdiction or makes an unconstitutional decision, or when the \u201cdecision violates a provision of applicable law and is prohibited as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In the review proceedings before this court, we affirmed the LUBA opinion and order on the grounds that respondents\u2019 contentions were either incorrect or not preserved. We also observed that the county had not taken a potentially available exception to Goal 3, and that \u201cLUBA cannot be faulted in failing to affirm an action not taken.\u201d 240 Or App at 297. Following that observation, we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cLUBA\u2019s remand to the county will allow a more careful focus on the plan designation and nature of any exception to be taken for the expansion area, as well as the implementing zoning for that plan designation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>That <em>dictum </em>about the nature of the remand proceedings before the county was entirely inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s reversal of the local government decision and our affirmance of that opinion and order. We have no basis to send back that order to LUBA so that LUBA can change its disposition to a remand to the county. <em>See </em>ORS 197.850(9)(a) (allowing reversal or remand of a LUBA order if the court finds the order \u201cto be unlawful in substance\u201d). We therefore modify our opinion by deleting the following at 240 Or App at 297:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201cLUBA\u2019s remand to the county will allow a more careful focus on the plan designation and nature of any exception to be taken for the expansion area, as well as the implementing zoning for that plan designation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> We refer to the parties by their designations in the LUBA proceedings under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\"> By contrast, under OAR 661-010-0071(2), a local government land use decision can be remanded by LUBA if the \u201cdecision improperly construes the applicable law, but is not prohibited as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
