Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 126, 135, 806 P2d 92 (1991). On a foggy and rainy October afternoon, Deputy Broyles was on patrol in his police car when he saw a red pickup truck, followed by a white motor home, coming towards him. Broyles saw the red pickup cross the center line, and he decided to enter the truck\u2019s license plate information into his mobile data terminal. By doing so, Broyles learned that the registered owner of the truck, defendant, had a suspended license. As the red truck passed him, Broyles was not able to see who the occupants were because of the rain and fog. Broyles turned his police car around and pulled the red pickup over.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Broyles could not see who was driving the truck after he had pulled it over, because there was a \u201cfour wheeler\u201d in the bed of the truck, blocking the rear window. When he reached the driver\u2019s side window of the pickup, Broyles noticed that both the driver and passenger were women; defendant is male. Broyles recognized the passenger, M, and asked her \u201cwhere [defendant] was.\u201d Both M and the driver pointed down the road in the direction of the white motor home. Broyles asked M \u201cif [defendant] was driving the motor home,\u201d and she said \u201cyes.\u201d Broyles told the women that he was leaving to catch up with the motor home and stop it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>that they were to follow him to the same location. The stop of the truck lasted approximately 60 to 90 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Broyles returned to his police car, caught up with the white motor home, and pulled it over. Broyles walked up to the driver\u2019s side window and asked the driver \u201cif he was [defendant], and he said he was.\u201d Broyles cited defendant for driving while suspended and released him. Broyles released the motor home to the women, who had followed him to the traffic stop in defendant\u2019s pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Defendant moved to suppress the women\u2019s statements, arguing that Broyles unlawfully extended the duration of the traffic stop when he asked the occupants of the truck where defendant was. Defendant asserted that, because he had a constitutionally protected possessory interest in his truck, Broyles violated that interest by questioning the occupants after observing that defendant was not the driver of the truck. At that point, defendant argued, Broyles no longer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving with a suspended license and, thus, the fact Broyles learned from questioning the occupants \u2014 that defendant was driving the motor home \u2014 was the product of an unlawful extension of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201cI am finding that the stop of the vehicle was appropriate under the case law. I find the discussion with the parties did not constitute an unreasonable seizure of the vehicle or an unlawful extension of that beyond a reasonable period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cAnd I am also finding that even if that had occurred, asking the questions of the passengers as to where the defendant was, was not a violation of the rights of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201cAnd even if it was an inappropriate seizure of the vehicle, it did not constitute a violation of the defendant\u2019s right and does not invalidate the arrest of the defendant based on that information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Defendant renews his arguments on appeal, asserting that, under <em>State v. Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or 1, 942 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>772 (1997), and <em>State v. Smith, </em>327 Or 366, 963 P2d 642 (1999), the fact that he was not personally driving the truck when Broyles stopped it is \u201cconstitutionally insignificant,\u201d because defendant retained a possessory interest in the truck. Thus, defendant reasons, Broyles\u2019s questioning of the occupants impermissibly extended the duration of the traffic stop, and the information that Broyles obtained from the occupants was the product of that illegal extension and should have been suppressed. The state replies that, regardless of whether defendant\u2019s possessory interest in the truck is cognizable under Article I, section 9, Broyles did not significantly interfere with that possessory interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u201cProperty is \u2018seized\u2019 for purposes of Article I, section 9, when there is a significant interference, even a temporary one, with a person\u2019s possessory or ownership interests in the property.\u201d <em>Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or at 6. In <em>Juarez-Godinez, </em>the defendant had been arrested after a traffic stop; his two passengers had not been arrested. \u201cAs a consequence of that arrest,\u201d the court explained, \u201cdefendant was unable to drive the car away himself. Still, he retained a possessory interest in the car and, in normal circumstances, could have transferred possession of it to one of his passengers and directed that it be driven away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The court held that the defendant\u2019s possessory interest had been significantly interfered with, particularly because the officer had requested the defendant\u2019s consent to a search of the car and had been refused, and after the defendant had refused, the officer had told him that another officer and a drug dog were coming to search the car. The court concluded that \u201c[the officer\u2019s] statements were <em>and </em>reasonably could have been interpreted as curtailing, by a show of authority, defendant\u2019s rights to transfer possession of, and direct the movements of, the <em>carId. </em>at 8 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>police officers had received a tip that a storage unit was being used to store marijuana harvested from an illegal growing operation. 327 Or at 368. The manager of the storage unit would not permit police officers to search the unit without a warrant and, after a drug dog positively alerted to the exterior of the storage unit, the police officers asked the manager to padlock the unit\u2019s door. The manager did so. <em>Id. </em>at 369. The officers later returned with a warrant, searched the unit, and found marijuana. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The defendant argued that his Article I, section 9, possessory interest in the storage unit was violated when the police, acting through the unit manager, padlocked the unit. The court agreed, holding that \u201c[p]adlocking the unit represented significant interference with respect to the unit. At least in theory, it deprived defendant of the use of the unit and access to its contents.\u201d Id. at 376. The court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABJ\">\u201cNeither do we agree with the state\u2019s suggestion that the seizure was constitutionally insignificant because defendant was in jail and in no position to exercise his possessory rights in the storage unit. The fact that one cannot <em>personally </em>exercise one\u2019s possessory rights does not preclude a conclusion that such rights have been violated. <em>See, e.g., [State </em>v.] <em>Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or at 8, 942 P2d 772 (seizure of car violated driver\u2019s right against unreasonable search and seizure even though driver was under arrest and unable to drive it).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>Smith, </em>327 Or at 377 n 7 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">As noted, defendant distills from <em>Juarez-Godinez </em>and <em>Smith </em>the proposition that, \u201cbecause [he] owned the truck, [defendant] retained all rights against its unreasonable search or seizure by the state, no matter where he was and no matter who else had permission to drive his truck.\u201d We need not determine the precise extent of defendant\u2019s possessory interest in his truck because, whatever that interest may have been, Broyles did not significantly interfere with it. Unlike in <em>Juarez-Godinez, </em>where the defendant\u2019s car was detained for nearly an hour after a traffic stop, defendant\u2019s truck in this case was pulled over for approximately 60 to 90 seconds, and Broyles\u2019s brief questions of its occupants did not curtail defendant\u2019s \u201crights to transfer possession of, and direct the movements of, the car.\u201d <em>Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or at 8. And, unlike in <em>Smith, </em>where the defendant\u2019s property was padlocked, here defendant\u2019s property remained under the control of the occupants whom defendant had allowed to use the truck. Accordingly, no violation of defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights occurred, and the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the challenged statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> Article I, section 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
