ORS 426.070; ORS 426.130. The trial court found that appellant suffered from a mental disorder, which made her unable to provide for her basic personal needs, and was not receiving the care necessary for her health or safety. ORS 426.005(l)(d)(B). Appellant assigns error to that determination, asserting that there is not clear and convincing evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that she is unable to provide for her basic needs. The state disagrees and argues that the trial court properly committed appellant to the Mental Health Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Appellant has not requested <em>de novo </em>review, and we decline to review the record in this case under that standard. ORS 19.415(3)(b); ORAP 5.40(8); see <em>also State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77 n 2, 245 P3d 697 (2010) (adhering to the \u201c \u2018presumption against the exercise of discretion\u2019 to engage in <em>de novo </em>review\u201d in the absence of a request and justification (quoting ORAP 5.40(8)(c))). Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions for legal error and are bound by the court\u2019s findings, unless there is no evidence to support them; we presume that disputed facts in the record were decided consistently with the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>State v. D. R., </em>239 Or App 576, 579, 244 P3d 916 (2010); <em>State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 655, 238 P3d 53 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">A discussion of the facts in this case would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. Suffice it to say that, even under a non-de <em>novo </em>standard of review and drawing all facts and inferences most favorably to the state, the evidence in the record in this case is legally insufficient to support a finding that appellant probably \u201c \u2018would not survive in the near future because [she] is unable to provide for basic personal needs.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. A. M.-M., </em>236 Or App 598, 603, 238 P3d 407 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Bunting, </em>112 Or App 143, 146, 826 P2d 1060 (1992)); <em>see also State v. B. C., </em>235 Or App 412, 416, 233 P3d 445 (2010) (concluding that trial court erred in committing appellant \u2014 who suffered from bipolar disorder, had exhibited \u201cerratic and threatening behavior,\u201d and \u201ccould not articulate any plan for how she would obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>shelter or food in the time before her next benefit check was to arrive\u201d \u2014 based on her inability to provide for basic personal needs).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
