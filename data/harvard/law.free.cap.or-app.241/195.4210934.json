Hartman, </em>238 Or App 582, 243 P3d 480 (2010), arguing that this court erred in its disposition of the case. In our original opinion, we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, and, consequently, we reversed and remanded the case. The state points out that the evidence at issue in defendant\u2019s motion concerned only two of the seven counts of which defendant was convicted and, thus, our disposition properly should have been to affirm defendant\u2019s convictions on the counts not affected by our reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The state\u2019s point is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; convictions on Counts 2 and 3 reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
