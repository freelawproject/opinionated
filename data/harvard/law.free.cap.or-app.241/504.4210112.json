J.</author>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Petitioner, a mobile home park operator, owns property that abuts a state highway. Defendant Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) approved an application to construct a new \u201capproach\u201d to that highway as part of the development of a Rite-Aid store near petitioner\u2019s property. The approval was conditioned on the developer erecting a median on the highway that would restrict turns \u2014 including turns in and out of petitioner\u2019s mobile home park. Petitioner, not a party to the permitting process, filed a petition for judicial review of ODOT\u2019s approval. In its petition, petitioner contended that (1) approval of the median had unlawfully deprived petitioner of a protected property interest \u2014 namely, an unrestricted easement from its property to the state highway, and (2) ODOT had \u201cfailed to provide advance notice and a hearing\u201d to petitioner before doing so. The circuit court agreed with the contention that petitioner should have been involved in the permitting process from the outset and, for that reason, remanded the case to ODOT. The agency now appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal involve, for the most part, procedural happenings. In January 2008, ODOT approved the new highway approach by way of an order in other than contested case. ODOT did not notify petitioner, an affected property owner, of the permitting process, and petitioner did not participate in the process. In October 2008, petitioner filed a petition for judicial review of the order in circuit court. <em>See </em>ORS 183.480(1) (\u201cany person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order\u201d may seek judicial review of the order); ORS 183.484 (describing judicial review of agency orders in other than contested cases). Petitioner contended that ODOT\u2019s order approving the approach \u2014 particularly, the condition that a median be constructed in the highway\u2014 would block highway access to petitioner\u2019s tenants and would make it impossible to deliver large mobile homes to petitioner\u2019s park. Petitioner asked the circuit court to reverse the order on that ground or, alternatively, to remand the case to the agency in order to give petitioner an opportunity to participate in the approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The circuit court agreed with petitioner\u2019s alternative contention that ODOT had provided inadequate process. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201cAlthough ODOT conducted some public hearings on the matter during the Regional Review process and instructed [the developer] to attempt to negotiate a shared access with [petitioner], [petitioner] was never a party to the permitting process. ODOT cannot escape this due process obligation by directing [the developer] to attempt to mitigate the impact of the development on [petitioner]\u2019s vested easement rights. The due process obligation can only be satisfied by including petitioner in the process. The Court finds [petitioner]\u2019s due process rights were thereby violated. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cThe easement is a property right which is protected by the US Constitution. Therefore, ODOT should have included [petitioner] in the process from the outset. Failure to do so clearly violated petitioner\u2019s due process rights. Therefore, the Court remands the case back to the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The court thereafter entered a judgment remanding the case to ODOT. ORS 183.484(5)(b)(C) (\u201cThe court shall remand the order to the agency if it finds the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion to be: * * * [otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On appeal, ODOT argues that the circuit court\u2019s remand to the agency was erroneous because the review process under the Oregon Administrative Procedure Act (APA) \u2014 the very process that petitioner invoked to obtain judicial review in this case \u2014 provided all the process that is due for constitutional purposes. Petitioner disputes whether the APA process was constitutionally adequate under the circumstances, but also suggests that we need not reach that question. That is so, petitioner argues, because the circuit court\u2019s judgment can be upheld on subconstitutional grounds: ODOT was required, by an Oregon statute, to provide petitioner with an opportunity to participate in the approval of the new highway approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">We agree with petitioner\u2019s alternative, subconstitutional basis for affirming the circuit court\u2019s remand to ODOT. <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 564, 687 P2d 785 (1984) (\u201c[C]onstitutional issues should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>not be decided when there is an adequate statutory basis for a decision[.]\u201d); <em>see also Zockert v. Fanning, </em>310 Or 514, 520, 800 P2d 773 (1990) (court will decide cases \u201cupon sub-constitutional grounds, where available, even though litigants argue only constitutional errors\u201d). As it turns out, the Oregon legislature has spoken on the very issue of whether property owners like petitioner should have an opportunity to participate in the permitting process for approach roads to highways. Under ORS 374.312, ODOT is specifically required to \u201cadopt rules governing the process of application for and issuance of permits for approach roads to highways by owners of property abutting the highways.\u201d That same statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201cThe department shall develop a program that allows a person that might be affected by the issuance of the permit, but that is not the owner of the property subject to the permit, <em>to express concerns to the department prior to the issuance of the permit. </em>For purposes of this subsection, persons that might be affected by the issuance of the permit are the city or county in which the road is located and <em>any person that owns property adjacent to the proposed access. </em>Nothing in this subsection gives a city, county or other person that might be affected standing to appeal any decision of the department regarding granting of the permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">ORS 374.312(5) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">ODOT acknowledges that it has not developed any such program, and, it is apparent that petitioner, a \u201cperson that owns property adjacent to the proposed access,\u201d was not provided with the statutorily contemplated opportunity \u201cto express concerns to the department prior to the issuance of the permit.\u201d During closing arguments before the circuit court, petitioner, citing ORS 374.312(5), explained that \u201cthe bell to be rung here is that ODOT doesn\u2019t have an adequate set of rules to deal with the general situation where you have a neighboring landowner who\u2019s impacted by a point of access.\u201d ODOT, for its part, agreed that \u201cthe agency could do better as far as bringing them in earlier perhaps,\u201d but contended that the problem was not of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Correct or not, ODOT\u2019s constitutional arguments do not address the agency\u2019s other, more elementary shortcoming. ODOT issued its order in other than a contested case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>without first giving petitioner the statutorily mandated opportunity to participate; for that reason, the circuit court correctly remanded the order to the agency. ORS 183.484(5)(b)(C) (\u201cThe court shall remand the order to the agency if it finds the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion to be: * * * [otherwise in violation of a constitutional <em>or statutory provision\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
