For the first time on appeal, he contends that the post-conviction court \u201chad no jurisdiction to hear\u201d his petition for post-conviction relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state agrees \u201cthat petitioner\u2019s petition was premature\u201d and, therefore, the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The petition for post-conviction relief in this case was filed in 2007; an amended petition was filed in January 2008. However, the appellate judgment on the direct appeal from the underlying criminal case was not entered until March 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the petition was filed while petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was still pending, the post-conviction court did not have jurisdiction to consider his claim. ORS 138.540(1) (post-conviction relief petition shall not be filed while appellate review remains available); ORS 138.550(1) (no post-conviction proceeding may be pursued while direct appellate review remains available); ORS 138.510(3)(b) (petition for post-conviction relief must be filed within two years of the date the appeal was final); <em>State v. Stevens, </em>134 Or App 1, 3, 894 P2d 1217 (1995) (circuit court has no jurisdiction to hear a post-conviction claim where the petition is filed while direct appeal is pending); <em>Mora v. Maass, </em>120 Or App 173, 176-77, 851 P2d 1154 (1993) (same). Given the fact that it lacked jurisdiction over the case, the post-conviction court should have dismissed the petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> Although he presents his contention as a \u201cplain error\u201d argument, we note that subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time. <em>See Weatherspoon v.
