J.</author>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">This appeal arises from a civil case in which plaintiffs, Benson and Blair, alleged that defendant had breached an agreement to purchase a truck from them. The case was sent to mandatory court-annexed arbitration, where defendant eventually prevailed and was awarded attorney fees. Accordingly, the trial court entered a general judgment pursuant to which plaintiffs were to pay defendant the sum of $4,635.50. After defendant began collection proceedings, Blair filed a motion seeking to have the judgment against her set aside, arguing for the first time that she had been mistakenly named as a plaintiff in the case by Woodard, the attorney who filed the complaint, and contending that she should never have been a plaintiff because she could not have obtained relief. The trial court ultimately granted Blair\u2019s motion, entering a general judgment setting aside the prior judgment against Blair and dismissing her as a party to the case. Defendant now appeals, asserting that the trial court erred in setting aside the judgment. We agree with defendant and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In 2006, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed in circuit court alleging that defendant had breached a contract relating to his purchase of a truck from Benson and Blair. According to the complaint, defendant agreed to pay Benson and Blair each a sum of money and did pay Blair but failed to pay Benson. Furthermore, the complaint alleged that defendant had falsely altered a bill of sale to show that the truck was paid for and presented that bill of sale to the Department of Motor Vehicles and, thereby, obtained clear title to the truck. Plaintiffs sought either a return of the truck or payment of the amount they alleged was still owed. In addition, they sought attorney fees and costs. Defendant answered and admitted to having purchased the truck from Blair, but denied any agreement to pay Benson. Defendant also sought attorney fees and costs in the event that he prevailed against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">As noted, the case was sent to mandatory arbitration. Blair submitted to a deposition before the hearing and testified during the hearing itself. Afterward, the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>entered an award denying both plaintiffs any recovery, finding defendant to be the prevailing party, and awarding defendant his costs and attorney fees pursuant to ORS 20.082. The trial court entered a judgment consistent with the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">Following defendant\u2019s efforts to collect on the judgment by garnishing Blair\u2019s bank account, Blair filed a motion asking the court to set aside the judgment against her \u201cfor the reason that it was obtained by surprise, mistake and excusable neglect.\u201d At the same time, she filed a motion asking \u201cfor an order dismissing her from this suit\u201d under ORCP 21A because, among other things, (1) there was no justiciable controversy pleaded between Blair and defendant; (2) Blair did not consent to being named a plaintiff and \u201cthere was never any service of process\u201d upon her; and (3) the complaint does not \u201cstate a claim for relief on the part of * * * Blair.\u201d In support of her motion to set aside the judgment, Blair filed an affidavit stating that she had not hired Woodard as an attorney, had been included in the complaint by mistake, and \u201cwas never informed that [her] name was on the papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Along with his opposition to the motion, defendant filed affidavits from his attorney and the arbitrator who heard the case, along with Blair\u2019s deposition transcript and letters from Woodard to defendant and to the arbitrator. The arbitrator\u2019s affidavit stated that Woodard had, without any indication to the contrary from Blair, represented himself to be Blair\u2019s attorney at the arbitration. According to the arbitrator, \u201cBlair stated in her testimony that she was entitled to the return of the truck to her\u201d from defendant and, in addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c[defendant\u2019s attorney] brought a motion to dismiss * * * Blair\u2019s claims at the beginning of the arbitration hearing. [Defendant\u2019s attorney] argued that * * * Blair had no valid claims against [defendant]. * * * Blair\u2019s attorney argued that * * * Blair was entitled to return of the vehicle. * * * Blair sat there and listened to the arguments and said nothing. I denied [defendant\u2019s] motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The deposition testimony reflected that, at the beginning of the deposition, defendant\u2019s attorney gave Blair a copy of the complaint \u201cthat [her] attorney filed\u201d and asked her to look it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>over, stating, \u201cI\u2019d like you to read that and if there\u2019s anything in there you don\u2019t feel is accurate, I\u2019d like you to point it out to me.\u201d Blair indicated that, with the possible exception of a discrepancy in the amounts owed to her and Benson, the complaint was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The court held hearings on the motions and heard testimony from Blair and Woodard and arguments from counsel. Blair testified that she had not hired Woodard as her attorney, had not intended to be a plaintiff in the case, and did not understand that she was one until after her bank account was garnished. According to Woodard, however, although he did not have a written retainer agreement with her, he had believed Blair to be his client and had named her as a plaintiff because he thought her to be a necessary party to the case. He also stated that he had represented Blair during her deposition and had met with her to prepare for trial, but that the majority of his communications were with Benson \u201cbecause she had a cell phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">After the hearings, the trial court issued a letter opinion with factual findings and conclusions based on the exhibits that had been filed, along with the testimony at the hearing. The court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201cThe Court finds counsel * * * Woodard, attorney for * * * Benson, believed he was representing * * * Blair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">\u201cThe Court also finds * * * Blair did not ever sign a retainer agreement with * * * Woodard, attorney for * * * Benson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201cAt all material times herein, during the course of this suit, * * * Woodard treated * * * Blair like a client, except he communicated indirectly with * * * Blair through * * * Benson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">\u201cThe Court finds the initial lawsuit in this case filed by * * * Woodard named * * * Blair as a plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">\u201cThe Court finds at the arbitration of this case, between * * * Benson, * * * Blair, and [defendant], wherein * * * Woodard represented, at least in his own mind, * * * Blair and * * * Benson against [defendant] and his counsel * * *[,] Blair acted like a party at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cThe Court finds that * * * Blair did not have any actual loss resulting from an alleged breach of contract by [defendant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201cThe Court also finds any replevin action requested by * * * Woodard, was a general replevin simply stating \u2018plaintiffs pray for the following relief: (a) for the return of their vehicle or, in the alternative, for the payment of the sum owing plus interest;\u2019 However, * * * Blair could not have kept the vehicle if returned. It would have gone to * * * Benson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cThe Court also finds [the a]rbitrator * * * believed * * * Blair was a party apparently based upon his review of the pleadings and the testimony at the arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\"><em>\u201cThe Court cannot discern any possibility of damages that could have been recovered by * </em>* <em>* Blair, nor could * * * Blair have received the vehicle in replevin, and as such she was not entitled to any incidental damages or attorney fees and was in fact, on a legal basis only, a mere witness.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u201cThis case was poorly handled by counsel for the [p]laintiff which carried over into the misconception of all concerned. * * * Blair is not a party to this case, and is not subject to having a [j]udgment taken against her as a party to this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">(Emphasis added.) The court granted the motion to set aside the judgment, apparently based on mistake pursuant to ORCP 71 B(l), and entered a judgment dismissing Blair as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">ORCP 71 B(l) provides, in relevant part, \u201cOn motion or upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or such party\u2019s legal representative from a judgment for the following reasons: (a) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect * * We review the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to set aside the judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Owens and Owens, </em>182 Or App 473, 477, 49 P3d 111 (2002). Although, when a judgment is taken by mistake, the trial court has discretion regarding whether to allow relief from that judgment, <em>see Old Republic Surety Co. v. McIlwain, </em>115 Or App 615, 618, 839 P2d 743 (1992), that discretion is not unfettered, but is controlled by fixed legal principles. <em>Hiatt v. Congoleum Industries, Inc., </em>279 Or 569, 574, 569 P2d 567 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>(1977); <em>see also State ex rel Johnson v. Bail, </em>140 Or App 335, 339, 915 P2d 439 (1996). The court\u2019s discretion \u201cshould be exercised to conform with the spirit of the statute and not to defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Meyer, </em>261 Or 129, 134, 493 P2d 48 (1972). Furthermore, although the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination granting relief from a judgment under ORCP 71 B is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, the issue of whether a mistake has been demonstrated is reviewed for legal error. <em>See Saldivar v. Roberts, </em>240 Or App 371, 376, 246 P3d 91 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in setting aside the judgment because, given the trial court\u2019s findings that Blair \u201cat all times behaved [as] if she was a party to this action, that her attorney believed she was a party in this action, that opposing counsel believed she was a party to this action, and the arbitrator believed she was a party\u201d in the case, \u201cthere was no mistake[.]\u201d Specifically, according to defendant, \u201c[a]t the heart of the trial court\u2019s ruling was the court\u2019s belief that attorney Woodard did a poor job of handling the case\u201d and that the claims were \u201cdoomed to fail from the very beginning[,]\u201d but that is not a basis for relief under ORCP 71 B. Blair, in turn, asserts that the trial court properly granted relief because Woodard was \u201cnot authorized to act as [her] attorney\u201d and, therefore, his \u201cmistake\u201d of naming her as a plaintiff \u201ccannot be held against her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We begin by noting that the premises of Blair\u2019s argument \u2014 that she did not know that she was a party to the case and that her inclusion in the case as a plaintiff was unauthorized and, factually, a mistake \u2014 are not supported by the trial court\u2019s findings, nor were they a basis for the trial court\u2019s decision. The trial court did <em>not </em>find that Blair was unaware that she had been named as a plaintiff in this case and, in fact, found that she \u201cacted like a party at all times\u201d and that other people involved in the case, therefore, believed her to be a party. Although the court did find that Blair did not sign a retainer agreement, it did not find as fact that Woodard had never been authorized to act as her attorney, nor did it base its ruling on those considerations. Instead, the trial court granted Blair\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment based on its conclusion that she could not obtain relief \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>she \u201cdid not have any actual loss\u201d \u2014 and that, therefore, <em>\u201con a legal basis only, </em>[she was] a mere witness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, the \u201cmistake\u201d on which the trial court apparently based its ruling was the mistake of filing a claim that should never have been brought and upon which Blair could not have recovered anything. That does not justify relief from the judgment pursuant to ORCP 71 B(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Whatever \u201cmistake\u201d means, ORCP 71 B(l) does not exist to save a party from the consequences of bringing an ill-advised case. <em>Cf. Wills and Wills, </em>94 Or App 546, 549, 765 P2d 1260 (1988) (\u201cWhatever the meaning of\u2018mistake,\u2019 ORCP 71 cannot be used as a subterfuge to avoid\u201d the rule governing new trials.). Blair was named as a plaintiff in the complaint and attended depositions and the arbitration in the case. The judgment was based on an arbitration award after a full hearing in which all parties participated. Defendant was required to defend the case, and successfully did so, and the arbitrator determined that he was legally entitled to attorney fees. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that Blair\u2019s claim should never have been filed and that \u201con a legal basis\u201d she was only a witness to the transaction is simply not a \u201cmistake\u201d for which the rule provides a remedy. Such an application of the rule would do \u201cviolence to the regular disposition of litigation.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Stancorp Financial Group Inc., </em>233 Or App 57, 61, 225 P3d 71 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 218 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings do not support relief pursuant to ORCP 71 B and that the trial court abused its discretion in granting such relief. <em>Cf. Patrick v. State of Oregon, </em>178 Or App 97, 105, 36 P3d 976 (2001) (\u201cA trial court has no discretion * * * to vacate or modify its own judgment for the sole purpose of contravening or circumventing other important limitations that flow from the finality of judgments * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
