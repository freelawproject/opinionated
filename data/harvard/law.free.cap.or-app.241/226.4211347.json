J.</author>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, and one count of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.408. On appeal, defendant contends that, under <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), the trial court erred in admitting, over defendant\u2019s objection, a physician\u2019s expert diagnosis, in the absence of diagnostic physical findings, that the victim had been sexually abused. The state does not dispute that <em>Southard </em>controls and that the trial court erred in admitting the diagnosis of sexual abuse. Instead, the state contends that the court\u2019s error was harmless. As explained below, we cannot say that, notwithstanding the erroneously admitted diagnosis, there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The material circumstances for purposes of our review are not controverted. Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, and one count of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.408. As pertinent here, ORS 163.427(1) provides that a person commits first-degree sexual abuse if, among other things, the person \u201c[s]ubjects another person to sexual contact.\u201d ORS 163.408 provides, in pertinent part, that a person commits second-degree unlawful sexual penetration \u201cif the person penetrates the vagina * * * of another with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">At trial, defendant\u2019s position was that he was not guilty of the charged conduct, but that, if he was, he was guilty but insane under ORS 161.295. Defendant did not admit that the alleged conduct occurred; rather, he testified that he did not remember engaging in that conduct. Alternatively, defendant took the position that he suffered from dissociative identity disorder and that, if the alleged conduct occurred, his other personality, \u201cJosh,\u201d was responsible for it. Specifically, the following exchange took place at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] * * * So you don\u2019t remember whether you did this to [the victim] or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201c[DEFENDANT:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] Correct? Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT:] I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] * * * And if it happened, did you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] Who did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT:] Josh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">The state offered the testimony of several witnesses to prove that defendant engaged in the conduct constituting sexual abuse and unlawful sexual penetration. In addition to the testimony of the victim and her mother, the state introduced the testimony of Dr. Janey Purvis, a physician with specialized training in child abuse and neglect. Purvis testified, over defendant\u2019s objection, to her diagnosis that \u201cit was highly likely that [the victim] had experienced sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">The jury convicted defendant of all three charges. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">As previously indicated, on appeal, the state does not dispute that, under <em>Southard, </em>the trial court erred in admitting Purvis\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse. Instead, relying primarily on our decision in <em>State v. Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>238 Or App 160, 241 P3d 1194 (2010), the state contends that the error was harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">\u201cGiven that defendant did not seriously contest that the abuse occurred (he asserted only that he did not remember whether he had abused [the victim] and that, if the abuse in fact occurred, his alternate personality was responsible), there is little likelihood Dr. Purvis\u2019s sexual-abuse diagnosis affected the verdict. At bottom, this case turned on whether the jury would accept defendant\u2019s guilty-but-insane defense. Whether the abuse occurred was, for all practical purposes, not in dispute. At trial, [the victim] gave detailed testimony about the abuse and her mother testified that defendant \u2014 purportedly speaking to her through his other personality, Josh \u2014 had admitted to it. Defendant did not seriously challenge the credibility of their testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Against that backdrop, admission of the sexual-abuse diagnosis was harmless error. That evidence was not relevant to, and thus could not have affected, the jury\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s guilty-but-insane defense. The challenged evidence went only to whether defendant had committed the alleged criminal acts (effectively undisputed), not to his mental state- \u2014 the question presented by his guilty-but-insane defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">For the reasons explained below, we disagree with the state that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis </em>frames the proper inquiry. In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court determined that, under Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict? The correct focus of the inquiry regarding affirmance despite error is on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a fact-finder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">336 Or at 32. Further, in <em>Davis,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201c[t]he Supreme Court further explained that a variety of considerations may properly inform that \u2018single inquiry,\u2019 including \u2018the nature of the error that occurred below,\u2019 <em>id., </em>and the \u2018context of the legal error.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 33. The court noted, for example, that the erroneous exclusion or admission of evidence would be harmless \u2018if the particular issue to which the error pertains has no relationship to the jury\u2019s determination of its verdict,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 32, or if the jury \u2018would have regarded the * * * evidence as duplicative or unhelpful to its deliberations.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 33. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>concluded that the erroneous exclusion was not harmless, because it could not \u2018say that the excluded statements were merely cumulative of admitted evidence \u2014 and, indeed, \u2018were qualitatively different than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>evidence that the jury heard\u2019 \u2014 and because \u2018the excluded evidence goes directly to the heart of defendant\u2019s factual theory of the case.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 34.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><em>State v. Perkins, </em>221 Or App 136, 143, 188 P3d 482 (2008) (quoting <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32-34) (omission in <em>Perkins).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Here, the state seeks to cast Purvis\u2019s diagnosis as pertaining to an \u201ceffectively undisputed\u201d <em>issue </em>\u2014 viz., whether defendant had committed the alleged criminal acts. As previously indicated \u2014 and as is inherent in the state\u2019s own characterization \u2014 that issue was not undisputed. Defendant did not admit that he engaged in the alleged criminal conduct. Although the state is correct that defendant raised a guilty but insane defense in this case, the state was not relieved of its burden to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. For that reason, Purvis\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse went \u201cdirectly to the heart of [the state\u2019s] factual theory of the case.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Our decision in <em>Sanchez-Alfonso </em>is not to the contrary. In that case, we held that, even if \u201can expert witness\u2019s diagnosis of physical child abuse at the hands of a particular actor \u2014 [the] defendant \u2014 is [not] admissible scientific evidence,\u201d the trial court\u2019s \u201cadmission of the challenged evidence was harmless.\u201d 238 Or App at 162. Specifically, we reasoned that \u201c[the] defendant never posited that anyone other than [the] defendant himself caused the physical injuries * * * at issue in the indictment\u201d and that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c[a]t the heart of this case was the parties\u2019 disagreement about [the] defendant\u2019s mental state when he injured [the victim] on the date in question. In contrast, the challenged evidence went to a part of the case that was not meaningfully at issue, namely, [the] defendant\u2019s role as the causal agent of those injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In <em>Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>unlike in this case, the physical evidence of abuse \u2014 including evidence that the victim suffered a skull fracture \u2014 was patent, and the defendant did not dispute that physical injuries occurred or that he was the causal agent. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 170. By contrast, in this case, there were no diagnostic physical findings of abuse. Rather, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>noted, defendant\u2019s position was that, <em>if </em>the alleged conduct occurred, his other personality, \u201cJosh,\u201d was responsible for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Further, to the extent that the state contends that the diagnosis was merely cumulative of the testimony of lay witnesses that defendant had engaged in the unlawful conduct, we disagree. The physician\u2019s medical diagnosis was \u201cqualitatively different than the [other] evidence that the jury heard.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 34. As the court noted in <em>Southard, </em>such a diagnosis comes from a \u201ccredentialed expert, surrounded with the hallmarks of the scientific method.\u201d 347 Or at 140. <em>See id. </em>at 141 (noting the \u201csubstantial risk that the jury may be overly impressed or prejudiced by a perhaps misplaced aura of reliability or validity of the evidence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In sum, we cannot say that there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the erroneously admitted diagnosis affected the verdict given the scientific nature of the diagnosis and its relationship to a disputed element of the charged crimes\u2014 that is, whether defendant actually engaged in the unlawful conduct. Accordingly, the admission of the diagnosis was not harmless and we must reverse defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> Article VII (Amended), section 3, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">\u201cIf the supreme court shall be of opinion, after consideration of all the matters thus submitted, that the judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed, notwithstanding any error committed during the trial[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> Our disposition in that regard obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s admission of the physician\u2019s nondiagnostic physical findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
