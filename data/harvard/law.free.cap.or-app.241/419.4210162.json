J.</author>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Defendant, who entered a conditional plea of guilty, ORS 135.335(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for misdemeanor driving while suspended or revoked, ORS 811.182(4), appeals from the resulting judgment, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a traffic stop. We agree with defendant that the stop violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the evidence obtained was the unattenuated product of that illegality. Accordingly, because the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We take the uncontroverted facts from the testimony at the suppression hearing. On the morning of June 4, 2007, Deputy Cochran saw defendant driving his vehicle on a highway. Cochran testified that he noticed <em>\u201ca </em>large crack in the windshield, which is a violation of statute, and so I pulled him over for that.\u201d Defendant testified that the crack \u201cstarts * * * on the driver\u2019s side four inches up from the bottom of the windshield. And then it progressively goes to the passenger side heading down towards the bottom of the windshield.\u201d According to defendant, the crack was \u201c18 inches to two feet\u201d long. When Cochran was asked how \u201ca crack like that [would] obstruct the vision either into or out of the vehicle,\u201d he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201c[I]t depends. Some people drive around with big spiderwebs, that wasn\u2019t what this case was, you know, that would be more apparent. But anything as simple as one line, it may be in your direction of vision, it may be on the side of the window where you\u2019re looking through as you\u2019re turning or something like that. Another problem is because I had a cracked windshield with just one line that was cracked from a baseball game, is that cracked windshield will act like, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sometimes like a prism with that crack and you get cracked glass and when the sunlight shines through it it will, you know, glint and glare off of that crack which is distracting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">During the stop, Cochran learned that defendant \u201chad a suspended license.\u201d Ultimately, Cochran cited defendant for driving with a suspended license, ORS 811.182(4), and gave him a warning concerning the windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the stop, contending that the deputy did not have probable cause to stop him for a traffic violation pursuant to ORS 815.220. As pertinent here, that statute prohibits driving a vehicle when the windshield is obstructed by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\"><em>\u201cany material </em>that prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle * * *. This subsection applies to any sign, poster, one-way glass, adhesive film, glaze application or other material if the material prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">ORS 815.220(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">At the suppression hearing, defendant\u2019s attorney argued that, under ORS 815.220, a crack is not a \u201cmaterial that prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle.\u201d Specifically, defendant\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201c[T]he statute itself discusses materials that obstruct the window. And the particular examples it gives in the statute includes posters, signs, one-way glass, adhesive film and glaze application. This has to do with tinted windows and decals. And these are added materials to the window. In this case we have a crack, and I don\u2019t believe that a crack is within the statute even.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The state disagreed with defendant\u2019s understanding of ORS 815.220. Instead, the state contended that probable cause existed for the deputy to stop defendant under the statute because it proscribes \u201cany impairment of seeing into or out of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, reasoning that the deputy had probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 815.220. Specifically, in its order, the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201cCochran had probable cause to stop the defendant to investigate the violation of having obstructed vehicle windows. * * * Cochran\u2019s probable cause was based on: 1) His subjective belief that it was more likely than not that the defendant had violated the statute; and 2) his belief was supported by objectively reasonable and articulable facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s windshield was cracked at the time he [was] stopped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">After the court denied defendant\u2019s motion, he entered a guilty plea, reserving, in writing, the right to appeal the court\u2019s ruling on that motion. ORS 135.335(3). This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">On appeal, defendant reiterates his contentions before the trial court. Specifically, defendant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cDefendant drove a vehicle with a large crack along the bottom of his front windshield. Deputy Cochran stopped defendant because he believed that the crack was capable of obstructing defendant\u2019s ability to see out of the vehicle in violation of ORS 815.220. ORS 815.220 prohibits driving a vehicle when the windshield is obstructed by a \u2018material that prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle.\u2019 Because a windshield crack is not a \u2018material\u2019 within the plain meaning of the word, Deputy Cochran did not have probable cause to believe that defendant violated the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u201cWithout probable cause to support the stop, defendant was stopped in violation of Article I, section 9[,] of the Oregon Constitution and in violation of ORS 810.410(3)(b). Thus, all evidence obtained as a result of the stop should be suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In response, the state contends that the deputy, after seeing the crack, had probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 815.220 because \u201c[t]here was no way for the officer to determine whether the crack was a \u2018material\u2019 upon the windshield * * * without stopping defendant.\u201d Alternatively, the state contends that, even if the deputy lacked probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 815.220, the stop was lawful because the deputy had probable cause to believe that defendant committed <em>a </em>traffic infraction. In support of that contention, the state notes that defendant \u201cpossibl[y]\u201d or \u201cpotentially\u201d violated other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>statutes </em>\u2014 viz., ORS 815.270 (operating a vehicle that is loaded or equipped to obstruct the driver), ORS 815.100 (operating a vehicle that violates certain Department of Transportation standards), ORS 815.020 (operating an unsafe vehicle), and ORS 815.210 (operating a vehicle without approved materials in the windows, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ca windshield or windows that do not conform\u201d to Department of Transportation standards). Ultimately, the state posits that, \u201c[b]ecause the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant\u2019s cracked windshield violated <em>a </em>traffic law, the stop was valid.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s contention concerning probable cause. In <em>State v. Tiffin, </em>202 Or App 199, 203, 121 P3d 9 (2005), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">\u201cAn officer may lawfully stop and detain a person for a traffic infraction if the officer has \u2018probable cause to believe that an infraction has been committed.\u2019 <em>State v. Isley, </em>182 Or App 186, 190, 48 P3d 179 (2002). \u2018Probable cause exists if, at the time of the stop, the officer subjectively believes that the infraction occurred and if that belief is objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In this case, defendant does not contend that the deputy lacked the subjective belief that defendant violated ORS 815.220. Instead, he challenges the objective reasonableness of that belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In <em>State v. Boatright, </em>222 Or App 406, 410, 193 P3d 78, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008), we summarized the general principles circumscribing our inquiry into whether an officer\u2019s belief is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">\u201c[A]n officer\u2019s belief may be objectively reasonable even if it turns out to be incorrect. Thus, probable cause may be based on a mistake of fact. Moreover, probable cause may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>be based on a mistake as to <em>which </em>law the defendant violated. Nevertheless, in order to satisfy the objective component, the facts that the officer perceives to exist must establish the elements of <em>an </em>offense, even if not the offense that the officer believed the defendant committed. Finally, although the facts as perceived by the officer must constitute the elements of an offense, in order to satisfy the objective component, an officer need not eliminate the possibility that a defense or exception to the offense applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis in original.) As we summarized in <em>Tiffin, </em>and as pertinent in this case, \u201can officer\u2019s subjective belief that a traffic infraction occurred is objectively reasonable if, and only if, the facts as the officer perceived them actually satisfy the elements of a traffic infraction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 202 Or App at 204. With that principle in mind, we turn to the crux of this case \u2014 that is, whether the deputy had objective probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 815.220.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">ORS 815.220 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of obstruction of vehicle windows if the person drives or moves on any highway or owns and causes or knowingly permits to be driven or moved on any highway any vehicle with windows obstructed in a manner prohibited under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\u201c(2) The windows of a vehicle are obstructed in a manner prohibited by this section if <em>any material </em>that prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle is upon any vehicle window described in this subsection. This subsection applies to any sign, poster, one-way glass, adhesive film, glaze application or other material if the material prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle. This subsection only applies to the following windows of the vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201c(a) The front windshield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The dispositive issue here is whether, for purposes of ORS 815.220(2), a crack is <em>\u201cany material </em>that prohibits or impairs the ability to see into or out of the vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In resolving that issue, we adhere to the principles described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as amplified in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). In general, \u201cwe examine the text and context of the statute, as well as any legislative history offered by the parties that, in the court\u2019s determination, is pertinent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State v. Bassett, </em>234 Or App 259, 265, 228 P3d 590, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 461 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The term \u201cmaterial\u201d is not defined in the statute; consequently, we look to its \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. As pertinent, \u201cmaterial\u201d is defined to variously mean (1) \u201cthe basic matter (as metal, wood, plastic, fiber) from which the whole or the greater part of something physical (as a machine, tool, building, fabric) is made\u201d; (2) \u201cthe finished stuff of which something physical (as an article of clothing) is made\u201d; or (3) \u201cthe whole or a notable part of the elements or constituents or substance of something physical &lt;the solid <em>~s </em>of the mixture will settle to the bottom of the container) or not physical &lt;the ~ of his character was basically good&gt;.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1392 (unabridged ed 2002). The essence of those definitions is that \u201cmaterial\u201d is generally something that has physical substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u201cMaterial,\u201d in the context of ORS 815.220(2), unambiguously connotes something that has physical substance for two reasons. First, a physical substance is something that, in the terms of the statute, may be <em>\u201cupon </em>any vehicle window.\u201d ORS 815.220(2) (emphasis added). Second, the statute itself refers to particular items that constitute <em>\u201cmaterial\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cany sign, poster, one-way glass, adhesive film, glaze application\u201d \u2014 all of which are things of physical substance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Applying that construction to this case, we readily conclude that a crack is not a \u201cmaterial.\u201d As defendant posits, \u201ca crack is not a tangible or physical object separate from the window itself. It does not have its own substance beyond pure window glass.\u201d Here, the deputy stopped defendant because he saw a crack in defendant\u2019s windshield.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, because the facts, as the deputy actually perceived them, did not satisfy the elements of ORS 815.220(2), he lacked objective probable cause to stop defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Having concluded that the deputy lacked probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 815.220, we turn to the state\u2019s alternative contention that the deputy had probable cause to believe that defendant committed some other traffic infraction. The state is correct that \u201can officer\u2019s inability to identify the specific law violated or an officer\u2019s mistaken identification of the wrong statute violated does not make a stop unlawful\u201d and \u201c[t]he key is whether the officer had probable cause to believe that a traffic infraction had occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>149 Or App 662, 666, 945 P2d 544 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Nonetheless, we decline to address the state\u2019s alternative contention. The state\u2019s argument in the trial court focused exclusively on ORS 815.220 \u2014 that is, the state did not point to any of the statutes that it now raises on appeal. Had the state attempted to rely on those statutes in the trial court, defendant might well have developed the record differently. <em>See Tiffin, </em>202 Or App at 202 (declining to address the state\u2019s alternative \u201cargument that the stop was lawful based on the officers\u2019 reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving under the influence because the state did not make that argument to the trial court\u201d; reasoning that, \u201c[h]ad the state done so, defendant might have developed a different record below\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In sum, because the deputy lacked probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 815.220, the stop violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the evidence obtained was the unattenuated product of that illegality. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> ORS 135.335(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201cWith the consent of the court and the state, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or no contest reserving, in writing, the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of an adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion.

In his brief, defendant notes that \u201c[t]he legislature first enacted ORS 815.220 as part of House Bill 2031 in 1983. Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 490\u201d and that a \u201csurvey of the committee minutes associated with that bill did not shed any light on the question of statutory interpretation at issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\"> The record is explicit in that respect.
