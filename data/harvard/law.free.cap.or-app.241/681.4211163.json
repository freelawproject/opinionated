He raises five assignments of error challenging his rape and sexual abuse convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the rape and sexual abuse counts. We reject that assignment of error without discussion and write only to address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which he asserts that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that, in order to convict him of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse, the state was required to prove that he knowingly subjected the victim to forcible compulsion. We agree with defendant and, accordingly, reverse his convictions for those crimes. In light of that conclusion, defendant\u2019s three remaining assignments of error \u2014 which assert that the trial court erred in failing to merge defendant\u2019s three first-degree sexual abuse convictions, entering more than one sexual abuse conviction on the basis of findings not reflected in the jury verdict, and imposing consecutive sentences \u2014 are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Defendant was charged by indictment with, among other things, first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse. The indictment alleged that defendant had committed the crimes of first-degree sexual abuse by \u201cunlawfully and knowingly [,] by means of forcible compulsion, subjecting the victim] to sexual contact\u201d and that defendant had committed the crime of first-degree rape by \u201cunlawfully and knowingly, by forcible compulsion, engaging] in sexual intercourse with [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">ORS 163.375 establishes the crime of first-degree rape and, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201c(1) A person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201c(a) The victim is <em>subjected to forcible compulsion </em>by the person!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Similarly, ORS 163.427 establishes, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first-degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\"><em>&lt;l* * </em>* * ijc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201c(B) The victim is <em>subjected to forcible compulsion </em>by the actor[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">(Emphasis added.) Hence, in order for the jury to convict defendant of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse, the state was required to prove, among other things, that defendant subjected the victim to forcible compulsion. In turn, ORS 163.305(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201c \u2018Forcible compulsion\u2019 means to compel by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">\u201c(a) Physical force; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">\u201c(b) A threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of immediate or future death or physical injury to self or another person, or in fear that the person or another person will immediately or in the future be kidnapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Defendant submitted to the trial court a written jury instruction that would have told the jury that it could convict defendant of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse only if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowingly subjected the victim to forcible compulsion. The court refused to give defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction and, instead, gave the following instruction about the required elements of those crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\">\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of Sex Abuse in the First Degree when the person knowingly subjects another to sexual contact and the victim is subject to forcible compulsion by the actor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-14\">\u201cSo in this case to establish the crime of Sex Abuse\u2014 Sexual Abuse in the First Degree as alleged in Count 2, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements: Number one, the act occurred in Multnomah County, Oregon; number two, that the act occurred on or about April 7, 2007; number three, that [the defendant] knowingly subjected [the victim] to sexual contact * * *; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>number four, <em>that [the victim] was subjected] to forcible compulsion by the actor, that is, the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cIn this case to establish the crime of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree as alleged in Count 3, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt * * * that [the defendant] knowingly subjected [the victim] to sexual contact * * *; and * * * <em>that [the victim] was subjected to forcible compulsion by the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201cAnd in this case to establish the crime of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree as alleged in Count 4, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt * * * that [the defendant] knowingly subjected [the victim] to sexual contact * * *; and * * * <em>that [the victim] was subjected to forcible compulsion by the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">* * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of Rape in the First Degree if the person knowingly has sexual intercourse with another and the other person is subjected to forcible compulsion by him. So in this case to establish the crime of Rape in the First Degree as alleged in Count 6, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements: Number one, that the act occurred in Multnomah County, Oregon; number two, that the act occurred on or about April 7, 2007; number three, that [the defendant] knowingly had sexual intercourse with [the victim]; and, number four, <em>that [the victim] was subjected to forcible compulsion by him.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">(Emphasis added.) The court also instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">\u201c[florcible compulsion is defined as follows: * * * To compel by either physical force or a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of imminent or future death or physical injury to self or another person or in fear that the other person will immediately or in the future be kidnapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">As can thus be seen, the trial court\u2019s jury instructions did not tell the jury that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had <em>knowingly </em>subjected the victim to forcible compulsion in order to convict him of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse. After the court instructed the jury, defendant took an exception to the court\u2019s failure to give his proposed instruction requiring the state to prove that he knowingly subjected the victim to forcible compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that forcible compulsion is a material element of the crimes of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse and that, therefore, the state was required to prove a culpable mental state with respect to that element. In light of that requirement, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the state was required to prove that he knowingly subjected the victim to forcible compulsion. As explained below, we agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We review a court\u2019s instructions to a jury for legal error. <em>State v. Crosby, </em>342 Or 419, 427, 154 P3d 97 (2007). Accordingly, we begin by relating the relevant legal framework. Both ORS 163.375 and ORS 163.427 are part of the Oregon Criminal Code, <em>see </em>ORS 161.005, and neither statute explicitly prescribes a culpable mental state for the crimes of first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree rape. Accordingly, ORS 161.095(2) and ORS 161.115(2) govern whether and how a culpable mental state attaches to the elements of those crimes. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rainoldi, </em>236 Or App 129, 141-47, 235 P3d 710 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>349 Or 654 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">ORS 161.115(2) explains that, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in ORS 161.105, if a statute defining an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state, culpability is nonetheless required and is established only if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, ORS 161.095(2) provides that \u201ca person is not guilty of an offense unless the person acts with a culpable mental state with respect to <em>each material element of the offense that necessarily requires a culpable mental state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Generally speaking, there are three categories of material elements in Oregon\u2019s criminal statutes: conduct, circumstance, and result. <em>Crosby, </em>342 Or at 429. As has frequently been noted, the task of determining whether an element of a crime is a material one \u201cthat necessarily requires a culpable mental state,\u201d ORS 161.095(2), \u201chas long vexed Oregon courts,\u201d <em>Rainoldi, </em>236 Or App at 141.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>recent decision in <em>Rainoldi </em>has helped to clarify the contours of that analysis. After engaging in a thorough review of the legislative history of ORS 161.095 and ORS 161.115, we concluded in <em>Rainoldi </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">\u201cthe phrase \u2018that necessarily requires a culpable mental state\u2019 requires us to determine whether the element in question concerns the substance or quality of the crime\u2014 the harm or evil sought to be prevented \u2014 or whether the element concerns venue, jurisdiction, statute of limitations, or something similar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">236 Or App at 147. Thus, we must determine whether the element of the crimes of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse requiring the victim to have been \u201csubjected to forcible compulsion\u201d by defendant is a material one that relates to the harm or evil that the legislature sought to prevent by enacting those statutes. If so, then it is a material element of the crimes of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse to which a culpable mental state applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">First, we conclude that the \u201csubjected to forcible compulsion\u201d element of both first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse is properly categorized as conduct that constitutes a material element of those crimes. A person who is subjected to forcible compulsion under those statutes necessarily is also the target of a specific act by the defendant\u2014 viz., \u201cphysical force\u201d or \u201c[a] threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of immediate or future death or physical injury to self or another person, or in fear that the person or another person will immediately or in the future be kidnapped.\u201d ORS 163.305(2); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2275 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining the verb form of \u201csubject,\u201d in part, to mean \u201cto bring under control or dominion : SUBJUGATE subjecting primitive peoples to colonial rule&gt;\u201d). Accordingly, the \u201csubjected to forcible compulsion\u201d element describes a particular form of prohibited conduct and is thus a material element of the crimes of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse. <em>See Crosby, </em>342 Or at 429 (\u201cConduct * * * [is one of] the types of material elements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>will be found in criminal statutes.\u201d); ORS 161.085(4) (defining \u201cconduct\u201d as \u201can act or omission and its accompanying mental state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Second, we conclude that the \u201csubjected to forcible compulsion\u201d element of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse \u201cnecessarily requires a culpable mental state\u201d because it directly \u201cconcerns the substance or quality of the crime[s] \u2014 the harm or evil sought to be prevented.\u201d <em>Rainoldi, </em>236 Or App at 147. The words used by the legislature in ORS 163.375 and ORS 163.427 to describe those crimes cement our conclusion. The requirement that a defendant have subjected a victim to forcible compulsion is the specific additional element that elevates nonconsensual sexual intercourse from a Class C felony, ORS 163.425, to a Class A felony, ORS 163.375(l)(a), (2); and that elevates nonconsensual sexual contact from a Class A misdemeanor, ORS 163.415(l)(a), (2), to a Class B felony, ORS 163.427(l)(a)(B), (2). Those statutory distinctions embody a legislative choice to impose a greater punishment when a defendant goes beyond subjecting the victim to nonconsensual sexual intercourse or sexual contact by subjecting the victim to forcible compulsion. Thus, the act of subjecting a victim to forcible compulsion is a \u201charm or evil\u201d that the legislature specifically sought to prevent in enacting ORS 163.375 and ORS 163.427. <em>Rainoldi, </em>236 Or App at 147. Accordingly, a culpable mental state applies to the forcible compulsion element of those crimes, and the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with the requisite mental state with respect to that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We need not decide in this case which culpable mental states apply to the forcible compulsion elements of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse. That is because the state indicted defendant for those crimes referring solely to a \u201cknowing\u201d mental state and, thus, the state was required to prove that defendant acted with a \u201cknowing\u201d mental state with respect to all material elements of the crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>State v. Bell, </em>220 Or App 266, 269, 185 P3d 541 (2008) (\u201cAlthough ORS 164.135 specifies no culpable mental state, because the state alleged in its indictment that defendant acted \u2018knowingly,\u2019 the state was required to prove that defendant <em>actually knew </em>that the car was stolen.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); <em>State v. Lane, </em>341 Or 433, 440, 144 P3d 927 (2006) (concluding that the state was required to prove the culpable mental state alleged in the indictment despite the fact that the relevant criminal statute specified no mental state).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">In light of the above considerations, we conclude that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that, in order to convict defendant of first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse, the state was required to prove that defendant knowingly subjected the victim to forcible compulsion. <em>See State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 209-10, 82 P3d 130 (2003) (conviction reversed because instructions allowed jury to find the defendant guilty even if jury failed to find the state had proven an element of the crime); <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 356, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (trial court committed reversible error by failing to instruct jury on element of crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Convictions for first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-9\"> Defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree rape and three counts of first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> The exceptions provided in ORS 161.105 apply to offenses that constitute a violation or that exist outside the Oregon Criminal Code and, thus, are not applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> <em>See, e.g., State v.
