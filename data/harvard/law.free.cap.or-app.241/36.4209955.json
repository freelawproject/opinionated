J.</author>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Defendant appeals from his convictions for, among other offenses, second-degree assault, ORS 163.175,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assigning error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of restitution. Defendant argues that, because he objected to the imposition of restitution, he was entitled to a restitution hearing under ORS 137.106(5). The state concedes that the trial court erred by imposing restitution without first affording defendant a hearing. As explained below, we find that concession to be well founded, and we accept it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Defendant was convicted of a variety of offenses arising out of an automobile accident that he caused by driving at a high rate of speed while under the influence of alcohol. At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the prosecutor informed the court that the state was seeking $383,667.97 in restitution on behalf of an insurance company, together with an additional $1,089.40 in restitution for one of defendant\u2019s victims. Defendant\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u2018Your honor, I don\u2019t think that [defendant] is opposed to paying the reasonable medical costs of the victims, but absent a more detailed showing or cost breakdown, I think that we would prefer to have a restitution hearing in order to at least be able to parse out which of these things is medically related and which of these is property related and how much of this is insurance requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The trial court agreed that \u201cthere needs to be a restitution hearing[.] * * * This is a significant amount of money so we can\u2019t just skim right over that. We will have a restitution hearing unless the parties can agree to an amount.\u201d The court then continued with defendant\u2019s sentencing. After imposing incarcerative sentences, the court stated that \u201cnow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>restitution, as we discussed earlier in this hearing, is going to be left open because of the amount requested and, frankly, the lack of detail.\u201d However, the court did not hold a restitution hearing, but ultimately imposed, in a written judgment, restitution in the amounts of $383,667.97 in favor of the insurance company, and $1,089.40 for the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">ORS 137.106 governs the imposition of restitution as a sanction upon a person\u2019s conviction for a crime. That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201c(1) When a person is convicted of a crime, or a violation as described in ORS 153.008, that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall include one of the following in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201c(5) If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount or distribution of the restitution, the court shall allow the defendant to be heard on such issue at the time of sentencing or at the time the court determines the amount of restitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The plain text of ORS 137.106(5) requires that, when a defendant objects to the amount of restitution and asks for a hearing, the trial court must accede to such a request. The failure to do so constitutes reversible error. <em>State v. Zaragoza, </em>220 Or App 526, 530, 188 P3d 308 (2008); <em>State v. Hval, </em>174 Or App 164, 174, 25 P3d 958, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 559 (2001). In this case, as the state rightly concedes, defendant adequately objected to the imposition of restitution in favor of the insurance company and sought a restitution hearing. Defendant was not afforded a hearing, and we therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> ORS 163.175 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the second degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">\u00ab* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">\u201c(c) Recklessly causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-12\"> We reject without further discussion defendant\u2019s further assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
