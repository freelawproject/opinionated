The state charged defendant with one count of reckless driving, ORS 811.140, and two counts of recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195, for speeding on the AstoriaMegler Bridge between Oregon and Washington. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that the Oregon police officer who arrested him in Washington violated Washington\u2019s Fresh Pursuit Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the Act) by bringing him back to Oregon without first presenting him to a Washington magistrate for a hearing on the lawfulness of the arrest. Defendant argued that the officer\u2019s violation of the Act constituted a due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court agreed and granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the officer had violated the Act and that the violation \u201crepresented a denial of due process\u201d that \u201c[could ]not be condoned.\u201d The trial court explained that, although \u201cdismissal of [defendant\u2019s] case may seem a harsh result,\u201d there was \u201cno other suitable remedy given the violation of [d]efendant\u2019s basic constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">On appeal, the state does not dispute that the officer violated the Act but contends that that violation does not constitute a due process violation that requires dismissal of the charges against defendant. For the reasons explained below, we agree and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We begin with the facts. On August 31,2007, Astoria Police Officer Ayet saw defendant driving northbound at a high rate of speed on the Astoria-Megler Bridge between Clatsop County, Oregon, and Pacific County, Washington. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The speed limit on the bridge is 55 miles per hour. Using radar, Ayet determined that defendant was driving at 121 miles per hour. While on the Oregon side of the bridge, Ayet activated his patrol car\u2019s overhead lights to stop defendant. Ayet believed defendant was not simply violating Oregon\u2019s speeding statute, ORS 811.100, but was also violating Oregon\u2019s reckless driving statute, ORS 811.140.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The bridge is a two-lane road with no shoulder, and defendant was not able to pull over safely until he was off the bridge in Washington. Ayet pulled over behind defendant\u2019s car and approached defendant. Ayet informed defendant of the reason for the stop and observed that defendant had two passengers in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Ayet called a Clatsop County prosecutor to ask whether he could bring defendant back to Oregon. Ayet testified that he called the prosecutor because it is <em>\u201ca </em>tangled mess when you cross the bridge, and I wanted to make sure whether I could bring [defendant] back, whether I had to give him a ticket there, whether I had to turn him over to a Washington trooper, or Pacific County.\u201d The deputy district attorney told Ayet that he could bring defendant back to Oregon. Ayet arrested defendant and put him in his patrol car. With defendant\u2019s permission, Ayet released defendant\u2019s car to defendant\u2019s passengers. Ayet then brought defendant to the Clatsop County Jail, with the intent that defendant would be processed, cited, and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The Clatsop County District Attorney\u2019s Office charged defendant by information with one count of reckless driving and two counts of recklessly endangering another person. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss the case, arguing that Ayet violated his due process rights by violating Washington\u2019s Fresh Pursuit Act. As noted, the Act provides, in part, that an officer who is in fresh pursuit of a person suspected of a felony or certain driving crimes, including reckless driving, can arrest the person in Washington, RCW 10.89.010, and, if the officer does so, then the officer has to take the person to a magistrate for a hearing on the lawfulness of the arrest, RCW 10.89.020.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Specifically, RCW 10.89.010 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u201cAny member of a duly organized state, county or municipal peace unit of another state of the United States who enters this state in fresh pursuit, and continues within this state in such fresh pursuit, of a person in order to arrest the person on the ground that he or she is believed to have committed a felony in such other state or a violation of the laws of such other state relating to driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, driving while impaired, or reckless driving shall have the same authority to arrest and hold such person in custody as has any member of any duly organized state, county or municipal peace unit of this state, to arrest and hold in custody a person on the ground that he or she is believed to have committed a felony or a violation of the laws of such other state relating to driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, driving while impaired, or reckless driving in this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">RCW 10.89.020, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\u201cIf an arrest is made in this state by an officer of another state in accordance with the provisions of RCW 10.89.010, he shall, without unnecessary delay, take the person arrested before a magistrate of the county in which the arrest was made, who shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of the arrest. If the magistrate determines that the arrest was lawful, he shall commit the person arrested to await for a reasonable time the issuance of an extradition warrant by the governor of this state. If the magistrate determines that the arrest was unlawful, he shall discharge the person arrested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Defendant argued that Ayet violated RCW 10.89.020 and, thereby, violated his due process rights. Specifically, defendant argued that the police \u201cessentially kidnapped him and brought him back to the [S]tate of Oregon, without affording him the due process that Washington allows\u201d and that that amounted to a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">As noted, the trial court concluded that Ayet had authority to stop and arrest defendant in Washington under RCW 10.89.010, but that Ayet violated RCW 10.89.020 when he failed to bring defendant before a magistrate for a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>on the lawfulness of the arrest. The court further concluded that the violation of RCW 10.89.020 constituted a due process violation. The court set out its findings and conclusions in a letter opinion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\u201c6. Sgt. [Ayet] had the authority under Washington\u2019s \u2018fresh pursuit\u2019 statute to enter into Washington for the purpose of pursuing Defendant and arresting him for the crime of Reckless Driving. RCW 10.89.010 and 10.89.020. Sgt. [Ayet\u2019s] stop of Defendant in Washington for the crime of Reckless Driving was lawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201c7. Sgt. [Ayet] did not comply with the provisions of RCW 10.89.020 which require that he take Defendant before a magistrate of Pacific County, Washington, for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">* \u2021 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201c[T]he failure to take Defendant before a magistrate to determine the lawfulness of his arrest, when clearly required to do so, is more than a mere statutory violation. It represented a denial of due process and cannot be condoned. Defendant\u2019s potentially dangerous conduct and a dismissal of his case may seem a harsh result, but I can find no other suitable remedy given the violation of Defendant\u2019s basic constitutional rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">On appeal, the state challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that Ayet\u2019s violation of RCW 10.89.020 constituted a violation of defendant\u2019s due process rights that required dismissal of the charges. We review the trial court\u2019s determination for errors of law. <em>See State v. Nelson, </em>166 Or App 189, 193, 999 P2d 1161 (2000) (reviewing dismissal for due process violation for errors of law). We reverse on the ground that, under controlling case law, irregularities\u2014 indeed, illegalities \u2014 in the manner in which a defendant is physically brought into a jurisdiction do not, in and of themselves, constitute due process violations that require the dismissal of the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">The Supreme Court first so held in <em>Ker v. Illinois, </em>119 US 436, 444, 7 S Ct 225, 30 L Ed 421 (1886). In <em>Ker, </em>the defendant was forcibly removed from Peru and brought to Illinois to face criminal charges. The Supreme Court acknowledged that the manner in which the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>captured and transported \u201cwas a clear case of kidnapping within the dominions of Peru,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 443, but rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that his due process rights had been violated, <em>id. </em>at 440. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">\u201cThe \u2018due process of law\u2019 here guaranteed is complied with when the party is regularly indicted by the proper grand jury in the State court, has a trial according to the forms and modes prescribed for such trials, and when, in that trial and proceedings, he is deprived of no rights to which he is lawfully entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 440. The Court specifically rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his kidnapping required the dismissal of the charges against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cThere are authorities of the highest respectability which hold that such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why the party should not answer when brought within the jurisdiction of the court which has the right to try him for such an offence, and presents no valid objection to his trial in such court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The Supreme Court affirmed the <em>Ker </em>rule in <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 US 519, 72 S Ct 509, 96 L Ed 541, <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>343 US 937 (1952). In <em>Frisbie, </em>a habeas corpus case, the petitioner argued that his due process rights were violated when Michigan police officers forcibly transported him from Illinois to Michigan to face criminal charges and that the due process violation nullified his subsequent conviction and sentence. The Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s arguments, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u201cThis Court has never departed from the rule announced in <em>Ker v. Illinois, </em>that the power of a court to try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court\u2019s jurisdiction by reason of a \u2018forcible abduction.\u2019 No persuasive reasons are now presented to justify overruling this line of cases. They rest on the sound basis that due process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprized of the charges against him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 522 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>More recently, the Supreme Court affirmed the <em>Ker </em>rule in <em>United States v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>504 US 655, 665, 112 S Ct 2188, 119 L Ed 2d 441 (1992), a criminal case in which the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that United States law enforcement officers arranged for his forcible abduction from Mexico to the United States to face criminal charges. The defendant argued that his abduction constituted \u201coutrageous governmental conduct, and that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to try him because he was abducted in violation of the extradition treaty between the United States and Mexico.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments, holding that the treaty did not, expressly or implicitly, provide \u201cthe only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664. In other words, the Court held that, although the treaty governed one means of bringing a person from one country to the other to face criminal charges (extradition), it did not prohibit other means of doing so (including forcible abduction). <em>Id. </em>at 668-69. Therefore, the Court concluded, the defendant\u2019s abduction did not violate the treaty. The Court farther concluded that, because the defendant\u2019s abduction did not violate the treaty, \u201cthe rule of <em>Ker v. Illinois </em>[was] fully applicable.\u201d Id. at 670. The Court noted that the defendant\u2019s abduction may have been \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cin violation of general international law principles,\u201d but it did not \u201cprohibit his trial in a court in the United States for violations of the criminal laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">This court followed <em>Ker </em>and <em>Alvarez-Machain </em>in <em>State v. Aydiner, </em>228 Or App 282, 208 P3d 515, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 259 (2009), <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 131 S Ct 530 (2010).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Aydiner, </em>the defendant was indicted for several crimes, including aggravated murder, a capital offense. At the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the indictment, the defendant was in his native Turkey and unaware of the charges. He sought to return to the United States to be with his wife, a United States citizen. Because the defendant had overstayed his prior visit, the federal government initially denied him reentry. But, at the state\u2019s request, the federal government reversed its position and allowed the defendant to return. The defendant, who was still unaware of the charges against him, believed he had been granted a waiver to return. After flying from Turkey to Oregon, the defendant was arrested at the airport and held for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The defendant moved to dismiss the state\u2019s case, arguing that the state\u2019s use of \u201ctrickery and deceit\u201d violated the extradition treaty between Turkey and the United States, as well as his due process rights. <em>Id. </em>at 285. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and he was subsequently convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On appeal, the defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. Relying on <em>Alvarez-Machain, </em>this court held that the alleged \u201ctrickery and deceit\u201d did not violate the extradition treaty between Turkey and the United States because, as in <em>Alvarez-Machain, </em>\u201cthe treaty did not intend the extradition process to be exclusive.\u201d <em>Aydiner, </em>228 Or App at 289. We further held that, under <em>Ker and Alvarez-Machain, </em>the \u201ctrickery and deceit\u201d \u201cdid not violate [the defendant\u2019s] right to due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In this case, there is no dispute that Ayet violated ROW 10.89.020 when he brought defendant back to Oregon without first taking him to a magistrate for a hearing on the lawfulness of his arrest. But, under <em>Ker </em>and its progeny, that violation is not a basis for dismissal of the charges against defendant. It does not bar his prosecution in Oregon. If, as <em>Ker </em>establishes, forcibly abducting a person from Peru to face criminal charges does not constitute a due process violation that requires dismissal of criminal charges, we cannot say that bringing a person back across the Astoria-Megler Bridge does.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\"><em>State v. Meyer, </em>183 Or App 536, 53 P3d 940 (2002), on which defendant relies, is not to the contrary. In <em>Meyer, </em>an Oregon police officer observed the defendant speeding on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Oregon side of the Interstate 5 Bridge between Multnomah County, Oregon, and Clark County, Washington. The officer did not initiate a traffic stop until the defendant was on the Washington side of the bridge. After the defendant stopped, the officer issued him a citation for \u201cviolating the basic speed rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. At the subsequent traffic violation trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the officer did not have authority to stop and cite him in Washington. The trial court denied the motion and convicted the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">On appeal, this court reversed. We held that the officer had no authority to stop or cite the defendant in Washington. Washington\u2019s Fresh Pursuit Act, we noted, authorizes pursuit and arrest of persons suspected of felonies and certain driving offenses, but those driving offenses do not include speeding. <em>Id. </em>at 548. We accepted the defendant\u2019s argument that the officer \u201clacked authority to stop and cite him in [Washington] and that the resulting citation therefore was, in effect, void <em>ab initio.\u201d Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">That is not the case here. Defendant does not argue that Ayet lacked the authority to stop him or that the state lacked the authority to charge him, either by citation or information. In other words, he does not argue that the state proceeded on a charging instrument that it had no authority to issue in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Instead, defendant argues that the charging instrument should be dismissed as a sanction for illegal conduct, specifically, Ayet\u2019s violation of RCW 10.89.020. But, as discussed above, Ayet\u2019s violation of RCW 10.89.020 is not a due process violation that requires dismissal of the charges, and defendant has not offered, and we are not aware of, any authority for the proposition that violation of a statute requiring an officer to bring a defendant before a magistrate in a timely manner requires dismissal of the charges. To the contrary, we have held that violations of statutes requiring a timely arraignment do not result in dismissal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Nation, </em>54 Or App 929, 636 P2d 1001 (1981), <em>rev den, </em>292 Or 568 (1982) (neither dismissal nor suppression was appropriate in case where defendant arraigned three hours later than statute required); <em>State v. Jenks, </em>43 Or App 221, 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>P2d 681 (1979) (violation of speedy arraignment statute does not bar prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In sum, although Ayet violated RCW 10.89.020 when he failed to bring defendant before a magistrate for a hearing on the lawfulness of his arrest, that violation is not a basis, under the due process clause or <em>Meyer, </em>for dismissal of the charges against defendant. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\"> Washington\u2019s Fresh Pursuit Act provides, in part, that an officer from another state in fresh pursuit of a person suspected of a felony or certain driving offenses can arrest the person in Washington and that, if an officer does so, the officer must take the person before a Washington magistrate for a hearing to determine the lawfulness of the arrest. The relevant provisions of the Act are set forth below. 241 Or App at 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, \u201cNo State shall * * * deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> Oregon courts also applied the <em>Ker </em>rule prior to <em>Aydiner. See, </em>e.g., <em>State v. Fox, </em>250 Or 83, 85, 439 P2d 1009, <em>cert den, </em>393 US 891 (1968) (citing <em>Ker </em>and <em>Frisbie </em>in rejecting the defendant\u2019s Oregon constitutional claims and holding that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the trial court was not impaired by any defect in the proceedings by which defendant was brought into Oregon for trial\u201d); <em>State v. Wertheimer, </em>6 Or App 507, 509, 488 P2d 1199 (1971) (rejecting, under <em>Fox </em>and <em>Frisbie, </em>the defendant\u2019s \u201carguments with reference to his motion on jurisdiction and motion to dismiss the indictment * * * based upon his claim that he was illegally extradited or taken from Minnesota to Oregon for this trial\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
