Defendant cross-appeals from the supplemental judgment, arguing that the trial court erred by not awarding her the full amount of attorney fees requested. We affirm the dismissal without discussion and write only to address the attorney fee issue. Our reversal of the attorney fee award renders defendant\u2019s cross-appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that defendant constructed her home in violation of restrictive covenants to which both neighboring parties\u2019 properties were subject. Defendant filed an answer that denied all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims but made no mention of attorney fees. After a bench trial, the court ruled in defendant\u2019s favor. The court later concluded that \u201c[t]here is no objectively reasonable basis for the assertion of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for loss of view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Defendant then moved for attorney fees under ORS 20.105(1), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201c[T]he court shall award reasonable attorney fees to a party against whom a claim * * * is asserted, if that party is a prevailing party in the proceeding and to be paid by the party asserting the claim * * * upon a finding by the court that * * * there was no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">After a hearing, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion and awarded her $50,000 in attorney fees in a supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that defendant failed to plead attorney fees as required by ORCP 68 C(2)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201c[A] party seeking attorney fees shall allege the facts, statute or rule that provides a basis for the award of such fees in a pleading filed by that party. * * * No attorney fees shall be awarded unless a right to recover such fee is alleged as provided in this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The requirements of ORCP 68 C(2)(a) are mandatory. <em>Mulier v. Johnson, </em>332 Or 344, 350, 29 P3d 1104 (2001). A party must identify the statutory basis for an award, unless the facts asserted provide \u201c \u2018a basis for an award of fees, the parties have fairly been alerted that attorney fees would be sought and no prejudice would result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nguyen v. McGraw, </em>210 Or App 192, 195, 149 P3d 1273 (2006) (quoting <em>Page and Page, </em>103 Or App 431, 434, 797 P2d 408 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Here, defendant made no mention of attorney fees in her answer, nor did she cite the statute, ORS 20.105(1), or any facts that would support an award under that statute. Thus, despite defendant\u2019s post-trial motion, plaintiffs were not sufficiently on notice that attorney fees would be requested. <em>See Nguyen, </em>210 Or App at 195-97. It follows that the trial court had no authority upon which to award attorney fees to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">On appeal, award of attorney fees in the supplemental judgment reversed; otherwise affirmed. Cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\"> Plaintiffs also argue that the court erred in awarding attorney fees by concluding that there was no objectively reasonable basis for the assertion of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Because we conclude that defendant failed to satisfy ORCP 68 C(2)(a), we do not consider this alternative ground for reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
