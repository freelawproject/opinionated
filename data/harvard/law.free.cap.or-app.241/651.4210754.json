He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission, over his objection, of evidence of a nurse practitioner\u2019s diagnosis, made in the absence of any physical evidence, that the victim had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On appeal, defendant contends, in part, that, pursuant to <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), the trial court\u2019s admission of the diagnosis was reversible error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that, in light of <em>Southard, </em>\u201cthe trial court committed reversible error\u201d in admitting that evidence. According to the state, \u201c[t]he proper remedy is to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.\u201d The state\u2019s concession is well founded, and, accordingly, we accept it. Thus, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\"> In light of our resolution of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, we do not reach his second assignment, that, in light of <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010), the trial court committed plain error in admitting testimony from the nurse practitioner \u201cregarding her assessment of the victim\u2019s statements that formed the basis for her medical diagnosis of sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
