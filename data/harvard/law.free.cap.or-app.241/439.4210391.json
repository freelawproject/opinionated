He first argues that the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay statements that the assault victim, who did not testify at trial, had made to a police officer immediately after the assault, which had identified defendant as one of the assailants. Defendant asserts that the victim\u2019s statements should not have been admitted because the state failed to establish that the victim was unavailable as a witness, and, therefore, admission of his statements violated defendant\u2019s right under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution to confront witnesses. The state counters that defendant\u2019s first assignment is not preserved and should not be considered on appeal. We conclude that defendant adequately preserved his first assignment of error and that the state failed to establish that the victim was unavailable as a witness under Article I, section 11. We also conclude that admission of the victim\u2019s hearsay statements prejudiced defendant, requiring that we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the case to the trial court. That conclusion renders defendant\u2019s second assignment of error pertaining to his sentence moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We review the facts of this case in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 350, 800 P2d 259 (1990). In June 2007, James, Monroy, and the victim went to a house in Albany. Several people were already in the house, including defendant and Turvey. At some point, a fight broke out in a bedroom, during which defendant struggled with and hit the victim. Of the people present at that time, three testified at trial about those events: Monroy, James, and Turvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Monroy testified that she saw defendant struggle with and hit the victim and later heard the victim yelling about being hit by someone. James remembered going into the home with the victim and entering a bedroom with him, where other people were present. James then left the bedroom, entered a bathroom, and closed its door. James did not recall the victim being attacked and, although he apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>remembered the sound of voices while he was in the bathroom, he did not recall what was said or how loud the voices were. Turvey admitted that he had assaulted the victim that day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified that he was the only assailant and that defendant was sleeping in another room during the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Officer Tapper was dispatched to the area of the house in response to a report of a melee. When he arrived, Tapper saw the victim come out of the house staggering and waving his hands at Tapper. The victim \u201clooked terrified\u201d and was disoriented. Tapper saw that the victim had blood and \u201clumps and bumps all over his face\u201d and \u201cblood coming from an ear\u201d; it was obvious to Tapper that the victim had recently been beaten. As will be explained below, the trial court allowed Tapper to testify about statements that the victim made to him during their initial encounter outside the house. Tapper testified that the victim said that defendant was crazy, that defendant and another man had attacked him, and that they were still in the house. A short time later, police officers entered the house and found several people, including defendant and Turvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">During the second day of defendant\u2019s trial, the state informed the court, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, that the victim had failed to appear to testify. The state moved to admit the hearsay statements that the victim had made to Tapper. The state acknowledged that the victim had not been subpoenaed for trial, but it offered to present witnesses to testify about the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements, \u201cthe efforts of the [sjtate to secure [the victim\u2019s] attendance,\u201d and the victim\u2019s \u201cexpressions of fear about coming here.\u201d When asked for his position on the state\u2019s request, defense counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201cWell, Your Honor, I would not agree that this would fall under necessarily the excited utterance [exception]. It seems to me it would fall under Rule 804 about a declarant being unavailable or making himself unavailable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u201cAs far as [the victim] not being here, both sides actually had been in communication, and I would ask to be allowed to present my own witness who had been in communication with [the victim], who had indicated that he would not be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\u201c[Court]: To rebut the reasons or the necessity of receiving the other evidence in lieu of his testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes. I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201c[Court]: To show why the Court should not allow\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right. If there\u2019s testimony given that he\u2019s afraid to appear. I do see from the indictment that he appeared before the grand jury, and on a basic level <em>I </em>\u2014 I <em>do have a problem with any evidence regarding his prior statements being submitted. I do think that it does * * * violate both Article 1, Section 11[J of the Oregon [CJonstitution </em>and the Sixth Amendment to the United States [Constitution, and I think that it totally flies in the face of <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>that we\u2019ve all become accustomed to in the recent years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The prosecutor explained that he had spoken with the victim by telephone the day before trial and, at that time, the victim had assured him that he would be present at trial the following day. The trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201cSo you knew he wasn\u2019t where he was supposed to be [on the first day of trial]. So is law enforcement \u2014 have you asked law enforcement to assist in trying to find [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I have. I have also talked to others, Your Honor, and those people are here to tell you about that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The court then heard testimony from three witnesses, still outside of the jury\u2019s presence, about the state\u2019s efforts to obtain the victim\u2019s attendance at trial, which the state believed to be sufficient to establish that the victim was unavailable to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">First, the court heard testimony from Houdek, an employee of the Linn County Sheriffs civil process office. Houdek testified that on September 5,2007, she had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>a subpoena to be served on the victim requiring his appearance on November 14, 2007, to testify at defendant\u2019s trial. She learned that the victim was scheduled to appear in court on another matter on September 26. Houdek went to the courthouse on September 26 at the time that the victim was supposed to appear; however, the victim did not show up. She attempted to serve the subpoena on the victim a second time at a court appearance on November 5, but he again did not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Second, the court heard testimony from the victim\u2019s attorney, Tibbets, who was representing the victim in a separate criminal matter. He confirmed that the victim had not appeared for the September 26 and November 5 court appearances. Tibbets also testified that he had received an unspecified number of telephone calls from the prosecutor starting in early October asking Tibbets to contact the victim and \u201cput him in touch\u201d with the prosecutor. Tibbets received another telephone call from the prosecutor on November 13, the day before defendant\u2019s trial, about his desire to communicate with the victim. As it turned out, Tibbets had not spoken with the victim in the week before defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Finally, the victim\u2019s stepmother testified. She stated that, although the victim had lived with her and the victim\u2019s father periodically over the past year, he had not been living at their home during the past month and had \u201cmainly stay[ed] with his friends.\u201d However, she had seen the victim several times during the past month, including the day before trial. The victim told her at their last encounter that he knew about defendant\u2019s trial, and gave her the impression that he intended to appear at it. The stepmother also testified that she had received two telephone calls from the prosecutor. The first was the day before defendant\u2019s trial, and the second was the following day. When she saw the victim the day before defendant\u2019s trial, she relayed the prosecutor\u2019s message to him to call the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The state then offered Tapper as a witness to describe the statements that the victim had made and the circumstances of those statements. After hearing Tapper\u2019s testimony, the court heard argument from counsel about the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements. The state argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>that the statements were admissible as excited utterances under OEC 803(2) and that their admission would not violate defendant\u2019s confrontation right under Article I, section ll.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following colloquy ensued regarding whether the state had established that the victim was unavailable, as relevant to the latter argument.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] Now, in order for the Court to [admit Tapper\u2019s testimony under the excited utterance exception,] <em>the Court has to find as well that there would not be any violation to the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the Oregon [Constitution. </em>The evidence you\u2019ve received establishes that. First of all[,] you\u2019ve received evidence about the efforts \u2014 about the fact that [the victim] is absent from this trial, absent yesterday and absent today[;] <em>you\u2019ve also received evidence about the efforts of the prosecution to obtain his attendance so that he could testify directly. These efforts have been reasonable, and, given the circumstances of this particular case and this particular person, the best that could be done to obtain his attendance at trial, therefore I\u2019d ask that you find under the Evidence Code 804 that he is unavailable for purposes of the evidence rule under subsection (l)(e), as in Edward, that [he is] absent from the hearing, and the proponent of his statement, and that is the State, has been unable to procure his attendance by process or other reasonable means.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201c[Court]: Alright. Let me ask [defense counsel] a couple of questions * * *. [Y]ou didn\u2019t address the question of unavailability. Are you contesting whether [the victim] is\u2014 and of course we know there\u2019s a special definition of \u2018unavailability,\u2019 it\u2019s not the common definition, but are you contesting [the] unavailability of [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes. It sounds to me like he \u2014 he knew about the trial, he\u2019s been \u2014 and I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t prepared to address that right now and as I talk I\u2019m flipping through for the \u2014 under\u2014you\u2019re referring to under 804?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201c[Court]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And <em>I don\u2019t think he falls under any of those definitions. </em>He\u2019s not \u2014 there\u2019s no lack of testimony \u2014 lack of memory, certainlyt, OEC 804(l)(c)], it\u2019s not that he\u2019s unable to be present because of a death or then existing physical or mental illness[, OEC 804(l)(d)]. He\u2014 <em>the State has been able to procure his attendance in the past, certainly before the grand jury and certainly before this Court in another case, although admittedly he did fail to appear two times. </em>[OEC 804(l)(e).] He\u2019s not exempted by Court ruling. [OEC 804(l)(a).] Again, he\u2019s already testified to the grand jury[, OEC 804(l)(b)], so I would \u2014 and I remember <em>I originally contested the unavailability issue before, and I think that you would have to fall under Rule 804.1 don\u2019t </em>\u2014 I <em>don\u2019t see that he has.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The court proceeded to rule that the victim\u2019s hearsay statements were admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201c[Court]: * * * Going through the checklist, there\u2019s a specific mention in one of the cases you gave me that \u2014 one of the <em>Crawford </em>cases [where] the witness hadn\u2019t been subpoenaed for the trial, so being subpoenaed is not a magic touchstone on whether a witness is unavailable or not. It kind of comes up in 804[(l)](b). If you were looking at (l)(b), persists in refusing to testify despite an order of the Court to do so, not having a subpoena takes Mr. \u2014 basically takes [the state] out of (l)(b), which he would have had if he had a subpoena, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the witness isn\u2019t unavailable. So as to that first matter I am convinced based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the testimony that I\u2019ve already heard in this trial from the other witnesses, and I\u2019m referring \u2014 you know, I can refer specifically to some things like Ms. Monroy, even though she was obviously a reluctant witness you might say. She described yelling and screaming and traumatic events that were occurring inside the house. That\u2019s \u2014 that comes into play a couple of times here not only in unavailability, why would he be unavailable, and there\u2019s testimony that \u2014 from one of the three witnesses [the state] called, [the victim\u2019s stepmother], that he expressed fear, and then we have, you know, Officer Tapper\u2019s testimony here outside the hearing of the jury that he was certainly terrified that day, [the victim] was, so I find unavailability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">\u00edj\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201c* * * <em>Confrontation under [the] Oregon [Constitution, I\u2019ve already covered the 804(l)(e), unavailability. </em>Then we get [to] indicia of reliability, and I\u2019ve already kind of addressed that too. * * * [S]o under the Oregon [Constitution I \u2014 I think that the testimony does pass the confrontation clause rights of the defendant in this case[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">(Emphasis added.) Based on that ruling, Tapper testified at trial about statements that the victim had made to him during their initial encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the victim\u2019s statements to Tapper. Specifically, defendant asserts that the admission of the hearsay statements violated Article I, section 11, because the state had failed to establish that it had made a good-faith effort to obtain the victim\u2019s attendance at trial and, thus, had failed to establish that the victim was unavailable as a witness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state counters that defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is unpreserved, asserting that defense counsel\u2019s argument to the trial court about whether the victim was unavailable under OEC 804(1) \u201cdid not in any way attack the state\u2019s OEC 804(l)(e) theory of unavailability. Instead, in arguing that [the victim] could not be deemed unavailable, defendant focused on subsections of that rule {viz., OEC 804(l)(a) through (d)) that the state was not relying on to establish [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>victim\u2019s] unavailability.\u201d Thus, according to the state, \u201cdefendant\u2019s theory on appeal for excluding the challenged hearsay is substantively different from the ones he presented to the trial court,\u201d and, therefore, it is not preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We reject the state\u2019s preservation argument for two reasons. First, our review of the record establishes that defendant <em>did </em>address whether the state had established unavailability under OEC 804(l)(e). That is the only provision of the rule that conceivably could bear on the issue in this case, it is the provision to which the state\u2019s unavailability evidence was directed, and it is the provision on which the court relied to conclude that the state had established unavailability. Defendant, in turn, addressed each provision of OEC 804(1), including subsection (l)(e), and asserted that the state had not established unavailability under any of them. Hence, to the extent preservation turns on whether defendant contested unavailability under OEC 804(l)(e), defendant did.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Second, the correct focus in this case is on whether the state established that the victim was unavailable to testify as a witness for purposes Article I, section 11. As we will explain, defendant preserved his unavailability argument under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As noted, the trial court admitted the victim\u2019s hearsay statements under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception, OEC 803(2), to the general rule against the admission of hearsay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Oregon Evidence Code does not require that the declarant be unavailable in order for an excited utterance to be admitted as hearsay evidence. OEC 803; <em>State v. Moore, </em>334 Or 328, 335, 49 P3d 785 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Nonetheless, in order to admit hearsay evidence under OEC 803 in a criminal case, the state must establish that the declarant is unavailable for purposes of Article I, section 11. <em>Moore, </em>334 Or at 335. As the Oregon Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>has recently confirmed, for hearsay statements by a declarant who does not testify at trial to be properly admitted, there are two requirements that must be met under Article I, section 11. \u201cFirst, the declarant must be unavailable, and, second, the declarant\u2019s statements must have \u2018adequate indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 540, 135 P3d 260 (2006) (quoting <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 66, 100 S Ct 2531, 65 L Ed 2d 597 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">With that framework in mind, we turn again to the state\u2019s preservation argument. The preservation requirement exists \u201cnot to promote form over substance,\u201d <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 220, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (brackets in original omitted) (quoting <em>Shields v. Campbell, </em>277 Or 71, 77-78, 559 P2d 1275 (1977)), but, rather, to promote three important policies: judicial economy, procedural fairness to the parties, and full development of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 219-20; <em>accord State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 340, 211 P3d 262 (2009). Under the circumstances presented here, we conclude that those policies have been served. Although trial counsel and the court appear to have conflated the unavailability requirement under the Oregon Evidence Code and Article I, section 11, we are persuaded that the parties and the trial court were fully aware that the state was required to establish that the victim was unavailable under Article I, section 11, and that defendant sufficiently alerted the court to his argument that that standard had not been met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particular, our conclusion is guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the preservation rule in <em>Parkins, </em>which posed a similarly postured dispute about whether the defendant had preserved an argument for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>In <em>Parkins, </em>the defendant argued on appeal that \u201chis kidnapping conviction should be overturned because the evidence failed to show that the victim was \u2018secretly confine[d] * * * in a place where [she was] not likely to be found.\u2019 ORS 163.225(l)(b).\u201d 346 Or at 335 (alterations in original). The state contended, however, that the defendant had not preserved that specific challenge. At the close of the state\u2019s case at trial, the state alerted the court to <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>50 Or App 381, 386-87, 624 P2d 151 (1981), and described that case as \u201c \u2018an important case with regard to the kidnapping charge,\u2019 because that opinion analyzed the \u2018secretly confined\u2019 and \u2018place not likely to be found\u2019 elements of ORS 163.225(l)(b).\u201d <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 337. Subsequently, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, and defense counsel briefly discussed and attempted to distinguish <em>Montgomery </em>from the defendant\u2019s case. However, defense counsel immediately followed that argument by asserting to the court, \u201c \u2018[T]hat\u2019s not our issue. Our issue is not a nitpicking argument regarding specific elements and specific crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 338. Rather, the defendant clarified that \u201che was \u2018simply saying that there\u2019s insufficient evidence, as a whole\u2019 to conclude that [the] defendant committed any criminal acts as charged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Before the Supreme Court, the state argued that the trial court had not had an adequate opportunity to consider the argument that the defendant had raised on appeal because the defendant\u2019s statements after his discussion of <em>Montgomery </em>\u201csteered the trial court away from the legal issue of whether the alleged conduct constituted \u2018secret confine[ment] * * * in a place where the person is not likely to be found,\u2019 as that phrase is used in ORS <em>163.225(l)(b).\u201dParkins, </em>346 Or at 338 (alterations in original). The Supreme Court disagreed with the state and concluded that the trial court appeared \u201cto have understood the <em>Montgomery </em>issue to be in play.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. Furthermore, after reviewing the principles behind the preservation rule, it concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201cthose policies are sufficiently served. The statutory issue that [the] defendant raises was presented to the trial court, even if [the] defendant addressed it ambivalently. And not only did the state have a meaningful opportunity to address the issue, it was the state that raised <em>Montgomery </em>before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the trial court. Finally, the trial court had an opportunity to resolve the issue, and the record suggests that the trial court in fact did so. To be sure, the issue could have been better preserved, but it was, we conclude, adequately preserved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The parallels between the preservation issue in <em>Parkins </em>and in our case support our conclusion that defendant adequately preserved his first assignment of error. First, the issue whether the victim was unavailable as a witness under Article I, section 11, was squarely presented to the trial court. Although he could have done so more explicitly, defense counsel told the trial court that admission of the victim\u2019s hearsay statements would violate Article I, section 11, because the state had not satisfied the unavailability requirement. In particular, in rebutting the state\u2019s request that the court find \u201cthat there would not be any violation to the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the Oregon [Constitution,\u201d defense counsel engaged in a point-by-point analysis of all five subsections of OEC 804(1) and a summary argument that the victim was not unavailable as a witness \u201cunder any of those definitions.\u201d <em>See </em>241 Or App at 445-46. Given that trial counsel and the court all appear to have understood the definition of unavailability under OEC 804(l)(e) to serve as a proxy for unavailability under Article I, section 11, we conclude that that argument, in conjunction with defense counsel\u2019s argument that admission of the victim\u2019s statements \u201cdoes * * * violate * * * Article [I], [s]ection 11[,] of the Oregon Constitution,\u201d adequately informed the trial court that the state\u2019s efforts to obtain the victim\u2019s appearance at trial were insufficient and, thus, that the victim was not unavailable under Article I, section 11. <em>See </em>241 Or App at 442-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Second, just as in <em>Parkins, </em>not only did the state have a meaningful opportunity to address whether the victim was unavailable under Article I, section 11, it was the state that specifically argued in support of its motion that \u201cthere would not be any violation to the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the Oregon [Constitution\u201d because it had demonstrated that the victim was \u201cunavailable for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>* * * [OEC 804] subsection (l)(e) * * * and that * * * the State[ ] has been unable to procure his attendance by process or other reasonable means.\u201d Finally, the court here was given the opportunity to resolve whether the victim was unavailable under Article I, section 11, and it concluded that the victim was.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The state presents an additional argument on defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, which we understand to be a further challenge to defendant\u2019s preservation of that assignment for appeal. The state maintains that \u201cthe trial court ultimately found that [the victim] was unavailable as a witness because he had concerns for his safety and was absent for that reason.\u201d The state argues that defendant has not challenged that reasoning on appeal, which it believes formed the basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the victim was unavailable. Thus, the state urges that we affirm the admission of the victim\u2019s hearsay statements because \u201cdefendant fails to offer any legal analysis showing error in the unavailability ruling the trial court <em>actually </em>made.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We are not persuaded by that argument. The court did not offer that reasoning as an alternative basis for its decision on the victim\u2019s unavailability. <em>See Roop v. Parker Northwest Paving Co., </em>194 Or App 219, 236, 94 P3d 885 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 374 (2005) (\u201c[W]here plaintiffs fail to challenge the alternative basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we must affirm it.\u201d). Rather, in the context of concluding that the victim was unavailable, the court identified the victim\u2019s fear of testifying in defendant\u2019s trial as one possible explanation for why the victim did not appear at trial. Contrary to the state\u2019s assertions, defendant\u2019s challenge on appeal correctly focuses on whether the court erred in concluding that the victim was unavailable for purposes of Article I, section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number> We turn to the merits of defendant\u2019s argument that the state failed to establish that the victim was unavailable as a witness. A declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d under Article I, section 11, if the proponent of the declarant\u2019s hearsay statements made a good-faith but ultimately unsuccessful effort to obtain the declarant\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>State v. Nielsen, </em>316 Or 611, 623, 853 P2d 256 (1993). \u201cThe degree of effort which constitutes due diligence in attempting to secure an unavailable witness depends upon the particular circumstances presented by each case.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>42 Or App 29, 32, 599 P2d 1225, <em>rev den, </em>288 Or 1 (1979). Even so, other cases addressing unavailability under Article I, section 11, help us assess the sufficiency of the state\u2019s efforts to obtain the victim\u2019s appearance at trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In <em>Anderson, </em>we considered whether the state had made a good-faith effort to secure the appearance of several declarants at trial and had thereby established that they were unavailable to testify. 42 Or App at 31-32. We summarized the state\u2019s efforts to locate those witnesses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cCharles Jackson * * * maintained several local addresses in the Grants Pass area. * * * A subpoena was taken to his last known address on two occasions!,] but he was no longer residing there. Several friends of his were contacted and they reported that they had not seen him for some time. Jackson had mentioned that he was leaving the area as he had been there long enough. The police were unable to locate a forwarding address for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cThe other three missing witnesses were traveling and living as a group. * * * The subpoenas for the second trial were taken to their last known address!,] but they were no longer living there. The sheriffs office then contacted the local post office and found that Marian Ferguson had a post office box there!,] but it had been inactive for several months. Another address was obtained from the post office!,] and an attempt was made to locate her through that address, to no avail. Sheriff s deputies spoke with other persons living in [their last known residence] and the surrounding area in an attempt to locate the witnesses. * * * The only lead the deputies uncovered was that the four witnesses reportedly had moved approximately two months earlier and had \u2018possibly gone someplace into the Los Angeles area.\u2019 * * * Follow-up contacts with people in the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>turned up nothing further. A call to the district attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles was unproductive. Attempts to locate the witnesses continued to the day of trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 32-33. From that record, we concluded \u201cthat the state [had] made a proper showing of a good faith attempt to locate the missing witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>Nielsen, </em>the Supreme Court also had to determine whether a declarant was unavailable under Article I, section 11. The state\u2019s efforts to locate the declarant and obtain his attendance at trial included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201c[Pjolice attempted to subpoena [the declarant] at her parents\u2019 home and at the second address that she had given to the arresting officer; they asked persons at those addresses for other leads and then tried to find [the declarant] at a third location that was suggested by residents at the second address; warrant checks, to see if [the declarant] had been arrested on any of several outstanding warrants against her, were conducted weekly through the police computer information system; and police made such a check on the morning of trial. There was no indication that police failed to follow up on any available lead concerning [the declarant\u2019s] whereabouts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">316 Or at 618-19. In light of those facts, the court concluded that \u201cthe state made a good-faith effort to obtain [the declarant\u2019s] testimony\u201d and, accordingly, concluded that the declarant \u201cwas unavailable within the requirements of Article I, section 11 <em>rid. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In contrast to <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Nielsen, </em>in <em>State v. Lucus, </em>213 Or App 277, 279, 160 P3d 1012 (2007), we concluded that the state had failed to establish that the declarant was unavailable under Article I, section 11. The record in <em>Lucus </em>revealed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201c[T]he prosecutor indicated that a subpoena had been mailed to the [declarant\u2019s] residence, but she had not been personally served with a subpoena. The prosecutor also stated that he had spoken with a member of the [declarant\u2019s] family, who had at first indicated that the [declarant] would attend trial but later \u2014 a day or two before trial \u2014 had told the prosecutor that the [declarant] had left home, leaving a note saying that she was too frightened to testify and would be gone for a \u2018few days.\u2019 The family member did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>know where the [declarant] was. The state made no subsequent efforts to locate the [declarant].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 278. On that record, we concluded that \u201cthe steps taken by the state to procure the attendance of the [declarant] at trial were insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We conclude that the circumstances presented here are more similar to those in <em>Lucus. </em>Here, the state prepared a subpoena for the victim in early September; however, it made only a minimal effort to serve it on the victim. The sheriffs office attempted service only twice and, both of those times, it relied on the victim\u2019s expected attendance at two court appearances. There is no indication in the record that the state attempted to serve the subpoena at any other location or time.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Similarly, aside from making a few telephone calls to the victim\u2019s attorney, Tibbets, who was representing the victim in a criminal action adverse to the state, there is no indication in the record that the state made any effort prior to the day before trial to determine the victim\u2019s whereabouts. The record does not indicate that the police went to the victim\u2019s last known address or sought out family members or people with whom the victim had previously lived. Until the victim failed to attend the first day of defendant\u2019s trial, it does not appear that the state had asked law enforcement officers to assist it in finding the victim. In fact, it appears that the first time that the state contacted anyone other than Tibbets was on the day before defendant\u2019s trial, when the prosecutor contacted the victim\u2019s stepmother and later spoke with the victim on the telephone. In light of those circumstances and on this record, we conclude that the trial court erred in concluding that the victim was unavailable as a witness under Article I, section 11, and, therefore, erred in admitting the victim\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">That error is one that requires us to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the case to the trial court, <em>see </em>OEC 103, unless the error was harmless. The state does not argue that admission of the statements was harmless, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>on this record, we conclude that the error in admitting them was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> At the time of defendant\u2019s trial, Turvey was incarcerated after having been convicted of third-degree assault and coercion for his conduct dining the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\"> Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution provides, as relevant: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to meet the witnesses face to facet.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> As the colloquy between the trial court and counsel reveals, they were discussing whether the requirements for demonstrating the unavailability of a witness under OEC 804(1) had been satisfied in this case. That statute provides that a declarant is unavailable as a witness when the declarant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201c(a) Is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of a statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">\u201c(b) Persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of a statement despite an order of the court to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">\u201c(c) Testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of a statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">\u201c(d) Is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">\u201c(e) Is absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant\u2019s statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance * * * by process or other reasonable means.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">OEC 804(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\"> Defendant does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s determination that the victim\u2019s statements to Tapper qualified as excited utterances under OEC 803(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> OEC 803(2) provides that \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d is not excluded by OEC 802, the general rule against admission of hearsay evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b485-5\"> We acknowledge that the parties\u2019 apparent conflation of the unavailability requirement under the Oregon Evidence Code and Article I, section 11, at trial is an understandable error given that the respective inquiries undoubtedly overlap to some degree and that their distinct contours have, at times, not been expressly recognized. <em>See, e.g., State v.
