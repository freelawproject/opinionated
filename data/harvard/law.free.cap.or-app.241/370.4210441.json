J.</author>\n<p id=\"b406-3\">Mother appeals a permanency judgment that changed the permanency plan for her son, R, from reunification to adoption. Her arguments on appeal concern, first, the sufficiency of the juvenile court\u2019s findings regarding reasonable efforts by the Department of Human Services (DHS) to reunify the family and, second, the court\u2019s determination that there was no reason to defer the filing of a petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights. Mother challenges the juvenile court\u2019s legal conclusions, which we review for errors of law. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">To frame the issues, we need only to describe the permanency judgment and related documents. The permanency judgment incorporates a letter opinion in which the court noted that mother\u2019s mental health issues have worsened over time and that, despite DHS\u2019s attempts to help her, mother \u201cwill not and cannot change.\u201d By checking boxes and circling words in the permanency judgment form, the court indicated its finding that reasonable efforts have been made to make possible the child\u2019s safe return home and to support mother\u2019s efforts to comply with the plan. The court adopted the \u201cagency\u2019s report/petition/probable cause statement dated 5-26-10 as the Court\u2019s written findings for this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">That DHS court report, which was admitted as an exhibit at the permanency hearing and which also is contained in the trial court file, has a cover page with identifying information, followed by slightly more than five pages of text. The report describes, among other things, counseling that mother received at Coastal Center, mother\u2019s refusal of a referral for a medication management assessment, and the results of a psychological evaluation conducted about two months before the permanency hearing. Under the heading \u201crecommendations,\u201d the report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201cWe request that the Court make the determination that reasonable efforts, in light of the child\u2019s and parent\u2019s circumstances, have been made to make it possible for the child to be safely returned to the home, and in supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the parent\u2019s efforts to comply with the plan. Reasonable efforts include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">\u201cCase management; Psychological evaluation; Face to face contacts with child, parent, and foster parents; Coastal Center counseling; Staffing with Department of Justice; Medical card for child; Visitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Mother appeals from the permanency judgment. In her first assignment of error, she contends that the juvenile court erred by not including in the judgment, as required under ORS 419B.476(5)(a), a \u201cbrief description of the efforts [DHS] has made\u201d to reunify the family. She argues that, under <em>State ex rel DHS v. M. A. (A139693), </em>227 Or App 172, 205 P3d 36 (2009), the permanency judgment is insufficient because the court did not include a brief description of DHS\u2019s efforts on the face of the judgment, did not attach the referenced DHS court report to the judgment, and did not indicate the specific page of the report relied upon as a description of reasonable efforts. DHS contends that the judgment adequately incorporates findings that satisfy the statutory requirement by way of the DHS court report, either standing alone or taken in conjunction with the juvenile court\u2019s letter opinion. We conclude that the permanency judgment contains an adequate description of reasonable efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We begin our analysis with the statute requiring the findings at issue. ORS 419B.476 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">\u201c(2) At a permanency hearing the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u201c(a) If the case plan at the time of the hearing is to reunify the family, determine whether the Department of Human Services has made reasonable efforts * * * to make it possible for the ward to safely return home and whether the parent has made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making its determination, the court shall consider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">\u201c(5) The court shall enter an order within 20 days after the permanency hearing. In addition to any determinations or orders the court may make under subsection (4) of this section, the order shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201c(a) The court\u2019s determination required under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, including a brief description of the efforts the department has made with regard to the case plan in effect at the time of the permanency hearing!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We examined that statute in <em>M. A., </em>in which the juvenile court ordered a permanency plan of \u201canother planned permanen[t] living arrangement\u201d (APPLA). 227 Or App at 175. In the permanency judgment, the court found that DHS had made reasonable efforts, and it took judicial notice of a court report. The judgment, however, lacked both the required description of DHS\u2019s efforts and the determination, required by ORS 419B.476(5)(f), of a compelling reason why a permanency plan other than APPLA was not in the children\u2019s best interests. 227 Or App at 183. Concluding that the juvenile court\u2019s findings were insufficient, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cThe fact that the judgment refers to what the court \u2018heard from the parties\u2019 and states that the court took judicial notice of the caseworker\u2019s report, establishes, at most, the information on which the court relied in making its decision. It does not, without more, reflect the court\u2019s reasoning or demonstrate the basis for the court\u2019s ultimate decision, much less set forth, as required in this case, a \u2018compelling reason\u2019 why it is in the children\u2019s best interest to move to a permanency plan of long-term foster care. Thus, it is inadequate to meet the requirements of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). In a footnote, we observed that the juvenile court \u201cdid not incorporate by reference or otherwise adopt the caseworker\u2019s court report; in any event, that alone would have been insufficient in this case to satisfy the requirements of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183 n 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Relying on <em>M. A., </em>mother argues that the permanency judgment here suffers from similar deficiencies. <em>M. A., </em>however, involved a complete failure to make a determination of a compelling reason that a particular permanency plan would be in the children\u2019s best interests. We did not hold in <em>M. A. </em>that a juvenile court may never incorporate by reference or adopt a report in a permanency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Here, unlike in <em>M. A., </em>the juvenile court did not merely refer to information upon which it relied in finding that reasonable efforts had been made. Rather, it found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>DHS had made reasonable efforts and adopted DHS\u2019s court report dated May 26, 2010, \u201cas the Court\u2019s written findings\u201d for that section of the permanency judgment. The report contains a request for a finding of reasonable efforts, followed by a summary description of those efforts. On this record, there is no ambiguity about which report the court adopted as its written findings, nor is the report so lengthy or unclear as to preclude its use as a \u201cbrief description.\u201d Here, the juvenile court\u2019s adoption of DHS\u2019s court report as its written findings concerning reasonable efforts was sufficient to comply with the requirement of ORS 419B.476(5)(a) that the judgment include \u201ca brief description of the efforts the department has made with regard to the case plan in effect at the time of the permanency hearing.\u201d We therefore reject mother\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In her remaining two assignments of error, mother contends that the juvenile court erred in its determination that there was no reason, under ORS 419B.498(2), to defer filing a petition to terminate her parental rights. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.476(5)(d) (requiring, when the court determines that the permanency plan should be adoption, that the court determine \u201cwhether one of the circumstances in ORS 419B.498(2) is applicable\u201d). In mother\u2019s view, this case falls within the circumstances described in ORS 419B.498(2)(a), which provides an exception to the requirement to file a petition when \u201c[t]he child or ward is being cared for by a relative and that placement is intended to be permanent.\u201d Mother contends that, because R was placed with his maternal grandmother, whom DHS had identified as the adoptive resource, R was being cared for by a relative in a placement that is intended to be permanent. DHS responds that ORS 419B.498(2)(a) refers to a permanent placement with a relative other than an adoption. We conclude that DHS is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Juvenile Code treats \u201cadoption\u201d and \u201cplacement with a fit and willing relative\u201d as two distinct permanency plans. ORS 419B.476(5) requires a permanency judgment to include, among other determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201c(b) The court\u2019s determination of the permanency plan for the ward that includes whether and, if applicable, when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201c(A) The ward will be returned to the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201c(B) The ward will be placed for adoption, and a petition for termination of parental rights will be filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">\u201c(C) The ward will be referred for establishment of legal guardianship; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201c(D) The ward will be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201c(c) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be to return home because further efforts will make it possible for the ward to safely return home within a reasonable time, the court\u2019s determination of the services in which the parents are required to participate, the progress the parents are required to make and the period of time within which the specified progress must be made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c(d) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be adoption, the court\u2019s determination of whether one of the circumstances in ORS 419B.498(2)[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] is applicable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">\u201c(e) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be establishment of a legal guardianship or placement with a fit and willing relative, the court\u2019s determination of why neither placement with parents nor adoption is appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u201c(f) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be a planned permanent living arrangement, the court\u2019s determination of a compelling reason, that must be documented by the department, why it would not be in the best interests of the ward to be returned home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>placed for adoption, placed -with a legal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relative[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">ORS 419B.476(5) thus identifies as different permanency plans, requiring different findings, (1) return to a parent, (2) adoption, (3) a legal guardianship or \u201cplacement with a fit and willing relative,\u201d and (4) a planned permanent living arrangement. <em>See also </em>ORS 419A.004(18) (\u201c \u2018Planned permanent living arrangement\u2019 means an out-of-home placement other than by adoption, placement with a relative or placement with a legal guardian that is consistent with the case plan and in the best interest of the ward.\u201d). For permanency plan purposes, then, adoption is different from placement with a relative; indeed, if the permanency plan is placement with a relative, the court must explain why adoption is not appropriate. Accordingly, the reference in ORS 419B.498(2)(a) to when \u201c[t]he child or ward is being cared for by a relative and that placement is intended to be permanent\u201d refers to placement with a relative other than an adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">That construction of ORS 419B.498(2)(a) is internally consistent and consistent with ORS 419B.476(5). Mother\u2019s construction, by contrast, creates an internal inconsistency: The placement with a relative here \u2014 which mother contends triggers the application of ORS 419B.498(2)(a) \u2014 is a prospective adoption and therefore is certainly \u201cintended to be permanent\u201d \u2014 yet the termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption cannot occur, under mother\u2019s reading, because the child is placed with a relative in a placement that is intended to be permanent. Planning for adoption by a relative would preclude achieving adoption by a relative, in mother\u2019s construction. Although apparently plausible at first glance, mother\u2019s construction of ORS 419B.498(2)(a) is not plausible when the statute is considered in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Mother does not contend that any other circumstance in ORS 419B.498(2) applies. Accordingly, we conclude that the juvenile court did not err by determining that none of the circumstances in ORS 419B.498(2) was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> ORS 419B.498(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">\u201cThe department shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of a parent in the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section [including, as relevant here, when the child has been in substitute care for 15 months of the most recent 22 months] unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\u201c(a) The child or ward is being cared for by a relative and that placement is intended to be permanent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">\u201c(b) There is a compelling reason, which is documented in the case plan, for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child or ward. Such compelling reasons include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">* * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-15\">\u201c(B) Another permanent plan is better suited to meet the health and safety needs of the child or ward * * *[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
