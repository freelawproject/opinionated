On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in giving the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d uniform jury instruction regarding accomplice liability \u2014 an instruction that we have since held \u201cis not an accurate statement of the law and that * * * probably created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the jurors.\u201d <em>State v. Lopez-Minjarez, </em>236 Or App 270, 286-87, 237 P3d 223, <em>disposition modified on recons, </em>237 Or App 688, 240 P3d 753 (2010). The state concedes that, under <em>Lopez-Minjarez, </em>the instruction was erroneous; it argues, however, that the error was harmless in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A recitation of the facts relevant to harmlessness would not benefit the bench, bar, or public. Suffice it to say that the jurors, on the facts of this case, likely were misled as to whether they were required to decide that the murder was committed \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 the robbery or burglary, ORS 163.115(l)(b), or whether they could instead decide that robbery and murder were the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d of an intended burglary. The erroneous instruction likely affected the jurors\u2019 deliberations as to the robbery and murder counts, and, ultimately, the verdict as well. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s robbery and murder convictions and remand for a new trial on those counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The state cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in merging defendant\u2019s burglary and robbery convictions with one of his convictions for felony murder. Given our reversal of the robbery and murder convictions, the merger question is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>On appeal, convictions for felony murder (Counts 5 and 6) and robbery (Count 8) reversed and remanded; burglary conviction remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed. Cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> The state also contends that <em>Lopez-Minjarez </em>was incorrectly decided, an argument we reject without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> Defendant does not argue that the instructional error was prejudicial with respect to his conviction for burglary, and we agree with the state that the error was harmless as to that conviction. Defendant has advanced two assignments of error regarding the admission of certain recorded testimony \u2014 assignments that, if correct, would require a reversal of the burglary conviction as well. We reject those assignments, and defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>contentions, without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
