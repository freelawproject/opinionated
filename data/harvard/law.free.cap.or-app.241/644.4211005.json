Bankston, </em>239 Or App 301, 243 P3d 1217 (2010). In that opinion, we affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and, on the state\u2019s cross-appeal, accepted defendant\u2019s concession that the trial court erred in merging two of his convictions. Accordingly, we remanded the case for entry of a judgment reflecting separate convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 303. As the state correctly notes in its petition for reconsideration, our opinion erroneously identified the convictions at issue in the state\u2019s cross-appeal. Our opinion mistakenly identified those convictions as defendant\u2019s convictions for first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.411, and third-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.415. <em>Id. </em>at 302. In fact, the convictions at issue were defendant\u2019s convictions for first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.411, and first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">For that reason, we modify our opinion and disposition in four respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">First, we delete the references to \u201cthird-degree sexual abuse\u201d in the first two sentences of our prior opinion, <em>id. </em>at 302, and in the first sentence of the second paragraph of that opinion, <em>id., </em>and replace them with \u201cfirst-degree sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Second, we delete the reference to \u201cORS 163.415\u201d in the first sentence of our prior opinion, <em>id., </em>and replace it with \u201cORS 163.427.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Third, we delete the text of footnote two, <em>id. </em>at 302 n 2, and replace it with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">\u201cORS 163.427 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-10\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-12\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-13\">\u201c(B) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201c(C) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being mentally defective, mentally incapacitated or physically helpless; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">\u201c(b) Intentionally causes a person under 18 years of age to touch or contact the mouth, anus or sex organs of an animal for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\u201c(2) Sexual abuse in the first degree is a Class B felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Fourth, we withdraw the disposition in our prior opinion, <em>id. </em>at 303, and replace it with the following: \u201cAffirmed on appeal. On cross appeal, remanded for entry of judgment reflecting convictions for one count of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration and one count of first-degree sexual abuse; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified. Affirmed on appeal. On cross-appeal, remanded for entry of judgment reflecting convictions for one count of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration and one count of first-degree sexual abuse; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
