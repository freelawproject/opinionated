Petitioners Karuk Tribe of California (Tribe) and Friends of the River Foundation (Friends) offered to pay TriMet for displaying a message about salmon restoration efforts. TriMet refused that offer based upon its advertising policy to accept only certain types of commercial advertisements and public service announcements for display. The reviewing court concluded that TriMet\u2019s decision violated Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution because the advertising policy classified acceptable displays on the basis of their subject matter and transgressed the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because the advertising policy was not applied in a viewpoint neutral way.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On appeal, TriMet contends that, in the context of a challenge to a government policy on the use of its property, where the government is acting in its proprietary capacity, Article I, section 8, should be interpreted consistently with the First Amendment. In that case, both constitutional provisions should be construed to allow content-based regulation of expression, so long as that regulation is reasonable and viewpoint neutral. In other words, TriMet would have us engage in the equivalent of a First Amendment forum analysis under Article I, section 8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Petitioners respond that there is no support for a \u201cproprietor exception\u201d in either the text of Article I, section 8, or that provision\u2019s history and interpretive case law; instead, petitioners rely on the analytical framework of <em>State v. Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 649 P2d 569 (1982). Petitioners argue that, because TriMet\u2019s decision was based on the content of the proposed display, it violated Article I, section 8. Petitioners also argue that TriMet engaged in viewpoint discrimination and made a decision not reasonably related to the stated purposes of its advertising policy so as to violate the First Amendment. Because we agree with petitioners that TriMet\u2019s decision violated Article I, section 8, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">TriMet is a mass transit district, organized and operating under the provisions of ORS chapter 267. It allows paid advertisements on the exterior of its buses and light rail vehicles. In August 2007, petitioners submitted the following display to TriMet that depicted three in-stream salmon facing a wall of electrical sockets:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>TriMet permits only certain types of displays on its vehicles. TriMet describes those permitted displays in a policy adopted by its general manager that is designated as TriMet\u2019s Advertising Policy and Standards. Ultimately, petitioners\u2019 submission was rejected pursuant to the 2008 version of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Section I.A. of the 2008 Advertising Policy and Standards (the policy) provides that it is adopted by the general manager pursuant to ORS 267.140. ORS 267.140(2) confers authority on the general manager of a mass transit district to \u201c[h]ave full charge of the administration of the business affairs of the district.\u201d By contrast, the district board is empowered by ORS 267.150 to exercise its \u201clegislative authority * * * by ordinance,\u201d including the power to \u201cenact police ordinances relating to the protection, use and enjoyment of district property and facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Section I.B. of the policy states that its purpose is \u201cto create definite, uniform Standards for the display of advertising on TriMet buses, light rail vehicles, facilities, and any other revenue vehicles or facilities owned, leased, controlled or operated by TriMet (hereinafter referred to as [ ^Property\u2019).\u201d In addition, section I.C. declares TriMet\u2019s intent \u201cnot to allow or cause any of its Property to become a public forum for the dissemination, debate, and/or discussion of public issues.\u201d Section I.D. further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201cActing in its proprietary capacity by allowing advertising on its vehicles and property and not as a regulator, TriMet seeks to advance certain interests including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201c(1) Maximizing revenues to support programs and services through the sales of Advertisements on vehicles and property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">\u201c(2) Promoting the use of public transportation[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201c(3) Maintaining the safety of passengers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">\u201c(4) Protecting minors who travel on TriMet\u2019s transportation system; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201c(5) Avoiding any potential identification of TriMet with the viewpoints of Advertisement on vehicles and property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Regarding the establishment of particular standards and restrictions for advertisements submitted for display on TriMet property, section II of the policy provides that \u201cTriMet only accepts Advertisements\u201d; that \u201c Advertisement,\u2019 as used in [the] policy, means a communication that promotes or offers goods or services\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he definition of Advertisement notwithstanding, TriMet may, in its discretion, accept \u2018Public Service Announcements\u2019 as defined herein.\u201d More particularly, section II.C. establishes that, if the proposed advertisement falls within one or more of 16 limiting categories, then that advertisement will not be displayed or maintained on TriMet property; the limiting categories include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">\u201c(9) Political. Campaign Speech. The Advertisement contains political campaign speech. For purposes of these Standards, the term \u2018political campaign speech\u2019 is speech that (1) refers to or supports a specific ballot question, initiative petition, or referendum, or (2) refers to any candidate for public office.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">(Underlining omitted.) Lastly, regarding public service announcements, section II.H. of the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cThe Advertising Contractor for TriMet will, from time to time, make unsold space available for public service announcements proposed by non-profit corporations that are exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or by federal, state or local government agencies or subdivision thereof. * * * A public service announcement cannot contain a message that is retail or commercial in nature and shall comply with the Advertising Standards set forth in the Advertising Policy and Standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Petitioners\u2019 request was reconsidered by TriMet\u2019s advertising standards committee under the 2008 policy. The committee concluded that petitioners\u2019 submission was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>allowed \u201cadvertisement.\u201d Petitioners appealed that decision to TriMet\u2019s general manager, Hansen, who concurred in the committee\u2019s findings that \u201cthe submission does not constitute advertising and is not permissible under TriMet\u2019s Advertising Policy and Standards * * * in effect as of January 8, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Following that final decision by TriMet, petitioners petitioned the trial court for a writ of review, alleging that TriMet\u2019s decision rejecting their proposed display constituted an unlawful restriction on speech in violation of Article I, section 8, and the First Amendment; the trial court issued the writ. TriMet filed a return to the writ and, later, an addendum to the return, after which the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, petitioners argued that TriMet\u2019s policy violated Article I, section 8, because it impermissibly discriminated based on content by allowing commercial speech while at the same time disallowing some forms of political speech. <em>See Robertson, </em>293 Or at 412 (Article I, section 8, \u201cforecloses the enactment of any law written in terms directed to the substance of any \u2018opinion\u2019 or any \u2018subject\u2019 of communication, unless the scope of the restraint is wholly confined within some historical exception\u201d). Petitioners also argued that TriMet\u2019s decision violated the First Amendment because it was not viewpoint neutral and was not reasonably related to the purposes of the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In response, TriMet raised, as an initial matter, whether the Tribe, as a \u201csovereign,\u201d had standing in the writ of review proceeding to enforce \u201cpersonal\u201d speech rights under the state and federal constitutions. At the same time, TriMet acknowledged that, without the Tribe as a party, the case would nonetheless proceed with Friends as the sole petitioner. As to the merits, TriMet argued that, in the instant context, the trial court should construe Article I, section 8, under the methodology of <em>Priest v. Pearce, </em>314 Or 411, 415-16, 840 P2d 65 (1992), so as to reach an interpretation that, in essence, would be consistent with First Amendment forum analysis. TriMet acknowledged that that construction necessarily included an element of \u201cpermissible content-based line drawing,\u201d and advocated that \u201cthis case is not a <em>Robertson </em>case.\u201d As to the First Amendment, TriMet argued that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>decision was constitutional because it was based on reasonable and viewpoint neutral content-based distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The reviewing court granted petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the cross-motion made by TriMet. In a letter opinion, the court explained that, as to Article I, section 8, it saw \u201cno basis on which to recognize any \u2018government as proprietor\u2019 distinction.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that, because \u201cthe content of the [petitioners\u2019] communication was the focus of the government decision,\u201d that decision was impermissible under Article I, section 8. The court also concluded that TriMet\u2019s decision \u201cwas not viewpoint neutral and was therefore invalid under the First Amendment.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court entered an order and, later, a general judgment concluding that TriMet\u2019s rejection of petitioners\u2019 display violated petitioners\u2019 free speech guarantees in the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"> On appeal, the parties renew the arguments they made below as to both the Tribe\u2019s standing and as to the Article I, section 8, analysis. As an initial matter, we reject TriMet\u2019s contentions concerning the Tribe\u2019s standing to proceed in this case. The Tribe obtained review of TriMet\u2019s decision under ORS 34.020. That statute sets the qualification or standing of a writ of review plaintiff to obtain review in circuit court. ORS 34.020 provides that, except for certain types of land use decisions, \u201cany party to any process or proceeding before or by any inferior court, officer, or tribunal may have the decision or determination thereof reviewed for errors, as provided in [the -writ of review statutes].\u201d In <em>Kellas v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>341 Or 471, 145 P3d 139 (2006), the Supreme Court determined that standing to obtain review of a rule adoption by an administrative agency was a function of statutory allowance: \u201cRather, the question is whether the legislature has empowered citizens to initiate a judicial proceeding to vindicate the public\u2019s interest in requiring the government to respect the limits of its authority under law.\u201d <em>Id. at 484. </em>Here, the legislature has authorized a \u201cparty\u201d to a local government proceeding to obtain judicial review. The Tribe was a \u201cparty\u201d to TriMet\u2019s process for review of acceptable advertising copy for display on mass transit vehicles and had standing to seek judicial review under ORS 34.020. Whether Article I, section 8, protected the Tribe\u2019s proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>speech goes to the merits of its arguments about TriMet\u2019s policy and not to its standing to obtain a judicial decision about the policy\u2019s validity. Accordingly, we turn to the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the interpretation of Article I, section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">As noted above, Article I, section 8, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o law shall be passed restraining the free expression of opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever.\u201d In <em>Robertson, </em>the Supreme Court explained that that provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201cforecloses the enactment of any law written in terms directed to the substance of any \u2018opinion\u2019 or any \u2018subject\u2019 of communication, unless the scope of the restraint is wholly confined within some historical exception that was well established when the first American guarantees of freedom of expression were adopted and that the guarantees then or in 1859 demonstrably were not intended to reach. Examples are perjury, solicitation or verbal assistance in crime, some forms of theft, forgery and fraud and their contemporary variants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">293 Or at 412 (citation omitted). The court later reiterated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201carticle I, section 8, prohibits lawmakers from enacting restrictions that focus on the content of speech or writing, either because that content itself is deemed socially undesirable or offensive, or because it is thought to have adverse consequences. * * * It means that laws must focus on proscribing the pursuit or accomplishment of forbidden results rather than on the suppression of speech or writing either as an end in itself or as a means to some other legislative end. * * * If [a] statute [is] directed only against causing the forbidden effects, a person accused of causing such effects by language or gestures would be left to assert (apart from a vagueness claim) that the statute could not constitutionally be applied to his particular words or other expression, not that it was drawn and enacted contrary to article I, section 8.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 416-17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">For nearly 30 years, the <em>Robertson </em>framework has been the guiding rubric by which Oregon appellate courts have resolved Article I, section 8, challenges to various laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>regulating constitutionally protected expression.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Moyer, </em>348 Or 220, 230 P3d 7, <em>cert den, </em>_US _ , 131 S Ct 326 (2010); <em>Vannatta v. Oregon Government Ethics Comm., </em>347 Or 449, 222 P3d 1077 (2009), <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 130 S Ct 3313 (2010); <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>340 Or 275, 132 P3d 5 (2006); <em>State v. Ciancanelli, </em>339 Or 282, 121 P3d 613 (2005); <em>City of Eugene v. Miller, </em>318 Or 480, 871 P2d 454 (1994). Rather than hew to the traditional <em>Robertson </em>framework, TriMet asks us instead to engage in a <em>Priest </em>analysis of Article I, section 8, and thereby construe that provision to allow government-drawn distinctions based on the content of expression where the government acts in its proprietary capacity. We decline TriMet\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Generally, our goal in construing an original provision of the Oregon Constitution is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201c \u2018to understand the wording [of the constitutional provision] in the light of the way that wording would have been understood and used by those who created the provision,\u2019 <em>Vannatta v. Keisling, </em>324 Or 514, 530, 931 P2d 770 (1997), and to \u2018apply faithfully the principles embodied in the Oregon Constitution to modern circumstances as those circumstances arise,\u2019 <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 297, 4 P3d 1261 (2000).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-10\"><em>State v. Hirsch/Friend, </em>338 Or 622, 631, 114 P3d 1104 (2005). To reach that goal, <em>Priest </em>requires the examination of the wording, historical circumstances, and interpretive case law of the constitutional provision at issue. 314 Or at 415-16. As TriMet correctly notes, the construction of Article I, section 8, provided in <em>Robertson </em>was not based on the methodology of <em>Priest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">However, the Supreme Court in <em>Ciancanelli </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">\u201c[I]n light of this court\u2019s longstanding reliance on the <em>Robertson </em>framework to resolve issues that arise under Article I, section 8, the burden of demonstrating that that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>framework is inconsistent with the intent of the people who drafted and adopted Article I, section 8, lies with the party challenging that framework \u2014 in this case, the state. * * * [Ajfter applying the methodology set out in <em>Priest </em>to Article I, section 8, we are satisfied that the <em>Robertson </em>framework is justified. That framework is generally compatible with the \u2018natural rights\u2019 approach that we have described as a possible source of Article I, section 8. Moreover, it is more consistent with that approach than the malleable and indistinct \u2018balancing\u2019 test proposed by the state. We therefore will continue to analyze challenges brought under Article I, section 8, using the <em>Robertson </em>framework (including <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>notion of a historical exception).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">339 Or at 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">TriMet recognizes that <em>Ciancanelli </em>determined that the <em>Robertson </em>framework was \u201cjustified,\u201d but nonetheless contends that we should not apply that framework \u2014 in essence, that we should ignore binding Supreme Court precedent \u2014because (1) the court in <em>Robertson </em>\u201cwas not thinking about governmental proprietorship when it issued its decision\u201d; (2) \u201cthere is a fundamental inconsistency between <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>\u2019non-content\u2019 approach and \u2018forum analysis\u2019 \u2018reasonable viewpoint neutral\u2019 content-based perspective\u201d; and (3) it would make little sense to \u201ccompel governments acting as property owners[,] when opening up previously closed forums[,] * * * to try and fit their forum into the second <em>Robertson </em>category.\u201d We understand TriMet to argue that <em>Robertson\u2019s </em>reach does not extend to circumstances where a government acts in its proprietary capacity and that therefore we should construe Article I, section 8, under the <em>Priest </em>methodology. In light of <em>Ciancanelli, </em>however, TriMet\u2019s arguments before us that this is not a <em>Robertson </em>case are unpersuasive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>TriMet rejected petitioners\u2019 submission because its policy only allowed displays to be published on its vehicles if the display was an advertisement or a public service announcement. Accordingly, TriMet\u2019s decision to reject petitioners\u2019 display because it was not an advertisement was based on the application of a policy that explicitly regulated expression based on its content. Under the first category of <em>Robertson, </em>such regulation is impermissible under Article I, section 8, unless the restraint is wholly confined to some historical exception. The only argument offered by TriMet that its advertising policy restrictions fall within such a historical exception comes too late in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">TriMet, in a footnote in its reply brief, takes the position that, even if we disagree with its argument that this is not a <em>Robertson </em>case, it is not \u201cgame over.\u201d According to TriMet,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201c[allthough it would present the Court with the task of driving a square peg into a round hole, TriMet has provided the Court with a historical basis predating the adoption of the Oregon Constitution that suggests that, had the framers or voters in 1857 thought about the issue, they would have acknowledged and embraced * * * the proprietary function doctrine applicable to municipal corporations that was well established in other jurisdictions by that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Charitably, we understand TriMet\u2019s statements in that regard to present an alternative argument for reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision \u2014 that, under the first category of <em>Robertson, </em>there <em>is </em>a government as proprietor historical exception to the reach of Article I, section 8. We do not reach the merits of that argument for two reasons: not only did TriMet fail to preserve that argument below, but, as we have often had occasion to remind others, \u201c[a] party may not raise an issue for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Best Overhead Door, LLC, </em>238 Or App 559, 563 n 2, 242 P3d 740 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The trial court did not err in concluding that TriMet\u2019s advertising policy violated Article I, section 8, to the extent that it classified speech on the basis of its content, notwithstanding that the policy regulated the use of government property.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> Article I, section 8, provides, \u201cNo law shall be passed restraining the free expression of opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever; but every person shall be responsible for the abuse of this right.\u201d The First Amendment similarly provides, in part, \u201cCongress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> The United States Supreme Court recently summarized the First Amendment\u2019s forum analysis in <em>Christian Legal Soc.

DMV, </em>335 Or 481, 490-91, 72 P3d 628 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\"> TriMet does not contend that an advertising policy adopted by a governmental officer that only affects contractual relationships of that government does not enact or implement a \u201claw\u201d under Article I, section 8. Indeed, TriMet eschewed any such contention at oral argument. The challenged policy in this case declared the general manager\u2019s preferences for entering into contracts for the use of district property for advertising. The policy was adopted under the general manager\u2019s administrative authority under ORS 267.140(2) to \u201c[h]ave full charge of the administration of the business affairs of the district\u201d and not under the lawmaking powers conferred to the district board under ORS 267.150. Neither we nor the Supreme Court have decided whether a governmental policy adopted by an executive officer that only affects contractual relationships of that government, and does not enact or implement a general rule of civil conduct, qualifies as a \u2018law,\u201d whose enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>or enforcement is constrained by Article I, section 8. It may be that the relevant \u201claw\u201d here is ORS 267.140(2), empowering the general manager to adopt the policy in question. As we have said, however, any legal distinction about the meaning of a \u201crestricting\u201d or \u201crestraining\u201d \u201claw\u201d under Article I, section 8 \u2014 although related to TriMet\u2019s \u201cgovernment as proprietor\u201d thesis \u2014 is outside the legal questions presented to the reviewing court below and advanced on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
