ORS 163.175. On appeal, defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that she knew that her brother would use a rock \u2014 as opposed to his fist \u2014 to assault the victim, and that she therefore should have been acquitted of aiding and abetting the \u201cphysical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d ORS 163.175(l)(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Because the trial court found defendant guilty of the relevant offense, we state the facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Viranond, </em>346 Or 451, 453, 212 P3d 1252 (2009). Defendant and the victim were friends. They briefly lived together and also worked together. The friendship fell apart in December 2008, and the victim moved out. The victim also informed their employer about some of defendant\u2019s activities, and defendant was fired as a result. After defendant was fired, she made threats through mutual acquaintances about what she would do to the victim, including a text message stating, \u201cwhen I see her she\u2019s dead.\u201d The victim also learned through friends that defendant was \u201clooking for [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In January 2009, the victim and her friends were \u201changing out\u201d in downtown Portland when she saw defendant in a car that she recognized as belonging to defendant\u2019s boyfriend, Mashtalyar. The victim became concerned, called for her ride, and headed back to her residence in Oregon City.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">When the victim reached her residence and began walking up the steps to the front door, she saw someone \u201crunning out of the bushes.\u201d That individual, later identified as defendant\u2019s 13-year-old brother, struck the victim twice in the head with a rock, knocking her to the grass. Defendant, who had been hiding in the bushes, then jumped out. She and her brother then ran to Mashtalyar\u2019s car, which was parked down the block, and they fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The victim and her friends reported the crime and described the getaway car. A short time later, police pulled over Mashtalyar\u2019s car. He was driving, defendant was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>passenger seat, and defendant\u2019s brother was in the backseat. Mashtalyar told the investigating officer that they had driven to Oregon City to beat up the victim, that the plan was to punch and \u201cknock [the victim] out,\u201d and that \u201call three had planned it\u201d; he denied knowing anything about the rock that was used during the assault. As it turned out, Mashtalyar had been driving with a suspended license, and his car was towed and inventoried. During the inventory, police found \u201ca baseball sized rock that had blood on it\u201d under the driver\u2019s seat. In the backseat, police found a canister of pepper spray, a black ski mask, and an aluminum baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Defendant and Mashtalyar, her codefendant, were each subsequently charged with two counts of assault. Count 1, second-degree assault, alleged that the defendants \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly cause physical injury to [the victim] by means of a dangerous weapon, to-wit: a rock.\u201d Count 2, third-degree assault, alleged that the defendants \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly, while being aided by another person actually present, cause physical injury to [the victim].\u201d After a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of second-degree assault on a theory of accomplice liability; she was acquitted of third-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Defendant now appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in convicting her of second-degree assault because the evidence established, at most, that she was an accomplice to fourth-degree assault. Her contention is that, under the accomplice liability statute, ORS 161.155, a defendant cannot be held liable for aiding or abetting second-degree assault unless the defendant intends to aid or abet that particular crime, as opposed to an assault generally. Here, she argues, the evidence established that she agreed to aid her brother in \u201cbeating up\u201d the victim \u2014 a fourth-degree assault \u2014 but that there was no evidence that she was aware or intended that her brother would use a rock (which she concedes is a dangerous weapon) as part of that assault. According to defendant, despite that lack of evidence, the trial court nonetheless erroneously relied on <em>dictum </em>in <em>State v. Fichter, </em>226 Or 526, 532, 360 P2d 278 (1961), to find her guilty on the theory that second-degree assault by means of a rock was a \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of the plan to physically assault the victim. <em>Cf. State v. Lopez-Minjarez, </em>236 Or App 270, 286, 237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>P3d 223, <em>disposition modified on recons, </em>237 Or App 688, 240 P3d 753 (2010) (\u201cWe conclude that the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 instruction is not an accurate statement of the lawt.]\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The state\u2019s response is two-fold. First, the state argues that defendant did not adequately preserve for appeal her contentions regarding the sufficiency of the evidence because she did not move for a judgment of acquittal, nor did she argue below regarding the continued viability of <em>Fichter\u2019s </em>\u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d formulation. Second, the state argues that, contrary to defendant\u2019s characterization of the evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that defendant indeed intended to aid or abet a second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">As an initial matter, we conclude that the issue defendant raises on appeal regarding the sufficiency of the evidence was adequately preserved below. Although defendant did not move for a judgment of acquittal, she clearly challenged the sufficiency of the evidence during closing argument. <em>See State v. McCants/Walker, </em>231 Or App 570, 576, 220 P3d 436 (2009), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or 655, 239 P3d 226 (2010) (\u201cAs noted, here, neither defendant challenged the legal sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof by way of a motion for judgment of acquittal. Nevertheless, in a bench trial, a defendant may also preserve a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence by clearly raising the issue in closing argument.\u201d). During closing arguments, counsel for her codefendant specifically argued that, under the accomplice liability statute, the state must prove that the defendants intended to aid and abet an assault with a dangerous weapon rather than a \u201csimple Assault IV of punching.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">\u201cNatural and probable consequences don\u2019t apply to a situation where on [his] own [defendant\u2019s brother] finds a weapon of some kind as he\u2019s heading to the scene of the incident and then changes the whole intent of what\u2019s going to go on, which is you\u2019re going to do an armed assault, that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>not a natural and probable consequence of the plan that these people had or the intent that they had in the car, which was to punch her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Codefendant\u2019s counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201cAnd, again \u2014 you know, what evidence is there that there was any planning to commit an Assault II in the car, there wasn\u2019t any. What did [defendant] think when she was leaving the car and what was going to happen at this place, was she aiding an Assault II or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u2018When did [defendant\u2019s brother] arm himself with a rock, did [defendant] know that he had picked up a rock, did she pick it up and give it to him, what discussions were there, we don\u2019t have any evidence of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201cDid \u2014 you know, so if she aided \u2014 how did she aid an Assault II so a lot of the same questions as Mr. Mashtalyar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then offered her closing argument, asking the court to \u201cadopt on behalf of my client [codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] arguments he and I discussed [sic] the various cases that we found.\u201d Later, defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cstress[ed] [codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] argument about the natural causes or the natural effects,\u201d arguing that there was no evidence that defendant knew that an assault with a rock would be a consequence of her actions. Furthermore, from the trial court\u2019s remarks following closing arguments, it is apparent that the court understood defendant and her codefendant to be arguing that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that they intended to aid or abet a crime more serious than fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">We turn, then, to the merits of defendant\u2019s assignment of error. Her argument has two components: First, she argues that she can be convicted of second-degree assault on an accomplice liability theory only if she intended to aid or abet an assault of that <em>seriousness </em>\u2014 i.e., an assault with a dangerous weapon. Second, she argues that the evidence in the record is insufficient to establish that she intended anything more than to aid her brother\u2019s punching of the victim in the head with his fist. Whatever the merits of defendant\u2019s understanding of accomplice liability, her factual premise is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>incorrect. On this record, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that defendant intended more than a \u201csimple\u201d assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Defendant is correct that there is no direct testimony that she knew her brother was armed with a rock. There is ample circumstantial evidence, however, from which a trier of fact could infer that defendant intended her brother to inflict injury on the victim by means of a dangerous weapon. A trier of fact would not be required to infer, as defendant suggests, that her brother picked up the rock somewhere outside of defendant\u2019s presence. It would be perfectly reasonable to infer that her brother had the rock with him when they left the car together or picked it up as the two were approaching the victim\u2019s residence together, and that defendant knew exactly what her brother intended to do with it. Defendant had previously threatened, \u201c[WJhen I see [the victim] she\u2019s dead.\u201d The plan was to \u201cknock [the victim] out\u201d; in the backseat of the getaway car, there was a ski mask (used during the assault), a baseball bat, and a canister of mace \u2014 items that, under the circumstances, give rise to an inference that the plan was to do more than simply punch the victim; and defendant was dropped off with her brother and was hiding nearby in the bushes when her brother, carrying a \u201clarge object\u201d in his hand, ran toward the victim and assaulted her. That evidence was sufficient for a trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to aid or abet an assault with a dangerous weapon, and defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the charge of second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> Although defendant suggests that the trial court applied the incorrect law to the facts, <em>cf Lopez-Minjarez, </em>236 Or App at 286, her assignment of error pertains only to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
