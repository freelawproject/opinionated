Great American appeals a limited judgment in favor of the district, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment for the district and denial of its own motion for summary judgment. The trial court determined that the insured\u2019s excess insurance policy with Great American did not incorporate an anti-assignment provision contained in the insured\u2019s underlying policy and, consequently, that the district as assignee could prevail on its claim for breach of contract against Great American. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In an appeal of a judgment resulting from cross-motions for summary judgment, where the defendant assigns error to both the denial of its motion and the granting of the plaintiffs motion, both are subject to review. <em>Ellis v. Ferrellgas, L. P., </em>211 Or App 648, 652, 156 P3d 136 (2007). Each moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there are no issues of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&amp;L Excavating and Trucking, Inc., </em>178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002). We review the record for each motion in the light most favorable to the party opposing that motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Here, the district and Great American agree that there are no disputed issues of fact and that their opposing motions turn on issues of law, specifically, the interpretation of an insurance contract and the applicability of a statute, ORS 31.825. We summarize the facts from those stipulated by the parties for purposes of their cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The district hired a roofing contractor to replace the roof of a school. The contractor was negligent in its work, and, as a result, the roof caught fire. The contractor had a liability insurance contract (the underlying policy) with CNA Insurance Company (CNA), and an excess insurance contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(the excess policy) with Great American.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amount of damage to the school exceeded the limits of the underlying policy. The contractor timely submitted claims to both CNA and Great American for coverage under the policies; Great American denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Thereafter, the contractor, the district, and CNA entered into a settlement agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, CNA agreed to pay its policy limit of $1 million, and the contractor agreed to pay $50,000, to the district. The parties agreed that, within five days after execution of the agreement, the district would file a civil action for negligence against the contractor, seeking damages of $2,393,885.43, at which time the agreed-upon payments would be made. Upon collection of payment, the district then agreed to \u201crelease[ ] [the contractor] from claims of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, that could be asserted against [the contractor] up to and including the first $1,050,000 of the total amount of [the district\u2019s] damages suffered as a result of the Fire\u201d and that \u201c[the district\u2019s] claims exceeding the first $1,050,000 of [the district\u2019s damages] are expressly reserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The agreement further provided that, within five days after the filing of the complaint against the contractor and the receipt of payment from CNA and the contractor, the district and the contractor would file a stipulated judgment against the contractor for $1,343,885.43, representing the district\u2019s remaining alleged damages. Finally, the parties agreed that, within five days after entry of the stipulated judgment, the contractor would assign its claims and rights against third parties, including Great American,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the district in exchange for the district\u2019s agreement not to execute the judgment against it (the \u201cAssignment of Claims and Covenant Not to Execute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Those events occurred,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, on the basis of the assignment of rights from the contractor, the district filed this action against Great American<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for, among other claims, breach of the insurance contract. The parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of Great American\u2019s liability on the district\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">As relevant here, Great American argued that an anti-assignment clause in the underlying policy (set out below) was incorporated into Great American\u2019s excess policy, thus precluding assignment of the contractor\u2019s rights to the district without its consent under <em>Holloway v. Republic Indemnity Co. of America, </em>341 Or 642, 147 P3d 329 (2006). Relying on <em>Stubblefield v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>267 Or 397, 517 P2d 262 (1973), Great American further argued that, even presuming a valid assignment of the contractor\u2019s rights under the excess policy, because the settlement agreement released the contractor from any additional liability to the district beyond the amount it paid under the settlement, Great American consequently also has no obligation to the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In response, the district argued that (1) the excess policy does not incorporate the anti-assignment provision in the underlying policy; (2) the anti-assignment provision in any event is inconsistent with ORS 31.825 and, therefore, invalid; and (3) because the contractor\u2019s claims were not extinguished by the settlement agreement but expressly preserved by ORS 31.825, Great American\u2019s argument under <em>Stubblefield </em>fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The trial court agreed with the district that the anti-assignment provision in the underlying policy was not incorporated into the excess policy and, without further explanation, entered an order granting the district\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>partial summary judgment and denying Great American\u2019s motion. A limited judgment was subsequently entered against Great American, which Great American now appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The central issue on appeal is whether, in light of the anti-assignment provision in the contractor\u2019s underlying policy with CNA, the district can maintain this action against Great American. That provision states: \u201cYour rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without our written consent except in the case of death of an individual named insured.\u201d The excess policy, in turn, includes a section entitled \u201cCOVERAGE,\u201d which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201cWe will pay on behalf of the Insured \u2018loss\u2019 in excess of the Underlying Limits of Insurance shown in Item 5. of the Declarations, but only up to an amount not exceeding the Company\u2019s Limits of Insurance as shown in Item 4. of the Declarations. <em>Except for the terms, conditions, definitions and exclusions of this policy, the coverage provided by this policy will follow the First Underlying Insurance Policy, as shown in Item 5. of the Declarations </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">(Capitalization omitted; emphasis added.) It is thus necessary for us to first determine whether, by virtue of the emphasized text (the disputed provision), the excess policy incorporates the anti-assignment clause of the underlying policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We review interpretations of insurance policies for errors of law. <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469, 836 P2d 703 (1992). As the Supreme Court recently reiterated, \u201cthe primary and governing rule\u201d in doing so \u201cis to ascertain the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Dewsnup v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>349 Or 33, 39-40, 239 P3d 493 (2010) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201cTo that end, we examine the terms and conditions of the policy, <em>Groshong v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>329 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>303, 307, 985 P2d 1284 (1999) (citing <em>Interstate Fire v. Archdiocese of Portland, </em>318 Or 110, 117, 864 P2d 346 (1993)), and where a particular term is not defined in the contract, we begin by identifying that term\u2019s plain meaning. <em>Groshong, </em>329 Or at 308. If the term has no plain meaning; that is, if the term is ambiguous, we examine that term within the context of the policy as a whole. <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 470. If two or more plausible interpretations still remain, we construe the term against the drafter and in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><em>Dewsnup, </em>349 Or at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Great American contends that the only plausible reading of the disputed provision demonstrates that the excess policy is a \u201cfollows-form\u201d contract \u2014 that is, that it \u201cincorporates all the terms, conditions, definitions and exclusions of the underlying CNA insurance contract except for provisions that contradict language contained in Great American\u2019s own insurance contract.\u201d Because the excess policy does not address the assignment of rights, it thus follows, according to Great American, that the excess policy incorporates the anti-assignment clause from the underlying policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The district, on the other hand, interprets the provision to mean that the excess policy follows only the \u201ccoverage\u201d section of the underlying policy, not its \u201cterms, conditions, definitions and exclusions,\u201d such as the anti-assignment clause. In other words, in the district\u2019s view, the disputed text unambiguously provides that the \u201cterms, conditions, definitions and exclusions\u201d do not follow the underlying policy, but, rather, are determined solely by reference to the excess policy, which, as noted, does not itself preclude the assignment of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">As explained below, we conclude that the provision is ambiguous, that that ambiguity is not resolved by reference to the context of the policy as a whole, and, therefore, that the provision must be construed against its drafter, Great American. <em>Dewsnup, </em>349 Or at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Following the methodology described above, \u201c[w]e begin with the wording of the policy, applying any definitions that are supplied by the policy itself and otherwise presuming that words have their plain, ordinary meanings.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Tualatin Valley Housing v. Truck Ins. Exchange, </em>208 Or App 155, 159, 144 P3d 991 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 344 (2007). Once again, the pertinent wording reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">\u201cExcept for the terms, conditions, definitions and exclusions of this policy, the coverage provided by this policy will follow the [underlying policy].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">None of the key words are defined in the policy itself; therefore, we look first to the plain meanings of those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The word \u201cexcept,\u201d as used here, can mean \u201cwith the exclusion or exception of,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>791 (unabridged ed 2002); \u201cexception,\u201d in turn, means \u201cthe act of excepting or excluding: exclusion or restriction (as of a class, statement, or rule) by taking out something <em>that would otherwise be included,\u201d id. </em>(emphasis added). Given that definition, the sentence could reasonably be understood to mean, as Great American asserts, that the excess policy follows the underlying policy, including its terms, conditions, definitions, and exclusions \u2014 provisions that would otherwise be encompassed in \u201ccoverage\u201d \u2014 with the exception of those specific terms and conditions that are also contained in the excess policy itself. However, the word \u201cexcept\u201d can also mean \u201cotherwise, elsewhere, or for other reason than : other than : BUT.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Capitalization in original.) And that definition tends to support the district\u2019s reading \u2014 that is, that the excess policy follows the underlying coverage <em>other than </em>as to the terms, conditions, definitions, and exclusions that will govern that coverage, which terms will be supplied by the excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Reference to the ordinary meaning of the term \u201ccoverage\u201d does nothing to clarify the provision\u2019s meaning in either direction. Great American\u2019s asserted construction of the provision requires that the word \u201ccoverage\u201d necessarily encompass policy terms, conditions, definitions, and exclusions. The district\u2019s reading, on the other hand, comprehends that \u201ccoverage\u201d means something separate and apart from the policy\u2019s terms, conditions, definitions, and exclusions\u2014 specifically, \u201ccoverage,\u201d according to the district, is the general categories of loss included in the policy (here, <em>e.g., </em>bodily injury and property damage, \u201cpersonal and advertising\u201d injury, and medical payments). Either reading is plausible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>under the relevant dictionary definitions of the word. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 524-25 (defining \u201ccoverage\u201d as \u201cprotection by insurance policy: inclusion within the scope of a protective or beneficial plan,\u201d or the \u201caggregate of items covered as * * * the aggregate of risks covered by the terms of a contract of insurance\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Bergmann v. Hutton, </em>337 Or 596, 603-04, 101 P3d 353 (2004) (meaning of words \u201cthis coverage\u201d as used in ORS 742.504(7)(c) decipherable only by reference to its context).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The plain meaning of the provision is therefore ambiguous, and we turn to the context to determine if that ambiguity can be resolved. <em>Groshong, </em>329 Or at 312 (second interpretive step entails \u201cexamin[ing] the phrase in light of \u2018the particular context in which that phrase is used in the policy and the broader context of the policy as a whole\u2019 \u201d (brackets in original omitted) (quoting <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 470)). As context supporting its interpretation, the district points to the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision in the excess policy, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cIf other insurance applies to a \u2018loss\u2019 that is also covered by this policy, this policy will apply excess of the other insurance. Nothing herein will be construed to make this policy subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of such other insurance. However, this provision will not apply if the other insurance is specifically written to be excess of this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201cOther insurance includes any type of self-insurance or other mechanism by which an insured arranges for funding of legal liabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The district contends that the underlying policy \u2014 because it is a \u201cmechanism\u201d that the insured used to fund its legal liabilities- \u2014 falls within the scope of \u201cother insurance,\u201d and, as a result, the excess policy is expressly not subject to any of the terms and conditions of the underlying policy, including the anti-assignment clause. We disagree. Read in the context of the policy as a whole, it is plain that the underlying policy\u2014 which is specifically identified and consistently referred to throughout the excess policy as the \u201cFirst Underlying Insurance Policy\u201d \u2014 is separate and distinct from the \u201cother insurance\u201d referred to in this provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The district also points out that the underlying policy includes a specific section entitled \u201cCOVERAGES,\u201d which, among other things, defines and describes the various <em>types </em>of coverages provided by the policy, such as for bodily injury and property damages, as well as a separate and distinct section entitled \u201cCOMMON POLICY CONDITIONS,\u201d which includes the anti-assignment clause. Thus, according to the district, because the incorporation provision uses the term \u201ccoverage\u201d to describe the particulars in which the excess policy will follow the underlying policy, it clearly indicates the policy\u2019s intent to incorporate the \u201cCOVERAGES\u201d section of the underlying policy, and not the \u201cCOMMON POLICY CONDITIONS\u201d section of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">That position is persuasive up to a point. However, the \u201cCOVERAGES\u201d section of the underlying policy also contains particular subsections labeled \u201cExclusions,\u201d undermining the district\u2019s argument that \u201cterms, conditions, definitions and exclusions\u201d are distinct from the policy\u2019s \u201ccoverage.\u201d Moreover, as Great American points out, the word \u201ccoverage\u201d is also used broadly in both policies to refer generally to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>scope of benefits and rights provided by the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Other contextual clues, however, do provide support for the district\u2019s reading of the disputed provision. For example, the excess policy includes separate sections referring specifically to \u201cCONDITIONS,\u201d \u201cDEFINITIONS,\u201d and \u201cEXCLUSIONS.\u201d Although the policy does not contain a separate \u201cTERMS\u201d section, that structure lends some credence to the district\u2019s view that the excess policy, rather than the underlying policy, provides the applicable \u201cterms, conditions, definitions and exclusions.\u201d More significantly, the \u201cexhaustion\u201d provision of the excess policy \u2014 which appears on the same page of the policy as the disputed provision \u2014 states that, under certain circumstances, if all limits of the underlying policy are exhausted,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the excess policy \u201cwill apply as underlying insurance <em>subject to the same terms, conditions, definitions and exclusions of the [underlying </em>policy], except for the terms, conditions, definitions and exclusions of [the excess policy].\u201d (Emphasis added.) This suggests that Great American knew how to incorporate the terms and conditions of the underlying policy when it intended to do so. By using different phrasing in the provision at issue here \u2014 that is, by instead saying \u201c[e]xcept for the terms, conditions, definitions and exclusions of this policy, the <em>coverage </em>provided by this policy <em>will follow </em>the [underlying policy]\u201d (emphasis added)\u2014 it is reasonable to assume that Great American intended something different. <em>See Laird v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>232 Or App 162, 171, 221 P3d 780 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 414 (2010) (acknowledging the maxim of construction that \u201cdifferent words are presumed to have different meanings\u201d in the context of insurance contract interpretation; rejecting application of that maxim where it would lead to a result that is not plausible from the perspective of an \u201c \u2018ordinary purchaser of insurance\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Totten v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>298 Or 765, 771, 696 P2d 1082 (1985))).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In short, a contextual reading of the provision at issue here provides no definitive guidance as to whether the excess policy is intended to incorporate all of the particulars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of the underlying policy (except those in conflict with the \u201cterms, conditions, definitions and exclusions\u201d of the excess policy), or whether all of the \u201cterms, conditions, definitions and exclusions\u201d would be supplied by the excess policy itself. As a result, the provision remains ambiguous. We, therefore, apply the rule that ambiguous terms are to be construed against the drafter and in favor of the insured. <em>Dewsnup, </em>349 Or at 40 (citing <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 470-71). As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">\u201cAmbiguity requires resort ultimately to [that rule] because, when two or more competing, plausible interpretations survive the kind of scrutiny described, the term still must \u2018reasonably be given a broader or a narrower meaning, depending upon the intention of the parties in the context in which such words are used by them.\u2019 <em>Shadbolt v. Farmers Insur. Exch., </em>275 Or 407, 411, 551 P2d 478 (1976); <em>accord Joseph v. Utah Home Fire Ins. Co., </em>313 Or 323, 330, 835 P2d 885 (1992); <em>Chalmers v. Oregon Auto Ins. Co., </em>262 Or 504, 509, 500 P2d 258 (1972). That is, when two or more competing, plausible interpretations prove to be reasonable after all other methods for resolving the dispute over the meaning of particular words fail, <em>then </em>the rule of interpretation against the drafter of the language becomes applicable, because the ambiguity cannot be permitted to survive. It must be resolved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\"><em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 470-71 (emphasis in original). Applying that rule here means that we construe the excess policy in favor of the district, that is, as <em>not </em>incorporating the anti-assignment provision contained in the underlying policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the parties recognize, absent that incorporation, nothing in the excess policy prohibits the contractor from assigning its rights under the policy to the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We turn, then, to Great American\u2019s alternative argument that, even if the assignment of rights was valid under the policy, the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment under the holding of <em>Stubblefield, </em>267 Or 397. In <em>Stubblefield, </em>the plaintiff had, in a prior action, sued his wife\u2019s doctor for allegedly enticing the plaintiffs wife to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>engage in sexual intercourse with the doctor and with others in the doctor\u2019s presence (specifically, the claims were for \u201calienation of affections\u201d and \u201ccriminal conversation\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 398. The doctor was insured by the defendant, who refused to defend. The plaintiff and the doctor then entered into a settlement agreement, \u201cunder which a judgment for $50,000 was entered against [the doctor], but with a prior \u2018covenant not to execute\u2019 against the [doctor] for any amount in excess of $5,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In exchange, the doctor executed an assignment to the plaintiff of all claims in excess of that amount that he had against the defendant insurance company; the plaintiff subsequently filed an action against the defendant based on those claims. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that, because the defendant was required to indemnify the doctor only for the amount that the doctor was \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d and the covenant not to execute the judgment had extinguished the doctor\u2019s liability to the plaintiff above $5,000\u2014 which amount was expressly excluded by the assignment\u2014 there was nothing to assign. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01 (emphasis omitted). In other words, the purported assignment transferred no enforceable rights against the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Great American argues that the present case is materially indistinguishable \u2014 that is, the district made a claim against the contractor;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the insurer, Great American, denied coverage; the district entered into a settlement agreement with the contractor; under that agreement, a stipulated judgment was entered against the contractor for a specified amount of damages, and the district agreed not to execute that judgment in exchange for the contractor assigning to the district its rights and claims against Great American. Thus, in Great American\u2019s view, just as in <em>Stubblefield, </em>the contractor had no legal liability to the district for the judgment and, consequently, under <em>Stubblefield, </em>neither does Great American.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The district remonstrates that <em>Stubblefield </em>is inapplicable in light of ORS 31.825, enacted after <em>Stubblefield </em>was decided, and under which the contractor\u2019s claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Great American were expressly preserved and validly assigned to the district. We agree with the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">ORS 31.825 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cA defendant in a tort action against whom a judgment has been rendered may assign any cause of action that defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer as a result of the judgment to the plaintiff in whose favor the judgment has been entered. That assignment and any release or covenant given for the assignment shall not extinguish the cause of action against the insurer unless the assignment specifically so provides.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Thus, the statute expressly permits a defendant in a tort action who has received an adverse judgment to assign to the plaintiff in that action any cause of action that the defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer as a result of the judgment. Here, at the time the district and the contractor entered into the \u201cAssignment of Claims and Covenant Not to Execute\u201d the contractor was the defendant in an action for negligence brought by the district, and a judgment in favor of the district had been entered in that case. As a result of that judgment, the contractor had a cause of action against Great American for breach of the insurance contract, which the contractor then assigned to the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Moreover, the second sentence of the statute makes clear that the assignment \u2014 and any \u201crelease or covenant\u201d given in exchange \u2014 does not, unless the assignment specifically provides otherwise, extinguish the claims against the insurer. Here, the \u201cAssignment of Claims and Covenant Not to Execute\u201d did not specify the elimination of claims against Great American, but, instead, expressly preserved them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Great American, however, contends that the statute does not apply because the assignment and release were agreed to in the settlement agreement \u2014 that is, before any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>suit was filed against the contractor. Therefore, according to Great American, the defendant was not \u201ca defendant in a tort action,\u201d and the contractor did not have any \u201ccause of action\u201d against Great American \u201cas a result of the judgment.\u201d Rather, in Great American\u2019s view, the district \u201cfully compromised its claim against [the contractor] <em>prior to </em>the entry of the stipulated judgment\u201d (emphasis in original), thus, the statute is inapposite and, consistently with <em>Stubblefield, </em>Great American has no liability to the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The problem with Great American\u2019s argument is that, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the district\u2019s release of the contractor from claims in excess of $1,050,000 \u2014 although anticipated in the agreement \u2014 was conditioned upon the filing of a tort action and entry of judgment against the contractor. To briefly recap that agreement: The parties agreed that the district would file an action for negligence against the contractor after the settlement agreement was executed and that, within five days after that filing and the district\u2019s collection of payment of $1,050,000 ($50,000 from the contractor and $1,000,000 from CNA), the district and the contractor would file a stipulated judgment against the contractor for the district\u2019s damages in excess of that amount. The agreement then provided that, \u201cwithin five business days after the stipulated judgment is entered, [the contractor] and [the district] will execute an assignment agreement and covenant not to execute in the form attached [the Assignment of Claims and Covenant Not to Execute].\u201d Thus, until the stipulated judgment was entered, the district had no enforceable right to assignment and the contractor had no enforceable right to release from liability to the district. Moreover, the agreement expressly provided that the district reserved its claims against the contractor (in excess of the $1,050,000 that the contractor and CNA agreed to pay). <em>See </em>241 Or App at 164. In other words, contrary to Great American\u2019s position, the district did not \u201cfully compromise its claims\u201d against the contractor until the \u201cAssignment of Claims and Covenant Not to Execute\u201d was executed. And, at that time, the contractor plainly was a \u201cdefendant in a tort action against whom a judgment ha[d] been rendered\u201d who had a cause of action against its insurer as a result of that judgment. Thus, under the plain meaning of ORS 31.825, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>contractor was free to assign that cause of action to the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">To summarize, we conclude that the excess policy does not prohibit the assignment of the contractors\u2019 rights under that policy to the district. We further conclude that that assignment was valid under ORS 31.825 and, consequently, that the district, as assignee, prevails in its claim for breach of contract against Great American. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in entering partial summary judgment for the district or in denying Great American\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> The underlying policy had the following limits: $1 million per occurrence, $2 million products/completed operations aggregate, and $2 million general aggregate. The excess policy had limits of $4 million per occurrence with $4 million aggregate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> The contractor reserved its right to collect against Great American for the $50,000 it agreed to pay to the district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> It appears, however, that the stipulated general judgment that was actually entered against the contractor was in the amount of $1,172,639, rather than $1,343,885.43, as was contemplated in the settlement agreement. Neither party argues that that disparity has any significance to the issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\"> The district also named the contractor\u2019s insurance agents as defendants, claiming negligent procurement of insurance.

(Quoting Eric Mills Holmes, Interim Vol 23, <em>Appleman On Insurance 2d, </em>\u00a7 145.1, 6 (2003).) <em>See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>877 (9th ed 2009) (a following-form policy\u201d \u201cadopts the terms and conditions of another insurance policy\u201d). Even assuming that understanding of \u201cfollows-form\u201d insurance contracts, the provision written into the excess policy here is insufficient \u2014 given our analytical method for construing insurance contracts \u2014 to unambiguously establish that it was intended to carry that meaning. <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 469 (in interpreting an insurance contract, we must determine the intent of the parties \u201cbased on the terms and conditions\u201d of the policy).
