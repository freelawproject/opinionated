Defendant did not preserve that contention in the trial court. However, we agree with defendant that the admission of that diagnosis was \u201can error of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). For the reasons stated in <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 522, 228 P3d 666 (2010), and <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 513-14, 228 P3d 688 (2010), we exercise our discretion to correct that error. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> The jury also found defendant guilty of four counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427. The trial court merged the counts of sexual abuse into the counts of sodomy \u201cfor sentencing purposes.\u201d On appeal, the parties raise no issues concerning the court\u2019s ruling in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> Our disposition in that regard obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s other assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s admission of statements by the expert \u201cthat indicated that she believed the victim was credible\u201d as well as various contentions in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief concerning purported trial- and sentencing-related errors. Further, we reject without discussion defendant\u2019s remaining contention in his <em>pro se </em>brief concerning the amendment to the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
