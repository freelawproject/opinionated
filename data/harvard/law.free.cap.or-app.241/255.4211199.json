Plaintiff alleged that his wife, prior to her death, had been promised a share of ownership in defendant in exchange for her service to the company and that she had, in fact, received dividends from the company in the years after her employment ended. Defendant, in response, moved for summary judgment on the ground that no such dividend had been paid and that plaintiff could present no evidence that his wife actually became a shareholder. According to defendant, plaintiffs wife is not listed on the corporation\u2019s records, filings, or tax forms, and no stock certificates were ever issued to her. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, and plaintiff now appeals. We reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We state the facts \u2014 sparse though they are \u2014 in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the nonmoving party. <em>Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP, </em>336 Or 329, 332, 83 P3d 322 (2004). Defendant is a closely held corporation. Its president, Tardie, and his wife, the company\u2019s secretary, are its only registered shareholders and its only directors. Prior to her employment with defendant, Anita Yeoman, along with her husband, William Yeoman, visited the Tardies\u2019 home. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the terms of Anita\u2019s potential employment with defendant. During that meeting, Tardie told Anita and William that he \u201cwas going to make [Anita] a 10% shareholder in exchange for going to work.\u201d Just before they left, Tardie told her that \u201cshe would start at 2% per year, so that it would take five years for her to earn the full 10%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Shortly thereafter \u2014 sometime in late June 2001, it appears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 Anita went to work for defendant. She worked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>defendant until early June 2002, just prior to her one-year anniversary. At that point, defendant terminated her employment. An \u201cEmployee Exit Interview Form\u201d indicates that she was discharged for \u201cunexcused absence\u201d and because she was \u201cunproductive.\u201d Anita\u2019s base-year wages at the time of her. termination were approximately $45,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In the years following her termination, Anita received checks from defendant. The first check, in the amount of $1,871.54, was dated August 2004. Around the time that Anita received the check, Tardie telephoned the Yeoman house and spoke with William. Tardie was \u201ccalling about the 2%\u201d either to say that \u201cthe check had been mailed\u201d or to be certain that the Yeomans had received it. Defendant sent another check to Anita the following June, this time in the amount of $7,175.00. The company sent her a third check in June 2006, in the amount of $13,117.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In December 2006, Anita\u2019s attorney sought access to defendant\u2019s corporate records in order to \u201cdetermine the potential value of [Anita\u2019s] stock, and to determine whether she has been paid the appropriate amount for her dividends.\u201d Anita died in a car accident on June 13,2007, before the question of access to the company\u2019s records had been resolved. Plaintiff, in his capacity as the personal representative of her estate, then filed this action in August 2007, seeking, in his first claim for relief, a declaration that he is a \u201c4% shareholder of Defendant, and for such other and further supplemental relief as may be appropriate, including an order requiring the payment of delinquent dividends.\u201d In a second claim for relief, plaintiff sought an order requiring defendant to permit plaintiff to inspect and copy corporate records.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Defendant, in response, moved for summary judgment on both claims for relief. In support of its motion, defendant argued that plaintiffs claim that Anita was a shareholder \u201cis entirely unsupported by any documentation or evidence that reflects ownership of any shares or interest in [defendant].\u201d Her name, defendant argued, \u201cis found nowhere in the pertinent corporate records, filings, or tax forms as a shareholder and no [Public Safety Center, Inc.] stock certificates were ever issued to her.\u201d Thus, defendant contended, \u201c[p]laintiffs evidence supports the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>profit-sharing agreement between Anita Yeoman and [defendant], but does not rise to the level of creating a genuine dispute that Anita Yeoman was a shareholder in [defendant].\u201d Plaintiff, in opposition, pointed specifically to the \u201cvery odd amounts of money\u201d paid to Anita on an annual basis after she left the company. Plaintiff attached a copy of a letter sent by defendant\u2019s counsel during a discovery dispute in this case; in that letter, defendant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI believe that any monetary distribution to Anita Yeoman, other than wages, was a gift calculated on the basis of 2% of some aspect of Public Safety Center\u2019s financial performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and entered judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims. Plaintiff now appeals, arguing that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to him, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Anita became a shareholder and was paid dividends, even if the corporation never formally recorded her status as a shareholder. In plaintiffs view, defendant\u2019s failure to account for Anita\u2019s shares is not conclusive as to her ownership; rather, he argues, it is evidence that a trier of fact can consider in determining whether she became a shareholder. Defendant, meanwhile, reprises its argument that shareholder status requires corporate formalities that did not occur in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Before delving into the parties\u2019 respective arguments as to whether plaintiff should be declared a \u201cshareholder\u201d of defendant, we must first determine what plaintiff means by that term. The term \u201cshareholder\u201d is defined for purposes of the Oregon Business Corporation Act, ORS chapter 60, as \u201cthe person in whose name shares are registered in the records of a corporation or the beneficial owner of shares to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with a corporation.\u201d ORS 60.001(29).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Plaintiff does not argue that Anita was, in fact, a \u201cshareholder\u201d within the definition set out in the Oregon Business Corporation Act. Nor is there any evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>record that any shares were registered in Anita\u2019s name or that she was a beneficial owner under a nominee certificate on file with defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, plaintiff contends that his complaint seeks, more generally, a declaration that Anita was a shareholder \u201cin the general sense of that term \u2014 a person who owns stock in a corporation.\u201d If that relief were granted, plaintiff submits, he \u201ccould then request supplemental relief that would include an order that the shares be registered in the records of the defendant corporation to validate his rights as a shareholder for purposes of ORS chapter 60.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We agree that plaintiffs complaint can be construed as seeking a declaration that Anita (and, now, plaintiff as the personal representative of her estate) is the owner of shares in the corporation. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to that question: Did plaintiff demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Anita became the owner of shares of defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Plaintiff contends that, in order for a person to acquire shares of a corporation, two things must occur: One, the company must enter into an agreement with the prospective purchaser for the sale of the shares; and, two, the purchaser must actually pay for those shares pursuant to that agreement. At that point, in plaintiffs view, ownership of the shares has passed to the purchaser, even if the company has not registered that transaction in its corporate records.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Defendant, meanwhile, characterizes plaintiffs theory as one of \u201cspontaneous transfer\u201d \u2014 a theory that, according to defendant, this court rejected in <em>Olson v. F &amp; D Publishing Co., Inc., </em>160 Or App 582, 982 P2d 556 (1999). Defendant takes the position that, in the context of a services arrangement like the one Anita and defendant purportedly entered into, more is required than an agreement to make someone a shareholder. Rather, defendant argues, a corporation must actually <em>issue </em>the shares, through a process that involves certain corporate formalities \u2014 for example, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>board of directors approving the consideration received for the shares. ORS 60.147(3) (\u201cBefore the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. * * * A record of action by the board of directors authorizing the issuance of shares for a specified consideration may be relied upon in concluding that shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.\u201d). According to defendant, there is no evidence whatsoever that any of those formalities occurred here. For the reasons that follow, we agree that defendant must have actually issued shares to Anita in order to make her a shareholder; however, we conclude that, on this record, there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether that happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The primary question on appeal reduces to how a corporation transfers ownership of \u201cshares\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe units into which the proprietary interest in a corporation are divided.\u201d ORS 60.001(28).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under ORS 60.144, the initial purchase of shares of a corporation is accomplished through a \u201csubscription\u201d for shares, either before or after incorporation. \u201cA subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a <em>contract </em>between the subscriber and the corporation <em>subject to ORS </em>60.147.\u201d ORS 60.144(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">ORS 60.147, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201c(1) The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201c(2) <em>The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed or other securities of the corporation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">\u201c(3) <em>Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. </em>That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. A record of action by the board of directors authorizing the issuance of shares for a specified consideration <em>may be relied upon in concluding that shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201c(4) <em>When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201c(5) The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid or the benefits received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid or the benefits are not received, the shares placed in escrow or restricted and the distributions credited may be canceled in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Importantly, shares \u201c[m]ay be <em>but are not required to be represented by certificates,\u201d </em>and unless otherwise provided by statute, \u201cthe rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.\u201d ORS 60.161(1) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>ORS 60.161(2) - (5) (setting forth form and content requirements for share certificates); ORS 60.164(1) (\u201cUnless the articles of incorporation or by-laws provide otherwise, the board of directors of a corporation may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series without certificates.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">From the foregoing provisions of the Oregon Business Corporation Act, we glean the following: (1) a subscription agreement is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation, ORS 60.144(5); (2) consideration for that contract may consist of \u201cservices performed\u201d or \u201ccontracts for services to be performed,\u201d ORS 60.147(2); (3) before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>be issued is adequate, ORS 60.147(3); (4) once the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the \u201cshares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable,\u201d ORS 60.147(4); and (5) share certificates are evidence of, but not prerequisites to, shareholder rights, ORS 60.161(1); <em>Babbitt v. Pacco Investors, </em>246 Or 261, 271, 425 P2d 489 (1967) (\u201cNeither is it necessary, in order for one to become a shareholder, that a certificate of stock, which is only evidence of ownership of an interest in the assets of the corporation, shall have been issued.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Read together, those statutory requirements provide that, in the context of a subscription agreement based on services, ownership of shares passes once the corporation has received full consideration for authorized shares pursuant to the terms of the subscription agreement. In other words, the shares are deemed to have \u201cissued\u201d and to \u201cbe fully paid and nonassessable\u201d once the corporation accepts payment in exchange for consideration for the authorized shares. <em>Cf. Babbitt, 246 Or </em>at 270 (citing case law for the proposition that \u201cpayment is essential where the subscription is for shares of an existing corporation\u201d); <em>see also </em>Mark S. Rhodes, <em>Transfer of Stock </em>\u00a7 2.8,45 (7th ed 2006) (\u201c[A] stock certificate is not necessary to the ownership of stock, and, as a legal matter, stock may be considered issued prior to the issuance of a certificate. * * * Acceptance of payment for the stock may be considered issuance, regardless of the execution and delivery of a certificate.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>id. </em>at 46 (\u201cIt has been said that * * * \u2018it is the payment, or the obligation to pay, for shares of stock, accepted by the corporation, that creates both the shares and their ownership.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Illinois-Indiana Fair Ass\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>328 Ill 368, 376, 159 NE 815 (1927))).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that defendant issued shares to Anita. There is evidence that the corporation offered Anita shares of the company in the amount of \u201c2% per year,\u201d such that it would take \u201cfive years for her to earn the full 10%\u201d; that Anita then went to work for defendant and performed services for defendant pursuant to her agreement to receive shares; that Anita received checks after her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>employment ended \u201con the basis of 2% of some aspect of [defendant\u2019s] financial performance\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that defendant\u2019s president called Anita \u201cabout the 2%\u201d to make sure that she had received her check.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Defendant suggests that a factfinder would be required to impermissibly speculate that the post-employment checks to Anita were, in fact, dividend payments, because \u201cthe payments could be evidence of <em>virtually anything.\u201d </em>(Emphasis by defendant.) We disagree. There may be other reasonable explanations as to why Anita received yearly payments after her employment with defendant was terminated, but the task of choosing among reasonable inferences is not the same as speculation. On these facts, one reasonable inference that a factfinder could draw is that the payments were, indeed, dividends, particularly in light of Tardie\u2019s alleged promises and follow-up phone call regarding the \u201c2%.\u201d <em>Cf. Babbitt, </em>246 Or at 271 (\u201cIt may be added that * * * the corporation recognized the plaintiff as a shareholder by sending him notices of stockholders\u2019 meetings [even though no stock certificates had been issued to him].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">A factfinder could further infer, on the facts of this case, that defendant\u2019s board of directors had authorized the issuance of the shares in exchange for Anita\u2019s services. Defendant is a closely held corporation. Its sole registered shareholders are Tardie, the company\u2019s president, and his wife, the company\u2019s secretary; the two also comprise the company\u2019s board of directors. A factfinder would be entitled to infer, from the fact of the dividend payments, that defendant\u2019s board knew of and authorized the promise to make Anita a shareholder, accepted Anita\u2019s service as payment for the shares, and later paid her dividends as a shareholder. The fact that the corporation\u2019s records do not reflect any issuance of shares to Anita might be <em>evidence </em>that no such shares were ever issued, but it is not fatal to plaintiffs claim that Anita was a shareholder. <em>Cf. Babbitt, </em>246 Or at 271 (certificate is \u201conly evidence of ownership of an interest in the assets of the corporation\u201d). In sum, on the record before us, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendant issued stock to Anita.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">For that <em>reason </em>\u2014 i.e., that a factfinder could find that defendant actually \u201cissued\u201d stock without documenting it \u2014 this is not a \u201cspontaneous transfer\u201d case. Nor is <em>Olson, </em>as defendant argues, \u201cdirectly on point.\u201d That case involved claims of breach of contract and misrepresentation by an employee who alleged that the defendants, the corporation and its president, had induced his employment with the promise of transferring stock to him and then never performed that promise. Thus, the gravamen of the plaintiffs claims in <em>Olson </em>was that he <em>never became a shareholder, </em>because the promise to transfer shares of the corporation was not performed. Here, by contrast, plaintiff alleges that the promise to make Anita a shareholder was fully performed (and dividends paid), but that her shareholder status simply is not reflected in the records of the corporation. For that reason, and the others stated above, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs first claim for relief cannot be sustained on the ground that the corporation\u2019s records do not reflect the issuance of those shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Defendant advances various alternative bases for upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s first claim for relief, none of which we find persuasive. First, defendant contends that the alleged agreement to make Anita a shareholder is void under the statute of frauds. Defendant did not advance that argument until its reply brief in the trial court; even assuming, however, that the statute of frauds issue was properly before the trial court and now us, it does not provide an alternative basis for the grant of summary judgment, because there are unresolved factual issues regarding potential defenses to the statute of frauds, such as partial performance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Second, defendant advances a number of theories as to why its purported agreement with Anita is unenforceable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>including that the alleged promise to make Anita a shareholder is too indefinite to serve as the basis for a valid contract. Those bases for summary judgment were not the subject of defendant\u2019s motion; had they been raised in the initial motion, the record below might have developed differently. For that reason, we do not discuss them further. <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 660,20 P3d 180 (2001) (\u201c[I]f the losing party might have created a different record below had the prevailing party raised that issue, and that record could affect the disposition of the issue, then we will not consider the alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We next turn to the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs second claim for relief, which alleges a statutory right to inspect and copy corporate records under ORS chapter 60. Plaintiff alleges that he \u201csent a statutory demand, pursuant to ORS 60.774, to inspect and copy designated corporate records.\u201d ORS 60.774(1) provides that \u201ca shareholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at the corporation\u2019s principal office, any of the records of the corporation described in ORS 60.771(5)\u201d so long as the shareholder gives the corporation sufficient written notice of the shareholder\u2019s demand. In the event that the corporation refuses to allow such an inspection, ORS 60.781 provides a remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cIf a corporation does not allow a shareholder who complies with ORS 60.774(1) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the circuit court of the county where the corporation\u2019s principal office is located, or, if the principal office is not in this state, where its registered office is or was last located, may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation\u2019s expense upon application of the shareholder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">ORS 60.781(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">As previously discussed, the term \u201cshareholder\u201d is defined for purposes of ORS chapter 60 as \u201cthe person in whose names shares are registered in the records of a corporation or the beneficial owner of shares to the extent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with a corporation.\u201d ORS 60.001(29). There is no evidence in this record that Anita\u2019s shares were ever registered in the records of the corporation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And it is \u201cshareholders\u201d as defined in ORS chapter 60 \u2014 and not simply the owners of shares of the corporation in the general sense \u2014 that have statutory inspection rights under ORS chapter 60. <em>Cf. Babbitt, </em>246 Or at 271 (holding, under earlier version of Oregon corporation statutes providing inspection rights to \u201cshareholders of record,\u201d that \u201cany record kept by the corporation which enables it to determine whether a person seeking examination of its books is a shareholder should be deemed sufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In this particular case, it appears that plaintiffs second claim for relief was premature. If, as plaintiff contends, Anita acquired an ownership interest in the corporation that simply is not reflected anywhere in the corporation\u2019s records, the proper course is to obtain injunctive relief such that the corporate records reflect that share ownership, thereby triggering statutory \u201cshareholder\u201d inspection rights under ORS chapter 60. Indeed, plaintiff acknowledges as much, arguing that, upon obtaining a declaration of shareholder status, he \u201ccould then request supplemental relief that would include an order that the shares be registered in the records of the defendant corporation to validate his rights as a shareholder for purposes of ORS chapter 60.\u201d However, until that time, plaintiffs right to inspect defendant\u2019s records is a matter of discovery rather than a product of ORS chapter 60. <em>See </em>ORS 60.774(5) (\u201cThis section does not affect: (a) The right of a shareholder to inspect records under ORS 60.224 or, if the shareholder is in litigation with the corporation, to the same extent as any other litigant; or (b) <em>The power of a court, independent of this chapter, to compel the production of corporate records for examination.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)). For that reason, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs claim to inspect defendant\u2019s records pursuant to ORS 60.781, because there is no evidence that Anita was a \u201cshareholder\u201d within the meaning of that statute at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>time of the December 2006 demand to inspect the corporation\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Reversed and remanded with respect to plaintiffs first claim for relief; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> The record is convoluted regarding the dates of her employment. Plaintiffs complaint alleges that Anita began working for defendant \u201c[i]n or about July of 2002,\u201d and defendant admitted that allegation in its answer. In his opening brief, plaintiff asserts that Anita went to work for defendant on June 14, 2002, and then cites portions of the record that reflect that she was <em>terminated </em>on June 14, 2002. In any event, the parties appear to agree that Anita was terminated by defendant just prior to her one-year anniversary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> In various parts of ORS chapter 60, that definition is modified for particular purposes. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 60.261(4); ORS 60.551(7); ORS 60.774(6); <em>see also </em>ORS 60.830 (defining \u201cowner\u201d of and to \u201cown\u201d shares for purposes of business combinations with interested shareholders).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> <em>See </em>ORS 60.234(1) (\u201cA corporation may establish a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee is recognized by the corporation as the shareholder.
