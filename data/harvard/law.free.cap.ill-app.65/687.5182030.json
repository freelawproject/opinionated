The instructions given by the court for the people were not detrimental to the plaintiff in error.</p> <p id=\"b685-7\" pgmap=\"685\">The interpretation we give to the first clause-of the section in question is, that it made it a crime to expose a child to the inclemency of the weather, without the exposure resulting in injury to his or her health.</p> <p id=\"b685-8\" pgmap=\"685\">The second clause of the act apparently assumes that the exposing of a child to the inclemency of the weather would injure its health; but the first clause does not of itself require, as a requisite of the crime, the health to be injured, and we do not think that it should be so interpreted on account of any reflex action of the subsequent clauses of the sentence. The statute was intended to enlarge the scope of the common law, and to make it a crime to expose a child of tender years to the inclemency of the weather, regardless of consequences to its health. At common law, such exposure must result in injury to health to constitute a crime. Rex v. Hogan, 5 Eng. Law &amp; Eq. 553; Shannon v. People, 5 Mich. 72.</p> <p id=\"b685-9\" pgmap=\"685\">It was also by the statute intended to make it a crime to in any manner willfully do such acts as to injure the health of a child under one\u2019s legal contract. The legislature has since changed the wording of the section in question, so as to remove the ambiguity but not to change its legal meaning as we here interpret it.</p> <p id=\"b685-10\" pgmap=\"685\">The sentence and judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
