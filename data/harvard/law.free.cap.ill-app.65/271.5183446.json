Appellant elected to abide by the demurrer, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellee for costs.</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">It is now urged by appellant that the demurrer to the special plea should have been sustained.</p> <p id=\"b270-7\" pgmap=\"270\">Those parts of section 23 which have a direct bearing on the question presented by the record, are as follows:</p> <p id=\"b270-8\" pgmap=\"270\">\u201c It shall not be lawful for any insurance company, association or partnership, incorporated by or organized under the laws of any other State of the United States, or any foreign government, for any of the purposes specified in this act, directly or indirectly, to take risks or transact any business of insurance in this State unless possessed of the amount of actual capital required of similar companies formed under the provision of this act; and any such company desiring to transact any such business, as aforesaid, by any agent or agents in this State, shall first appoint an attorney in this State on whom process of law can be served, and file in the office of the auditor of public accounts a \"written instrument, duly signed and sealed, certifying such appointment, which shall continue until another attorney be substituted.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b270-9\" pgmap=\"270\">\u201c Uor shall it be lawful for any agent or agents to act for the company or companies referred to in this section, directly or indirectly, in taking risks or transacting the business of fire or inland navigation insurance in this State, without procuring from the auditor of public accounts a certificate of authority, stating that such company has complied with all the requisitions of this act which apply to such companies, and the name of the attorney appointed to act for the company.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b270-10\" pgmap=\"270\">\u201c Any violation of any of the provisions of this act shall subject the party violating the same to a penalty of $500 for each violation.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b270-11\" pgmap=\"270(21) 271(26)\">The same section also requires the filing of a detailed statement of the assets, indebtedness, etc., of the company, and the following section authorizes the revocation of the certificate of authority to do business whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that said statement is false.</p> <p id=\"b271-4\" pgmap=\"271\">There can be no doubt of the propriety and constitutionality of the law from which the foregoing extracts have been copied. Cincinnati Mutual Health Assurance Co. v. Rosenthal, 55 Ill. 85; Pierce v. The People, 106 Id. 11; Seamans v. Zimmerman, 59 N. W. Rep. 290; 91 Iowa 363; Seamans v. Temple Co., 63 N. W. Rep. (Mich.) 408.</p> <p id=\"b271-5\" pgmap=\"271\">The legislature has- the power to protect our citizens against an irresponsible insurance company of another State, which, like the grass, in the morning groweth up and flourisheth, and in the evening is cut down and withereth. It is proper to require of such a company some proof of responsibility, and the appointment of an agent on whom process can be served, so that Illinoisans may not be compelled to pursue a vanishing phantom into remote parts of the United States, in a fruitless effort to enforce the payment of an insurance policy. It is proper also to prohibit any agent from taking risks for such a company, either directly or indirectly, without procuring a certificate of authority from the auditor of public accounts.</p> <p id=\"b271-6\" pgmap=\"271\">Can the violator of our laws come into our courts, with a courteous bow, and enforce a contract which has been secured in disregard of the statutory prohibition ?. True it is, that the contract was made in Wisconsin; but true it is also, that the property insured is in Illinois. If this contract can be enforced, successful methods of carrying on business in this State without the intervention of resident agents will be devised, and the statutory law will become a dead letter, and our citizens will become the prey of irresponsible insurance companies. \u201cComity between States does not require a law of one State to be executed in another when it would be against the public policy of the latter State. Ho State is bound to recognize or enforce contracts which are injurious to the welfare of its people, or which are in violation of its own laws.\u201d Pope v. Hanke, 155 Ill. 617.</p> <p id=\"b272-4\" pgmap=\"272\">The very question presented here has been settled by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin adversely to appellant\u2019s contention in Rose v. Kimberly &amp; Clark Co., 62 N.W. Rep. 526, 89 Wis. 545, in which case it is held that the execution of an insurance policy in a foreign State by a- foreign insurance company to insure property within the State of Wisconsin, is the transaction of business in the latter State within the meaning of a statute, which provides that, except on certain conditions, no foreign fire insurance company shall \u201c directly or indirectly take risks or transact any business of insurance\u201d within the State of Wisconsin. In holding that assessments on the policy holder can not be recovered where the statute has not been complied with, the court uses the following vigorous language:</p> <p id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272\">\u201c The object of this statute is so plain that it can not be mistaken. It is to protect our citizens against irresponsible and worthless foreign companies of the very kind which we have now before us. The evil to be corrected is not the writing of a policy by an unlicensed company within this State alone, but the writing of such a policy at all. Bearing in mind the object of the statute and the evil tobe corrected, it is very plain that the object will be largely defeated, and the evil will flourish as before, if it be held that companies without license can establish their agencies just outside of the State line and conduct their business by mail.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b272-6\" pgmap=\"272\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
