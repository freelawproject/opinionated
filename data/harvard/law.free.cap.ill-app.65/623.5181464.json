Bonfield, the owner of a tile factory and the real estate on which it was situated in Kankakee county, leased the same to Richard Rosenstock for the period of eight years at a rental of $ 1,500 per annum. The lease gave to Rosenstock the right to change and add to the building, kilns and machinery and to substitute new machinery for old, new buildings and machinery to become part of the leased property and be surrendered with it on the termination of the lease.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-9\" pgmap=\"620\">Rosenstock formed a partnership with S. C. Hyndshaw for the purpose of manufacturing brick and tile, and began extensive changes and improvements in the plant. Buildings were remodeled and torn down, new boilers and engines, new drying apparatus and new kilns were substituted for old ones and there was such reconstruction of the entire plant that its capacity was increased from 25,000 to 70,000 brick per day. On the 30th of August, 1S94, they purchased of appellants two boilers and one engine for $2,200.01 executing to them notes for balance of the unpaid purchase price \u00b6 amounting to $2,161.81, and a written agreement that title of ownership should remain in appellants until the notes should j be fully paid. The boilers and engine with necessary fittings Avere placed in the reconstructed plant.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-10\" pgmap=\"620\">Hyndshaw &amp; Rosenstock being in hard lines financially, on the 25th of January, 1895, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to Edward E. Day, who took possession of the property.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-11\" pgmap=\"620(10) 621(88)\">On March 6,1S95, appellants filed a petition in the County Court setting out the contract between them and Hyndshaw &amp; Rosenstock and asked a return of the engine and boilers. It was resisted by the assignee and Bonfield, each of whom filed answers setting up that the property was so placed in the factory as to become part of the realty and Bonfield further claimed it under that clause in the lease which provided that all new machinery substituted for old should become part of the leased property and be surrendered on the termination of the lease.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-4\" pgmap=\"621\">The County Court found against appellants and dismissed their petition with petitions of other claimants heard at the same trial.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">From the order dismissing their petition appellants have appealed and ask a reversal, because the court did not declare in them a first lien upon the engine and boilers for the amount due them and order the assignee to allow them to remove them.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621\">Wheeler &amp; Hunter and Reyiy &amp; Mann, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b621-7\" pgmap=\"621\">As between appellants and the insolvents, it is clear that the former were the owners of the engine and boilers in question.

Ewell, page 81. But this depends upon the intention. The interest of the tenant in the land being only temporary and limited, it is not ordinarily his intention to make permanent accessions to the realty. And it is this question of intention that must be determined and inquired into. If the intention is to make the articles annexed a permanent accession to the realty, then such intention must prevail, and such articles must not thereafter be removed without the permission of the landlord. Ewell, p. 90. Such fixtures can not be removed even when the lease has a special provision allowing their removal when it amounts to a destruction of the property. Fifield et al. v. Farmers Bank, 148 Ill. 163; Ewell, 318; also Chap. 1, p. 23, Chap. 3, p. 68, and notes.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-4\" pgmap=\"623\">Where vendor delivers personal property to vendee under an agreement that the property is to be considered belonging to vendor until the payment of price is made, such agreement is void as to creditors.

R., 112 Ill. 319, this court says: \u201c In fact, the rule is that if anything apprises a purchaser or incumbrancer that a particular person claims the property or an interest in the property, the former must pursue that notice to its source, and failing to do so, he will be charged with all he would have learned had he pursued and investigated the matter to the full extent to which it led.

Justice Habkeb</author> <p id=\"AOO\" pgmap=\"625\">delivebbb the opinion of the Ooubt.</p> <p id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">The only serious question involved in this controversy is whether the engine and boilers purchased of appellants by Hyndshaw &amp;Rosenstoek were so set as to become part of the realty.</p> <p id=\"b625-7\" pgmap=\"625\">It may be conceded that as between appellants and the insolvents, the former were the owners of the property an til paid for, and that the assignee took the property subject to all equities, liens and incumbrances which existed against the same in the hands of the insolvents. There is no doubt that the parties to the contract of purchase could agree among themselves that the engine and boiler should be treated as personalty, and ownership remain with the vendors until they were paid for; but their agreement could not change the character of the property, so' far as third parties were concerned. Dobschuetz v. Holliday, 82 Ill. 371; Fifield et al. v. Farmers Nat. Bank et al., 148 Ill. 163; Cross v. Weare Commission Co., 153 Ill. 499.</p> <p id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625(51) 626(247)\">In. addition to the fact that the lease executed by the owner, Bonfield, and under which the insolvents were operating the plant, expressly provided that all new and substituted machinery should become \u201c part of the demised property \u201d and be surrendered to the owner on the termination of the lease, the evidence shows that the engine and boilers claimed by appellants were placed within one of the buildings on brick and stone foundations. The boilers were placed on foundations of brick work into the ground, and arched over with brick walls eight feet high laid in mortar. On these walls or arches rested posts supporting the roof of the building. The engine was placed upon a solid stone or concrete foundation sunk four feet and a half in the ground, with iron bolts imbedded in it, and the engine through holes in its bed was bolted to the foundation. A line of shafting was affixed to the engine room by bolts and screws to the walls and extended to the machine room, with pulleys, and from the driving wheel of the engine and belt post to a pulley on the line of shafting, and belts went from the pulleys in the machine room to the mills, thereby driving the machinery. A steam supply pipe passed from the boilers to the engine, connecting them, and steam pipes attached to the building passed from the boil ere to the drying - machinery in the dry house. This was the condition of the property at the time of the assignment. The evidence also shows that in order to remove the engine and boilers, it would necessitate the breaking of a hole in the brick wall of the bnilding six or seven feet in diameter.</p> <p id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">The proofs clearly show annexation of the property in question to the realty, appropriation and adaptation to the use and purpose of that part of the realty with which it is connected, and intention on the part of the party making the annexation to make it a permanent accession to the freehold. They bring the case within the rule stated by Mr. Ewell,- in his excellent work on fixtures, page 22.</p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">This case is much like the one reviewed by the court in Fifield et al. v. Farmers Nat. Bank, 47 App. 118, and afterward considered by our Supreme Court, in 148 Ill. 163. We refer to the discussion of the principles involved in the opinions filed in that case, in support of our conclusion that the County Court in this case properly dismissed appellants\u2019 petition. Order affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
