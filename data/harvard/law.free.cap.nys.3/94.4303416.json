After reciting plaintiff\u2019s proof of his cause of action, it proceeds: \u201cDefendant offers a note of $125 given by plaintiff, and another to defendant. Plaintiff objects to it as a counter-claim, and that it was not an offset against plaintiff. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tiff said note was <em>good, </em>and lie would not repudiate, but would allow; but it was not a legal claim. Defendant moves to dismiss the complaint; that judgment be rendered against the plaintiff for cost; no objection to the note being paid, consenting to the whole thing. No defense; no witnesses sworn.\u201d Now, it appears from this that no formal proof of the execution of the note was given. The plaintiff objected to its introduction, but would allow it. The ground of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is not stated; and it would seem that defendant had no objection to the note being paid, \u201cconsenting to the whole thing.\u201d We think it is a fair construction that the plaintiff objected to the note as a counter-claim, but offered to allow it as payment on this \u25a0claim, and that the defendant consented to this. Very possibly the plaintiff feared that, if the note came in as a counter-claim, the objection might be -taken (which is now urged) that the sum total of amounts would exceed the justice\u2019s jurisdiction. Therefore he says: \u201cI object to this as a counterclaim, but I am willing to allow it as a payment. \u201d The defendant says he has no objection to the note being paid,\u2014that is, by this allowance,\u2014and consents to the whole thing. The matter was very justly and properly disposed of. The judgment of the county court should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Landon and Ingalls, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
