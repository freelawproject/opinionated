J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7j\">The plaintiff was injured while riding as a passenger ire. one of the defendant\u2019s street cars. The accident was caused by a collision between the car in which he was riding and a furniture van. The proof of negligence upon the part of defendant\u2019s driver is sufficient to uphold the verdict. Tiie defendant\u2019s car was going up town, and was at the time of the collision crossing Sixth avenue, Hew York. The furniture van was going down on the-Sixth-Avenue track. The defendant\u2019s ear was going very fast. The horses of the van had passed over the track, but the defendant\u2019s car ran into the end of the van. The mere statement of the case is sufficient to support the verdict. There was no crowd of vehicles\u2014no obstruction\u2014at midday, and it was solely because the driver would not slacken his speed so as to permit a wagon time to pass over the track. The plaintiff was free from negligence. He was riding in the car, with the window open, with his arm resting on the sill of the same, but entirely within the line of the car. The jury was instructed that the plaintiff could not recover if any part of the plaintiff\u2019s arm was out of the car window, and that, if his \u201cinjury was occasioned by the projection of the plaintiff\u2019s arm,\u201d the verdict should be for the defendant. This is in conformity with <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>12 N. Y. 236. Judgment should, be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
