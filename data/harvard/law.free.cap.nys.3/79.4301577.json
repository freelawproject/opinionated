Lansing against Samuel Stevens, impleaded, etc., in the city court of Albany, where he obtained judgment, which was affirmed by the county court. Defendant, Stevens, appeals. <em>Oulman </em>v. <em>\u2022Schmidt, </em>35 Hun, 345, referred to in the opinion, was an action commenced dn a justice\u2019s court of King\u2019s county by the service on the defendant of a summons and sworn complaint. The defendant demurred, the demurrer was \u25a0overruled, and defendant failed to answer; whereupon the justice rendered judgment for plaintiff without requiring any proof of his claim. The county court affirmed the judgment. Code, \u00a7 2891, relating to justice\u2019s courts, provides that, \u201cif a defendant fails to appear and answer, the plaintiff cannot re,cover without proving his ease.\u201d By chapter 414, Laws\u2019 1881, the plaintiff may make a written complaint, verify it, and have it served on the defendant'. Section 3 provides that, if the defendant fails to answer or demur to such complaint, he shall be deemed to have admitted the allegations of the complaint as true, and the court shall, upon proof of service thereof, enter judgment for the plaintiff for the amount demanded, without further proof. On appeal to the general term, the court (Pratt, J.) said: \u201cSection 2891 of the Code is not repealed by the act of 1881, and must be read in connection with section 3 of the act above quoted, and such construction given to them .that both may stand if that be possible. Under the Code, the plaintiff could not take judgment in any case without proving his case. This rule is now so far modified that in certain actions, if a sworn complaint is served upon the defendant, the plaintiff may take judgment without further proof, provided the defendant fails to answer or demur; but if he does either, then the ease is governed by the Code, and the plaintiff must prove his claim.\u201d The court accordingly reversed the judgment, on the ground that, a demurrer having .been interposed, the plaintiff was bound to prove his case.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Argued before Learned, P.

The decision was placed upon that ground, although there-was another fatal defect in the proceedings in that case, which was considered, as appears by the opinion. * That case was cited as authority in <em>Thames-</em>v. <em>Jones, </em>4*7 Hun, 81. We think the case of <em>Oulman </em>v. <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>should be followed by this court. The judgment of the county court, and of', \u25a0the city court of Albany, should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Learned, P.
