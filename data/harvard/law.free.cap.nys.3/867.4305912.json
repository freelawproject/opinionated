J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyX\">The respondent calls attention to section 3013 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that a judgment of nonsuit \u201cmust be rendered against the plaintiff prosecuting an action before a justice of the peace, * * * if he fails to appear within one hour after the summons is returnable, or within one hour after the time to which the trial has been adjourned.\u201d If there had been no appearance of the parties before the justice on the 21st of June it would have been the duty of the justice to have granted a nonsuit; but section 3015 provides: \u201cWhere a judgment is confessed, * * * the. justice must forthwith render judgment, and enter it in his docket-book.\u201d Apparently the justice understood from the interview held with the parties that it was the intention of the parties that the plaintiff should recover the property, and that the defendant should pay the costs. He treated their understanding, as communicated to him, as the equivalent of confession of judgment, and entered the same in his minutes; the defendant .having in effect assented that the justice might so regard the issue as disposed of by confession, and that the plaintiff should recover his property, and that the defendant should pay the costs of the action, and make an entry in virtue of that arrangement, which is equivalent to carrying out the arrangement. Under the circumstances, particularly after the defendant had acquiesced in the action of the justice for a year, it is not seemly that he should be heard to question the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace. Section 3011 authorizes a judgment upon confession if the defendant personally appeared before the justice; but that section provides, however, that the confession must be in writing, signed by the defendant, and filed with the justice. Apparently \u2022 the defendant consented before the justice, in the presence of the plaintiff, that the judgment be entered against him, or at least the justice so understood it; and the entry made by the justice was in accordance with the agreement made by the defendant, to-wit, that the plaintiff should have the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>\u2022erty mentioned in the pleadings, and that the defendant should pay the costs incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In <em>Beecher </em>v <em>Kendall, </em>14 Hun, 327, the court upheld a judgment predicated upon a verbal acceptance of an offer of judgment, although the statute provides that if the plaintiff \u201caccept the offer, and give notice thereof in writing, the justice shall file the offer and acceptance thereof, and render a judgment accordingly.\u201d The personal assent to the acceptance was made in the presence of the justice and of the defendant. It was observed by the court, in deciding that case, viz.: \u201cThe provision of the Code was thus substantially complied with; but, if not, the defendants cannot here take advantage of the error. Again, it was a substantial confession of judgment by the defendants when all the parties were present before the justice.\u201d <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>17 Barb. 424. \u201cIt is the duty of appellate courts to indulge in every reasonable and warrantable intendment and presumption, in order to sustain proceedings and judgments of inferior tribunals.\u201d <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>54 N. Y. 366; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>91 N. Y. 350. Section 3063 of the Code of Civil Procedure declares, viz.: \u201cThe appellate court must render judgment .according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors or defects, which do not affect the merits.\u201d Applying the spirit of the language just quoted to the case in hand, it seems to us that the defendant ought not to be permitted to question the action of the justice based upon his agreement that the plaintiff should have the property embraced within the issue joined before the justice, and that he should pay the costs of the action. The action \u25a0of the justice accords with \u201cthe merits,\u201d as admitted by defendant\u2019s agreement. Again, if we regard the entry of the judgment in the docket of the justice\u201ein August, 1883, as a part of the judicial duty of the justice to give force and validity to the judgment, that act was requested by the defendant, \u2022as his attorney expressly insisted the justice should make the'entry, which he did, in his docket. The defendant ought not to be permitted to take advantage of an act which he requested to be performed. Section 1294 of the Code provides that an appeal may be taken \u201cby a party aggrieved.\u201d It is difficult to see how the defendant was aggrieved by the entry made in the justice\u2019s docket upon the express request of the defendant\u2019s attorney, or upon the \u25a0threat made by him. We think the county court ought not to have reversed the judgment. Judgment of the county court reversed, and that of the justice\u2019s court affirmed, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<author id=\"b881-6\">Follett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1Mm\">I am not prepared to hold, and I think it unnecessary to hold, that the justice\u2019s judgment is valid; but I am clear the defendant had no right of appeal, and that the county court should have dismissed his appeal. The judgment of the county court should be reversed, with costs, and the defend.ant\u2019s appeal to that court dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Martin, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
