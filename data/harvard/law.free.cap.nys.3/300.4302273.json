Smith, Jr., to foreclose a mortgage given by the \u2022defendant the Isle of Wight Company, of which the defendants Rufus W. Leavitt, Sidney De ICay, Van Dewater Smith, and Philip Kobbe were guarantors. The property covered by the mortgage had been sold, on foreclosure of a second mortgage to Robert W. Jaggard, and was by him transferred to Eliza M. Leavitt, and by her to Morris E. Leavitt, and by him to the Lawrence Beach Company, all of whom were made defendants. The answer of the defendants the Isle of Wight Company, the Lawrence Beach Company, Eliza M. Leavitt, Rufus W. Leavitt, Morris E.

If a defendant wishes to insist upon the questions raised by such an answer, he must be ready when the cause is reached. The court was-right in giving judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The affidavits do not show any ground for relief as a matter of favor; rather the contrary. It appears that the plaintiff is willing to sacrifice a large part of the debt to get his money. That is an abundant answer to the opinions expressed in the papers as to the great value of the property. The impression produced upon the court is that the property is worth less than the debt.
