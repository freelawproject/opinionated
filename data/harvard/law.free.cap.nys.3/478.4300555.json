Y., and was 81 years old when his son, Henry Block, on the 17t'h day of November, 1887, petitioned the county court to appoint a committee for. him, and that a commission <em>de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo </em>issue. The commission was issued to one John F. Tuttle, who caused a jury to be summoned. Simeon Block ap-pea red by counsel and contested the allegations of the petition. -A juror \u2014 Neil Duress \u2014 was examined on his <em>voir dire, </em>and answered as follows: <em>\u201cExamined by Mr. Jenkins. </em>I am acquainted with the respondent, Simeon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Klock, and with his sons. I have talked with Henry Klock, the petitioner, about this case, and about the property. I have not taken much interest in the case. I have formed some little opinion. I do not know as I have expressed it. I have heard several stories about it, and have formed some \u25a0opinion, so that it would require some evidence to remove it. I have talked with Henry Klock twice about it. I guess I have heard him speak of it more than twice. I think only three times in all. I have had no conversation with him since I was summoned as a juror. I was summoned several days ago. I am friendly with Henry Klock. I have formed an opinion without hearing the evidence, Henry Klock talked with me about subpoenaing me as a witness; he did not subpoena me. <em>Examined by Mr. Carskaddan. </em>I would try and make an impartial inquisition in this case on the evidence, and I think I could. I have formed no opinion in this case that could not be overcome by the evidence. <em>Re-examined by Mr. Jenkins. </em>I did say I had formed some little opinion, and that it would require some little evidence to overcome it. I have not heard Henry say anything about the property.\u201d The juror was challenged by Simeon Klock, for cause, which being overruled, he was then challenged peremptorily, and this challenge was also overruled. Exception was also taken to the admission of the evidence of one Douglas, the substance of which is stated in the opinion. The inquisition resulted in a verdict of insanity, which, when the inquisition was returned to the county court, was confirmed, and a committee appointed for Klock, who appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b491-5\">Argued before Hardin, P.

The sheriff must notify the jurors accordingly, and must return the precept, and the names of the persons notified, to the commissioner, at the time and place specified in the precept. The commissioners, or a majority of them, must determine a challenge made to a juror. In <em>Tebout's Case, </em>9 Abb. Pr. 211, it was held that if a finding in such a proceeding as the one before us was induced \u201cby any bias or opinion previously formed,\u201d there should be a new trial. In <em>Re Wager, </em>6 Paige, 11, the chancellor declared that it was the duty of the sheriff \u201cto select and summon such jurors as he thought proper, and who were indifferent in relation to the matter; that the commissioners were only authorized to decide upon the validity of challenges to jurors so selected.\u201d Following that ruling, it is said, in Barbour\u2019s Chancery Practice, (Ed. 1843, vol. 2, p. 232:) \u201cThe commissioners are authorized to decide upon the validity of challenges to jurors.\u201d The same rule is repeated in the edition of 1875, (volume 2, p. 233.) Section 1176 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c upon the trial of an issue of fact, joined in a civil action in a court of record, or not of record, each party may peremptorily challenge not more than two of the persons drawn as jurors for the trial.\u201d It is claimed, however, by the respondent, that the technical language of that section does not apply to the proceedings before us. However that may be, we are of the opinion that a contesting party, upon a hearing before a commissioner, should be allowed to challenge jurors in accordance with the practice prescribed for the guidance and government of courts in obtaining an impartial jury. We think the learned commissioner committed an error when he refused to hold that the juror was not \u201can indifferent person,\u201d and in determining the challenges adversely to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In a proceeding so important as the character of the one in which the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>fcion arises, which may result not only in committing the custody o\u00a3 the person, but the custody of the property, of the party proceeded against, to another, great care and caution should prevail; and a juror ought not to sit who confesses that he has formed an opinion, \u201cand that it would require some little evidence to overcome it. \u201d <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Denio, 345; <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>People, </em>74 N. Y. 283. Chapter 427 of the Laws of 1873 provides that the determination in respect to challenges of jurors, both in civil and in criminal cases, may be reviewed. Chapter 475 of the Laws of 1872, in relation to challenges of jurors who had previously formed or expressed an opinion or had an impression in respect to the circumstances involved in a trial, only relates to criminal cases, and that statute could not be invoked to aid the ruling before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>95 N. Y. 316, the rule is laid down in respect to non-expert witnesses, and the extent given to which their examination may be made, and their opinion delivered; anditis said that where they have \u201ctestified to facts within their knowledge and observation,\u201d they may characterize them as rational or irrational; that the testimony from such witnesses must .be limited to their conclusions from the facts testified to by them. The witness Douglas was allowed to testify, against an objection, that the impression formed upon his mind was that Kloek was failing very fast, physically as well as mentally. When the direct question was put to him as to the impression that was made upon his mind by the talk which he had detailed as to being rational or irrational, the witness was unable to answer in accordance with the rule stated in <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Holcomb, supra, </em>but the commissioner allowed the evidence to stand, in which the witness said: \u201cIt seemed to me that his mind was very weak, but I could not call it rational or irrational.\u201d We think the order of confirmation should be set aside, together with the finding of the jury, and that a trial should be had in the county court of 'Oneida, county, of the questions of fact arising upon the competency of Simeon Kloek. Findings of the jury set aside, and the order of confirmation reversed, and a new trial of questions of fact ordered before a commission, and a jury to be appointed by the county court of Oneida county, with the costs of this appeal to abide the final award in the proceeding. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
