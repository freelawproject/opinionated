We are of the-opinion that Exhibit A did not contain th\u00e9 whole agreement between the parties. The agreement between the parties is Exhibit <em>X, </em>and w'as offered in evidence by the plaintiffs. By that agreement the defendant bound him-self to assign to the Standard Hydro-Carbon Machine Company all the patents that he then had, upon the payment to him of the sum of $110,000. It does not appear that the said Jackson ever received said sum of $110,000. As the-payment of this sum was a condition precedent, plaintiff cannot recover without showing that such a sum has been paid or tendered to the defendant-judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">Sedgwick, C.
