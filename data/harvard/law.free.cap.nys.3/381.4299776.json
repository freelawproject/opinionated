Fell against the New York Locomotive Works to recover agreed compensation for labor and services. Upon the report of the-referee, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff for $812.53, and interest from Hovember 5, 1887, damages, and for costs. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint avers that from about January 1, 1884, he was in the employ of the defendant \u201cas a jobber or contractor, manufacturing and superintending the manufacture of certain parts of locomotive engines, his particular employment being known as the * rocker or piston job,\u2019 at a certain agreed schedule of rates or prices for each piece manufactured; and that the agreement was terminated by and at the instance of this defendant on or about October 15,1887;\u201d and that the defendant was indebted to plaintiff, \u201c under and pursuant to-the contract above described, for work, labor, and services in the manufacture and superintendence of the manufacture of certain parts of locomotive engines, in the sum of eight hundred thirty-seven and sixty-six one-hundredths dollars.\u201d Defendant, in its answer, admits \u201cthat it is indebted to this plaintiff for work, labor, and services by him, said plaintiff, performed, according to a certain agreed schedule of rates, in the sum and amount of six hundred sixty-two and ninety one-hundredths dollars, part of the sum of eight hundred thirty-seven and sixty-six one-hundredths dollars, demanded in the-complaint herein.\u201d And it also contains a denial of any further or other indebtedness. The referee, upon the evidence before him, found \u201c that on or about February 25,1887, plaintiff entered into a new agreement with defendant, by which he agreed to continue in the employ of defendant at the same class of work, and at the same schedule of rates or prices, as before, subject, however, to a discount upon the amount or value of such work monthly, of three per centum for each and every engine over five, and not exceeding-twelve, which should be completed and leave defendant\u2019s said works during-the month, or between pay-days. \u201d And the referee also found that \u201c October 15, 1887, the value of the work done by plaintiff for defendant at the schedule of prices aforesaid, and remaining unsettled and unpaid for, was $837.66, as appraised and agreed upon between the parties on or about October 17, 1887;\u201d and the referee allowed a discount on six engines, amounting to $25.13,. leaving a net balance of $812.53, for which sum he ordered judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b393-18\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J., <em>(after stating the facts as above.)</em></author>\n<p id=\"A9G\">Inasmuch as there is no certificate in the appeal-book that the case contains all the evidence given upon the trial before the referee, this court will not review the findings of fact made by the referee. <em>Griffiths </em>v. Phelps, 21 Wkly. Dig. 390; <em>Spence </em>v, <em>\u2022Chambers, </em>39 Hun, 195; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Hun, 118; <em>Graff </em>v. <em>Boss, </em>47 Hun, 152. We must therefore assume that the facts were sufficient to uphold the findings of fact made by the referee. There is no exception to his conclusion of law stated in his report. There is, therefore, nothing for us to review \u2022except the rulings by the referee, made upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">11 The plaintiff, to maintain his case, was sworn as a witness, and testified, in substance, to the arrangement that was entered into between him and the \u25a0defendant in respect to his services; and after referring to a bill of particulars which he said \u201crepresents the work that the defendant was and is, indebted to me for, giving the items and amounts as reported to me by them,\u201d he added: \u201cMy contract with the defendant was simply this: The work was to'be performed, and labor to be paid for, through the office. The contract was made with White, and afterwards, in 1887, with Mr. Hardie, in which the whole \u25a0contract was modified, but price per piece remained the same.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe discounts were to be:. On each engine, up to five, which should leave the works between pay-days, there was to be no discount; on each additional engine over five, and up to twelve, there should be three per cent, per engine discount. \u201d After the plaintiff had given his version of the arrangement existing between him and the defendant, the defendant took the case, and Mr. Striker was sworn in its behalf, and he gave testimony somewhat in conflict with that of the plaintiff in respect to the understanding as to the discounts, and he added that Mr. Hardie, who was superintendent of the defendant, \u201c was authorized to make the contract.\u201d He also testified that the plaintiff and he had held a conversation, and that the plaintiff in that conversation claimed \u201cthere should be no discount. I claimed that the discounts should be taken out. * * * I said it was not a question of how many engines sent out,' but how much work he had done. Mr. Fell had, so far as his work was concerned, finished five engines during the three weeks preceding the time he left defendant\u2019s employ.\u201d He also testified: \u201cThe defendant ratified the scale of discounts named in \u2018 Exhibit Humber 2,\u2019 and authorized Hardie to make a contract with Fell, in accordance with them. That is all I recollect. The talk with Mr. Hardie, about allowing discounts for calendar months, was a little later, and was no part of the original contract. The agreement has been treated by both parties that the settlements should be every pay month, instead of calendar month.\u201d After the defendant had given some further testimony tending to support its theory of the contract, it rested, and the plaintiff took the case, and called to the stand as a witness Robert Hardie, who was superintendent of the defendant\u2019s works from April, 1886, to June, 1887, and by him the plaintiff proposed to prove the conversation held between him and the plaintiff, which formed the contract between the defendant and the plaintiff. To that conversation the defendant objected as incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial; and (2) as reopening the plaintiff\u2019s case, and not rebutting testimony. The court overruled the objection. The defendant took an exception. It is now urged in behalf of the defendant that the exception presents a fatal error. . We do not think so. We think that the testimony given by Hardie tended to rebut or contradict some of the testimony given by the defendant upon the issues involved between the parties. The testimony was therefore competent, and material and relevant. Doubtless the testimony of Hardie might have been received while plaintiff was giving his affirmative testimony to make out his claim or cause of action. Our attention is called to the rule which requires all the testimony in support of the issue on the plaintiff\u2019s side to be given before he has rested; and <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>78 N. Y. 420, is cited for the rule. That case, as well as numerous others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>holds that the rule has exceptions to it. In the ease just cited, Rapallo, J., \u2022says: \u201cThese rules may, in special cases, be departed from in the discretion' \u2022of the trial judge, but a refusal to depart from them is no ground of exception.\u201d Our attention is called to <em>Knallakan </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>47 Hun, 118. There \u201cdefendant took no objection that the evidence had been closed, and that plaintiff was reopening the case.\u201d We there held that the defendant could not be heard to say \u201cthat the court abused its discretion in that regard. He must be confined to the objections stated and taken when the rulings complained of were made.\u201d Nothing in that case is said or intimated to the effect that the question whether the case should be reopened or not was not one for the discretion of the trial judge or referee. That discretion, when exer\u2022cised, is controlling, and will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is \u2022 clearly of the opinion that there has been an abuse of the discretion. We are not able to say that the referee abused his discretion in receiving the testi\u2022rnony of Hardie. On tiie contrary, we think a portion of Hardie\u2019s testimony was entirely competent by way of rebuttal of the facts which the defendant had, produced upon the issue, and, so far as it was not a rebuttal, it was affirmative testimony. There was no error or abuse of discretion committed \u2019by the referee in receiving it at that stage of the case when it was offered. <em>Agate </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>84 N. Y. 672. In <em>Delafield </em>v. <em>De Grauw, </em>9 Bosw. 2, it \u2022was held: \u201cAt the close of the trial it is in the discretion of the referee whether he will allow depositions to be read as to matters which should be proved by a plaintiff or defendant before he rests, and his refusal to allow it is not matter of exception.\u201d If the defendant was taken by surprise by the permission given to call Hardie as a witness, and needed further testimony, an application for an adjournment might have been made to the referee, and it must be assumed that he would have allowed proper latitude to the defend- \u2022 ant in order to meet the testimony given by the witness Hardie.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">2. Nor do we think it was error to permit the witness Hardie to state that he had reported the terms of the contract made with the plaintiff to Mr. Striker. The witness liad just stated the terms of the contract, and the important inquiry was whether information thereof was communicated to Mr. Striker, an officer of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">3. Nor do we think it was error to allow the witness to state that \u201cMr. Striker asked me if the word \u2022 month \u2019 was to mean calendar month. I said, \u2018No, it was to be four weeks, or a pay month.\u2019 I told him that was the understanding between Fell and I, and I refused to open negotiations with Fell.\u201d We think the exceptions taken during the progress of the trial present no error calling for an interference with the conclusion reached by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
