Yietor and others against Louis F Strooek, for goods sold and delivered. The answer is a general denial. Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified substantiallythat in March, 1880, upon invitation, the defendant, Samuel Stroock, (now deceased,) called at plaintiffs\u2019 place of business in New York city, and partially examined certain goods, called \u201cChinchillas,\u201d contained in 10 eases. He subsequently called again, in company witli a Mr. Strauss, his book-keeper, and he was requested to examine all or as many of the goods as he desired, all the cases having been opened. After this examination, Mr Stroock expressed himself satisfied, and stated that he had examined all he wanted to. Thereupon the price\u201470 cents per yard\u2014 was agreed upon. He was expressly informed that the goods would be sold \u201cas are,\u201d that is, not of first quality or grade, but in bulk, such as they were exhibited to him. The defendant and Mr. Strauss then said they would take the goods, which were then sent to the defendant\u2019s place of business. The goods remained at the latter place, unopened, some 10 days; at least so the defendant testifies, there being no testimony on the part of plaintiffs on that subject. When the defendant opened the cases, as he alleged, he found that the goods were not what he had purchased, and therefore offered to return them, declining to accept. Plaintiffs\u2019 salesman endeavored to compromise the matter by offering a reduction of from 5 to 7\u00bf- per cent, upon the total amount* but it was not accepted; defendants persisting in their rejection of the goods* Upon these facts a motion to dismiss was made, on the ground that the sale was within the statute of frauds, and consequently void, which motion was denied, under exception. The case was given to the jury upon the question of acceptance, and a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied; hence this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b813-10\">Argued before Nehrbas and McGown, JJ</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b813-11\"><em>Jacobs Bros., </em>for appellant. <em>Bluinenstiel &amp; Hirsch, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b813-12\">Nehrbas, J</author>\n<p id=\"ARX\">In considering the reasons for the enactment of the statute of frauds, it seems to us that one of the main objects to be accomplished was to do away with the making of contracts by mere word of mouth. Language, however strong, could not form the basis of a legal agreement Some act was required to be done by a purchaser before he could be bound; so that an acceptance and a reception of goods by him would be valid, not by reason of any verbal statements he might make, but by some action taken by him or on his behalf. This principle was laid down in <em>Shindler v Houston, </em>1 N Y. 261, and is, in our judgment, a correct exposition of the law in view of the purpose of the statute. The case of <em>Cross </em>v <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>44 N. Y. 661, however, seems to us to be a departure from this rule. In that case the defendants gave a verbal order to plaintiffs to deliver 24,000 barrel hoops to a common carrier selected by the defendants. The latter had previously examined the hoops, and had expressed their satisfaction concerning them by word of mouth. It was held that acceptance might precede delivery, and that the defendants\u2019 verbal admission that the goods were satisfactory was a sufficient acceptance, if followed up by actual delivery to the carrier. The goods hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ing been lost in transit, the verdict of the jury in plaintiffs' favor was1 sustained. The court, Earl, C., says: \u201cThere is nothing in tito statute which requires that the accepting and receiving shall be at the sawe- time. Either may precede the other; and, after both have concurred, the statute has been complied with, and the contract becomes operative and valid. <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>Dunlop, </em>5 N. Y 587. The defendants agreed to take these identical hoops, and, after receiving them, and thus fully complying with the statute, they could not reject them upon any objection to their quality.\u201d See1, <em>also,. Allard </em>v. <em>Greasert, </em>61 N. Y 1. So, in the case of <em>Grey </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>9 Daly, 363, an oral agreement for the purchase of a scale was made by the defendants for $60, to-be paid on delivery It was taken, for the purpose of delivery, to the office of \u25a0defendants, upon a truck driven by plaintiff\u2019s car-man. He entered, the defendants\u2019 office, and, handing the plaintiff\u2019s bill, said he had the scale on his. truck. He was told to drive it into the back yard, and, in attempting to do so, accidentally caused the scale to be broken. Held, that there bad been no receipt of the scale by the purchasers sufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds. Yah Hoeseh, J., delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cThe scale was seen and selected by the defendants before the purchase, so that there is no doubt of the acceptance. The difficulty is that there was no receipt of the scale by the defendants.\u201d Applying this interpretation of the statute to the case at bar, it seems to us that by the examination made of the goods by Mr. Stroock and his book-keeper, and his agreement to pay 70- cents per yard for the same, his acceptance of the goods was established. We must take the plaintiffs\u2019 version of the verbal agreement, since the jury have found in their favor. The goods came into defendant\u2019s possession, as the delivery is admitted by the defendant\u2019s witnesses. Under <em>Cross </em>v. <em>O'Donnell, supra, </em>the defendant could not reject them upon any objection to their quality Receipt and acceptance were complete so as to satisfy the statute, and the contract of purchase and sale consummated. Ho fraud has been alleged or proven, and it seems the defendant had np right to return or offer to return-the goods after his reception of them. For these reasons we feel bound to affirm the judgment and order appealed from, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
