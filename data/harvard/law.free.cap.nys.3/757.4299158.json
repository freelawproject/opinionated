A general verdict was returned for defendants. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for new trial was \u201cgranted, unless the defendants stipulate to change and amend the verdict * * * so that it would appear to have been rendered in favor of plaintiffs for $20 and interest,\u201d and was denied in the event that such stipulation should be made. Defendants stipulated accordingly, and judgment was entered for plaintiffs for $21.35. The judgment and order were affirmed at the general term of the city court, and plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b769-12\">Argued before MoAdam, C.

After the verdict had \u25a0been rendered, and the oversight was called to the attention of the court, it promptly corrected the error, as it had the power to do. <em>Burhans </em>v. <em>Tibbits, </em>7 How. Pr. 21; <em>Van Schoening </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>14 Abb. Pr. 185; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>3 E. D. Smith, 89. The fact that this changed the general verdict for the defendants into a specific judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor is to the advantage \u2022of the latter, and they cannot complain of ft; especially as we cannot see how \u25a0the oversight of the court in respect to this item in any way influenced the jury on the other questions involved in the case, or that any error was committed by the court in its charge as to the other property in controversy. The judgment and order must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
