Y. 1885, c. 342, \u00a7 6, a mechanic\u2019s lien ceases in a year, unless within that time an action to enforce it is commenced; and section 8 provides that the manner of instituting the action shall be the same as in mortgage foreclosure. Provision is made for the mode of commencing an action in a court not of record, but not for a court of record. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 399, which applies to mortgage foreclosure, declares that an attempt to commence an action by delivery of the summons to the sheriff is equivalent to a commencement \u201cwithin the meaning of each provision of this act which limits the time for commencing an action. \u201d Cases of different limitations specially prescribed are excepted from that chapter of the Code by section/414. <em>Meld, </em>that a lien is preserved by delivery of the summons to the sheriff for service within a year, though it is not served until after the year has expired.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_6\">Section 6, c. 342, Laws 1885, provides that the lien shall not bind longer than a year after filing notice, unless within that time an action is commenced to enforce the same. Section 8 says that the manner and form of instituting and prosecuting any such action shall be the same as in actions for foreclosure of mortgages upon real property. This section, as I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>think, makes the practice as to these actions similar to that of actions of foreclosure. There is nothing said in the act as to the manner of commencing these actions when they are in courts of record. Provision is made as to such actions brought in courts not of record by sections 9,10 <em>et seq., </em>and these direct as to service of summons. As to actions in courts of record, we must therefore be left to the Code. Mow, the question is, in a court of record, what is the commencement of an action of this kind? The act does not say that the \u2022service of the summons is the commencement, or that anything else is the commencement. It only says that an action is to be commenced within a year, and the manner and form of instituting it are to be those of a foreclosure action. Turning, then, to the Code, to inquire as to the manner and form \u00f3f instituting such an action, we find section 399, providing that an attempt to commence such an action of foreclosure by delivery of the summons to the sheriff, with intent, etc., is equivalent to the commencement, so far as affects the limitation of time imposed on such action of foreclosure. It is \u00a1true that section 414 excepts from the provisions of that chapter cases where another limitation is imposed. But we are not inquiring as to the limitations imposed on actions to enforce liens or an action to foreclose mortgages. We are only inquiring as to the manner and form of instituting mortgage foreclosure, in order that such form and manner may be followed in actions to enforce liens. And certainly the provisions of section 399 apply to actions to foreclose mortgages. They are part of that manner and form which are .applicable to actions to enforce liens. The time of limitation is different, but the mode of commencing, in respect to the limitation, is the same in these actions and in jthose. It would, I think, be unreasonable to hold that the general rules which govern all other actions do not govern these. Mow, in regard to these actions in courts not of record, section 9 specially states how the .action is to be commenced, viz., by personal service, except as provided by section 10. This is in accordance with section 2876 of the Code. And the silence in this statute as to the mode of commencement in courts of record, .and its reference to actions of foreclosure, leave us to apply the provisions of the Code. \"Unless positively forbidden, we ought to apply the same uniform \u2022system to all actions, these included. There is no reason for any distinction, and I think none was intended. I therefore think the judgment should be in . all respects affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Ingalls, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b362-6\">Landon, J., (dissenting.)</author>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">The defendants Shepard, Trask, Manning, and \u2022one Drexel, since deceased, but whose executors have been substituted as defendants in his place, were the owners of a lot of land on the west side of Saratoga lake, and on the 1st day of October, 1884, entered into an agreement with the defendant Julia Abel to convey the same to her for $6,000, payable in 10 annual installments of $600 each, the first of which was to be paid that \u2022day, and thereupon the vendee, Mrs. Abel, was to take possession. The agreement further provided that Mrs. Abel should build two cottages upon the premises at a cost of not less than $1,200 each, and a stable to cost not less than $500, and make other substantial improvements and repairs. Mrs. Abel \u25a0entered into possession under the agreement, and engaged in making the erections and improvements specified in the agreement. The plaintiffs, under a contract with Mrs. Abel, between the 1st day of January, 1885, and the 6th \u2022day of June, 1885, furnished labor and materials to make such erections and repairs, of the value of $548.40, which remain unpaid. The plaintiffs filed a notice of lien therefor in the Saratoga county clerk\u2019s office, June 25, 1885, wherein Shepard, Trask, Manning and Drexel were named as owners. This \u00a1action was commenced under chapter 342 of the Laws of 1885. This act \u2022went into effect May 27, 1885. A portion of the labor and materials for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\"the notice of lien was filed was furnished before that date, and a portion after it. The act of 1885 repealed the previous mechanic\u2019s lien laws, and changed \u25a0the form of the remedy to foreclose the lien, but contained this reservation: \u201cThis act shall not be so construed as to affect, enlarge, invalidate, or defeat .any lien or right to a lien now existing, or any proceeding to enforce such \u2022lien now pending by virtue of any of the provisions of the acts hereby repealed.\u201d Section 26. The defendants, the owners of the premises and ven\u2022dors of Mrs. Abel, urge that inasmuch as the proceedings and this action were instituted under the act of 1885, the plaintiffs cannot under this act enforce \u25a0\u2022so much of their claim as accrued while chapter 489, Laws 1873, was in force. 'This contention is based upon the language of section 1, c. 342, Laws 1885. 'This section provides: \u201cAny person or persons, firm or firms, * * *\u2022 who \u00a1shall hereafter perform any labor or service, or furnish any materials, * * * \u2022with the consent of the owner, * * * may, upon filing the notice of \u2019.lien,\u201d etc. The plaintiff had a right to a lien under chapter 489, Laws 1873, ifor the labor and materials furnished up to the day of its repeal. That right \u25a0was saved by the act of 1885, and a new remedy given. True, the act of .1885 does not expressly say that the old right is to be worked out and enforced under the new law, but it is plain that such was the legislative intent. Chapter 382 of the Laws of 1886 protects notices of liens filed prior to June 27, 1885, under any of the laws repealed by the act of 1885. The remedial act of 1886 is additional evidence of the legislative intent that the rights to liens \u25a0existing at or prior to the repeal of the old laws could be enforced under the .act of 1885, and that the notice of lien could be filed under the same act, if not .previously filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The defendants, the vendors, further object that the lien does not attach to \"their interest in the land, but only to Mrs. Abel\u2019s. Both the acts of 1873 and \u25a0of 1885 declare that where the labor or materials are furnished \u201c with the con.sept of the owner, \u201d the lien attaches to the interest of the owner. A vendor who has not yet given the vendee a deed is regarded as an owner within the meaning of the act. Section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u25a0 The court found that the labor and materials in this case were furnished with the consent of the owners, the vendors, and the evidence supports the finding. The authorities are ample that in such case the owner\u2019s interest in the premises is bound by the lien. <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>90 N. Y. 336, and cases there cited. Section 6 of the act of 1885 provides: \u201cNo lien provided for in this act shall bind the property therein described for a longer period than one year -after the notice of lien has been filed, unless within that time an action is \u2022commenced to enforce the same; and, if the action is in a court of record, a notice of the pendency of such action is filed with the county clerk, \u201d etc. The notice of lien was filed June 25, 1885; the notice of the pendency of the action was filed June 25, 1886. No question is made that the notice of the pendency of the action was not filed in time. It must be filed within one year after the notice of lien is filed. One year after June 25,1885, embraced the whole of June 25, 1886. <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>75 N. Y. 240. The summons was served upon the defendant Trask June 23, 1886, and delivered to the sheriff for service on the other defendants, Shepard, Manning and Drexel, June 24, 1886, but was not served until June 28th. If sections 398 and 399 of the Code of Civil Procedure apply, then the action must be deemed commenced within time to avoid the statute of limitations; but if neither applies, then the attempt to commence the action against the defendants Shepard, Manning, and Drexel was not equivalent to its commencement. Section 398 provides: \u201cAn action is commenced against a defendant, within the meaning of any provision of this act which limits the time for commencing an action, when the summons is served on <em>him or on </em>a co-defendant who is a joint contractor, or otherwise united in interest with him.\u201d Section 399: \u201cAn attempt to commence an action * * * is equivalent to the commence<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ment thereof against each defendant, within the meaning of each provision of' this act, which limits the time for commencing an action,\u201d etc. The limitation of the time within which an action must be commenced in order to save the lien is made by the act of 1885, and not by the Code. Section 414 of the-Code of Civil Procedure excepts from the provisions of chapter 4, entitled1 \u201cLimitation of the time of enforcing a civil remedy,\u201d \u201ca case where a different limitation is especially prescribed by law. \u201d This action was not com- \u2022 meneed against Shepard, Manning, and Drexel until after the year had expired, and therefore there was no lien against their interest to be enforced. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs against the defendant Trask, and reversed as to the other appellants, with costs, and the complaint as to-them dismissed, with costs of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
