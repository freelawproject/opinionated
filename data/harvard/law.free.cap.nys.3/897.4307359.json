(3) To an action for any other cause, where the defendant is, or, if there are two or more defendants, where all of them are, at the time of the commencement of the action, residents of the county, and wherein the complaint demands judgment for a sum of money only, not exceeding one thousand dollars; to recover one or more chattels, the aggregate value of which does not exceed one thousand dollars, with or without damages for the taking or detention thereof.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO5I\">By the record it appears that the title to real estate was put in issue by the pleadings, and that question was tried, and determined \"in plaintiff\u2019s favor. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is rightly entitled to the immediate possession of a parcel of land under and by virtue of a written lease from the owner, naming him. These averments are denied by the answer. The right of possession was thus put in issue by the pleadings. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>47 How. Pr. 84, and the cases there collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The county court had no jurisdiction to try the issue as to the right of the plaintiff to the possession of the real estate described; and so much of the judgment as relates to that issue is void, and affords no support for the award \u25a0of costs in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. Code Civil Proe. \u00a7 340. It does not appear from the papers presented that the question of jurisdiction was raised upon the trial, but consent of parties never confers jurisdiction. The defendants might be entitled to costs in their favor if the question of title to the premises was the only issue raised by the pleadings, and passed upon by the verdict and judgment. The action was to recover possession of personal property also; and the plaintiff\u2019s title thereto, and the right of possession thereof, were \u25a0estimated by the verdict. Under the provisions of section 3228, the plaintiff is entitled to recover costs to an amount equal to the value of all chattels as fixed by the verdict, together with damages awarded for their detention. On \u25a0this appeal we do not consider the question whether the judgment follows the verdict or not, relative to the personal property; nor whether the value of the same, and the damages for defendants\u2019 detention, are by the verdict separately assessed from the value of the use of the freehold estate. We only determine, in disposing of this appeal, that upon the verdict the defendants are not entitled to costs, and the plaintiff is entitled to costs not exceeding the value of the personal property, and the damages for defendants\u2019 detention as \u25a0fixed by the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Order appealed from reversed, and retaxation ordered, without costs of this appeal to either party.
