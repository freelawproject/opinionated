Where such .allegation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>made, the plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves the same on trial of the' action; and a judgment for the defendant is not a bar to the new action to-recover the money or chattel. * * <em>* </em>(4) In an action upon contract, express or implied, other than a promise to marry, where it is alleged in the complaint that the defendant was guilty of a fraud in contracting or incurring\" the liability, or that he has, since the making of the contract, or in contemplation of the making \"of the same, removed or disposed of his property with intent to defraud his creditors, or is about to remove or dispose of the same\" with like intent; but, where such allegation is made, the plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves the fraud on the trial of the action, and a judgment for the defendant is not a har to a new action to recover upon the contract only. \u201d Section 1487 provides that, \u201c where a judgment can be enforced by execution, * * * an execution against the person of the judgment debtor may be issued thereupon, * * * where the plaintiff\u2019s right to arrest the defendant depends upon the nature of the action. * * *\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b135-6\">Argued before McAdam, C.

It was formerly regarded as an action on contract, and the right of arrest extrinsic. <em>Segelken </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>94 N. Y. 484-; <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>8 Civ. Proc. R. 283. The allegation of conversion was treated assurplusage, and not issuable, (Id.,) and no execution against the person could-issue unless an order of arrest had been obtained prior to judgment, ( <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>40 N. Y. 124.) Since the amendment made, in 1886, to section 549 of the Code, this rule has been changed. The right to arrest in such a case is-, no longer extrinsic to the cause of action, but is made an essential part of it.The action is (by this section) treated as one <em>ex delicto; </em>for the last portion of section 549 provides that a judgment for the defendant will not bar a new action <em>(ex contractu) </em>to recover the money. The judgment in such an action (ea: <em>delicto) </em>authorizes an execution against the person without the prerequisite of an order to arrest. Code, \u00a7 1487. The court below, in holding otherwise, clearly erred in its construction of section 549, <em>supra. </em>The fact that the plaintiff entered judgment with the clerk, without application to the-court, may have rendered the judgment voidable for irregularity, but not-void. It can only be attacked by a direct motion founded on the irregularity complained of. It is good until set aside, and while in force is sufficient to-authorize an execution against the person. It follows that the order appealed-from must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
