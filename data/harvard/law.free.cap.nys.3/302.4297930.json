Lefurgy for a <em>mandamus </em>to compel the New York As Northern Railroad Company to restore the waters of the Sawmill river to their ancient channel at, through, and along relator\u2019s farm in the town of Greepburgh. An alternative writ was issued January 25, 1888, to which defendant made return setting up the general issue, and alleging, among other things,' that the acts complained of were not done by defendant, but by an\u25a0other corporation, and that the cause was barred by the statute of limitations. It was shown by the evidence that the ancient bed of the river ran along the .eastern boundary of relator\u2019s farm, there making a curve or bend towards the west; that for ten years prior to 1880 a railroad had crossed this bend in the river by two bridges within a short distance of each other, on relator\u2019s land, leaving the water free to flow in its ancient bed; that in 1880 the New York Gity &amp; Northern Railroad .Company dug a ditch along the east side of its track .on the land of one Odell, so that the waters of the river flowed through it on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\"that side of the track,\u2014the ancient channel under the bridges being left open, -and the water flowing there when the river was at high water. The defendant corporation, the successor of the New York City <em>&amp; </em>Northern Railroad 'Company, was organized October 10, 1887, by persons who had bought the road under a foreclosure sale. The jury rendered a verdict for the relator, by \u25a0direction of the court, upon which a judgment was entered directing the issuance of a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus. </em>From this judgment defendant -appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b315-5\">Argued before Dykman and Pratt, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-6\"><em>Holmes &amp; Adams, (George H.

Y. 486, as an authority that defendants may be held responsible for injuries now taking place, 'though the original acts from which these injuries spring were performed by \" their predecessors in title. If the duty which devolves upon a railroad company to restore and maintain a stream in its original bed, after it has been -'temporarily diverted for purposes of construction, could be avoided by a transfer of ownership, the rights of land-owners would he much imperiled. We \u2022 think the duty is transferred with the property. The statute of limitations is \u00a1invoked by defendants. It is argued that as the digging which at last re\u2022sulled in changing the river bed was done in 1880, more than six years before \u00a1this action was begun, the cause of action arose in 1880, and is barred by the \u2022statute. It appears that the change in the bed of the stream did not take place -at once, upon the excavation of the new channel. The filling up and final \u25a0obliteration of the ancient channel was a work of time, and is not shown to \u00a1have taken place more than six years before action brought. Even did that fact appear, it may well be doubted whether the statute would apply, but that \u25a0question need not be determined. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Dykman, J., concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
