Squire, the relator, was removed from the office of commissioner of public works on the ground of bribery and conspiracy. During the hearings before the mayor and governor the relator was indicted for the same offenses, and acquitted. He applies for <em>certiorari </em>to review the proceedings by which he was removed, contending that he could not be removed except for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>cause. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 2125, prescribes a limitation of four months for bringing <em>certiorari, </em>and section 212(5 extends this to 20 months, where the relator is imprisoned on a criminal charge, or in execution upon conviction of a criminal offense, etc.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b154-5\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

The pendency of the indictment in no way precluded this court from exercising its power of review, if it had any. The relator, being out on bail, had full liberty to make his application during the four months allowed by section 2125 of the .Code, and he. was not imprisoned on a criminal charge at the time of the expiration of this time, so as to be entitled to the additional time mentioned in section 2126. An order may be entered denying the application upon these grounds, so that an appeal may be taken therefrom if the relator desires.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
