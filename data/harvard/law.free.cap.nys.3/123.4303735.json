Wherefore plaintiff charges defendant, as a stockholder, with liability for said indebtedness, under section \u202237, c. 611, Laws 1875, on the ground that said capital fixed is not paid in, and \u2022demands judgment against defendant for $663.24, with interest from May 16, 1887, and.costs, and alleges personal service of the summons on defendant, on \u2022or before April 7,1887. The defendant, in her answer, denies any knowledge \u25a0 or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations contained in the second paragraph of the complaint. And for a further and separate defense, she alleges, in substance, that the Southern Trust Company, on -or about the 21st day of February, 1887, recovered a judgment against the said American Opera Company on a promissory note made by said company to Calvin S. Brice, husband of defendant, for the sum of $5,120, the amount \u2022 of said note, interest, and costs; that on February 21, 1887, an execution was .issued upon said judgment against the American Opera Company, and that the same was, before the commencement of this action, returned wholly un,satisfied; that thereafter, and on or about April 20, 1887, the said Southern Trust Company commenced an action against this defendant, as a stockholder \u2022 of said American Opera Company, to recover the amount of said note, etc.; \u25a0 that the total liability of defendant for the debts of said American Opera Company has never exceeded $5,000; that about May 6,1887,\"defendant paid to the .Southern Trust Company the sum of- $5,000, and the same was accepted in \u2022satisfaction of her liability on the said note, and in full satisfaction of said .judgment, whereupon said action was discontinued by the Southern Trust Company. Plaintiff demurred to the new matter alleged in the answer as a -separate defense, on the ground that it stated \u201cno facts sufficient to constitute, \u25a0a defense in this action, and is therefore insufficient in law.\u201d On June 13, 1887, an order was made by Justice Nehrbas, overruling the demurrer, and for judgment in favor of defendant, dismissing the complaint with costs; and \u2022on April 25, 1888, judgment was entered, dismissing the complaint, and for \u2022cost to the defendant amounting to $47.18, her costs and disbursements in this :action. The pleadings in each of the above cases are substantially the same, -and the same questions are presented on the appeal in each case.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b136-10\">Argued before McGown and Pitshke, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-11\"><em>Wm.

This action vras commenced on April 7, 1887, at which time no judgment had been obtained by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tiff against the American Opera Company; as the plaintiff did not recover his. judgment until the 16th day of May, 1887. The Southern Trust Company obtained a judgment on the 21st day of February, 1887, against the American Opera Company on a promissory note for $5,000, and an execution was issued thereon on the same day, and returned wholly unsatisfied, before the commencement of the action, by the Southern Trust Company, viz., on April 20, 1887, on which day an action was commenced by the Southern Trust Company against this defendant, as a stockholder, etc., to recover the amount of the said promissory note; and defendant, on May 6, 1887, paid to the Southern Trust Company the sum of $5,000 in full satisfaction of her liability on said note. Justice Rehrbas, in his opinion, holding that on April 7, 1887, when this action was commenced, plaintiff had no existing cause of action-against the defendant, inasmuch as the judgment recovered by the plaintiff against the American Opera Company, had not been recovered, or execution thereon returned unsatisfied, at the time of the commencement of this action, on April 7, 1887; said judgment not having been recovered until the 16th day of May, 1887; and that defendant\u2019s liability did not become fixed until May 16, 1887, and that defendant had on May 6, 1887, discharged her liability as a stockholder by payment to the Southern Trust Company of the sum of $5,000, the amount claimed in the suit of the Southern Trust Company against her, commenced on April 20.1887. In deciding that plaintiff had no existing cause of action against the defendant for the reason that no judgment had been obtained and execution returned thereon unsatisfied in plaintiff\u2019s action against the American Opera Company at the time of the commencement of this suit, Justice Rehrbas followed the ruling of this court on that question, which-ruling was affirmed by the general term of the court of common pleas, on an appeal in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>12 N. Y. St. Rep. 136, and many similar cases-decided in this court. The court of appeals, however, have in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>17 N. E. Rep. 676, overruled the decision of this court and of the court of common pleas made in the cases above referred to, and hold that under the act of 1875 it is not necessary first to obtain judgment against the corporation, and have execution thereon; and that the same is not made a condition under said act to the commencement of a suit by a creditor against a stockholder. In holding that defendant discharged her liability as a stockholder-by the payment by her to the trust company the amount of her liability, Justice Rehrbas\u2019 decision is in full accord with, and sustained by, the decisions of the court of appeals in <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>17 N. Y. 458; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Love, </em>50 N. Y. 572; <em>Mathez </em>v. <em>Neidig, </em>72 N. Y. 100; <em>Pfohl </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>74 N. Y. 143. The payment made by defendant was clearly \u201cunder legal compulsion.\u201d An action had been commenced against her for a cause of action, to which she had no legal or honest defense. She was not required to incur the expense of a defense, where none existed, nor to wait for the recovery of the judgment, against her, and thus subject herself to unnecessary costs. Justice Rehrbas, in his opinion, further says that \u201cit is a rule of pleading that on a demurrer the court will consider the whole record, and give judgment for the party who, on the whole, appears to be entitled to it.\u201d This ruling is sustained by the opinion of Chief Justice MoAdam in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>at general term, filed February 10, 1888, IS R. Y. St. Rep. 728, which ruling was not overruled in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>hereinbefore referred to. See, also, <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>19 Abb. N. C. 79; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>N. Y. City Ct. Sp. Term, June, 1887. The demurrer of the plaintiff to the separate defense set up in defendant\u2019s answer admits all such matters of fact as were therein sufficiently pleaded, thus admitting the payment by the defendant to the Southern Trust Company of the amount of her liability as a stockholder; and, as before stated, such payment, being admitted by the demurrer, was a good defense to this action, and\" which could be set up on a new trial, and would be a good defense on such trial.\u00b0 For the-reasons above stated the judgments appealed from must be affirmed, with costs,.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>but with liberty to the plaintiff to withdraw his demurrer on payment within 10 days of $20 costs of the trial of an issue of law in one action, and the costs .of appeal in one action, to be taxed. If this condition is not complied with, .the affirmance will be absolute, with costs in each action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
