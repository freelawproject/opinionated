The elements of damage set forth were the loss of profits .of a profitable business, and the acquirement by defendant of a knowledge of the business from plaintiff. The plaintiff received his share of the profits ..earned up to the time of the alleged breach or refusal of defendant to continue in business with plaintiff. Whatever the agreement was, or with whomsoever it was made, rests upon the plaintiff\u2019s conversation' with Paul Weidmann, Sr., (president of defendant,) and Paul Weidmann, Jr., (one of the trustees of defendant,) which conversations, stated most favorably to plaintiff, were to the effect that Weidmann, Sr., said to plaintiff: \u201cI am acting for \u25a0.the company, [meaning defendant,] and.I will furnish the money to buy the bags, etc., and you your services. I will take three-fourths of the net profits, .and you shall have one-fourth of the net profits;\u201d to which the plaintiff assented. Then plaintiff said, in the presence of Weidmann, Sr., to Weidmann, ,Jr.: \u201cNow, we had better draw up the papers right away, and have them signed,\u2014have the whole thing settled;\u201d to which Weidmann, Jr., replied, \u201cWe are busy; come in to-morrow.\u201d The next morning plaintiff said to Weidmann, Jr., \u201cCan\u2019t we have those papers drawn up and signed?\u201d when Weidmann, Jr., replied that his father (Weidmann, Sr.,) had gone away .for two weeks; adding, \u201cand you will have to wait till he comes back.\u201d Plaintiff said to Weidmann, Jr., \u201cI want those papers drawn up for five years;\u201d to which Weidmann, Jr., replied, \u201cI. hope it will last fifty years.\u201d Whether this testimony is sufficient to establish a contract of copartnership with the defendant, a corporation, without some corporate act authorizing or ratifying the same; or whether a corporation can form a copartnership with an individual; or whether a verbal agreement for the formation of a copartnership for more than a year is valid under the statute of frauds,\u2014it will not .be necessary for us tp decide. Assuming there was a copartnership agreement between the plaintiff and defendant, there was no breach, because it \u25a0was for no limited or specified term, and hence was dissolvable at the will of .either party. Story, Parfn. p. 437, \u00a7 269. There was no meeting of the minds .on the time for whi,ch the partnership was to continue, on the most favorable construction to plaintiff of the only evidence on this point, to-wit., that part _of plaintiff\u2019s testimony in which he states he said to Weidmann, Jr., \u201cI want it for five years;\u201d to which Weidmann replied, \u201cI hope it will last for fifty years.\u201d But he (Weidmann, Jr.,) had just told plaintiff that he would have \u00a1to wait two weeks, and see his father, (Weidmann, Sr.) This manifestly left the term of the partnership unsettled. This action is based solely upon an .alleged breach of a copartnership agreement in that defendant terminated the same, and refused to continue in business with plaintiff under such contract. The agreement did not fix the term, and it could be dissolved at the will of .either party. Of course tlie plaintiff was entitled to his share of any assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>of the copartnership when dissolved, but this action is not brought to recover such share. For these reasons the judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
