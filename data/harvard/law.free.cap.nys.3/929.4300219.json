Fargo, as president of the American Express Company, for damages for the loss of a certain package of goods delivered by plaintiff to the company at the city of New York, addressed to Mrs. C. P. Frankel, Saugerties, M. Y., for carriage and delivery as addressed. Mrs. Frankel testifies that she never ordered the goods, never received them, or knew of their delivery, and that she never gave.authority to any person to order or receive them for her. The defendant\u2019s driver, who had been in its employ but four days, and had never previously'been in the express business, testified that he tendered the package to Mrs. Frankel, and she refused to accept it; that he afterwards took the package to her store, and gave it to a man there, who he afterwards learned was Warschofsky; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>received it, paid the expressage, and signed for it in his own name. He did not inquire for his authority to receive it, nor did he ask for Mrs. Frankel. The delivery was made in the day-time, and the package was a large one. The door between the store and the little building back of it, in which the Fran Ir\u00e9is lived, was open, and there were some ladies in there, who could see into the store.

P. Frankel, Saugerties, H. Y., which they agreed to carry and safely deliver to her. The package was tendered by the defendants to Mrs. Frankel at her place of business, in Saugerties, and she refused to receive the same, or pay the expressage thereon, on the ground that she had not authorized the purchase of it. Afterwards a daughter of Mrs. Frankel went to defendant\u2019s office at Saugerties, and directed that the package be sent to her mother\u2019s place of business, but it is not shown that this was done by the authority of tlie mother. The defendant thereupon delivered the package at Mrs. Frankel\u2019s place of business, to one Warschofsky, without making any inquiry as to whether he was authorized to receive it for Mrs. Frankel. He receipted it in his own name, and not in hers. There is no evidence that Warschofsky was Mrs. Frankel\u2019s agent for that purpose, or that he was authorized to receive it for her; nor is there any evidence that he was in the store by Mrs. Frankel\u2019s authority;-nor are there facts and circumstances shown from which the court was bound to infer that he was her agent. Where a common carrier delivers goods to a stranger without requiring evidence of identity, it is liable to the consignor for their value. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>50 N. Y. 213. It is bound to deliver the goods to the consignee or his agent, and, if to the agent, it must be prepared to show the authority of the agent tc receive it, if that is disputed. <em>Witbeck </em>v <em>Holland, </em>45 N. Y. 18. It was in this case, and the justice was fully justified by the evidence in .arriving at the conclusion he did upon that subject. The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
