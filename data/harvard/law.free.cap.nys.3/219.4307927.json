Havens against\" Adeline P. Havens and Lewis Bowden, executors of Nicoll Havens, deceased. It -was proved before the referee that plaintiff, who was testator\u2019s son, had been to California, and returned in 1868, bringing with him his wife and children, with whom he lived in testator\u2019s house until the latter\u2019s death. He did some farm work, and had some farming tools of his own, but was a carpenter, and principally engaged at his trade, being a large part of the time' away. At different times during his residence with his father he built additions to the house, worth several hundred dollars. About 18 months before' testator\u2019s death he told the draughtsman of his will that he had given the farm1 to plaintiff by 1ns will, and wanted him to go on with it; that he (testator)' was unable to work, and would always be, but that plaintiff was well enough* off with what he had given him. Different amounts were shown to have been1 paid at various times by plaintiff for labor done on the farm, and for articles' purchased and taken there,\u2014such as hay, pigs, and material used on the buildings. During a great part of the time plaintiff and family ate at the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u25a0table with testator and his wife, and there was evidence that plaintiff furnished a considerable quantity of the provisions, and that he paid testator for many .articles produced on the farm and used on the table. There was no proof of the ownership of the money with which plaintiff paid for labor, etc., nor of .any express promise by testator to pay for anything. The referee found for \u2022defendants, and judgment was entered accordingly. Plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b232-5\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The plaintiff resided on the farm, and apparently had the common \u2022use of it with his father for many years. The improvements were for the convenience of the plaintiff, and the money paid was partly, at least, for his benefit. We might surmise that, he expected to have the farm at his father\u2019s \u2022death, and thus reap the benefit of the improvements. Even in such case the \u2022 estate would not be liable to pay in the absence of a promise of that kind. The case is barren of any direction on the part of the testator to the plaintiff to pay out money or make improvements. The fact that the plaintiff resided ;So long with his father, and that no accounting seems to have been had, renders it probable that the plaintiff never intended to charge, and the father never expected to pay, for any of the items claimed. The case seems to fall within the principle stated by the referee, and enunciated in the following de<em>cisions,\u2014Bowen </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>2 Bradf. Sur. 336; <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>McKeon, </em>85 N. Y. 137; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Hun, 275,\u2014to-wit: That no recovery can be had by near relations living upon the same premises in common, or members of the same family, without proving an express promise to pay, or proving such facts -and circumstances as to make the inference plain that there was such a promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The exception to the ruling of the referee in excluding the question put to -the plaintiff as a witness in his own behalf need not be considered, as the .amount paid never became material through failure to prove any liability. It was of no importance whether plaintiff expended much or little, unless there \u25a0was a promise to repay on the part of testator. The question, \u201cState whose money it was that you paid to these different parties, \u201d was also properly excluded, for the reason just stated. Assuming that it was plaintiff\u2019s money, he could not make his father his debtor without a request to pay. The question, \u201cDid you do any farming on your own account?\u201d was not well taken, as \u2022the matter was immaterial. The irresistible conclusion, from a careful reading of the testimony, is that the plaintiff failed to make out a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Barnard, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"A42\">Dykman, J., <em>(concurring.)</em></author>\n<p id=\"AE9\">This was a reference under the statute of a \u2022disputed claim of the plaintiff against the administrator of the defendants. The plaintiff was a son of the testator, and, with his family, occupied a portion of his father\u2019s dwelling-house in Suffolk county, from 1868 until his .father\u2019s death, in 1885; and this claim is for services during that period, and for materials furnished in building, and work performed in the erection of \u2022certain buildings. The referee has found that the materials were furnished for the building, and the work was performed; that the labor was not performed by the plaintiff under an agreement with his father, nor were the materials furnished or money paid for labor performed by other parties by authority or under the order or direction of the testator, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover therefor. The report is sustained by the proof. The plaintiff falls within the line of decisions in this state respecting services performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>by members of the same family, where no implied promise to pay therefor is raised by the law, and the report of the referee is justified by that class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
