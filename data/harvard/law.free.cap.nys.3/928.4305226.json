The answer denies the making of any such contract, or any violation thereof, or that any sand or gravel procured by the plaintiff was in pursuance of any contract with it, or under its direction, or at its request; with a further denial that any sand or gravel procured by the plaintiff had been used by the defendant. The issue thus joined was brought to trial before a jury, who found a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the sum of $1,000. 'Upon appeal to the general term of the city court, the judgment entered upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the verdict was affirmed, and from such decision of the general term this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The main question of fact involved was whether or not the alleged contract was ever made. The verdict of the jury has definitely settled this fact, and it cannot, on this appeal, be made the subject of review. On the argument of the appeal we understood the appellant to admit the making of the contract, its breach, and the right of the plaintiff to damages. His criticisms were confined to the rule of damages adopted by the court as applicable to the case, and to which he had duly excepted. We have no doubt that the rule applied by the trial judge in reference to the depot-site which was to be made upon the plaintiff\u2019s land was correct, and that the fair cost of filling in the depot-site as stipulated \u2022 was recoverable. <em>Laraway </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>10 N. Y., opinion of Johnson, J., page 373. That part of the charge, however, which relates to the damages tobe recovered for the failure to fill in the trestle-work, appears to be erroneous. The defendant having neglected and refused to fill in the trestle-work upon its railroad as it agreed to do, the plaintiff was entitled to recover such damages as flowed naturally .and approximately from the breach,, and were within the contemplation of the parties as likely to result therefrom. The fault of that portion of the charge which deals with the question of damages for the failure to fill in the trestle-work, is, it seems to us, that it erroneously assumes that the contract was different from what it actually was,\u2014that the railroad was liable if the filling in of the trestle-work did not exclude water from the plaintiff\u2019s land, and make it dry. The whole scope of the charge on this branch of the case is that the railroad company was bound to make the plaintiff\u2019s land dry. That was not the contract. The defendant did not agree to build an embankment that would keep the water from the plaintiff\u2019s land, but agreed to fill in the trestle-work with sand arid gravel from the bank of earth owned by Mr. Bogert. It was therefore an error, we think, to submit this part of the case to the jury upon the theory that the defendant had contracted to keep the water from the plaintiff\u2019s land. For the reason above stated, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
