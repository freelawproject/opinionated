(FHBA), appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Nicolosi, </em>J.) requiring him to indemnify the plaintiff, Dr. Seymour Kessler, for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs he incurred in this declaratory judgment action and to pay him the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority (NHHFA) in a related action. We reverse in part, vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">The record reveals the following facts. The plaintiff is one of several limited partners of FHBA. <em>Kessler v. Gleich, </em>156 N.H. 488, 490 (2007). FHBA was created to construct, own and operate a \u201cSection 8\u201d housing development in Concord. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">FHBA financed the housing development through the NHHFA. <em>Id. </em>As the sole general partner of FHBA exercising complete control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>management of the development, the defendant executed a regulatory-agreement, as well as a mortgage and promissory note with NHHFA. <em>Id. </em>These documents required the defendant to contract with an approved managing agent for the property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Between 1997 and 2004, the defendant was repeatedly notified by NHHFA that FHBA was in violation of the regulatory agreement for failing to have an approved managing agent in place. <em>Id. </em>NHHFA further informed the defendant that if FHBA did not comply with the terms of the regulatory agreement, NHHFA would foreclose on the property. <em>Id. </em>After several additional notifications, on October 1, 2004, NHHFA began foreclosure proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The defendant, however, never notified the limited partners of the default or the commencement of foreclosure proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff learned of the foreclosure through his attorney and intervened to enjoin the sale of the property at auction. <em>Id. </em>at 490-91. The foreclosure auction was temporarily enjoined. <em>Id. </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In 2004, the plaintiff filed suit against the defendant seeking a declaration that the defendant willfully breached the fiduciary duties he owed the plaintiff and the other limited partners. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ruled in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, finding that the defendant willfully breached his fiduciary duty of loyalty by violating the partnership agreement and by allowing the partnership to be defaulted by NHHFA for lack of a proper managing agent. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Thereafter, the plaintiff, as the prevailing party, renewed his motion in superior court for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion and awarded him $288,281.20 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. These fees included $75,406 for legal fees and expenses incurred by NHHFA in the foreclosure action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u201cA prevailing party may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees when that recovery is authorized by statute, an agreement between the parties, or an established judicial exception to the general rule that precludes recovery of such fees.\u201d <em>Tulley v. Sheldon, </em>159 N.H. 269, 272 (2009) (quotation omitted). We will not overturn a trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees unless it is an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In applying this standard, we are mindful of the substantial deference given to the trial court\u2019s decision on attorney\u2019s fees, and we -will uphold the decision if the record provides some support for it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The trial court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to fees pursuant to the indemnity provision of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement (section 6.8), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>No General Partner shall have any liability or obligation to the other General Partners, the Limited Partners or the Partnership for any decision made or action taken in connection with the discharge of his duties hereunder, if such decision or action is made or taken in good faith. Moreover, the General Partners shall not be liable to the Limited Partners because of the disallowance or adjustment by any taxing authority of any deduction or credits claimed in any tax return filed by the Partnership. The General Partners shall not be liable to the Partnership or the Limited Partners for any negative amount in their capital account, provided same shall not have arisen out of their borrowing money from the Partnership, any such borrowing being prohibited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each General Partner shall indemnify and save harmless the Partnership, the Limited Partners and the other General Partners from and against any claim, loss, expense, liability, action or damage, including, without limitation, reasonable costs and expenses of litigation and appeal (and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) ari[s]ing out of his fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, or his willful failure to comply with any representation, condition or other agreement herein contained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The companion to section 6.8 is section 6.7, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">The Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each of the General Partners and their successors and assigns from any claim, loss, expense, liability, action or damage resulting f[ro]m any act or omission performed or omitted by any of them in their capacities as General Partners, including, without limitation, reasonable costs and expenses of litigation and appe&amp;l (and the reasonable costs and expenses of attorneys engaged by the General Partners in defense of such act or omission), but no General Partner shall be entitled to be indemnified or held harmless for any act or omission arising from his fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, or his willful failure to comply with any representation, condition or other agreement herein contained. Any indemnity under this Section 6.7 shall be provided out of and to the extent of Partnership assets only, and no Limited Partner shall have any personal liability on account thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">On appeal, the defendant first argues that the trial court erred by interpreting section 6.8 to require him to pay the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the declaratory judgment proceeding. The defendant contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>that this provision applies only to claims brought by third parties against the limited partners and does not apply to claims brought by a limited partner against a general partner. As the defendant explains: \u201cThe prepositions \u2018from and against,\u2019 juxtaposed as they must be against the language \u2018indemnify and save harmless,\u2019 can only mean that the parties intended that the general partner will protect the limited partners \u2018from\u2019 the action of another, or save harmless \u2018against\u2019 the claim of another made against them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">When there is an express contract for indemnity, as there is here, the rights of the surety are not to be determined by general indemnity principles, but by the letter of the contract for indemnity. <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. AMSCO, </em>153 N.H. 28, 34 (2005). The meaning of a contract is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We interpret indemnity agreements in the same way that we interpret contracts generally. <em>Id. </em>at 34. We look to the parties\u2019 intent at the time the agreement was made, considering the written agreement, all its provisions, its subject matter, the situation of the parties at the time the agreement was entered into, and the object intended. <em>Dunn v. CLD Paving, </em>140 N.H. 120, 122 (1995). We assign the words and phrases used by the parties the common meaning that would be given to them by a reasonable person. <em>AMSCO, </em>153 N.H. at 34. Unless the agreement contains ambiguous terms, we limit our review to the four corners of the document itself. <em>Dunn, </em>140 N.H. at 122. We construe express indemnity agreements strictly, particularly when they purport to shift responsibility for an individual\u2019s own negligence to another. <em>See Merrimack School Dist. v. Nat\u2019l School Bus Serv., </em>140 N.H. 9, 12 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that the indemnification provision at issue, <em>in its entirety, </em>applies only to third party claims is broader than necessary to resolve this appeal. This appeal concerns <em>only </em>the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, specifically whether such fees and costs are recoverable in first party litigation. We limit our analysis of the indemnification provision accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We have previously addressed the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to indemnification agreements. In <em>Town of Nottingham v. Newman, </em>147 N.H. 131, 136-37 (2001), we ruled that the agreement between one of the defendants and the Town required her to pay the Town\u2019s legal expenses incurred in enforcing their agreement. The agreement stated that the defendant understood that if she defaulted, thereby requiring the Town to remove her two mobile homes, she would be responsible for all of the costs, attorney\u2019s fees and legal expenses the Town would incur. <em>Newman, </em>147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>N.H. at 132-33. We held that this language obligated the defendant to pay the Town\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37.</p>\n<p id=\"A0b\">By contrast, in <em>Merrimack School District, </em>140 N.H. at 14-15, we held that the parties\u2019 agreement did not obligate the indemnitor to pay the indemnitee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred to enforce the indemnification agreement. The language in that agreement was that the indemnitor agreed to \u201cdefend, indemnify and save the [indemnitee], and its employees harmless from all claims and demands, actions and causes of action, damages, costs, loss of service, expenses and compensation on account of or in any way growing out of any claim referred to above.\u201d <em>Merrimack School Dist., </em>140 N.H. at 12 (quotation omitted). The claims referred to were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">any and all claims and demands, actions and causes of action, damages, costs, loss of service, expenses and compensation, including but [not] . . . limited to any and all claims for personal injury and/or death and property damage which may, in any way, arise from or out of the operations of the defendant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement whether such operations be performed by the defendant itself, anyone directly or indirectly employed by it or any other person or company retained in any way to carry on all or a portion of the operations necessary to abide by the terms of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted.) We held that the reference to any \u201closs\u201d the plaintiff might sustain \u201cdoes not imply cost or expense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. We ruled that this language did not indicate the parties\u2019 intent to include within the scope of the indemnification agreement the attorney\u2019s fees incurred to enforce it. <em>Id.; see Nova v. Penske, </em>952 A.2d 275, 289 (Md. 2008) (ruling that indemnification agreement that does not specifically refer to attorney\u2019s fees was not intended to cover first party attorney\u2019s fees and, thus, did not allow the prevailing parties to recover their fees in action between the parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The language in the indemnity agreement in this case is more specific than that in <em>Merrimack </em>because it refers to attorney\u2019s fees, but is not as specific as that in <em>Newman, </em>which actually referred to an action between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Courts in other jurisdictions have ruled that because a promise by one party to a contract to indemnify the other party for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigation between the two parties is contrary to the general rule that parties are responsible for their own legal fees, <em>see Clipper Affiliates v. Checovich, </em>138 N.H. 271, 277 (1994), the court should not infer a party\u2019s intention to waive the benefit of the general rule \u201cunless the intention to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>so is <em>unmistakably clear </em>from the language of the promise.\u201d <em>Hooper Associates v. AGS Computers, </em>548 N.E.2d 903, 905 (N.Y. 1989) (emphasis added). The parties in <em>Hooper </em>had an agreement under which the plaintiff agreed to buy computer equipment and services from the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 903. The indemnification provision explained that the defendant was required to \u201cindemnify and hold harmless\u201d the plaintiff \u201cagainst and from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees arising out of\u2019 five specific kinds of actions. <em>Id. </em>at 903-04 n.l (quotations and emphasis omitted). The plaintiff sued the defendant for, among other things, breach of express and implied warranties, one of the five specified actions entitling the plaintiff to indemnification for its attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 903, 903-04 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Nonetheless, the court ruled that the indemnification provision \u201cd[id] not contain language clearly permitting plaintiff to recover from defendant the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in a suit against the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 905. The court stated that the language was \u201ctypical of those which contemplate reimbursement when the indemnitee is required to pay damages on a third-party claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court observed that the five specific kinds of actions specified in the agreement were not exclusively or unequivocally referable to claims between the parties themselves and, thus, did not support an inference that the defendant promised to indemnify the plaintiff for counsel fees in an action on the contract. <em>Id.; see Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, Inc. v. Hollander, </em>337 F.3d 186, 199-200 (2d Cir. 2003) (applying New York law, court holds that provision requiring indemnitor to reimburse indemnitee for any legal or other expenses incurred with respect to any claims arising in any manner out of or in connection with the idemnitee\u2019s services, \u201cincluding, without limitation, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the indemnification obligations set forth herein\u201d was insufficient to require indemnitor to pay indemnitee\u2019s legal fees in indemnitee\u2019s breach of contract action against indemnitor); <em>Nevadacare v. Department of Human Services, </em>783 N.W.2d 459, 470-72 (Iowa 2010) (indemnity provision that required indemnitor to indemnify indemnitee for all costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, related to or arising from any breach of the parties\u2019 contract applied only to claims brought by third parties and not to a breach of contract claim between the parties). <em>But see, e.g., Dalton v. Childress Service Corp., </em>432 S.E.2d 98, 100-02 (W. Va. 1993) (indemnity clause, which provided for indemnification of \u201cany and all costs and expenses including attorney\u2019s fees which may be incurred in connection therewith\u201d applied to expense incurred in defending third-party claims <em>and </em>to those incurred in enforcing parties\u2019 agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>We align ourselves with those courts that will not infer a party\u2019s intention to waive the benefit of the general rule that parties are responsible for their own legal fees unless the intention to do so is <em>\u201cunmistakably clear </em>from the language of the promise.\u201d <em>Hooper Associates, </em>548 N.E.2d at 905 (emphasis added); <em>cf. Merrimack School Dist., </em>140 N.H. at 12 (express language is unnecessary to provide indemnity for the negligence of another where the parties\u2019 intention to afford protection for another\u2019s negligence is \u201cclearly evident\u201d (quotation omitted)). This is in keeping with our general reluctance to imply a duty to indemnify. <em>See Dunn, </em>140 N.H. at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In this case, the claims for which the agreement allows the plaintiff to collect attorney\u2019s fees, like the claims in <em>Hooper, </em>do not exclusively or unequivocally refer to claims between the parties. Section 6.8 of the parties\u2019 agreement allows the plaintiff to collect fees arising from the general partner\u2019s fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, or willful failure to comply with any representation, condition or other agreement contained in the parties\u2019 partnership agreement. These claims could be brought either by the limited partners or by a third party. Had the parties wished to demonstrate their clear intent to require the general partner to indemnify the limited partners for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in an action between the general and limited partners, they could have used language such as that used by the parties in <em>Newman, </em>147 N.H. at 132-33. In <em>Newman, </em>the parties used language that referred specifically to an action between them. Here, by contrast, the parties used language that could have referred to an action between them or could have referred to an action brought by a third party. Because the intention to require indemnity in an action between the parties is not \u201cunmistakably clear from the language of the promise,\u201d <em>Hooper Associates, </em>548 N.E.2d at 905, we decline to infer such an intention, <em>see Dunn, </em>140 N.H. at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the indemnification provision at issue does not require the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs he incurred in bringing this declaratory judgment proceeding because it does not specify that such fees and costs are recoverable in an action between the parties. We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s award to the plaintiff of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs he incurred in this declaratory judgment proceeding. While the plaintiff asserts that he is entitled to recovery of his attorney\u2019s fees and costs under common law, he acknowledges that the trial court did not address this claim. We decline to do so in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by requiring him to pay the plaintiff $75,406, which represents the attorney\u2019s fees that NHHFA incurred in the foreclosure action. The trial court ruled that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>was responsible for these fees because: (1) the note and mortgage contained provisions in which the partnership agreed to pay NHHFA\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for any action related to foreclosure as a result of default; and (2) section 6.8 of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement obligates the defendant to indemnify the partnership for any expenses arising out of his willful failure to abide by the agreement. Section 6.4(A) of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo General Partner shall have authority to perform any act in violation of... any agreement between the Partnership and NHHFA.\u201d The defendant breached the agreement between the partnership and NHHFA by failing to put an approved managing agent in place and, by so doing, also breached section 6.4(A) of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We find no error in this analysis. However, we vacate the trial court\u2019s award of those fees to the plaintiff. As the defendant aptly notes, the note and mortgage obligate the <em>partnership </em>to pay NHHFA\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. They do not obligate the plaintiff to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s orders in the injunction proceeding make him responsible for NHHFA\u2019s fees. The trial court\u2019s rulings are unclear. In its initial order, the trial court appears to have agreed with the plaintiff that the court\u2019s 2004 and 2006 orders in the foreclosure proceeding required him to pay NHHFA\u2019s fees. The court specifically referred to those orders when responding to the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe only fees recoverable for NHHFA costs and fees, if any, are the $17,000 in costs originally claimed in 2004 during the litigation against NHHFA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In its order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, however, the trial court stated that \u201cthe plaintiff is correct in asserting that the <em>partnership </em>is liable to NHHFA for [its] reasonable attorney\u2019s fees expended in attempting to collect on the indebtedness of the mortgage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court further ruled that while the defendant was ultimately hable for NHHFA\u2019s fees because of the partnership agreement, he was liable only \u201cto the extent that NHHFA collects its fees under the terms of its agreement with the Partnership.\u201d The court\u2019s order appears to contemplate that the amount of fees recoverable by NHHFA was as yet undetermined when it stated: \u201cIf a dispute arises between NHHFA and the <em>Partnership </em>regarding the fees owed to NHHFA, or if the defendant contests the reasonableness of those fees, the defendant would be allowed to intervene and challenge the legitimacy of the fees and his obligation given his ultimate liability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nonetheless, the trial court awarded the <em>plaintiff </em>$75,406 \u201cfor NHHFA legal fees and expenses, auctioneer expenses, and appraisal fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In light of the trial court\u2019s arguably conflicting rulings and the record submitted on appeal, which fails to clarify the trial court\u2019s intent, we vacate the award of $75,406 to the plaintiff for NHHFA\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\n<em>Reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
