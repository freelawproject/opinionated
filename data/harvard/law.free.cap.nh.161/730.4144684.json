We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">The record supports the following facts. The State provides pensions to eligible retired state employees through the NHRS. Active state employees contribute to the NHRS through wage deductions. RSA 100-A:16, 1(a) (Supp. 2010). Upon retirement, retirees receive a member annuity based upon their contributions and a state annuity determined in part by the member\u2019s \u201caverage final compensation.\u201d RSA 100-A:5, 1(b) (2001). The funds held by the NHRS are to be used solely to pay the retirement allowances of NHRS members. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 36-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">The State also provides medical and surgical benefits to state employees and their spouses and dependents, and eligible retirees and their spouses through a separate program and statutory scheme. <em>See </em>RSA 21-1:30,1-II (Supp. 2009) (amended 2010); <em>see also State Employees </em>Assoc. <em>of N.H. v. N.H. Div. of Personnel, </em>158 N.H. 338, 340 (2009). Eligible retirees include retired state law enforcement personnel (Group II), other retired state employees who meet certain eligibility criteria (Group I) and certain vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>deferred retirees. RSA 21-1:30, II, III (Supp. 2009) (amended 2010). The NHRS does not hold the funds used to pay for these benefits. Instead, the Employee and Retiree Benefit Risk Management Fund holds these funds, and they are administered by the department of administrative services (DAS). RSA 21-I:30-e (Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Prior to 1992, the State paid the full health care premium for eligible retired state employees, subject to funding by the legislature. RSA 21-1:30 (Supp. 1990). In 1991, the legislature amended the statute to provide that \u201c[t]he state shall pay a premium.\u201d RSA 21-1:30, I (Supp. 1991). Nonetheless, following this amendment, the State continued to pay the entire cost of the retirees\u2019 health care premium. However, in July 2009, the legislature enacted RSA 100-A:54, III, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">The retirement system shall deduct from the monthly retirement allowance of retired state employees under the age of 65 years receiving medical and surgical benefits provided pursuant to RSA 21-1:30, the premium contribution amounts of $65 per month for each such retiree and $65 per month for each applicable spouse; provided that the charge to each household shall not exceed $130 per month. Deducted amounts . . . shall be deposited in the employee and retiree benefit risk management fund. In the event the retiree\u2019s monthly allowance is insufficient to cover the certified contribution amount, the retirement system shall so notify the department of administrative services, which shall invoice and collect from the retiree the remaining contribution amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Shortly after the statute\u2019s enactment, the State distributed a notice to all retired state employees who received benefits pursuant to RSA 21-1:30, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">Effective July 1, 2009 legislation was enacted that requires State of New Hampshire retirees and their spouses ... to make a monthly contribution toward the cost of their health care coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">The law directs the New Hampshire Retirement System to deduct $65 per person each month from the retiree\u2019s pension account for each covered retiree and covered spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">The New Hampshire Retirement System will begin taking premium contributions from pension benefits beginning July 31,2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>As of April 2009, an estimated 3,258 retired state employees and spouses under the age of sixty-five received health coverage. Of these retirees, only eight had a monthly allowance insufficient to cover the premium contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In response to this statute\u2019s enactment, the plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action in superior court on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated against the State, the NHRS, and Shapiro. They sought a declaration that RSA 100-A-.54, III is unconstitutional under the Contract Clauses of the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions and Part I, Article 36-a of the New Hampshire Constitution, and to permanently enjoin the NHRS from deducting the health care premiums from their pension benefits. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for class certification, upon which the trial court never ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The court ruled that the plaintiffs have a vested contractual right to receive their full pensions and that RSA 100-A:54, III impairs that right. However, the court determined that the impairment is not substantial, and, accordingly, the impairment does not violate the Federal or State Contract Clauses. The court further found that RSA 100-A:54, III does not violate RSA 100-A:26-a (2001) or Part I, Article 36-a. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs assert that RSA 100-A:54, III violates both Part I, Article 23 and Part I, Article 36-a of the New Hampshire Constitution. They contend that it violates Part I, Article 23 because it impairs: (1) their vested right to receive the full amount of their pension benefits; and (2) their vested contractual rights conferred by RSA 100-A:26-a. They contend that it violates Part I, Article 36-a because it requires the NHRS to deduct funds that it was obligated to send to retirees and instead send them directly to the State to reduce the State\u2019s cost of providing medical insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>N.H. Assoc. of Counties v. State of </em>N.H., 158 N.H. 284, 287-88 (2009) (quotation omitted). The sole issue on appeal is the constitutionality of RSA 100-A:54, III. We review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 288. \u201cThe party challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Tuttle v. N.H. Med. Malpractice Joint Under-writing </em>Assoc., 159 N.H. 627, 640 (2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing a legislative act, we presume it to be constitutional and will not declare it invalid except upon inescapable grounds.\u201d <em>Baines v. N.H. Senate President, </em>152 N.H. 124, 133 (2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn other words, we will not hold a statute to be unconstitutional unless a clear and substantial conflict exists between it and the constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). As such, a statute will not be construed to be unconstitutional when it is susceptible to a construction rendering it constitutional. <em>White v. Lee, </em>124 N.H. 69, 77-78 (1983). \u201cWhen doubts exist as to the constitutionality of a statute, those doubts must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees, N.H. Judicial Ret. Plan v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>161 N.H. 49, 53 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The plaintiffs first contend that RSA 100-A:54, III violates Part I, Article 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution, which provides: \u201cRetrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive, and unjust. No such laws, therefore, should be made ... for the decision of civil causes ...\u201d We have previously defined \u201cretrospective law\u201d as \u201cevery statute, which takes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Furlough), </em>135 N.H. 625, 630 (1992) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\u201cPart I, Article 23 does not expressly reference existing contracts. However, we have held that its proscription duplicates the protections found in the contract clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Tuttle, </em>159 N.H. at 640 (quotation omitted). Although our retrospective law provision provides greater protection than its federal counterpart, we have relied upon federal Contract Clause cases to resolve issues raised under Part I, Article 23 when contract impairment, and not simply retroactive application of a law, was alleged. <em>Id. </em>at 640-41. Accordingly, we understand Section 10 of the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 23 of the State Constitution to afford equivalent protections where a law impairs a contract, or where a law abrogates an earlier statute that is itself a contract. <em>Id. </em>at 641. We will refer to their equivalent protections as the Federal and State Contract Clauses, respectively. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We do not interpret the State Contract Clause \u201cas an absolute bar on the impairment of either governmental or private contractual obligations.\u201d <em>Parker v. Wakelin, </em>123 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997). Rather, there is no State Contract Clause violation unless it is first shown that a contract has been substantially altered. <em>Furlough, </em>135 N.H. at 630-31. \u201cThis inquiry has three components: whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631 (quotation omitted). If we determine that the legislation substantially impairs a contract, \u201ca balancing of the police power and the rights protected by the contract clauses must be performed, and the law may pass constitutional muster only if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.\u201d <em>Tuttle, </em>159 N.H. at 641 (quotation, brackets and ellipses omitted). We do not perform this analysis mechanically because no two cases are alike. <em>Id. </em>at 642. Our core task is to \u201cstrik[e] a balance between constitutionally protected contract rights and the State\u2019s legitimate exercise of its reserved police power.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The plaintiffs contend, and the State concedes \u201cfor purposes of this case only,\u201d that the retirees have a vested right to certain retirement benefits, which are equivalent to contractual obligations. <em>See State Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n of N.H. v. Belknap County, </em>122 N.H. 614, 621 (1982) (\u201c[Retirement] benefits constitute a substantial part of an employee\u2019s compensation and become vested upon the commencement of permanent employee status.\u201d). Accordingly, we must resolve only whether RSA 100-A:54, III substantially impairs the retirees from receiving their full pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The trial court determined that automatically deducting a retiree\u2019s healthcare premium from his retirement allowance impairs a retiree\u2019s right to receive the full amount of his retirement allowance, but that the impairment is not substantial. The State contests whether there is any impairment at all, but we find it unnecessary to resolve this issue because we agree with the trial court that any alleged impairment is not substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the retirees\u2019 right to a pension in the amount specified by law became binding upon hire. Thus, they contend that RSA 100-A:54, III substantially impairs their rights to receive the full pension to which they are entitled because it diverts either $65 or $130 per month from the retirees\u2019 pensions into the State\u2019s coffers. They rely upon <em>Furlough </em>and several other cases that have held that payroll lags and mandatory furloughs substantially impair the employment contracts of state employees. <em>See, e.g., Univ. of Hawaii Professional Assembly v. Cayetano, </em>183 F.3d 1096, 1106 (9th Cir. 1999); <em>Condell v. Bress, </em>983 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir. 1993); <em>Ass\u2019n of Surrogates v. State of N.Y., </em>940 F.2d 766, 772 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>Mass. Community College Council v. Com., </em>649 N.E.2d 708, 712 (Mass. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Unlike the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs, the State here has not in any way reduced its payment obligations to the retirees. For example, in <em>Furlough, </em>we considered a proposal by the legislature to require state employees to take unpaid leave. <em>Furlough, </em>135 N.H. at 628-29. We determined that the proposal \u201cimpair[ed] the very heart of an employment contract: the promise of certain work for certain income. Its impact would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>likely wreak havoc on the finances of many of the affected workers and can only be considered substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Here, unlike the salary reductions in the cases cited by the plaintiffs, RSA 100-A:54, III does not reduce the retirees\u2019 pension. Just as a payroll deduction for health insurance does not reduce an employee\u2019s contractually guaranteed salary, the automatic deduction of healthcare premiums does not decrease the retirees\u2019 pensions. The plaintiffs do not dispute the State\u2019s ability to charge the premium. Thus, regardless of whether the defendants deduct the statutorily authorized healthcare premium from the retirees\u2019 pension or separately bill them for the amount due, they still must pay the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The plaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred because it focused upon whether the premium deduction substantially impairs the retirees\u2019 overall net worth, rather than whether the chosen method of collection substantially impairs the retirees\u2019 right to receive their full pensions. In this ease, as previously stated, RSA 100-A:54, III does not reduce the retirees\u2019 pensions. Moreover, the cases the plaintiffs rely upon all consider whether the <em>reduction </em>in pay would substantially impair the employees\u2019 overall financial situation; we conclude that the trial court did not err in considering the retirees\u2019 overall financial situation here. <em>See Ass\u2019n of Surrogates, </em>940 F.2d at 772 (holding that withholding an amount equal to ten percent of an employee\u2019s pay over a ten-week period could prevent an employee from meeting financial obligations such as mortgages, loans and credit card payments).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">We also note that the medical and surgical benefits under RSA 21-1:30 are voluntary and the plaintiffs do not contend that retirees are unaware that they may decline coverage. The plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument that the crux of this dispute is not whether the State may charge retirees a premium toward their healthcare, but how the State can collect that premium. Given that the retirees who are covered must pay the premium in one manner or another, we cannot say that any alleged alteration of contractual obligations is anything other than minimal. <em>See Tuttle, </em>159 N.H. at 649 (explaining that \u201c[m]inimal alteration of contractual obligations may end the inquiry\u201d of whether a substantial impairment has occurred (quotation omitted)). Accordingly, because the calculation of each retiree\u2019s pension remains unchanged, the deduction does not substantially impair their vested right to receive a full pension. <em>See Lippman v. Board of Educ. of Sewanhaka, </em>487 N.E.2d 897, 900 (N.Y. 1985) (\u201cThe result of a reduction in the proportion of the health insurance premium paid... is that a retiree will receive a smaller retirement check, but this is no more a change in retirement benefits than would be an increase in the price of eggs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>at the supermarket or in a retiree\u2019s apartment rent. The retiree has less to spend, but there has been no change in his <em>retirement benefit.\u201d). </em>Because we have determined that the automatic premium deduction does not substantially impair the retirees\u2019 vested rights to a full pension, we need not consider whether the deduction is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The plaintiffs next argue that RSA 100-A:54, III violates the Contract Clauses of the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions because it impairs the retirees\u2019 right to the anti-alienation protections provided by RSA 100-A:26-a. The plaintiffs contend that RSA 100-A:26-a acts as an anti-alienation statute that only allows for the assignment, attachment and execution of the retirees\u2019 benefits to the extent allowed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The plaintiffs argue that RSA 100-A:26-a was incorporated as a term of the retirees\u2019 contract with the NHRS, and because ERISA does not permit the alienation authorized by RSA 100-A:54, III, that statute impermissibly impairs their contract with the NHRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The defendants contend that RSA 100-A:26-a is not an anti-alienation statute, but rather a statute intended as an exception to RSA 100-A:26 (2001) by providing specific circumstances under which the retirees\u2019 benefits may be subject to assignment, attachment and execution. The defendants argue that RSA 100-A:54, III merely provides an additional circumstance under which the retirees\u2019 benefits may be subject to assignment, attachment and execution, and is therefore consistent with RSA 100-A:26 and 100-A:26-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Resolution of this issue requires that we engage in statutory interpretation. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Zorn v. Demetri, </em>158 N.H. 437, 438 (2009). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>LLK Trust v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>159 N.H. 734, 736 (2010). We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>We construe all parts of a statute together to effectuate its overall purpose and avoid an absurd or unjust result. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole. <em>Id. </em>This enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We begin by examining the language of RSA 100-A:26, the anti-alienation statute, which the plaintiffs claim was effectively replaced by RSA 100-A:26-a. RSA 100-A:26 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">The right of a person to any benefit or to any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this chapter, and the monies in the funds created hereby, shall be exempted from any state, county or municipal tax in the state, and shall not be subject to execution, trustee process, attachment or any other process whatsoever, legal or equitable, and shall be unassignable <em>except as herein specifically provided.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Thus, unless the legislature specifically provides for an exception, RSA 100-A:26 prohibits any alienation of the retirees\u2019 benefits. In <em>Fowler v. Fowler, </em>116 N.H. 446 (1976), we rejected a wife\u2019s attempt to attach the husband\u2019s retirement benefits <em>for </em>the support <em>of </em>his minor children by court order because the plain language of RSA 100-A:26 did not allow the court to carve out exceptions to the anti-alienation statute not specifically provided for by the legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 449. In the wake of <em>Fowler, </em>the legislature passed RSA 100-A:26-a in order to specifically provide certain exceptions to the anti-alienation statute. <em>See </em>Laws 1977, ch. 465 (\u201cAn act... relative to the assignment, attachment and execution of benefits under the New Hampshire and Policemen\u2019s Retirement Systems.\u201d). RSA 100-A:26-a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the right of a person to any benefit or to any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this chapter, and the monies in the funds created hereby shall be subject to assignment, attachment and execution to the same extent as such rights under private retirement systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Private retirement systems are governed by ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2008). According to the plain language of RSA 100-A:26-a, if a retiree\u2019s benefits would be subject to assignment, attachment or execution under ERISA, those benefits are subject to assignment, attachment and execution under New Hampshire law. RSA 100-A:26-a simply provides for specific exceptions to the anti-alienation provisions of RSA 100-A:26. Thus, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that RSA 100-A:26-a is an anti-alienation statute which was meant to replace RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>100-A:26. There is nothing in the plain language of RSA 100-A:26-a that prohibits the legislature from adding additional exceptions to RSA 100-A:26.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">RSA 100-A:54, III is another exception to the anti-alienation statute specifically provided for by the legislature. The statute directs the retirement system to deduct from the monthly retirement allowance of retired state employees under the age of sixty-five a premium contribution for those retirees receiving state health benefits. Because RSA 100-A:26 specifically authorizes the legislature to provide for exceptions, RSA 100-A:54, III is consistent with that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Additionally, because we have determined that RSA 100-A:54, III does not impair or conflict with any rights provided by RSA 100-A:26-a, we need not resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that RSA 100-A:26-a is \u201ca term of the contract between the State and Retirees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In sum, RSA 100-A:26 stands as an anti-alienation statute with regard to the retirement benefits of retirees in this state. These benefits are not subject to assignment, attachment or execution except as specifically provided by the legislature. RSA 100-A:26-a specifically provides for exceptions to the anti-alienation statute and ties these exceptions to those permitted under ERISA. None of the exceptions provided in RSA 100-A:26-a are implicated in this case, and thus that statute is inapplicable here. RSA 100-A:54, III is simply another exception to the anti-alienation statute specifically provided for by the legislature. The plain language of RSA 100-A:26, RSA 100-A:26-a, and RSA 100-A:54, III demonstrates no conflict among them. Because RSA 100-A:54, III is consistent with the anti-alienation statute, it does not impair the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the anti-alienation protections and thus does not violate the Contract Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that RSA 100-A:54, III contravenes Part I, Article 36-a of the New Hampshire Constitution, which provides in pertinent part that \u201call contributions and payments made to [the New Hampshire retirement system] to provide for retirement and related benefits shall be held, invested or disbursed as in trust for the exclusive purpose of providing for such benefits and shall not be encumbered for, or diverted to, any other purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">When our inquiry requires us to interpret a provision of the constitution, we must look to its purpose and intent. <em>Warburton v. Thomas, </em>136 N.H. 383, 386-87 (1992). We first look to the natural significance of the words used by the framers. <em>Judicial Ret. Plan, </em>161 N.H. at 53. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>simplest and most obvious interpretation of a constitution, if in itself sensible, is most likely to be that meant by the people in its adoption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Additionally, \u201cwe will give the words in question the meaning they must be presumed to have had to the electorate when the vote was cast.\u201d <em>N.H. Mimic. Trust Workers\u2019 Comp. Fund v. Flynn, Comm\u2019r, </em>133 N.H. 17, 21 (1990) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The plaintiffs contend that RSA 100-A:54, III violates Article 36-a because it causes the diversion of the retirees\u2019 pension funds to pay for their healthcare expenses. However, we have already determined that the retirees receive the full value of their pensions. Because the health insurance premiums do not decrease the retirees\u2019 pensions, we find that there is no diversion of the retirees\u2019 pension funds under RSA 100-A:54, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In <em>Judicial Retirement Plan, </em>we recognized that the purpose of Article 36-a was \u201cto ensure that the State cannot use retirement system assets to fund other State operations.\u201d <em>Judicial Ret. Plan, </em>161 N.H. at 56. Here, the retirement system assets are being used to pay the benefits to each retiree, and not to fund other State operations. The retirement system then deducts the premium contribution from the allowance of each individual retiree. Thus, each retiree receives the full allowance of the retirement benefit from the retirement system assets, from which the retirement system deducts the premium contribution. The state health benefits are optional and are only deducted from those retirees opting to receive them. Should any retiree opt out of the benefit, the deductions would cease for that individual retiree. Because there is no diversion of the pension funds under RSA 100-A:54, III and the retirement system assets are not being used to fund other State operations, we find no violation of Article 36-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
