Robert Smyjunas, Jr., appeals the jury verdict against him in favor of the plaintiff, J &amp; M Lumber and Construction Company, Inc. (J <em>&amp; </em>M), and J &amp; M appeals the decision of the Superior Court <em>(Vaughan, </em>J.) to award prejudgment interest from the date of J &amp; M\u2019s 2008 writ of summons. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">The record reveals the following facts. In 2000, J &amp; M brought an equity action against Gorham Supermarket, LLC (Gorham Supermarket), among others, to enforce J &amp; M\u2019s easement rights associated with land in Gorham. In a 2003 order, the superior court, in addition to other rulings, ordered Gorham Supermarket to pay J &amp; M\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Gorham Supermarket appealed, and in a 2004 order, we upheld the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See J and M Lumber and Construction Company, Inc. v. Gorham Supermarket LLC &amp; a., </em>No. 2003-0644 (N.H. Aug. 4, 2004). In 2005, the trial court calculated the total amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs owed J &amp; M to be $110,007.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">In 2008, J <em>&amp; </em>M brought the instant action against Smyjunas, Gorham Supermarket, Bitsy Realty, Inc. (Bitsy Realty) and Tolle Road Partners, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Inc. (Tolle Road), seeking to collect the 2005 attorney\u2019s fees and costs award. J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s writ alleged that Gorham Supermarket had not paid any of J &amp; M\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs, despite the court order to do so, and that, in fact, Gorham Supermarket had been improperly dissolved and its assets depleted to avoid liability. The writ alleged that Bitsy Realty and Tolle Road were the sole members of Gorham Supermarket, which is a limited liability company, and that Smyjunas was the sole owner of both Bitsy Realty and Tolle Road. It also alleged that Smyjunas, Bitsy Realty and/or Tolle Road improperly liquidated and received Gorham Supermarket\u2019s assets, leaving Gorham Supermarket without sufficient assets to pay its debt to J &amp; M.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The case was tried to a jury. Before the trial concluded, J &amp; M voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its claims against Gorham Supermarket, Bitsy Realty and Tolle Road. As a result, Smyjunas became the only defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s claims against Smyjunas were: (1) piercing the corporate veil; (2) improper wind up of a limited liability company; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. The jury issued a general verdict in J &amp; M\u2019s favor, awarding J &amp; M $110,007.01. Thereafter, J &amp; M filed a motion for prejudgment interest dating either from its 2000 equity action or the trial court\u2019s 2005 orders requiring Gorham Supermarket to pay J &amp; M $110,007.01 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The trial court awarded J &amp; M prejudgment interest running only from the date of its 2008 writ. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\n<em>II. Smyjunas\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">A <em>Timeliness of Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Smyjunas first argues that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss J &amp; M\u2019s claims for improper dissolution and unjust enrichment because, he argues, both claims are time-barred. Under RSA 508:4,1 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">[A]ll personal actions, except actions for slander or libel, may be brought only within 3 years of the act or omission complained of, except that when the injury and its causal relationship to the act or omission were not discovered and could not reasonably have been discovered at the time of the act or omission, the action shall be commenced within 3 years of the time the plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury and its causal relationship to the act or omission complained of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Smyjunas contends that J &amp;M\u2019s improper dissolution claim is untimely because when J <em>&amp; </em>M deposed him in January 2002, it knew or should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>known that he had improperly dissolved Gorham Supermarket. He argues that J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s unjust enrichment claim similarly is untimely because, as of his January 2002 deposition, J &amp; M knew or should have known that he had allegedly received Gorham Supermarket\u2019s assets unjustly. Thus, he reasons, J &amp; M should have filed its suit within three years of January 2002 to be timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"> These arguments presume that J &amp; M would have had standing to assert its improper dissolution and unjust enrichment claims in January 2002, three years before the trial court had even calculated the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs that Gorham Supermarket owed J &amp; M. For a party to have standing, the party must have suffered a legal injury. <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>158 N.H. 194, 195 (2008). J &amp; M did not suffer an injury from the allegedly improper dissolution of Gorham Supermarket or Smyjunas\u2019s alleged unjust enrichment in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Smyjunas\u2019s reliance upon the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to support his arguments is to no avail. The discovery rule allows a plaintiff to commence an action within three years \u201cof the time the plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury and its causal relationship to the act or omission complained of.\u201d RSA 508:4,1. The rule has two prongs that must be satisfied: \u201cFirst, a plaintiff must know or reasonably should have known that it has been injured; and second, a plaintiff must know or reasonably should have known that its injury was proximately caused by conduct of the defendant.\u201d <em>Beane v. Dana S. Beane &amp; Co., </em>160 N.H. 708, 713 (2010) (quotation omitted). Here, there was <em>no </em>injury for J &amp; M to discover in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Smyjunas next asserts that J &amp; M\u2019s unjust enrichment claim is barred by laches because J <em>&amp; </em>M \u201csat on its rights for more than six years\u201d after his 2002 deposition \u201cbefore filing suit\u201d on this claim. He has failed to provide a record, however, demonstrating that he preserved this claim for our review by arguing laches in the trial court. Accordingly, we decline to address it. <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">\n<em>B. Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Smyjunas next argues that the trial court erred when it granted J &amp; M\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude him from relitigating whether he had notice of J &amp; M\u2019s claim regarding its easement when Gorham Supermarket owned the subject property (1997-1998) and before Gorham Supermarket was dissolved in 2001. The trial court ruled that Smyjunas was collaterally estopped from relitigating this fact because it had been fully litigated and decided in J &amp; M\u2019s original suit against Gorham Supermarket. Smyjunas also argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that, \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Court has already found and ruled that [Smyjunas] had notice of [J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s] easement over the property that was developed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred when it granted J &amp; M\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and gave the contested jury instruction. We apply a two-step analysis to determine whether to reverse a jury verdict in a civil case based upon an erroneous jury instruction. <em>Rallis v. Demoulas Super Markets, </em>159 N.H. 95, 98 (2009). First, the appealing party must show that it was a substantial error such that it could have misled the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Id. </em>at 98-99. Second, if we conclude that the error was a substantial one, we will reverse the jury verdict unless the opposing party shows that the error did not affect the outcome at trial; in other words, the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 99. Here, we do not reverse because we conclude that the alleged error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s collateral estoppel ruling, Smyjunas did not dispute that he knew of J &amp; M\u2019s easement before construction began. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">Q. Now, you will notice in the deed to you \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">Q. \u2014 by which you bought the property, there is reference to the right of way, isn\u2019t there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">A. Oh, yes. Yes, there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">Q. And all of your engineering diagrams showed that right of way, did they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">A. Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">Q. And during the course of that investigation [of the status of the property], you must have learned about this J &amp; M Lumber easement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">A. We \u2014 yes, we learned about that. We had \u2014 we learned about it in the title review. We learned about it in the deeds that we looked at in the very beginning. We looked \u2014 so it was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was fairly well known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">Additionally, J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s owner, Marcel Nadeau, testified that he called Smyjunas \u201ctwice to make him aware that [Nadeau] had a right of way going through that land.\u201d He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Q. You said that in 1997 you called Mr. Smyjunas twice \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">Q. \u2014 to tell him about the easement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">Q. And did you actually speak with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">A. I talked to him personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">Q. And what did you tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">A. I told him that I had a right of way, you know, going through that land that he had \u2014 that he had purchased...; that I wanted to protect my right of way because I was going to make use of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-12\">Q. And when was the next time you spoke with Mr. Smyjunas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-13\">A. I spoke to him after he had started his site work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-14\">Q. And what did you tell him then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-15\">A. I told him that they started the thing, and I said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s a deeded right of way, it\u2019s a right of way of record,\u201d and I says [sic], \u201cI want to preserve it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">On this record, we conclude that a reasonable juror could not have found anything other than that Smyjunas had notice of J &amp; M\u2019s easement over the property. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\u2019s instruction to that effect did not affect the outcome at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">\n<em>C. 1998 Account Transcript</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-18\">Smyjunas next contends that the trial court erred when it allowed J &amp; M, over his objection, to admit evidence of his 1998 account transcript from the Internal Revenue Service. This account transcript showed that for the year 1998, the joint gross income for Smyjunas and his wife was $2,018,515. Smyjunas\u2019s 1999 account transcript, which was also admitted into evidence, showed that in 1999, he and his wife had gross income of $362,611.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-19\">Smyjunas asserts that it was error to admit evidence of his 1998 account transcript because it \u201chad no probative value whatsoever\u201d and caused him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d He argues that \u201c[i]t is entirely probabl[e] that a juror could have improperly factored in the seemingly very high income earned by... Smyjunas and his wife in 1998 to determine that he was able, and therefore should, pay [J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s] judgment individually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The admissibility of evidence is generally within the discretion of the trial court, and we will uphold its rulings unless the exercise of its discretion is unsustainable. <em>N.H. Ball Bearings v. Jackson, </em>158 N.H. 421, 431 (2009). To be admissible, evidence must be relevant. <em>Id. </em>Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 403. \u201cA trial judge is granted broad discretion when balancing the probative value of evidence against the possible prejudice resulting from its admission.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Fisher Eng\u2019g, </em>150 N.H. 195, 199 (2003) (quotation and brackets omitted). Accordingly, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the 1998 account transcript unless Smyjunas demonstrates that this decision was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We hold that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion when it allowed J &amp; M to admit evidence of Smyjunas\u2019s 1998 account transcript. The trial court reasonably found that this evidence had a \u201ctendency\u201d to prove a fact that was <em>\u201cof </em>consequence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. Specifically, Smyjunas\u2019s 1998 account transcript had a tendency to show that Gorham Supermarket substantially depleted its assets soon after J &amp; M notified Smyjunas in 1997 about its easement claim. This fact, if proved, was, in turn, central to J &amp; M\u2019s piercing the corporate veil claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The trial court also reasonably determined that the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice from its admission. \u201cEvidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.\u201d <em>Zola v. Kelley, </em>149 N.H. 648, 655 (2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Here, contrary to Smyjunas\u2019s suggestion, the primary purpose for admitting the evidence or the effect of its admission was not to provoke the jury\u2019s instinct to punish, but rather to establish one of the central issues of the case \u2014 that he depleted the assets of the corporate entities despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>having notice of J &amp; M\u2019s claim. In this context, evidence of Smyjunas\u2019s finances during the years in question was highly probative. While admission of the 1998 account transcript arguably was prejudicial, we conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Therefore, the trial court did not err by admitting Smyjunas\u2019s 1998 account transcript into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">\n<em>D. Expert Witness Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Smyjunas next argues that the trial court erred when it partially denied his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude J &amp; M\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony. On December 31,2008, J &amp; M disclosed Richard J. Brauel, Jr., CPA, as an expert witness, stating that he had been asked to review the financial condition of Gorham Supermarket and the other corporate entities, including, but not limited to, the assets these entities owned before they were dissolved and the distribution of same. On March 17, 2010, J &amp; M supplemented this disclosure, explaining that its expert would also testify \u201cregarding the process of, generally accepted practices associated with[,] and the requirements in New Hampshire for winding up New Hampshire limited liability companies... and [would give his opinion that Smyjunas] did not follow the usual process, generally accepted practices and the related requirements.\u201d The supplemental disclosure further informed Smyjunas that the expert was \u201cexpected to testify [that Smyjunas] failed to account and provide for [J &amp; M\u2019s] claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">On March 18, 2010, Smyjunas filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony with respect to both disclosures. Smyjunas argued that the first disclosure failed to provide specifics and \u201cdid not remotely comply with the provisions of RSA 516:29-b.\u201d He contended that the second disclosure \u201cappear[ed] to exceed [the] scope of opinions \u2018disclosed\u2019 in the first disclosure,\u201d and that it was untimely. He also argued that because he had no \u201cmeaningful opportunity to respond to the . . . second . . . expert disclosure,\u201d allowing the expert to give the opinions disclosed therein \u201cwould be extremely unfair\u201d and cause him \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The trial court granted Smyjunas\u2019s motion as it pertained to the second disclosure, but denied it as it pertained to J &amp; M\u2019s initial disclosure. Smyjunas argues that this was error. He asserts that because the first disclosure did not comply with RSA 516:29-b (2007), the trial court should have precluded the expert\u2019s testimony altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">RSA 516:29-b, II requires parties in civil cases to disclose to their opponents any expert witness and, unless the parties so stipulate or the court orders otherwise, to provide for each such witness a written report that includes certain specific information. <em>In re Nicholas L., </em>158 N.H. 700, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>702 (2009). Because the parties do not argue otherwise, we will assume that the trial court did not vary the requirements set forth in RSA 516:29-b, II. <em>Milliken v. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic, </em>154 N.H. 662, 670 (2006); <em>see </em>RSA 516:29-b, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Additionally, RSA 516:29-b does not provide for any particular sanction for a party\u2019s failure to comply with its mandates. In his brief, Smyjunas appears to assume that our case law regarding the discovery obligations of civil litigants under superior court rules applies to RSA 516:29-b. <em>See </em>SUPER. Ct. R. 35(f). We make the same assumption for the purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Under our case law interpreting superior court rules, \u201c[a] party is entitled to disclosure of an opposing party\u2019s experts, the substance of the facts and opinions about which they are expected to testify, and the basis of those opinions.\u201d <em>Laramie v. Stone, </em>160 N.H. 419, 425 (2010) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cA party\u2019s failure to supply this information should result in the exclusion of expert opinion testimony unless good cause is shown to excuse the failure to disclose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see </em>SUPER. CT. R. Preface. The trial court has broad discretion in the management of discovery, and its decisions will be reviewed under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>Laramie, </em>160 N.H. at 425. \u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s decision was not sustainable, the appealing party must show that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Smyjunas has failed to meet this burden. While he asserts that he \u201chad no notice of the underlying opinions or substance of the expert testimony,\u201d the record does not support that assertion. At the hearing on his motion <em>in limine, </em>his attorney stated that, after receiving the first disclosure, Smyjunas understood that J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s expert was going to review financial records of the corporate entities \u201cand offer opinions related thereto.\u201d Also, at the hearing, it was revealed that Smyjunas conducted no expert witness discovery, even though J <em>&amp; </em>M first disclosed its expert and the subjects about which he was expected to testify more than a year before trial. Given this record, Smyjunas has failed to demonstrate that the first disclosure\u2019s lack of specifics caused him any prejudice, and, thus, has failed to show that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the expert to testify about the corporate financial records that he reviewed was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\n<em>E. Breach of Implied Covenant Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Finally, Smyjunas contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss J &amp; M\u2019s breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>dealing claim. In reviewing a motion to dismiss, our standard of review is whether the allegations in the plaintiffs pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. <em>Gen. Insulation Co. v. Eckman Constr., </em>159 N.H. 601, 611 (2010). We assume the plaintiffs pleadings to be true and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to it. <em>Id. </em>We need not assume the truth of statements in the plaintiffs pleadings, however, that are merely conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>We then engage in a threshold inquiry that tests the facts in the writ against the applicable law. <em>Id. </em>Dismissal is warranted if the writ\u2019s allegations do not constitute a basis for legal relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Smyjunas argues that J &amp; M has failed to plead a claim for breach of the implied covenant or duty of good faith and fair dealing because it has not alleged that it had a contractual relationship with any of the defendants. Smyjunas contends that, without a contractual relationship between the parties, there is no cause of action for breach of the implied covenant or duty of good faith and fair dealing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">\u201c[A]n obligation of good faith is imposed by statute in the performance and enforcement of every contract or duty subject to the Uniform Commercial Code.\u201d <em>Centronics Corp. v. Genicom Corp., </em>132 N.H. 133, 138 (1989); <em>see </em>RSA 382-A:l-201(20), :1-304 (Supp. 2010). Additionally, New Hampshire recognizes a common law \u201cgood faith contractual obligation.\u201d <em>Centronics Corp., </em>132 N.H. at 139. There is \u201cnot merely one rule of implied good faith duty in New Hampshire\u2019s law of contract, but a series of doctrines, each of them speaking in terms of an obligation of good faith but serving markedly different functions.\u201d <em>Id.; see Birch Broad, v. Capitol Broad. Corp., </em>161 N.H. 192, 198 (2010). The various implied good-faith obligations fall into three general categories: (1) contract formation; (2) termination of at-will employment agreements; and (3) limitation of discretion in contractual performance. <em>Livingston v. 18 Mile Point Drive, </em>158 N.H. 619, 624 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">New Hampshire law has not recognized a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing outside of the contractual context. J <em>&amp; </em>M urges us to acknowledge that parties to \u201cbusiness dealings\u201d generally have an obligation to deal with one another fairly and in good faith and to recognize a claim for breach of this general obligation. J &amp; M does not contend that this claim is recognized in any other jurisdiction and cites scant legal authority to support recognizing such a claim. Under these circumstances, we decline J &amp; M\u2019s invitation to create such a new cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">J &amp; M mistakenly asserts that we have already recognized a similar cause of action in the employment-at-will context. When employment is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>will, J <em>&amp; </em>M argues, \u201cno contract exists, but an employer nonetheless has an obligation to act in good faith and deal fairly with employees.\u201d This argument misconstrues New Hampshire law.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Employment at will refers to an employment <em>contract </em>that is for an indefinite period of time and is terminable at will. <em>See Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., </em>114 N.H. 130, 132, 133 (1974). In <em>Monge, </em>we held \u201cthat a termination by the employer of a contract of employment at will which is motivated by bad faith or malice or based on retaliation is not in the best interest of the economic system or the public good and constitutes a breach of the employment contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133. \u201cThe rationale underlying <em>Monge </em>is that there is an implied covenant in every contractual relationship that the parties will carry out their obligations in good faith.\u201d <em>Cloutier v. A &amp; P Tea Co., Inc., </em>121 N.H. 915, 920 (1981). Accordingly, the covenant of good faith to which we referred in <em>Monge </em>is a not a free-standing obligation that employers have to treat their employees fairly, but is an obligation implied into an employment contract that otherwise would be terminable at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Smyjunas argues that because the jury in this case returned a general verdict, the remedy for the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss J &amp; M\u2019s breach of implied covenant claim is to reverse and remand for a new trial. <em>See MacKenzie v. Linehan, </em>158 N.H. 476, 483 (2009). The rule in New Hampshire with respect to general verdicts is that when we are in doubt as to whether the jury would have found as it did if the error had not been committed, the case should be reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 484. Although Smyjunas states this general rule, he does not demonstrate why it is doubtful that the jury would have returned the same verdict had the breach of implied covenant claim been dismissed, and we fail to see why we should entertain such doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">To determine whether the jury would have returned the same verdict without the implied covenant claim, we examine whether it would have been reasonably possible for this to be the <em>only </em>claim for which the jury found Smyjunas liable. If so, then we would doubt whether the jury would have returned the same verdict if the implied covenant claim had been dismissed. If, on the other hand, the jury could not reasonably have found Smyjunas liable for the implied covenant claim alone without also finding him liable for another claim, then we would not doubt whether the jury would have still returned a verdict for J <em>&amp; </em>M if the implied covenant claim had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Based upon our review of the jury instructions, we conclude that it would not reasonably have been possible for the jury to find Smyjunas liable on the breach of implied covenant claim without also finding him liable on the unjust enrichment claim. The jury was instructed that to find for J &amp; M on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>its breach of implied covenant claim, it had to find that Smyjunas \u201ccommitted a wrongful act.\u201d The jury was also instructed that the specific wrongful act of which Smyjunas was accused was of distributing the assets of Gorham Supermarket without accounting for J &amp; M\u2019s claim and knowing that J &amp; M had a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The same wrongful act forms the basis of J &amp; M\u2019s unjust enrichment claim. The jury was instructed that to find in J &amp; M\u2019s favor on its unjust enrichment claim it had to find that Smyjunas \u201ccommitted a wrongful act\u201d and that the wrongful act of which he was accused was \u201cthe distribution of money when [he] should have reasonably known that J <em>&amp; </em>M... had a claim that was likely to lead to the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Because the same wrongful act forms the basis of both claims, if the jury found in J &amp; M\u2019s favor on its implied covenant claim, the jury would have also found in J &amp; M\u2019s favor on its unjust enrichment claim. Moreover, the damages J &amp; M sought were the same for <em>all </em>of its claims. The jury was instructed that \u201cthe damages [J &amp; M] seeks are fees and costs in the amount of $110,007.01.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Because it is clear that if the jury found for J &amp; M on the implied covenant claim, the jury would also have found for J &amp; M on the unjust enrichment claim, and because J &amp; M sought the same damages for both claims, we have no doubt that had the implied covenant claim been dismissed, the jury would have returned the same verdict. Accordingly, although we hold that the trial court erred when it failed to dismiss J &amp; M\u2019s breach of implied covenant claim, this error does not require us to reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\n<em>III. J &amp; M\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We next address J <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s appeal, which concerns the trial court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest. After the jury verdict was returned, J &amp; M filed a motion for statutory prejudgment interest calculated from the date on which it filed its first action (August 3,2000) or, alternatively, for statutory post-judgment interest calculated from the dates of the trial court\u2019s 2005 orders awarding it attorney\u2019s fees and costs (August 8,2005, and November 14,2005). <em>See </em>RSA524:l-a, :l-b (2007); <em>see also Nault v. N &amp; L Dev. Co., </em>146 N.H. 35, 37, 39 (2001) (explaining that both pre- and post-judgment interest are available under RSA 524:l-a and RSA 524:l-b). The trial court awarded J &amp; M prejudgment interest from the date of its 2008 writ against Smyjunas. J &amp; M argues that the trial court erred by failing to award it prejudgment interest from 2000 or post-judgment interest from 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Resolving this issue requires that we engage in statutory interpretation. We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Estate of Gordon-Couture v. Brown, </em>152 N.H. 265, 266 (2005). We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We first address the interest available as a result of J &amp; M\u2019s 2000 action and 2005 judgments. J <em>&amp; </em>M argues that RSA 524:l-b governs its entitlement to interest for its 2000 action and 2005 judgments. RSA 524:l-b provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">In all other civil proceedings at law or in equity in which a verdict is rendered or a finding is made for pecuniary damages to any party, whether for personal injuries, for wrongful death, for consequential damages, for damage to property, business or reputation, for any other type of loss for which damages are recognized, there shall be added forthwith by the clerk of court to the amount of damages interest thereon from the date of the writ or the filing of the petition to the date of judgment even though such interest brings the amount of the judgment beyond the maximum liability imposed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">J &amp; M\u2019s 2000 action was for injunctive relief for which the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs. For the purposes of this discussion, because no party argues otherwise, we will assume without deciding that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded J <em>&amp; </em>M in its first action constituted \u201cpecuniary damages ... for... [a] loss for which damages are recognized,\u201d and, therefore, that RSA 524:1-b governs the statutory interest available as a result of J &amp; M\u2019s 2000 action and 2005 judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">J <em>&amp; </em>M asserts, in effect, that when the trial court issued its orders in 2005, interest was imposed automatically, by operation of law, from the date of J &amp; M\u2019s 2000 writ against Gorham Supermarket until the date of payment. Smyjunas counters that in the context of J &amp; M\u2019s case against him, the amount of the 2005 judgments, including any pre- or post-judgment interest, were elements of damages for J &amp; M to prove. He argues, \u201cif [J <em>&amp; </em>M] believed it was legally entitled to interest on [the 2005 judgments] per RSA 524:1-a, RSA 524:1-b or the common law, it was incumbent upon J <em>&amp; </em>M to submit that claim to the jury.\u201d Here, he observes, J &amp; M did not ask the jury for more than the amount of the 2005 judgments themselves ($110,007.01). He contends that any award of statutory interest on the 2005 judgments would improperly augment J &amp; M\u2019s damages post-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We agree with Smyjunas that, in the context of this case, the amount of the 2005 judgments, including any pre- or post-judgment interest, were elements of damages for J &amp; M to plead and prove. We further conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>that because J &amp; M did neither, J &amp; M is not entitled to pre-judgment interest from the date of its 2000 writ or to post-judgment interest from the date of the court\u2019s 2005 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The instant case is similar to <em>Carbone v. Tierney, </em>151 N.H. 521, 535-36 (2004), in which we held that the interest that would have been awarded to the plaintiff had his attorney filed a successful lawsuit against his son and daughter-in-law was an element of damages to be proved. The plaintiff in <em>Carbone </em>hired the defendant to sue his son and daughter-in-law for the loss of his home and laboratory equipment. <em>See Carbone, </em>151 N.H. at 523-24, 536. The defendant filed numerous lawsuits on the plaintiffs behalf, which were all dismissed because of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with various court procedures. <em>See id. </em>at 524-26. Eventually, the plaintiff sued the defendant for legal malpractice, and received a jury verdict in his favor. <em>Id. </em>at 526. The trial court subsequently ordered interest to be added to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 526-27; <em>see </em>RSA 524:1-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The plaintiff also asked the trial court to award interest on the judgment that he would have received had the defendant filed a successful suit against his son and daughter-in-law. <em>Id. </em>at 536. The trial court declined, ruling that the plaintiff had failed to plead or prove his entitlement to such interest as an element of his damages. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed, concluding that how much interest the plaintiff would have obtained had the defendant filed a successful suit required resolving numerous factual issues, \u201cincluding when and where [the plaintiff] would have obtained [such] a judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the plaintiff did not present any evidence to the jury, which would have allowed it to decide these factual issues, we ruled that the trial court correctly denied his motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Like the plaintiff in <em>Carbone, </em>J &amp; M failed to plead and prove its entitlement to pre- and post-judgment interest relative to its 2000 writ against Gorham Supermarket. J &amp; M did not present any evidence to the jury of its entitlement to interest on the 2005 judgments. The jury was instructed that J &amp; M was awarded money in two orders, one dated August 8, 2005, and the other dated November 14, 2005, and was asked to decide the amount of damages to award J &amp; M because of Gorham Supermarket\u2019s failure to abide by those orders. Because the jury was required to determine the amount of J &amp; M\u2019s damages, and because J <em>&amp; </em>M presented no evidence relating to interest, we conclude that the trial court in this case correctly denied J &amp; M\u2019s request for pre-judgment interest from 2000 and for post-judgment interest from 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">We next address the interest available as a result of J &amp; M\u2019s 2008 action. J <em>&amp; </em>M argues that its 2008 writ was an action on a debt and that RSA 524:l-a therefore applies. RSA 524:l-a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>In the absence of a demand prior to the institution of suit, in any action on a debt or account stated or where liquidated damages are sought, interest shall commence to run from the time of the institution of suit. This statute shall be inapplicable where the party to be charged pays the money into court in accordance with the rules of the superior court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">For the purposes of this discussion, we will assume that J &amp; M\u2019s 2008 writ was an \u201caction on a debt or account stated or where liquidated damages [were] sought.\u201d RSA 524:l-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">J &amp; M asserts that because it \u201cmade a demand for payment of the 2005 Orders (the debt) shortly after the 2005 Orders were made,\u201d it is entitled to interest under RSA 524:l-a from the date of its 2005 demand. Under RSA 524:1-a, if a demand has been made before suit, interest accrues from the time of the demand; if no demand has been made, it accrues \u201cfrom the time of the institution of suit.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Ward, </em>129 N.H. 4, 12 (1986). Here, although J &amp; M asserts in its brief that it made a demand for payment shortly after the trial court\u2019s 2005 orders, nothing in the record on appeal demonstrates that such a demand was made. Accordingly, we cannot disturb the trial court\u2019s implied finding that J &amp; M did not make a demand before instituting suit, and, therefore, that interest was available only from the date on which J &amp; M initiated the current lawsuit, and not from the date of its alleged 2005 demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">For all of the above reasons, therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to award J &amp; M prejudgment interest from the date of its 2008 writ against Smyjunas. We have reviewed J &amp; M\u2019s remaining arguments and hold that they lack merit and warrant no extended consideration. <em>Vogel v.
