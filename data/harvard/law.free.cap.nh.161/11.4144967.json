We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The relevant facts follow. The parties were married in 2007. On June 25, 2009, the plaintiff filed a domestic violence petition against the defendant. In response to the pre-printed statement on the petition form that \u201cI am in immediate danger of abuse by the defendant. I base my request for protection from abuse on the following facts that occurred on the following dates, and ask the court to issue orders as noted below[,]\u201d the plaintiff alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">I was punched in my stomach and leg. Then I was choked and thrown to the floor[.] [H]e also threatened to drown [] me in the bath tub. He has punched close fisted me in the face and choked me until I have passed out.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">On many occasions my husband has hit me[,] choked me and thrown me to the floor. On three occasions[,] he has threatened my life. As for verbal abuse[,] it is normally you are homely ugly why can\u2019t I look like I did when I was thirty. My husband needs medical attention as he has clinical depression. But he refuses to go for help. He had a stay in Elliot hospital in Manchester[.] He was diagnosed as Suicidal [and] Homicidal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">(Emphasis omitted.) The plaintiff did not specify the dates of the alleged abuse. The court issued an <em>ex parte </em>domestic violence temporary order of protection and scheduled a final hearing for July 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">On July 6,2009, the defendant filed a motion seeking to continue the July 16 hearing and consolidate it with his petition for legal separation. The plaintiff objected. On July 14, 2009, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Motion denied in light of the Plaintiffs representation that the Defendant violated the Temporary Order and has been diagnosed as \u201csuicidal and homicidal.\u201d Although the Court makes no conclusions about the accuracy of the representation, it is a cause of concern sufficient for the Court to require that the hearing go forward as scheduled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">At the ensuing hearing on the domestic violence petition, <em>see </em>RSA 173-B:3, VII (Supp. 2009), the defendant did not appear, but he was represented by his attorney. His attorney requested reconsideration of the motion to continue. The trial court denied his request, noting its concern \u201cabout the new allegations\u201d in the plaintiffs objection. The defendant\u2019s attorney then argued that the plaintiff\u2019s petition was \u201clegally insufficient as a matter of law\u201d because it did not plead with sufficient specificity when the alleged abuse occurred. <em>See Tosta v. Bullis, </em>156 N.H. 763, 767 (2008); <em>Fillmore v. Fillmore, </em>147 N.H. 283, 286 (2001). Therefore, he contended, the final hearing should not \u201cgo forward.\u201d Without explicitly ruling on this argument, the court continued with the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The plaintiff testified, without objection, to the alleged abuse. She said that on June 16, 2009, the defendant grabbed her by her throat and threw her to the ground, and then chased her upstairs and punched her. She further stated that in May 2009, the defendant punched her in the stomach, punched her in the face, and punched her in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">On July 22,2009, the trial court issued a final protective order. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:5. The defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed. On appeal, the defendant argues that: (1) the allegations in the petition were legally insufficient to support the issuance of the temporary protective order and to hold a final hearing due to the absence of any dates in the allegations; (2) the trial court\u2019s issuance of the temporary protective order and failure to dismiss the petition prior to the final hearing violated his due process rights; and (3) the trial court erred by denying his motion to continue and consolidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s first argument, he, in essence, moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s petition; thus, we will consider his motion as we would a motion to dismiss. In considering \u201ca motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we assume the truth of the facts alleged by the plaintiff and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\u201d her. <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 766 (quotation omitted). \u2018We then engage in a threshold inquiry that tests the facts in the petition against the applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). Where the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>alleged by the plaintiff are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit legal relief, we will uphold the denial of a motion to dismiss. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">RSA chapter 173-B governs the protection of persons from domestic violence. The purpose of this chapter \u201cis to preserve and protect the safety of the family unit for all family members by entitling victims of domestic violence to immediate and effective police protection and judicial relief.\u201d <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>158 N.H. 602, 605 (2009) (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Pursuant to RSA 173-B:3, I (2002), \u201c[a]ny person may seek relief pursuant to RSA 173-B :5 by filing a petition, in the county or district where the plaintiff or defendant resides, alleging abuse by the defendant.\u201d Based upon this petition, a trial court may enter a temporary order, \u201c[u]pon a showing of an immediate and present danger of abuse,\u201d to protect a plaintiff until a final hearing is held. RSA 173-B :4,1 (2002). \u201cAbuse,\u201d as that term is defined in RSA chapter 173-B, means \u201cthe commission or attempted commission\u201d of certain enumerated acts, such as assault, criminal threatening or harassment, \u201cby a family or household member . . . where such conduct constitutes a credible threat to the plaintiffs safety.\u201d RSA 173-B:1, I (2002) (amended 2010). Thus, to survive the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the plaintiff needed to allege sufficient facts to support a finding that the defendant committed one of the acts enumerated in RSA 173-B: 1,1, and that this conduct constituted a credible threat to her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The defendant does not dispute that the petition alleges one of the acts enumerated in RSA 173-B:1,1; namely, assault. Nevertheless, he maintains that the petition \u201cwas legally insufficient as a matter of law for its complete absence of any dates of the allegations.\u201d He contends that <em>Tosta </em>and <em>Fillmore </em>require the plaintiff to plead facts from which it could be found that the threshold misconduct prompting the domestic violence petition was not too distant in time. The defendant asserts that this requirement is necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was in immediate and present danger justifying the issuance of a temporary protective order. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B :4,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We find the petition susceptible of a reading supporting the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct posed a credible threat to the plaintiff\u2019s safety. In response to the pre-printed statement on the petition form providing \u201cI am in immediate danger of abuse by the defendant,]\u201d the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had hit and choked her \u201c[o]n many occasions.\u201d She also alleged that \u201c[o]n three occasions\u201d he had threatened her life and that he \u201cneeds medical attention ... [b]ut he refuses to go for help.\u201d These statements permit one to reasonably infer that the plaintiff was at risk of further abuse. These allegations are also sufficient to allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>reasonable inference that the plaintiff was, as she alleged, \u201cin immediate danger of abuse by the defendant,\u201d justifying the issuance of a temporary protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><em>Fillmore </em>and <em>Tosta </em>are readily distinguishable. In <em>Fillmore, </em>we held the trial court erred in issuing a temporary protective order because the petitioner did not allege sufficient facts for a finding that she was in \u201cimmediate and present danger of abuse.\u201d <em>Fillmore, </em>147 N.H. at 285 (quotation omitted). In her petition, she stated the defendant was in Canada, he did not have a history of violence, and he had hit her \u201cmany years ago\u201d; she asked that he \u201cbe allowed to contact her at reasonable times to discuss child visitation and marriage counseling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284-85. In contrast here, the plaintiff described specific types of abuse and alleged that she was in \u201cimmediate danger of abuse by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In <em>Tosta, </em>we held that there was insufficient evidence at the hearing to support a finding that the defendant \u201cwas engaged in \u2018abuse\u2019 warranting a protective order,\u201d not that the pleadings themselves were deficient. <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 768. Indeed, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the pleadings were deficient, finding that they supported the conclusion that the defendant posed a credible and continuing threat to the plaintiff\u2019s safety. <em>Id. </em>at 767. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had not only hit her \u201cnine months ago,\u201d but had recently followed her while armed. <em>See id. </em>at 764,767. This case is similar to <em>Tosta </em>in that the petition presented to the trial court contained sufficient allegations of fact to support a denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">While <em>Tosta </em>and <em>Fillmore </em>mandate that the misconduct prompting a domestic violence petition not be too distant in time, neither obliges a plaintiff seeking a temporary protective order to set forth the specific dates upon which he or she allegedly suffered abuse. Indeed, such a requirement would conflict with the intent of RSA chapter 173-B, which is to entitle such victims \u201cto <em>immediate </em>and effective police protection and judicial relief.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>158 N.H. at 605 (quotation omitted; emphasis added). We decline to read such a requirement into the relevant statutory scheme. <em>See In the Matter of Nassar &amp; Nassar, </em>156 N.H. 769, 778 (2008) (\u201cWe will not consider what the legislature might have said, or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Here, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s allegations were legally sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss because they allowed a reasonable inference that the plaintiff was in \u201cimmediate and present danger\u201d of abuse by the defendant. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant next argues that the issuance of the temporary protective order and the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss the petition because it lacked specific dates of alleged abuse violated his due process rights under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The defendant compares RSA chapter 173-B cases to criminal cases in which we have articulated that Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution requires an indictment to describe the offense with sufficient specificity to ensure that the defendant can prepare for trial. <em>See State v. Ericson, </em>159 N.H. 379, 384 (2009). The defendant contends that the absence of any dates in the plaintiff\u2019s petition prevented him from presenting a time-based defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In criminal actions, we require that a complaint or indictment \u201ccontain the elements of the offense and enough facts to notify the defendant of the specific charges,\u201d but it \u201cneed not specify the means by which the crime was accomplished or other facts that are not essential to the elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Id.; see State v. Dixon, </em>144 N.H. 273, 275-76 (1999) (upholding trial court\u2019s denial of bill of particulars where indictment alleged sexual assault had occurred over forty-four month period and did not give exact dates, because date of crimes was not an element). No more is required of a <em>pro se </em>petitioner in the domestic violence context. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B :3,1 (requiring that \u201c[njotice of the pendency of the action and of the facts alleged against the defendant shall be given to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Here, the petition alleged that the plaintiff was \u201cin immediate danger of abuse by the defendant,\u201d and that the defendant had punched and choked her \u201c[o]n many occasions\u201d as well as thrown her to the floor. She also alleged that \u201c[o]n three occasions\u201d he had threatened her life and that he \u201cneeds medical attention . . . [b]ut he refuses to go for help.\u201d These allegations were sufficiently specific to ensure that the defendant could prepare for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the defendant is correct that the petition did not adequately apprise him of the alleged abuse prior to the hearing, he will not prevail on his due process claim absent a showing of actual prejudice. <em>McIntire v. Woodall, </em>140 N.H. 228, 230 (1995). The defendant has failed to make such a showing. At the hearing, the plaintiff testified to the specific dates of the alleged abuse. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration in which he alleged a due process violation. However, he made no showing as to how not knowing the specific dates prior to the hearing caused him actual prejudice. The defendant did not present any evidence to indicate that he in fact had a time-based defense which he would have presented had he known the alleged dates prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to continue and consolidate. He argues that the denial of his motion prejudiced him by denying him the opportunity to obtain information necessary to his defense, specifically, the dates of the alleged abuse. He further maintains that he was prejudiced by his absence at the hearing because he did not have the ability to consult with his counsel regarding the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s objection to his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in managing the proceedings before it.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Conner &amp; Conner, </em>156 N.H. 250, 252 (2007). \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s rulings in this area under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We will disturb decisions about . . . motions to continue only if the defendant demonstrates that the decision was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Larose, </em>157 N.H. 28, 39 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Here, the defendant has failed to carry his burden. First, as we discussed above, the allegations in the petition are sufficiently specific to enable the defendant to prepare for the hearing. Further, the defendant had the opportunity to appear at the hearing to consult with counsel about the additional allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s objection and he failed to do so. Regardless, the defendant concedes that the plaintiff \u201cdid not testify to the [additional] allegations in her Objection\u201d at the hearing. The defendant has not shown that the denial of his motion to continue and consolidate prejudiced his case. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The plaintiff requests that she be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal. Supreme Court Rule 23 permits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">The clerk of the supreme court shall audit and allow bills of costs accruing in this court, and certify the costs to the trial court with the order made in the case. The following costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party: the entry fee, the actual cost of reproducing and binding the notice of appeal and any appendix, the actual cost of reproducing and binding the brief and any appendix, and cost of transcript.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">Costs will be deemed waived if a request for taxation of costs with itemization is not filed within 30 days after the date on the order in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">In the interest of justice in extraordinary cases, but not as a matter of right, the supreme court in its sole discretion may award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees related to an appeal to a prevailing party if the appeal is deemed by the court to have been frivolous or in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><em>See LaMontagne Builders v. Brooks, </em>154 N.H. 252, 259 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The defendant contested the sufficiency of the domestic violence petition early in the proceedings. Prior to the final hearing, he moved to continue, in part, to obtain specific dates of the alleged abuse. At the start of the final hearing, he renewed his request for a continuance and contested the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs petition. We find nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant acted frivolously or in bad faith, and, therefore, the interests of justice do not merit an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, we deny the plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. As the prevailing party, however, the plaintiff may file a request for taxation of costs as provided in Rule 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
