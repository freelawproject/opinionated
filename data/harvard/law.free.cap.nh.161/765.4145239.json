On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence of causation of death. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">The facts of this case are well-documented in two prior opinions of this court, and therefore we do not recite them in their entirety. <em>See State v. Hutchinson, </em>156 N.H. 790 (2008) <em>(Hutchinson II); State v. Hutchinson, </em>137 N.H. 591 (1993) <em>(Hutchinson </em>I). By way of brief background, however, we note the following undisputed facts. On October 8, 1991, a jury found the defendant guilty of attempted murder for beating and strangling Ernest, his twenty-one-year-old former girlfriend, causing her to sustain severe brain damage. <em>See Hutchinson I, </em>137 N.H. at 592. Ernest remained in a near comatose state in the Rockingham County Nursing Home for approximately fourteen years until her death on November 6, 2005. In the days leading up to her death, Ernest exhibited signs of illness. On November 3,2005, she had chest congestion and a fever, and was wheezing and coughing. Nursing home personnel administered Tylenol and Robitussin, as well as nebulizer treatment. Two days later, Ernest\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>temperature rose again and she sustained a three to five minute seizure. She was again administered Robitussin and nebulizer treatment, and was additionally treated with an extra dose of her seizure medication, Dilantin, and placed on oxygen by way of nasal catheter. Despite those measures, Ernest\u2019s oxygen levels dropped and she sustained a second seizure, which lasted approximately forty-five minutes. She was then transported to the hospital, where x-rays indicated she had developed a respiratory infection. At that point Ernest\u2019s family chose to treat her only with comfort measures. She died several hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The State subsequently brought murder charges against the defendant. The defendant sought to bar the charges on double jeopardy grounds and appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on interlocutory appeal. <em>See Hutchinson II, </em>156 N.H. at 791. Thereafter, the defendant was tried and convicted of first-degree murder for Ernest\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">On appeal, the defendant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he caused Ernest\u2019s death. He does not contest that his actions caused Ernest\u2019s permanent brain injury, leaving her in a persistent, near-vegetative state for the fourteen years prior to her death. Nor does he dispute that Ernest\u2019s brain injury, and consequent immobility, increased her risk of developing certain illnesses. His sole argument is that the admitted risks to Ernest\u2019s health as a result of his actions do not establish the necessary element of legal causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must prove that no rational <em>trier of </em>fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. 666, 673 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Here, the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, an element of which is causation of death. <em>See </em>RSA 630:1-a, I (a person is guilty of murder in the first degree if he purposely causes the death of another). \u201cTo establish causation, the State needed to prove not only that the prohibited result would not have occurred but for the conduct of the defendant, but also that the defendant\u2019s conduct was the legal (or proximate) cause of the prohibited result.\u201d <em>State v. Lamprey, </em>149 N.H. 364, 366 (2003). In <em>Lamprey, </em>we considered the propriety of jury instructions that described a legal cause of death as a cause that is a \u201cdirect and substantial factor\u201d bringing about death. <em>Id. </em>at 367. We analyzed the instructions in light of our previous holding in <em>State v. Seymour, </em>140 N.H. 736, 746 (1996), that \u201ca legal cause is the cause without which the event would not have occurred, and the predominating cause, a substantial factor from which the event follows as a natural, direct and immediate consequence.\u201d <em>Lamprey, </em>149 N.H. at 367. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>concluded that the \u201cdirect and substantial factor\u201d language, in combination with an instruction that the prohibited result must be the \u201cdirect result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s actions, was substantially the same as the \u201cnatural, direct and immediate consequence\u201d instruction given in <em>Seymour. Id. </em>at 367-68. Here, the trial court instructed the jury on causation consistent with <em>Lamprey </em>and <em>Seymour, </em>and the defendant does not challenge those instructions. Thus, the issue before us is whether there was sufficient evidence that Ernest\u2019s death would not have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s conduct, and, in keeping with <em>Lamprey </em>and <em>Seymour, </em>whether there was sufficient evidence that Ernest\u2019s death was a natural and direct consequence of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the evidence in this case was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused Ernest\u2019s death beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, the State introduced the defendant\u2019s testimony from his 1991 attempted murder trial. In that trial, the defendant testified that he beat Ernest\u2019s head into the floor until she lost consciousness, and that after she regained consciousness and attempted to flee, he caught and strangled her for at least four minutes and continued to strangle her even after she collapsed. Dr. Albert Drukteinis, a forensic psychiatrist who evaluated the defendant, testified that the defendant stated he choked Ernest for five to ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Dr. David Heller, the emergency room physician at Exeter Hospital who first treated Ernest after the assault, testified that prior to the assault Ernest had no history of seizures. He further testified that at the time of treatment he believed \u201cthe chances of somebody [in Ernest\u2019s condition] recovering under these circumstances and having any kind of meaningful life [wa]s very, very unlikely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Dr. John Robinson, a neurologist who treated Ernest at the Portsmouth Regional Hospital, where she was hospitalized for two weeks following the assault, testified that in the immediate aftermath of the assault Ernest \u201cseized\u201d for approximately three to three and one half hours. He testified that Ernest suffered from hypoxia, a decrease in oxygen due to strangulation, and that the hypoxia caused uncontrolled seizures, which in turn caused additional impairment of her breathing. Robinson further testified that this cycle causes irreversible brain cell death.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Dr. Clinton Miller, a neurosurgeon who also treated Ernest following the assault, testified that Ernest exhibited decerebration, <em>ie., </em>the stiffening of the limbs, and that this indicated a sign of serious brain injury. He testified that Ernest suffered from \u201csevere, hypoxic brain injury, possibly combined with concussive closed head injury, most likely attributable to acute strangulation,\u201d and that uncontrolled seizures were the predictable consequence of hypoxic brain injury. Miller further testified that when the brain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>is deprived of oxygen for a period between three to five minutes, irreversible death occurs in the cells of the brain. He went on to testify that persons with severe brain damage, such as Ernest, typically have a shortened life expectancy and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">The anticipated eventual cause of death in a patient who has suffered a severe hypoxic or anoxic brain injury of any type ... is that [she] would succumb to . . . pneumonia, infection, heart attack, urinary tract infection, blood clots forming in the legs because [she is] immobile and then breaking off and traveling up to the lungs so that the ability to get oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream is impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">So these patients die from the lack of the ability of the brain to supervise all of our everyday vegetative functions, the things that you and I take for granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">He further testified that the fact that Ernest lived for fourteen years after the assault was, in his medical opinion, a testament to the extraordinary care provided by the nursing home in which she resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Dr. James Whitlock, a neurologist and chief medical officer at the Northeast Rehabilitation Hospital where Ernest was treated after her discharge from the Portsmouth Regional Hospital, also testified that the most significant risks to Ernest\u2019s life were pneumonia, infections, seizures, and clots in the lungs due to her immobility. He testified that the majority of people suffering from brain damage similar to Ernest\u2019s die within five years of sustaining the initial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">Dr. Karl Singer, an attending physician at the Rockingham County Nursing Home, testified that he prepared the death certificate for Ernest. Singer testified that he provided medical attention to Ernest for nearly fourteen years at the nursing home and that concerns for Ernest\u2019s health included preventing aspiration and maintaining control of her seizures. Singer testified that while he indicated on the death certificate that Ernest died of natural causes, he \u201cdid not think about\u201d Ernest\u2019s brain injury when preparing the certificate. He further testified that he had been too limited in his assessment of the cause of Ernest\u2019s death when he filled out the death certificate and that the certificate \u201cdidn\u2019t really reflect the whole nature of [Ernest\u2019s] problem over the last 14 years of her life.\u201d He stated that when filling out death certificates, doctors \u201ctend to focus on the last few minutes or hours and don\u2019t really often put things in context,\u201d and that this was \u201ca very common error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Dr. Jennie Duval, deputy chief medical examiner, testified that she performed an autopsy of Ernest and determined the cause of Ernest\u2019s death to be complications resulting from the 1991 brain injury. Duval testified that Ernest \u201cessentially stopped breathing, but it was a complication that directly related to the seizures she was having, and that directly related to the brain injury she suffered on that day in 1991. And that was because of the strangulation. So it all dates back to 14 years previously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Duval explained that Ernest\u2019s medical records indicated that after the assault, Ernest was found unresponsive and seizing. Although emergency workers were initially able to stop the seizures, Ernest continued to have partial seizures every one to two months throughout her fourteen years of long-term care, which required the continuous administration of seizure medication. Duval testified that during those seizures Ernest was at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia, as a result of aspiration of saliva or gastric contents into the lungs. Duval further testified that on the day before Ernest\u2019s death she started seizing again, that medical staff were not able to control the seizures, and that x-rays revealed that she had aspiration contents and pneumonia in the lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Duval also testified to two additional health problems that contributed to Ernest\u2019s death, both of which she attributed to the severe brain damage Ernest sustained fourteen years prior to her death. Duval explained that Ernest\u2019s autopsy revealed that she had a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot, in the main artery that supplies blood to the lungs, which would have decreased the oxygen that reaches the brain. She also had pulmonary edema \u2014 excess fluid retention in the lungs. Duval testified that she believed these conditions were caused by Ernest\u2019s immobility and that they combined to cause seizures, aspiration of infectious bacteria into her lungs, and, eventually, her death. Duval stated that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the cause of Ernest\u2019s death was homicide, death at the hands of another, and that \u201cth[e] final underlying cause that led to her death \u2014 even though it was delayed 14 years, that final underlying event was the attempted strangulation 14 years ago at the hands of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The defendant takes the position that this evidence merely supports a conclusion that Ernest\u2019s heightened risk of developing illness <em>could </em>have caused her death, and, therefore that the evidence is insufficient to establish legal causation. We conclude otherwise. The State presented evidence of the profound damage to Ernest\u2019s brain and the resulting associated risks. The State further presented evidence that Ernest died of precisely those conditions for which she was at risk due to her brain injury. Moreover, Duval specifically testified that Ernest died from complications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>which were directly related to her strangulation, and thus the cause of Ernest\u2019s death was homicide by strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The defendant points to testimony by Miller that patients with severe hypoxic brain injury tend to \u201csuccumb to one of the routine things that cause the death of most of us,\u201d and characterizes this testimony as an indication that Ernest\u2019s death was just as likely to have occurred without the brain injury. According to the defendant, this testimony suggests that \u201cwhile it is <em>possible </em>that Ernest\u2019s death might not have occurred but for strangulation, the evidence just as aptly proved that her death from respiratory illness occurred as it would have in the case of an otherwise healthy, mobile person with respiratory illness.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Miller\u2019s statement was in answer to a question about the medical complications of immobility, and directly related to his previous testimony about the generally shortened lifespan of persons with severe brain injury. Thus, his statement was an explanation of medical problems that occur in immobile patients, and which cause the death of most people after age has restricted mobility. Under these circumstances, we do not conclude that Dr. Miller suggested that Ernest\u2019s death would have occurred without the strangulation which caused her immobility, or that the defendant\u2019s assault was not the natural and direct cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Nor do we find merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that because Ernest lived for fourteen years with her injuries, as opposed to the five years generally projected for patients who are similarly brain injured, she had outlived the risk of death directly caused by the strangulation. As noted above, there was ample evidence to show that Ernest died of the very complications for which persons with severe brain injury and immobility are at risk. Moreover, the defendant points to no evidence that Ernest\u2019s heightened risk for those complications was eliminated by her longer lifespan.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Finally, we note the defendant\u2019s argument that in <em>Commonwealth v. Embry, </em>272 A.2d 178 (Pa. 1971), expert testimony given to \u201ca reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d was found insufficient to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Embry, </em>272 A.2d at 179. The facts in <em>Embry, </em>however, are distinguishable. <em>Embry </em>concerned a victim with a pre-existing heart condition who died of a heart attack after a purse-snatching. The medical examiner, and sole expert witness in the case, testified that while he was convinced the victim had died of a heart attack, he was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the robbery produced the stress which, in turn, caused the victim\u2019s heart attack. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the issue in <em>Embry </em>was not whether the expert testified based on the proper standard, but, rather, whether the expert\u2019s opinion in fact established causation. <em>Id.; cf. Com. v. Alston, </em>410 A.2d 849, 851 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1979) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>(finding appellant\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence to prove cause of death beyond a reasonable doubt \u201centirely specious,\u201d where the question presented to the medical examiner was \u201ccan you give an opinion with reasonable medical certainty as to the cause of death,\u201d and his response was \u201cThe cause of death was a stab wound of the thorax\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Our sufficiency of the evidence standard requires that we view each evidentiary item in context and not in isolation. <em>See State v. Evans, </em>150 N.H. 416, 424 (2003). Here, Ernest had no pre-existing medical condition, six expert witnesses testified to Ernest\u2019s brain damage, its cause, and the resultant associated risks, including shortened life span due to immobility and infection, and Duval testified that Ernest\u2019s death was caused by the defendant\u2019s 1991 assault on her. We conclude that this evidence, along with the other evidence adduced by the State, was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ernest\u2019s death would not have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s conduct and that her death was a natural and direct consequence of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b792-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
