We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">The relevant facts follow. The parties are former spouses who together have three children: twin sixteen-year-old daughters and a ten-year-old son. In October 2009, the parties entered into an agreement wherein the plaintiff assumed primary residential responsibility for the parties\u2019 children. The defendant maintains visitation with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">On March 18, 2010, the plaintiff, who is a physician, filed a domestic violence petition seeking an order of protection from the defendant. In his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>petition, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant sent numerous threatening and harassing emails and text messages to him, made false accusations against him in the local and national news with the intent to harm him personally and professionally, and filed false reports against him with police departments, the New Hampshire Board of Medicine (NHBM), and the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). The plaintiff asserted that \u201c[g]iven [the defendant\u2019s] mental state and the social circles she is in\u201d he had \u201cconcerns for [the] safety of [his] person and property,\u201d as well as concerns about the financial impact the defendant\u2019s actions could have upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The trial court held a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s petition on April 19,2010, at which both parties were present. The plaintiff submitted a number of exhibits to the trial court, including emails and text messages that he received from the defendant, which he alleged to be threatening in nature. He also submitted news articles in which the defendant was quoted as stating that the plaintiff had been an abusive husband, that he arranged for \u201chush money\u201d payments to her from a man she later accused of sexual assault, and that he had caused harm to their children. The plaintiff testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">My concern about risk to property and person is not so much directly from Cheryl. It\u2019s because she\u2019s going around telling a lot of people all this stuff and, you know, making me out to be this monster with all these things that are absolutely untrue. And the crowd that she hangs out with are basically the ones over there at the Friendship Center. It includes a lot of people who have criminal records. And my concern has been, with all of these bizarre things that she\u2019s saying \u2014 and it evolves over time \u2014 it becomes worse over time \u2014 that someone who considers \u2014 who believes her \u2014 someone who doesn\u2019t know the whole story and doesn\u2019t know the other side of the issue \u2014 might take it upon themselves to try to get justice when she claims that she\u2019s not getting justice through any of the proper things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">And through any of the proper channels. And so my concern is for my safety and safety of property, not so much directly from what she may do, as a result of all this stuff that she\u2019s doing in media, in talking to people and describing things \u2014 making things up the way she\u2019s doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The defendant admitted to sending the plaintiff the emails and text messages in question, and further admitted to contacting news media and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>making statements that she understood would negatively affect the defendant\u2019s livelihood as a physician and his reputation in the community. Nevertheless, the defendant denied that any of her statements to news outlets about the plaintiff were false or that she made them to cause him harm. She testified that her numerous communications with the plaintiff were her attempt to force him into taking her to court because she believes he does not \u201clisten to [her] when it comes to [the] children and their needs.\u201d She further testified that she believed the plaintiff\u2019s position as a doctor and member of the Mormon Church has given him credibility and that, in fact, it is the plaintiff who has caused harm to her and their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">After the hearing, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for a protective order. The trial court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">This Court is entering a specific finding that based upon the intent behind the Defendant\u2019s actions and her acknowledgement that her purpose in engaging [in] said contact was to force the Plaintiff to \u201ctake her back to Court\u201d that her continuation with that course of conduct despite the Plaintiff\u2019s numerous requests to cease and desist constitutes harassment under RSA 644:4 and that the Defendant\u2019s acknowledgement that her continued involvement in [the] aforementioned campaign would negatively affect the Plaintiff\u2019s emotional and psychological state as well as his professional .reputation demonstrates to this Court that the [Defendant\u2019s] purpose in the above referenced course of conduct was to annoy or alarm the Plaintiff without a lawful purpose or constitutional right to do so. The Court, based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the Defendant[\u2019]s aforementioned course of conduct finds the Plaintiff\u2019s statement that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">Given her mental state and the social circles she is in this has raised concerns for [the] safety of my person and property, as well as causing me to lose income by missing work to deal with all of this[,]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">to be a reasonable concern of the Plaintiff warranting Court intervention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendant committed one of the acts enumerated in RSA chapter 173-B, and that this conduct constituted a credible threat to the plaintiff\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">RSA chapter 173-B governs the protection of persons from domestic violence. The purpose of this chapter \u201cis to preserve and protect the safety of the family unit for all family members by entitling victims of domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>violence to immediate and effective police protection and judicial relief.\u201d <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>158 N.H. 602, 605 (2009) (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Pursuant to RSA 173-B :8, I (Supp. 2010), \u201c[a]ny person may seek relief... by filing a petition, in the county or district where the plaintiff or defendant resides, alleging abuse by the defendant.\u201d \u201cA finding of abuse shall mean the defendant represents a credible threat to the safety of the plaintiff.\u201d RSA 173-B :5, I (Supp. 2010). \u201cUpon a showing of abuse of the plaintiff by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall grant such relief as is necessary to bring about a cessation of abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAbuse,\u201d as defined in RSA chapter 173-B, means \u201cthe commission or attempted commission\u201d of certain enumerated acts, such as harassment, by a spouse or former spouse, \u201cwhere such conduct constitutes a credible threat to the plaintiffs safety.\u201d RSA 173-B:1,1 (Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The defendant does not dispute that the petition alleges one of the acts enumerated in RSA 173-B.T, I \u2014 harassment. Nevertheless, she argues that the protective order should not have been granted because all of the requirements of RSA chapter 173-B and RSA 644:4 (Supp. 2010) were not met. Assuming, without deciding, that the defendant\u2019s conduct met the criteria for harassment under RSA 644:4, we hold that the evidence fails to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a credible threat to the plaintiffs safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\u201c[W]e review sufficiency of the evidence claims as a matter of law, and uphold the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Fillmore v. Fillmore, </em>147 N.H. 283, 284 (2001) (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 173-B:3, VI (Supp. 2010). When performing this review, \u201c[w]e accord considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s judgments on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given testimony.\u201d <em>Fillmore, </em>147 N.H. at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Domestic violence protective orders are to be utilized when a victim has shown a need for protection <em>from an </em>ongoing, credible threat to his or her safety. RSA 173-B:5, I; <em>Walker, </em>158 N.H. at 605. Given this statutory objective, we have required a plaintiff to show more than a generalized fear for personal safety based upon non-violent harassment to support a finding that a credible threat to his safety exists. <em>In the Matter of Alexander and Evans, </em>147 N.H. 441, 441-43 (2002) (holding that while unwanted telephone calls and rude gestures made by the defendant to the plaintiff were enough to support a finding of harassment, they were insufficient to support a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a credible threat to the plaintiffs safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Here, while there may have been substantial evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct negatively affected the plaintiffs emotional or financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>well-being at the time he filed his domestic violence petition, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant represented an ongoing, credible threat to the plaintiff\u2019s <em>physical safety, </em>and that therefore he was in need of protection. Indeed, the plaintiff conceded that he did not feel the defendant herself posed a risk to his safety, and he presented no evidence that the defendant had in any way threatened his safety at any time. The plaintiff\u2019s concern for his safety was based upon his speculation that as a result of the defendant\u2019s statements about him, unknown persons might take it upon themselves to harm him. We conclude that the evidence in this case does not support a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct posed a credible threat to the plaintiff's safety. Accordingly, it was error for the trial court to enter a final domestic violence protective order against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b766-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN, HICKS and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
