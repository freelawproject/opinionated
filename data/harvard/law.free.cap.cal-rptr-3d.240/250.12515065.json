J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, the Governor called a special session of the Legislature for certain specified purposes, including to \"[i]mprove the efficiency and efficacy of the health care system, reduce the cost of providing health\n   care services, and improve the health of Californians.\" During that session, the Legislature enacted the End of Life Option Act ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443 - 443.22 ) (Act), which legalized physician-assisted suicide\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the terminally ill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the action below, the trial court entered judgment on the pleadings, enjoining enforcement of the Act on the ground that it was not within the scope of the proclamation calling the special session, and therefore it was in violation of article IV, section 3, subdivision (b) of the California Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This extraordinary writ proceeding presents two key issues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Have the parties challenging the constitutionality of the Act adequately alleged that they have standing to do so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Was the trial court correct in ruling that the Act is unconstitutional?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We will hold that the challengers have not shown that they have standing. Hence, we do not reach the constitutional question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because we are reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, we take the facts from the complaint, as well as from matters of which we may take judicial notice. (\n   <em>\n    People ex rel. Alzayat v.

(Assembly Weekly History, Apr. 4, 2016, p. 14.) On October 5, 2015, the Governor signed it into law. (Stats. 2015-2016, 2nd Ex. Sess., ch. 1.) It went into effect on June 9, 2016. ( Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 8, subd. (c)(1); see Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 1 (2015-2016 2nd Ex. Sess.); Assembly Weekly History (2015-2016 2nd Ex. Sess.), Apr. 4, 2016, p. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Act allows an individual who has complied with all of its requirements to obtain and to use an \"aid-in-dying drug.\" \"Aid-in-dying drug\" is defined, in part, as a drug that may be \"self-administer[ed] to bring about ... death ....\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.1, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the individual's attending physician must diagnose the individual as having a terminal disease. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.2, subd. (a)(1).) \"Terminal disease\" is defined as \"an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, result in death within six months.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.1, subd. (q).) At that point, the individual may make a request to the attending physician for an aid-in-dying drug. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.2, subd. (a), 443.3, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The attending physician must refer the individual to a consulting physician (\n   Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(3) ), who must also diagnose the individual as having a terminal disease. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.6, subd. (b).) If either the attending or the consulting physician finds indications that the individual has a mental disorder, he or she must refer the individual for a mental health specialist assessment. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.5, subd (a)(1)(A)(ii), 443.6, subd (d).) There are many other steps that must be taken to ensure that the request is voluntary and not the product of a mental\n   disorder, coercion, or a whim. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.3, 443.4, 443.5, subd. (a), 443.6, 443.7, 443.8, 443.10, 443.11, 443.17, subd. (d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   If all the conditions of the Act are met, the attending physician may prescribe an aid-in-dying drug to the qualified individual. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.5, subd. (b).) The qualified individual may then self-administer the aid-in-dying drug. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.1, subd. (b), 443.13, subd. (a)(2), 443.14, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Actions taken in accordance with [the Act] shall not, for any purposes, constitute suicide ..., homicide, or elder abuse under the law.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.18 ; see also Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.14, subd. (d)(2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A physician who participates in the process prescribed by the Act is immune from virtually all adverse legal consequences. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.1, subd. (h), 443.14, subd. (c).) On the other hand, a physician is equally immune from \"refusing to participate in activities authorized under this part, including, but not limited to, refusing to inform a patient regarding his or her rights under this part, and not referring an individual to a physician who participates in activities authorized under this part.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.14, subd. (e)(2), 443.1, subd. (h).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Participation in activities authorized [by the Act] shall be voluntary. ... [A] person or entity that elects, for reasons of conscience, morality, or ethics, not to engage in activities authorized [by the Act] is not required to take any action in support of an individual's decision under [the Act].\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.14, subd. (e)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Events in the Trial Court\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This action below was filed in June 2016. The plaintiffs are five individual physicians\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   along with a professional organization that promotes ethical standards in the medical profession\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively the Ahn parties). They asserted causes of action for violations of due process, of equal protection, and of California constitutional limitations on the power of the Legislature to act in special session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Initially, the only named defendant was Michael Hestrin, in his capacity as District Attorney of Riverside County. By stipulation, however, the Attorney General and \"[t]he State of California ... by and through the California Department of Public Health\" (collectively the State) intervened as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In February 2018, the Ahn parties filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On May 15, 2018, after hearing argument, the trial court ruled that it would grant the motion, without leave to amend. On May 21, 2018, it entered a formal written order\n   to that effect. On May 24, 2018, it entered judgment in favor of the Ahn parties and against Hestrin and the State. In the judgment, it enjoined enforcement of the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 29, 2018, three nonparties\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively the Fairchild parties) filed an ex parte application to vacate the judgment. They supported the Act and argued that the judgment was erroneous. On May 30, 2017, the trial court denied the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Events in This Court\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On May 21, 2018, the State filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court, along with a request for an immediate stay. Initially, we denied a stay. On June 8, 2018, however, the State filed an amended petition along with a renewed request for an immediate stay. On June 15, 2018, we issued an order to show cause and granted a temporary stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Meanwhile on June 6, 2018, the Fairchild parties filed an appeal from the judgment. We ordered that the appeal and this writ proceeding be considered together. We did not consolidate them. Nevertheless, from this point on, the parties served their filings in the writ proceeding on the Fairchild parties. Moreover, the Fairchild parties filed a return to the petition. None of the parties objected to this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   THE STATUS OF THE FAIRCHILD PARTIES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In their separate appeal, the Fairchild parties contend that, as a result of the denial of their ex parte application to vacate the judgment, they have standing to appeal and, in that appeal, to challenge the judgment on the merits. The Ahn parties dispute this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The issue for us at present, however, is not whether the Fairchild parties are parties to the appeal, but only whether they are parties to this writ proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A party to a writ proceeding does not necessarily have to have been a party to the proceeding in the tribunal below.

The Fairchild parties claim such a direct interest, in that they want access to assisted suicide under the Act, but the judgment enjoins enforcement of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Admittedly, the State's writ petition did not name the Fairchild parties\n   (see\n   <em>\n    Tabarrejo v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 859,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2030\">\n    182 Cal.Rptr.3d 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), nor did the Fairchild parties formally move to intervene (see\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

However, a person can become a party to an action, even if not named in the complaint, by appearing and participating without any objection by the other parties. (\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Ins.

We see no reason why this principle should not also apply to a writ proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This is not to say that they are necessarily\n   <em>\n    proper\n   </em>\n   parties. It may be that, if their participation had been challenged, we would conclude that their joinder is improper. We simply conclude that they are parties for such purposes as whether they are subject to our jurisdiction, whether they are entitled to notice, and whether we can consider their return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   THE PROPRIETY OF WRIT REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The State contends that review by writ is appropriate in this case. The other parties do not dispute this. Nevertheless, we address it briefly, because it goes to our jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It goes without saying that the judgment was appealable. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(1).) Indeed, both the State and the Fairchild parties have appealed from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Extraordinary writ review by way of a petition for writ of mandate is ordinarily available only if the petitioner has no adequate legal remedy. [Citation.] An immediate direct appeal is presumed to be an adequate legal remedy.

We therefore exercise our discretion in favor of writ review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   STANDING IN THE TRIAL COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The State contends that the Ahn parties do not have standing to challenge the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Ahn parties alleged that they are California physicians (or, in the case of the Academy, that it has members who are California physicians) who have patients with terminal diseases within the meaning of the Act. \"They bring this action to protect the rights of their patients to be protected by law ... from being assisted and abetted in committing suicide, from receiving substandard medical care, and from having depression and medical conditions leading to suicide left untreated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Academy additionally alleged that it \"promote[s] ethical standards in the medical profession\" and \"lobbies for ethical government policy consistent with the Hippocratic tradition of preserving life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The State responded with a general denial of these (and all other) allegations of the complaint. Moreover, in opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n   it argued that the Ahn parties lacked standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The trial court ruled that the Ahn parties did have standing: \"[W]here a constitutional challenge is involved, a party whose own rights are not impacted, but whose challenge is raised on behalf of absent third parties, has sufficient standing if the relationship between the litigant and the absent third party whose rights the litigant asserts is so close that the litigant is fully or very nearly as effective a proponent of the right as would be the absent party, and there are obstacles to prevent the third parties from bringing suit themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"The plaintiffs in this case are doctors whose actions are not only covered under the Act, but who have a close enough relationship to their patients to bring them within the ambit of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Furthermore, the Act impacts terminally ill patients who are not in a position to challenge the law because their illnesses and their shortened life expectancy present significant obstacles in bringing suit themselves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    General standing principles\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Justiciability has several aspects, including ripeness, mootness, and standing.

(\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 565-567.) The Supreme Court held that the doctor had standing to assert that this was a violation of his patients' state constitutional right to privacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 569-571.) It explained that \" '[w]here the constitutionally protected privacy interests of absent patients are coincident with the interests of the doctor, the doctor must be permitted to speak for them.' [Citation.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 570.) It reasoned, in part, that the doctor's interests were not \"at odds with his patients' interests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Here, the requisite commonality of interest is missing. The Ahn parties' terminally ill patients may be divided into two groups. One group, upon receiving their diagnosis, will want to request assisted suicide. The Ahn parties, however, brought this action to prevent them from doing so. They cannot possibly \"speak for\" this group of patients, even if they claim to be doing so for their benefit. The other group will not want to request assisted suicide. In that event, however, all they have to do is not request it. The Act simply does not affect them; thus, it also does not affect the Ahn parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The State sums this up well in its petition: \"If neither the real party physicians nor their patients want aid-in-dying to be a part of their professional relationship, then neither group suffers any injury due to the Act. Alternatively, if the real party physicians do not want to provide aid-in-dying, but their patients do want aid-in-dying, the physicians' interests are not aligned with those of their patients and third-party standing would not lie.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Personal standing\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Ahn parties also argue that they have personal standing, on three theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   First, they claim that they \"regularly\" diagnose terminal diseases. They claim that, if they diagnose a patient as having a terminal disease, \"that\n   make[s] th[e] patient[s] eligible to receive fatal drugs.\" They argue that this impacts their \"professional obligations and duties to clients.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   One problem with this argument is that the Ahn parties did not allege that they regularly (or ever) diagnose terminal diseases. Even assuming they do, however, it is simply not true that that diagnosis makes the patient eligible for an aid-in-dying drug. The patient still has to jump through a number of hoops, and the Ahn parties are free to refuse to participate in that process. Once they refuse, if the patient still wants an aid-in-dying drug, he or she must get a new attending physician, who must also diagnose the patient as having a terminal disease. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(1)(B).) Moreover, the attending physician must refer the patient to a consulting physician, and the consulting physician, too, must diagnose the patient as having a terminal disease. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.1, subd. (j), 443.5, subd. (a)(3), 443.6, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At this point, the Ahn parties' responsibility for the patient's choice of assisted suicide is attenuated, at best. We may assume that they would feel some reluctance to diagnose a patient as having a terminal disease, because one possible outcome is that the patient will start the assisted suicide process (albeit with a different attending physician). Even so, there\n   are many other reasons why a physician might be reluctant to diagnose a terminal disease - not least, that the patient might choose to commit\n   <em>\n    unassisted\n   </em>\n   suicide. These \"conjectural\" and \"hypothetical\" possibilities do not give rise to standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Under the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, a physician has a duty to communicate an honest diagnosis: \"Except in emergency situations in which a patient is incapable of making an informed decision, withholding information without the patient's knowledge or consent is ethically unacceptable.\" (Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2.1.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). Compliance might make the Ahn parties feel bad, but they cite no authority for the proposition that bad feelings can be sufficient to confer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second, the Ahn parties argue that the Act requires them to allow their employees to provide information about assisted suicide and to provide referrals to other physicians for assisted suicide. They cite the following provisions of the Act on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Health and Safety Code section 443.15 provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"[N]otwithstanding any other law, a health care provider may prohibit its employees ... from\n   participating in activities under this part while on premises owned or under the management or direct control of that prohibiting health care provider or while acting within the course and scope of any employment by, or contract with, the prohibiting health care provider.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.15, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   However, the same section also provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"For purposes of this section: [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \" 'Participating, or entering into an agreement to participate, in activities under this part' does not include ... : [\u00b6] ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \"(B) Providing information to a patient about this part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \"(C) Providing a patient, upon the patient's request, with a referral to another health care provider for the purposes of participating in the activities authorized by this part.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.15, subd. (f)(3).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, then, this section\n   <em>\n    allows\n   </em>\n   a health care provider to prohibit its employees from \"participating in activities under this part,\" while it carves out providing information and providing a referral from the definition of \"participating in activities under this part.\" But just because something is not expressly allowed does not mean it is forbidden. What is absent is any general rule\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   prohibiting an employee from providing information or providing a referral. Admittedly, a\n   <em>\n    health care provider\n   </em>\n   cannot be subjected to any sanctions - including employment sanctions - for providing information or providing a referral. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443.14, subd. (c), 443.16, subd. (a).) However, the Ahn parties have not shown that the Act provides a similar safe harbor for the\n   <em>\n    employee\n   </em>\n   of a health care provider (unless the employee is also a health care provider).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In any event, even assuming the Act does require a health care provider to allow its employees to provide information and to provide referrals, the complaint fails to allege standing on this basis. It does not allege that the Ahn parties even\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   any employees, much less that any of their employees are health care providers\n   or that any of their employees want to provide information and referrals against their employers' wishes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the Ahn parties argue that the Act is vague with respect to whether, once they refuse to participate in assisted suicide, they are required to refer the patient to a health care provider who will. That is incorrect. The Act specifically says that they cannot be sanctioned for not making such a referral. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.14, subd. (e)(2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Public-interest standing\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, the Ahn parties argue that they have public-interest standing to sue to enforce a public duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In mandate cases, the Supreme Court has held that \" ' \"where the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the [petitioner] need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, since it is sufficient that he is interested as a citizen in having the laws executed and the duty in question enforced.\" ' [Citation.] ...

It was in that context that the court said, \"the several district attorneys of the state, including the District Attorney of Merced County, have the specific duty to prosecute ... violations of general laws. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 26500.) This duty is mandatory, and not discretionary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 766,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20287\">\n    50 Cal.Rptr. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Government Code section 26500, however, states: \"The public prosecutor ...\n   <em>\n    within his or her discretion\n   </em>\n   shall initiate and conduct on behalf of the people all prosecutions for public offenses.\" (Italics added.) Thus, a district attorney's \"mandatory\" duty is to exercise his or her\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   to prosecute crimes. We may accept that, if a district attorney failed and refused to prosecute any crimes whatsoever, mandate might lie. Nevertheless, mandate cannot be used to compel a district attorney to exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion in any particular way. Thus, we see no way to construe the complaint as a mandate petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for the Ahn parties argued that his clients must be deemed to have standing, because otherwise no one would have standing to seek a remedy for the asserted constitutional violation. They have not shown that this is so. While we need not exhaustively specify who would have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act, it would seem that a district attorney who believes the Act is unconstitutional and who wants to prosecute persons who participate in assisted suicide would have standing. Similarly, a hospital or professional association that seeks to penalize health care providers under its jurisdiction who participate in assisted suicide would seem to have standing. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 443.14, subd.

Kim W.\n   </em>\n   (1984)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164048\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/160/326/#p330\">\n    160 Cal.App.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20609\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr. 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In the instant case, the State's pleadings raised a material issue as to standing in that the State denied all the Ahn parties' material factual allegations, including their allegations regarding their standing to sue. The trial court was required to accept the State's denials as true. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Thus, the court was required to deny the motion solely on this basis alone. The Ahn parties acknowledged as much at oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Second, it is clear from the majority and concurring/dissenting opinions that the Ahn parties have failed to demonstrate standing. The concurring/dissenting opinion carefully demonstrates what the Ahn parties\n   may plead to demonstrate a justiciable controversy; however, it is for the Ahn parties to make this threshold showing, which they have failed to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The concurring/dissenting opinion is correct in asserting that there is a hazard in judicial inaction. However, the majority opinion does not result in inaction. Rather, under the majority opinion, the trial court decision is vacated, leaving the EOLOA in effect. That law will remain in effect unless the Ahn parties are able to show a justiciable controversy and unauthorized acts by the Legislature. This posture is consistent with and comports with the presumption of constitutionality of laws passed in regular or special session referred to in the concurring/dissenting opinion.

I believe these limits are particularly applicable here where the legislative enactment, the EOLOA, remains presumptively valid, the Ahn parties have the opportunity to demonstrate their standing to challenge the EOLOA, and all parties maintain the same rights they had at the inception of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   My colleagues bypass the central and important question in this case-whether the Legislature exceeded its authority when it enacted the End of Life Option Act (EOLOA) to provide terminal patients facing prolonged painful deaths the option of obtaining drugs to shorten their suffering. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 443 - 443.22, unlabeled statutory citations refer to this code.) They conclude we cannot reach the question because the plaintiffs haven't adequately pled standing. (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 261-76.) I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In my view, the majority's approach needlessly ties this case up in a procedural Gordian knot. We can cut the knot by realizing the courts-both\n   trial and appellate-have discretion to dismiss a cause of action on any decisive legal ground. In this case, the fact that plaintiffs' challenge to EOLOA lacks merit as a matter of law provides an independent basis for us to reverse the trial court judgment finding EOLOA violates article IV, section 3 of the California Constitution and direct the court to enter judgment in favor of the state on plaintiffs' third cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   I part ways with the majority on just about every principle point of their analysis. Because the issues they raise are complex and interrelated, I start with an overview of our disagreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   First, the plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   pled standing. The majority reaches the contrary conclusion only by assuming all the plaintiff-physicians\n   <em>\n    as well as\n   </em>\n   all the members of plaintiff American Academy of Medical Ethics (the association) are conscientious objectors who will refuse to provide\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   aid-in-dying services. That proposition does not appear in the complaint. What the physicians\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   allege is they treat terminal patients and will inevitably harm them by following the regulations of their profession the Legislature enacted. Thus, the complaint successfully alleges some plaintiffs are\n   <em>\n    participating\n   </em>\n   physicians who have\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   standing because EOLOA regulates the way they practice medicine to their detriment. Because plaintiffs also allege some of their patients are unable to protect their own interests in litigation due to their illnesses, they also successfully allege\n   <em>\n    third-party\n   </em>\n   standing. In addition, the association has alleged standing by alleging some of its members have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Second, even if the complaint\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   concerned only with\n   <em>\n    nonparticipating\n   </em>\n   physicians whose practices EOLOA doesn't regulate because they refuse to participate at all, it is clear from the statute they would be able to amend to articulate standing on separate grounds. For example, the statute plainly bars nonparticipating physicians from controlling whether their employees share with their patients information about EOLOA or refer them to participating physicians. Thus, a nonparticipating physician who employs others cannot enforce an office policy requiring employees to run the business as a conscientious objector shop. Because an employer has an interest in being able to set such a policy, nonparticipating physicians will be able to allege direct standing to challenge whether the Legislature exceeded\n   its authority by enacting EOLOA during the special session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Still, I conclude the trial court committed an elementary error when it found the plaintiffs had\n   <em>\n    established\n   </em>\n   standing, as it had to do to enter judgment in\n   their favor. The trial court made its ruling on plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings. While I agree the plaintiffs had properly\n   <em>\n    alleged\n   </em>\n   standing, there was not yet any basis to conclude the plaintiffs in fact\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   standing. On the contrary, since the state specifically denied the standing allegations, that material issue was in dispute and could not be decided in favor of either party on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Since plaintiffs were required to establish standing to prevail, the trial court could not properly\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings. Doing so was error. To that extent, I agree with the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   However, the\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to establish the plaintiffs had\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   standing to prevail. The trial court was therefore free to rule in\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   favor on the merits of the purely legal constitutional challenge to EOLOA. A trial court can set aside disputed standing issues to reach a dispositive legal issue at any stage of litigation-on a demurrer, a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at summary judgment. Standing doesn't matter where the plaintiffs lose on independent grounds. And where those grounds are purely legal, the trial court may rule against plaintiffs even if their standing remains in dispute. The contrary rule offends both common sense and basic principles of judicial economy. So, the trial court plainly could have-and as I will explain should have-ruled plaintiffs' challenge to EOLOA as ultra vires legislation failed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This brings us to my third area of disagreement with the majority. Just as the trial court could have reached the merits of the constitutional challenge, we can too. The fact that standing remains in dispute (and may require additional pleading) isn't a barrier to our finding the legislation constitutional. We have the discretion to reach the substantive merits and rule in favor of the state parties. I would do so because we have a responsibility to expeditiously disperse the uncertainty this litigation has created for countless patients, family members, and loved ones, as well as physicians and workers in the health care sector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   There is simply no reason to drag this case out so the plaintiffs can prove they have standing before we hold the Legislature acted within its authority under the Governor's proclamation when it enacted EOLOA. For these reasons and the reasons I explain in detail in part IV below, I would do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   My colleagues set out selected provisions from EOLOA. However, I believe they leave out provisions which affect the analysis of both the\n   standing and constitutional issues. I therefore provide additional background about the provisions of EOLOA and its passage here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Proclamation and Special Legislative Session\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Governor Brown issued a proclamation calling the Legislature to assemble in extraordinary session on June 19, 2015 and directing them to consider and enact legislation relating to the delivery of health care services in California. (Proclamation by the Governor of the State of California (proclamation) (June 16, 2015).) Among other things, the Governor directed the Legislature to \"consider and act upon legislation necessary to [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   ... [i]mprove the efficiency and efficacy of the health care system, reduce the cost of providing health care services, and improve the health of Californians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As the plaintiffs emphasize, the proclamation also directed the Legislature to consider and act on legislation on certain specific topics related to health care funding. The proclamation embraced legislation \"necessary to enact permanent and sustainable funding from a new managed care organization tax and/or alternative fund sources to provide: [\u00b6] ... [a]t least $1.1 billion annually to stabilize the General Fund's costs for Medi-Cal; and [\u00b6] ... [s]ufficient funding to continue the 7 percent restoration of In-Home Supportive Services hours beyond 2015-16; and [\u00b6] ... [s]ufficient funding to provide additional rate increases for providers of Medi-Cal and developmental disability services.\" (Proclamation p. 1.) It also embraced legislation necessary to \"[e]stablish mechanisms so that any additional rate increases expand access to services; and [\u00b6] ... [i]ncrease oversight and the effective management of services provided to consumers with developmental disabilities through the regional center system.\" (Proclamation p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   On September 9, 2015, during the special session, Assemblyperson Dr. Susan Eggman introduced to the California Assembly the bill (Assembly Bill X2 15) which became EOLOA. \"Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to present to you today, Assembly Bill X2 15. This bill is the product of an immense amount of work across both houses involving many legislators' close collaboration with stakeholders. The result, members, is the most rigorous aid-in-dying legislation in the country, with the strongest set of protections for patients and the physicians who treat them. At its most basic, this bill provides the option for a person who is terminally ill to request a prescription for medication to aid in their passing in their last days.\" Assemblyperson Eggman then summarized the provisions of the bill and asked the other Assembly members for their support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Before the Assembly debated whether the bill represented good policy, Assemblyperson James Gallagher challenged it as outside the approved purposes for the special session. \"This bill is not properly before this extraordinary session, as it is not consistent with the purpose stated for the extraordinary session, which is health care funding. This bill has nothing to do with funding health care and MediCal.\" The Speaker pro tempore (Speaker) pointed out the Rules Committee had referred the bill to the Assembly as consistent with Assembly rules, and ruled the bill is \"germane to health care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Assemblyperson Gallagher pressed his objection further. He appealed the decision and called for a vote on whether EOLOA was germane to the purposes approved by the Governor. He argued, \"This extraordinary session was called for the specific purpose of finding funding for MediCal, and other health care issues for the developmentally disabled. This bill is not consistent with the subject of this extraordinary session. And I think it's incumbent upon all of us to ensure that we follow proper procedure. This bill did go through in our regular session, and it didn't make it through the Committee process. We need to respect that decision. In the decision that was made in Health Committee and not allow the rules to be circumvented. And so I would encourage all of you to overrule this ruling. So that we can get back to the business that we've been working on and we can get back to the proper business of this extraordinary session.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Speaker then called a vote of the Assembly to determine whether EOLOA was germane. \"Mr. Gallagher, as I indicated, the Rules Committee properly referred this bill. It's germane to health. I have cited my reasoning and my decision on your point of order. The question before the body is a procedural one, and ... the ruling of the Chair [should] be upheld. This is procedural, members. The clerk will open the role ... [T]his requires a majority of those present and voting.\" The Assembly voted 41 to 28 to uphold the decision EOLOA was within the purposes of the proclamation. The Assembly then turned to an extended debate on the policy of adopting aid-in-dying legislation, after which it voted 42 to 33 to enact EOLOA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Legislature passed EOLOA on September 11, 2015. (Assem. Weekly Hist., Apr. 4, 2016, p. 14.) Governor Brown signed the bill on October 5, 2015, and it went into effect on June 9, 2016. (Stats. 2015-2016, 2d Ex. Sess., ch. 1; Assem. Weekly Hist., Apr. 4, 2016, p. 14; Assem. Con. Res. No. 1, 2015-2016 2d Ex.

An aid-in-dying drug is any drug \"determined and prescribed by a physician ... which the qualified individual may choose to self-administer to bring about his or her death due to a terminal disease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( \u00a7 443.1, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   A patient is a qualified individual and may obtain a prescription for an aid-in-dying drug if they reside in California, have been diagnosed with a terminal disease, have the capacity to make medical decisions, voluntarily request a prescription, and have the physical and mental ability to self-administer the drug. ( \u00a7\u00a7 443.1, subd. (o) ; 443.2.) A terminal disease is \"an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, result in death within six months.\" (\u00a7 433.1, subd. (q).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   A patient's request for a prescription for an aid-in-dying drug must be repeated and take a specific form. The patient must make two oral requests, separated by at least 15 days, and one written request, all to their attending physician. ( \u00a7 443.3, subd. (a).) The written request must be in the form set out in section 443.11 and must be signed and dated in the presence of two witnesses. ( \u00a7 443.3, subd. (b)(1) &amp; (2).) The witnesses must, among other things, attest they know the patient or have proof of the patient's identity and they believe the patient to be of sound mind and not acting under duress, fraud, or undue influence. ( \u00a7 443.3, subd. (b)(3).) Only one family member may serve as a witness, and no person serving as the attending physician, consulting physician, or mental health care\n   specialist may do so. ( \u00a7 443.3, subds. (c)(1) &amp; (d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The act heavily regulates the conditions under which an attending physician may prescribe an aid-in-dying drug. Before doing so, the physician must determine whether the patient is a qualified individual, has a terminal disease, has the capacity to make medical decisions, and has made a voluntary request\n   using a form with required content. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a).) Each of these conditions is delineated elsewhere in the statute. If the physician determines the patient shows indications of a mental disorder, they must refer the patient for a mental health specialist assessment. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(1)(A)(i).) The physician must confirm the patient is making an informed decision by discussing the diagnosis and prognosis, potential risks and the probable result of ingesting the drug, the possibility they may obtain the drug but not take it, and other treatment options like comfort care, hospice care, palliative care, and pain control. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(2)(A)-(E).) They must also discuss with the patient whether they're feeling coerced or unduly influenced to confirm the decision was not the result of coercion. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The attending physician must then refer the patient to a consulting physician for a second opinion. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(3).) The consulting physician must examine the patient and relevant medical records, confirm the attending physician's diagnosis and prognosis, and independently determine the patient has the capacity to make medical decisions, is acting voluntarily, and has made an informed decision. ( \u00a7 443.6, subds. (a) - (c).) Like the attending physician, the consulting physician must refer the patient for a mental health specialist assessment if they show indications of a mental disorder. ( \u00a7 443.6, subd. (d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   If either physician refers the patient to a mental health specialist, the specialist must examine the patient and relevant medical records and independently determine whether the patient has the capacity to make medical decisions, act voluntarily, and make informed decisions. ( \u00a7 443.7, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) Further, the mental health specialist must determine whether the individual is suffering from impaired judgment due to a mental disorder. ( \u00a7 443.7, subd. (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Various additional provisions protect patients from being coerced into requesting or taking an aid-in-dying drug. Contractual provisions are not valid if they affect whether a person may make, withdraw, or rescind a request for an aid-in-dying drug. (\u00a7 443.12.) Policies for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities, as well as health care service and health benefit plans may not be conditioned upon or affected by a person making or rescinding a request for an aid-in-dying drug. (\u00a7 443.12, subd. (a).) Insurance carriers are not permitted to provide information to individuals about the availability of an aid-in-dying drug unless the insured has requested the information, either personally or through their attending physician. ( \u00a7 443.13, subd. (c).) A patient's attending physician, consulting physician, and mental health specialist may not be \"related to the individual by blood, marriage, registered domestic partnership, or adoption, or be entitled to a portion of the individual's estate upon death.\" ( \u00a7 443.17, subd. (d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The statute also bars outright coercion or fraud. \"Knowingly altering or forging a request for an aid-in-dying drug to end an individual's life without his or her authorization or concealing or destroying a withdrawal or rescission of a request for an aid-in-dying drug is punishable as a felony if the act is done with the intent or effect of causing the individual's death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   ( \u00a7 443.17, subd. (a).) \"Knowingly coercing or exerting undue influence on an individual to request or ingest an aid-in-dying drug for the purpose of ending his or her life or to destroy a withdrawal or rescission of a request, or to administer an aid-in-dying drug to an individual without his or her knowledge or consent, is punishable as a felony.\" ( \u00a7 443.17, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   If the patient satisfies all the statutory conditions, the attending physician may prescribe an aid-in-dying drug to the patient. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (b).) The patient may then self-administer the drug. ( \u00a7\u00a7 443.1, subd. (b) ; 443.13, subd. (a)(2); 443.14, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Physicians and other health care providers who provide services under EOLOA are immune from all forms of liability and discipline, including discipline as an employee or independent contractor, as I discuss in more detail in the part III.B. below, so long as they act professionally. ( \u00a7\u00a7 443.14, subd. (c) ; 443.16, subd. (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   However, health care providers are free to abstain from providing services under EOLOA. ( \u00a7 443.14, subd. (e)(1).) And if they are conscientious objectors, health care providers are immune from liability and discipline for refusing to participate in EOLOA services, including for \"refusing to inform a patient regarding his or her rights under this part, and not referring an individual to a physician who participates in activities authorized under [EOLOA].\" ( \u00a7 443.14, subd.

They asserted three causes of action. The first and second causes of action alleged EOLOA violates principles of equal protection and due process under the state constitution by removing protections for terminal patients that apply to everyone else and creating a process that can lead to waiver of the fundamental right to life without adequate procedural protections. ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.) The third cause of action alleged the Legislature acted beyond the power granted by the Governor's proclamation when it enacted EOLOA. ( Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 3.)

The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings on that claim. First, it held the plaintiffs had standing to bring the challenge. \"The plaintiffs in this case are doctors whose actions are not only covered under the Act, but who have a close enough relationship to their patients to bring them within the ambit of the Act\" and, in addition, \"the Act impacts terminally ill patients who are not in a position to challenge the law because their illnesses and their shortened life expectancy present significant obstacles in bringing suit themselves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On the constitutional challenge, the trial court ruled for plaintiffs as a matter of law. \"[T]he End of Life Option Act ('Act') was passed by a special session of the Legislature in violation of Article IV \u00a7 3(b) of the California Constitution because the Act is not encompassed by any 'reasonable construction' of the Proclamation granting the special session the authority to legislate.\" The court then entered judgment for plaintiffs, permanently enjoining the state from recognizing or enforcing EOLOA and the District Attorney from recognizing exceptions to the criminal laws EOLOA had created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The equal protection and due process claims were queued up for trial at the time the trial court ruled on the Legislature's authority to enact EOLOA, and the trial court did not address them in its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The majority develops two arguments for why the trial court erred by holding the pleadings establish plaintiffs have standing. One is the complaint fails to allege any form of standing-personal, third party, associational, or public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 263-67.) The other is the state parties' general denial of plaintiffs' allegations put the issue of standing in dispute, precluding judgment on the pleadings in plaintiffs' favor. (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 263-64.) I disagree with my colleagues because they read the\n   complaint too narrowly and, even assuming their narrow interpretation were correct, place far too much importance on the standing question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Who Are Participating Physicians Pled Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   I believe the majority is simply wrong about the adequacy of plaintiffs' complaint on standing. The individual plaintiffs allege they \"are physicians who treat patients meeting the Act's definition of having a terminal disease. They bring this action to protect the rights of their patients to be protected by law ... and from being assisted and abetted in committing suicide, from receiving substandard medical care, and from having depression and mental conditions leading to suicide left untreated.\" The association plaintiff alleges it \"represents thousands of member doctors and health-care professionals nationwide\" including \"California physicians whose patients meet the Act's definition of having a terminal disease.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   These allegations, if proven, would establish the individual members and some association members are physicians whose conduct is regulated by the newly enacted provisions of EOLOA. The physicians practice medicine in California and treat terminal patients. EOLOA heavily regulates the practice of medicine in California as it affects such patients and their physicians. To start, the act defines \"terminal disease\" narrowly as \"an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, result in death within six months.\" (\u00a7\u00a7 433.1, subd. (q); 443.5, subd. (a).) The provision therefore regulates the physician-patient relationship at the outset simply by classifying some patients as terminal and others as nonterminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   For patients who satisfy the definition and request an aid-in-dying drug, EOLOA's regulations pervade the physician-patient relationship. Before a physician can prescribe an aid-in-dying drug, they must determine whether the patient has the capacity to make medical decisions and\n   has made a voluntary request in an approved form. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a).) They must determine whether the patient shows indications of a mental disorder, and if so refer them for a mental health assessment. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(1)(A)(i).) They must confirm the patient is making an informed decision by discussing the diagnosis and prognosis, potential risks of the drug, advise about other treatment options, and discuss with the patient whether they're feeling coerced or unduly influenced to confirm the decision was not the result of coercion. ( \u00a7\u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(2)(A)-(E) ; 443.5, subd. (a)(4).) In the end, they must refer the patient for a second opinion. ( \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(3).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In simple terms, the new legislation directly regulates the medical practice of any plaintiff-physician who treats terminal patients and participates in\n   providing aid-in-dying services. The existing allegations are therefore sufficient to satisfy any obligation the plaintiffs had to plead personal standing. (\n   <em>\n    California Water &amp; Telephone Co. v.

( \u00a7 443.14, subd. (e)(1) ; see also \u00a7 443.14, subd. (e)(2).) But the complaint does not allege the plaintiffs are conscientious objectors, nor do the provisions that allow and protect conscientious objectors appear in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The majority's assumption is most clearly on display when they quote approvingly from the state's petition to show the physician-plaintiffs have not pled third-party standing as representatives of their patients. \" 'If neither the real party physicians nor their patients want aid-in-dying to be a part of their professional relationship, then neither group suffers any injury due to the Act. Alternatively, if the real party physicians do not want to provide aid-in-dying, but their patients do want aid-in-dying, the physicians' interests are not aligned with those of their patients and third-party standing would not lie.' \" (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 264.) Framing the issue this way obscures the fact the physician-plaintiffs are objecting to, among other things, the\n   <em>\n    way\n   </em>\n   they are required to deliver aid-in-dying services under EOLOA. And it ignores the allegations saying they seek to avoid being complicit in harming patients who ask for prescriptions for aid-in-dying drugs, but who should not and would not do so under a better regulatory regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   On appeal from a judgment on the pleadings, we assume the truth of the allegations and liberally construe all properly pled factual allegations in the complaint.

Moreover, a complaint may set out alternate\n   theories and even inconsistent allegations. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20525\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The majority's approach violates these principles by construing the allegations narrowly and discounting facts the allegations obviously imply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   For example, the plaintiffs allege \"predicting life expectancy is crude and fraught with subjective judgment ... [and] predictions for life-expectancy are frequently wrong, and often extremely so.\" It is reasonable to infer from this allegation that plaintiffs believe EOLOA's definition of terminal disease places them at risk as the physicians of people diagnosed with terminal diseases of prescribing aid-in-dying drugs to patients who are \"terminal\" only in the statutory sense, and that they will therefore wrongly hasten the death of patients, a harm to themselves as doctors and, obviously, to their patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The plaintiffs also allege EOLOA's provisions put them at risk of prescribing aid-in-dying drugs to patients who are suffering from illness-induced depression. \"Most persons who commit suicide do so as a result of depression, but most physicians are not specially trained in diagnosing depression. Indeed, participating physicians need not be qualified or trained to evaluate or determine whether an individual is burdened by mental impairment. Nevertheless, the Act requires that prescribing physicians determine whether a [patient with a terminal disease] has any 'indications of a mental disorder.' For most [such patients], the participating physician's determination, requiring no assessments, evaluations, questionnaires, or medical history on depression, anxiety or other mental disorders, will be their only mental health assessment before being given lethal drugs intended to end their lives.\" Because \"[j]udgment-impairing depression and anxiety disorders, which are common among individuals deemed terminally ill, are frequently impossible to detect absent in-depth psychiatric evaluation,\" the act's provisions make it likely they will, as physicians treating terminal patients, prescribe aid-in-dying drugs to patients who made their decisions out of illness-induced and temporary depression, causing them to wrongly hasten the death of their patients-again, an injury to the physicians and their patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Those interests, if proven, would give physicians who are providing aid-in-dying services standing to challenge EOLOA as ultra vires legislation. Because plaintiffs also allege they have terminal patients and such patients are not able to safeguard their own interests due to their illnesses, the same allegations, if proven, would give them third-party standing.

Finally, since the association alleges it has such member physicians, the physicians' interests are germane to the association's purpose, and neither the claim nor the relief requires the participation of the individual members, the allegations, if proven, would give it associational standing.

That's not the case here. Six individual plaintiff-physicians and a plaintiff-association with numerous member-physicians challenge EOLOA's constitutionality. Discovery may ultimately show some of those physicians are pure conscientious objectors, whereas others continue to serve their terminal patients and prescribe aid-in-dying drugs despite their qualms. On the other hand, discovery may show-as the majority assumes-that all the physicians are conscientious objectors, which would limit the theories plaintiffs could pursue at trial. In any event, we cannot make that decision on the pleadings; if the case is to go forward we must allow the plaintiffs to develop both theories in discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Nonparticipating Physicians Can Plead Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   I also believe the main opinion misinterprets provisions of the statute which nonparticipating physicians point to as giving them standing. Ultimately, I conclude the complaint fails to articulate these theories. I write separately because I believe the main opinion's analysis muddies the waters and to explain why I do not believe the majority should make so much out of the pleading problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Justice Fields indicates his agreement with my statutory analysis. (Conc. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 268 [\"The concurring/dissenting opinion carefully demonstrates what the Ahn parties may plead to demonstrate a justiciable controversy\"].) So, to the extent the main opinion disagrees, that position is not part of the majority holding, and the plaintiffs are free to seek leave to amend along the lines I outline, provided such allegations have factual support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Plaintiffs could establish standing based on the fact EOLOA stops them from controlling whether their employees or independent contractors tell terminal patients about the availability of aid-in-dying services or refer them to participating physicians. The statute plainly forbids principal-physicians from disciplining their health care provider employees and independent\n   contractors for providing terminal patients information about their EOLOA rights or referring them to physicians who are willing to provide aid-in-dying services. \"[A] health care provider shall not be subject to ... employment [or] ... contractual liability, ... sanction, or penalty or other liability for participating in this part, including, but not limited to, ... providing information to an individual regarding this part, and providing a referral to a physician who participates in this part.\" ( \u00a7 443.14.) If that weren't clear enough, a later provision is even more explicit. \"A health care provider may not be sanctioned for ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... [p]roviding information about the End of Life Option Act to a patient upon the request of the individual ... [or] [\u00b6] ... [p]roviding an individual, upon request, with a referral to another physician.\" ( \u00a7 443.16.) These two provisions establish a principal-physician can do nothing if a health care provider they employ or contract with provides information or referrals under EOLOA to patients who have a terminal disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The statute\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   allow nonparticipating health care providers to \"prohibit its employees, independent contractors, or other persons or entities, including other health care providers, from\n   <em>\n    participating\n   </em>\n   in activities\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   related to aid-in-dying services while acting within the scope of their employment. ( \u00a7 443.15, subd. (a), italics added.) But the statute limits such \"[p]articipating ... in activities\" to serving as an attending physician, a consulting physician, a mental health specialist, a person providing the aid-in-dying drug or prescription, or being present when a person takes the drug. ( \u00a7 443.15, subd. (f)(2)(A)-(E), respectively). So, a nonparticipating physician\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   direct their employees and independent contractors, including those who are health care providers, not to serve in any of those roles while on the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   However, the statute does not allow nonparticipating physicians to silence their employees and independent contractors when it comes to providing information and making referrals. On the contrary, the same provision allowing them to limit their employees and contractors from filling certain roles, specifically\n   <em>\n    excludes\n   </em>\n   providing information and referrals from the principal's right of control. Section 443.15 bars principal-physicians from ordering employees and contractors to withhold information from terminal patients about their options under EOLOA. ( \u00a7 443.15, subd. (f)(3)(B).) It also bars principal-physicians from ordering employees and contractors to refuse to refer terminal patients to health care providers who are not conscientious objectors. ( \u00a7 443.15, subd. (f)(3)(C).) Taken together, all these provisions ( \u00a7\u00a7 443.14 ; 443.15; 443.16) create a safety valve to make it less likely patients with terminal diseases will be shut off from treatment permitted under EOLOA simply because they chose a physician who objects to\n   aid-in-dying services. Notwithstanding the principal-physician's scruples, an employee or contractor may inform the patient of her rights under EOLOA and refer her to a physician who is not a conscientious objector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Indeed, under section 443.16, subdivision (b), an employee or contractor may even serve as an attending physician, consulting physician, a mental health specialist, a person providing the aid-in-dying drug or prescription, and be present when a person takes the drug, so long as they are acting outside their relationship with the conscientious objector. \"A health care provider that prohibits activities under this part in accordance with Section 443.15 shall not sanction an individual health care provider for contracting with a qualified individual to engage in activities authorized by this part if the individual health care provider is acting outside the course and scope of his or her capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the prohibiting health care provider.\" (\u00a7 433.16, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   These provisions obviously represent a policy choice by the Legislature. They chose to give conscientious objectors the right to opt out of providing services under EOLOA. But they judged it necessary to ensure patients would not be blocked from receiving aid-in-dying services simply because they elected a nonparticipating physician earlier in treatment. The Legislature accomplished this end by expressly limiting the powers of nonparticipating physicians to control their employees and independent contractors. They may direct their health care professionals not to act to deliver aid-in-dying services, but they cannot direct their employees (including doctors and nurses) not to diagnose terminal illnesses, provide information about aid-in-dying services, or refer patients to other health care providers who provide such services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor may they bar their health\n   care professionals from contracting to provide aid-in-dying services elsewhere. Thus, the Legislature let physicians and health care businesses choose to be conscientious objectors, but also ensured their terminal patients could obtain information and referrals by limiting the objectors' control over their employees and contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   If plaintiffs in this case employ or contract with health care providers, these provisions obviously have a direct effect on how they are permitted to run their businesses. They can run a shop that refuses to provide aid-in-dying services, but they cannot direct their employees and contractors to refuse to\n   promote or enable the delivery of aid-in-dying services for their patients. If that is the situation plaintiffs face, they can amend their pleadings to establish they have a direct interest in challenging EOLOA. (See\n   <em>\n    Garcetti v.

This is a non sequitur. All nonparticipating physicians need to plead standing is they have some employees, whether \"health care providers\" or not, whom they are barred from binding with a conscientious objector policy. A person can be a health care provider-which includes, among other professionals, physicians, surgeons, psychiatrists, registered nurses, and paramedics-\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   be an employee or independent contractor. ( \u00a7 443.1, subd. (h).) Sections 443.14 and 443.16 use the term \"health care providers\" instead of \"employees and contractors\" because they apply beyond the employment and contracting context. For example, they protect employers and principals,\n   <em>\n    as well as\n   </em>\n   employees and contractors, from criminal prosecution, loss\n   of credentials, discipline by professional organizations, or removal from the medical staff of another health care institution.

There can be no question, in the face of this provision, that sections 443.14, 443.15, and 443.16 all protect at least physicians, surgeons, psychiatrists, and registered nurses who are employees and independent contractors from discipline or sanctions by their employers or principals. By putting these provisions in place, the Legislature has placed limits on how health care businesses of any size may treat their employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The main opinion comes close to the same conclusion when they write, \"a hospital ... that seeks to penalize health care providers under its jurisdiction who participate in assisted suicide would seem to have standing.\" (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 267, citing \u00a7 443.14, subd. (c).) But hospitals are not the only employers of health care providers. Since some individual physicians operate their own businesses and employ and contract with other physicians and nurses, the majority too is committed to finding plaintiffs in this case have standing if they would penalize health care providers in their employ who participate in providing aid-in-dying services. As I noted above, Justice Fields' concurrence indicates his agreement with this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   So, all nonparticipating physicians would have to do to establish standing is plead they operate businesses providing services to patients who may qualify as terminal under EOLOA and they would bar people who work for them from providing information or referrals related to aid-in-dying services. Even the main opinion endorses the view that nonparticipating physicians can allege standing by pleading they employ or contract with other physicians, surgeons, psychiatrists, or nurses and would bar them from providing such information or referrals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   These points raise a second way the plaintiffs who are nonparticipating physicians are very likely to establish standing to challenge EOLOA as ultra vires legislation. If plaintiffs operate their businesses as conscientious objectors, they will lose business to competing health care providers who provide aid-in-dying services. The Legislature has effectively opened a new dimension of competition among health care providers who serve patients who may at some point in their treatment be diagnosed with a terminal disease. Such patients will pursue many other treatment options before they are diagnosed with a terminal disease, and their physicians can provide such treatment whether they object to or approve of aid-in-dying services. (See Amicus Brief of Andrea Saltzman at pp. 10-11 [discussing cancer treatments and patient-physician relationship before and after terminal diagnosis] and attached declaration at pp. 15-17 [same].) But the moment a\n   physician diagnoses a patient as terminal, the relationship changes for a patient interested in aid-in-dying services.\n   The attending physician is the person who would prescribe the aid-in-dying drug, and if that physician is a conscientious objector he or she may no longer be willing to continue serving as the patient's physician. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also \u00a7 443.1 [defining \"attending physician\" as \"the physician who has primary responsibility for the health care of an individual and treatment of the individual's terminal disease\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Changing doctors at that late stage of treatment would be disruptive, and for that reason it is a near certainty patients who care will choose compatible health care providers\n   <em>\n    long before\n   </em>\n   receiving a terminal diagnosis. For the same reason, other health care providers are unlikely to refer potential patients to a nonparticipating physician without disclosing that fact to the potential patient. That means nonparticipating physicians who regularly treat patients with terminal diseases will lose patients and business because of EOLOA, an interest sufficient to establish standing to challenge whether the Legislature was authorized to enact the legislation.

The trial court concluded \"[t]he plaintiffs in this case are doctors whose actions are not only covered under the Act, but who have a close enough relationship to their patients to bring them within the ambit of the Act ... [and] the Act impacts terminally ill patients who are not in a position to challenge the law because their illnesses and their shortened life expectancy present significant obstacles in bringing suit themselves.\" I agree these allegations were sufficient to plead standing, however, alleging something doesn't make it true. Unless the state admitted or failed to contest the standing allegations, the trial court could not at the pleading stage make the ultimate determination that plaintiffs had established standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   As it happens, the state parties did contest standing. Both the Attorney General and the District Attorney specifically denied plaintiffs' standing allegations on the ground they lacked information sufficient to form a belief\n   as to their truth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Belt and suspenders, the state parties also asserted the plaintiffs lack standing as an affirmative defense. The state's specific denials operate to raise material issues of fact as to standing, and it was therefore error for the trial court to enter judgment on the pleadings in favor of plaintiffs.

For all these reasons, it is a near certainty standing would be determined no earlier than summary judgment, and more likely only after trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Standing is No Barrier to Deciding EOLOA is Constitutional\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Unlike my colleagues, I see no point in sending this litigation back to the trial court for plaintiffs to do a better job pleading standing and, more importantly, develop facts to prove it. By insisting on that route, we leave a cloud hanging over the statute, and thereby abandon interested patients, loved ones, physicians, and other health care workers to continuing uncertainty. I believe these circumstances counsel that we resolve the merits of the plaintiffs' cause of action now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Justice Fields believes there's no reason to be concerned with delay because our opinion vacates the judgment, leaving the parties with \"the same rights they had at the inception of this action.\" (Conc. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 269.) That's not good enough. The inception of this action casts doubt on the rights and protections EOLOA provided. Though we could dispel the uncertainty, the majority chooses to leave it in place. Patients who may want to avail themselves of the act will continue to make these important decisions under\n   conditions of uncertainty. They may feel rushed to act and even choose to ingest the drugs early. Family members may justly fear they will be deprived of life insurance proceeds if the protections of EOLOA go away again. And doctors may be reluctant to provide prescriptions because a court may abruptly remove their immunity. All these considerations and others counsel the courts to act with alacrity, not merely with \"all deliberate speed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    We have the discretion to reach the merits and uphold EOLOA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Fortunately, we can do so. It goes without saying the trial court had the discretion and authority to rule EOLOA constitutional as a matter of law without first resolving the issue of standing. Unlike for the plaintiffs, there is no sense in which the state parties were required to address standing as a threshold issue. Once the plaintiffs raised the purely legal constitutional question by filing its motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court gained the power to decide the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Of course, since plaintiffs do have to satisfy the court that they are appropriate plaintiffs to obtain the relief they seek, and because, as I've discussed above, the standing issue could not be decided without factual development, the trial court could dispose of the case on the pleadings only if it ruled the constitutional challenge had no merit. I will explain why I believe the trial court should have reached that constitutional conclusion in part IV below. For now, my point is only that dismissing the cause of action without first reaching the standing issue was within the trial court's discretion and authority. Moreover, doing so would have been far more efficient than abstaining from ruling on the constitutional issue to allow the parties to first conduct discovery on standing and then dispute it at summary judgment or even at trial. That is, in essence, what the majority is doing now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The statute granting authority to enter judgment on the pleadings makes the\n   same point very clear. To rule for a moving plaintiff, \"the complaint [must] state[ ] facts sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of action against the defendant and the answer [must] not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.\" ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438, subd (c)(1)(A).) But to rule in favor of the defendant, \"\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   of the following conditions [must] exist: [\u00b6] ... The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint [or] [\u00b6] ... The complaint\n   <em>\n    does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\n   </em>\n   against that defendant.\" ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438, subd. (c)(1)(B), italics added [when the court grants judgment on the pleadings on defendant's motion]; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438, subd. (c)(3)(B) [when the court grants judgment on the pleadings on its own motion].) These provisions allow the trial court to grant judgment on the\n   pleadings in favor of the state parties if the pleadings establish as a matter of law that plaintiffs could not establish standing\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the constitutional violation. Since standing was disputed, but the constitutional claim itself is faulty, the court could have and should have entered judgment on the pleadings in the state's favor. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438, subd. (c)(3)(B) [court may grant judgment on the pleadings for defendant on its own motion].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   We have discretion to rule EOLOA constitutional on appeal for similar reasons. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906 [\"the reviewing court may review the verdict or decision ... which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from ... and may affirm, reverse or modify any judgment or order appealed from and may direct the proper judgment or order to be entered\"].) The trial court ruled on the issue, holding \"the End of Life Option Act ('Act') was passed by a special session of the Legislature in violation of Article IV \u00a7 3(b) of the California Constitution because the Act is not encompassed by any 'reasonable construction' of the Proclamation granting the special session the authority to legislate.\" The ruling concerns the interpretation of the Governor's proclamation, the statute, and a constitutional provision, so it's a purely legal question. What's more, the parties raised, briefed, and argued the constitutional issue extensively in the trial court and in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Indeed, on appeal, they focused on the constitutional issue almost to the exclusion of the standing issue. The state parties limited their discussion of standing to three and a half pages at the end of their 44-page amended petition and five pages in their 30-page traverse. The plaintiffs used only five and a half pages at the end of their 46-page return, and the Fairchild intervenors did not discuss standing at all. Several amicus briefs focus solely on the constitutional merits. Finally, the parties addressed the merits at oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Since we may rule on any legally adequate and dispositive ground which the parties raised in the trial court and on appeal, I would set the unresolved standing question to one side and reach the merits of the constitutional challenge. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    We could reach the merits even to find EOLOA unconstitutional\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   I recognize why my colleagues would be hesitant to address the merits if they believed EOLOA was unconstitutional. As a court, we should tread lightly when asked to resolve questions that are not-or not yet-ready for adjudication, especially so when we are asked to invalidate an act of a co-equal branch of the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \"The principle that courts will not entertain an action which is not founded on an actual controversy is a tenant of common\n   law jurisprudence. ... The concept of justiciability involves the intertwined criteria of ripeness and standing. A controversy is 'ripe' when it has reached, but has not passed, the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made. One who invokes the judicial process does not have 'standing' if he, or those whom he properly represents, does not have a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because the actor has neither suffered nor is about to suffer any injury of sufficient magnitude reasonably to assure that all of the relevant facts and issues will be adequately presented.\" (\n   <em>\n    California Water\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 253 Cal.App.2d at pp. 22-23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20618\">\n    61 Cal.Rptr. 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   As this court long ago recognized, \"In cases challenging governmental actions, the standing requirement is the rudder that allows courts to navigate between two equally objectionable hazards. On the one side is the risk that the judiciary will impinge upon the powers of the other branches of government by issuing advisory opinions. A court cannot reach out on its own to review the actions of the executive or the Legislature. The validity of such actions may only be passed upon when challenged by a litigant whose legal rights have been violated thereby. 'The province of the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals.' [Citation.] Were the courts to stray too far towards the advisory opinion hazard we would approach 'that state of affairs where standing may be conferred on a plaintiff whose only concern is concern itself.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Stocks v.

I think the standing problems the majority has identified are technical and temporary and do not warrant abandoning the public to continued uncertainty. Even if I agreed with the majority's conclusion the complaint limits plaintiffs to the theory they have been injured as physicians who refuse to participate in providing aid-in-dying services, it is obvious they can easily overcome the defect. If they return to the trial court, they will simply seek leave to amend. Both parties acknowledged this likelihood at oral argument, and the majority's disposition leaves that path open. Moreover, I expect they will succeed in convincing the trial court, in its discretion,\n   to allow amendment, because there are theories under which the plaintiffs will be able to plead and prove standing for purposes of bringing their challenge to EOLOA as ultra vires legislation.

Thus, even if the majority were inclined to rule EOLOA\n   <em>\n    unconstitutional\n   </em>\n   ,\n   there is no jurisdictional bar to the majority reaching the merits. There is, however, every practical reason for doing so.

The line of cases I suggest we follow say the courts may exercise their discretion to resolve disputes in the face of traditional standing problems in rare and extraordinary cases\n   which raise important issues of interest to the public. Everyone-from the plaintiffs, to the state, to amicus curiae, to the majority itself-admits this is such a case. We should resolve it now, one way or the other, without fear that doing so will commit us to reviewing the constitutionality of legislative enactments of lesser magnitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   At bottom, even if you are inclined to rule the statute unconstitutional, deciding whether to entertain the merits of this case is a prudential call, subject to our discretion as a court. Because the majority simply delays resolution out of a concern for technical compliance, and because the issue posed is wholly legal and a matter of substantial public interest, I believe they've made the wrong choice. I would reach the merits now, regardless whether we uphold or strike down the law. However, for the reasons I set out in the next section, I would find the Legislature acted within the scope of the Governor's proclamation when it enacted EOLOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The majority labors to tie themselves to the standing mast and resist plaintiffs' siren song. I find their attempts to restrain our actions unconvincing. First, the majority claims we should be \"guided by the familiar principle ... that 'we do not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so to dispose the matter before us.' \" (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 263 [quoting\n   <em>\n    Facebook, Inc. v.

There's no such principle. The majority's quotation is misleading, and the ellipsis is everything. What they leave out is \"we should address and resolve statutory issues prior to, and if possible, instead of, constitutional questions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Facebook, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1275, fn. 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514577\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/233/77/#p1275\">\n    233 Cal.Rptr.3d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514577\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/233/77/#p1275\">\n    417 P.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In other words, the familiar principle is the canon of statutory construction which recommends \"where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\" (\n   <em>\n    DeBartolo Corp. v.

We are not faced with conflicting interpretations of statutory language, one of which would invalidate the statute. We are deciding whether we may reach a constitutional issue in the face of uncertainty about the plaintiffs' standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Second, the majority cites several cases characterizing standing as \"jurisdictional\" at least to the extent the issue may be raised at any time during the life of a case. (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 261-62.) Contrary to the majority's argument, these cases did not overrule\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   or import the federal article III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   standing requirement into California law. Indeed, none of them even addresses the question whether the courts have discretion to hear a cause where standing is in question. Most inapt among these cases is\n   <em>\n    People ex rel.

The court abstained because the attorney general, by his own admission, sought a pure advisory opinion \"on behalf of the People of the State of California\" because \" '[t]he various clerks, sheriffs, and marshals of the State of California [who issue and serve writs of attachment] ... wish to be advised as to what the law is.' \" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=464%20P.2d%20126\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) That's not the circumstance we face at all. Nor was there any question in\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   whether the issue presented justified easing up on standing requirements, because the court ruled the very same statutory provisions\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   violate due process in two companion cases issued the same day.

(Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 262.) They do so to avoid the Supreme Court's admonition that \"[i]f the issue of justiciability is in doubt, it should be resolved in favor of justiciability in cases of public interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    National Audubon Society v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1983)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4638367\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/33/419/#p432\">\n    33 Cal.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433, fn. 14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20346\">\n    189 Cal.Rptr. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=658%20P.2d%20709\">\n    658 P.2d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 261-62.) The majority pays lip service to the principle, but demurs, \"A court cannot resort to this rule ... when it has no doubt that standing is absent.\" (Maj. opn.\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 261-62.) Even if they were correct on this point-and\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   and the other cases I discuss show they are not-ours is not such a case. All we can say is we don't yet know whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove standing. In other words, standing is in doubt. In a case of such broad public interest that means we should proceed to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Finally, a related point. The majority appears to hold the view the courts cannot resolve the purely legal question whether EOLOA was an ultra vires act by the Legislature until we know for certain the plaintiffs have standing to bring that action. As I've discussed above, in this case such certainty is not likely to arrive until trial. Does the majority believe the courts can't reach the purely legal question of EOLOA's constitutionality under article IV, section 3 of the California Constitution until a jury has decided the plaintiffs have standing? That appears to be the implication of their argument, but there's simply no basis for it. The trial court could have ruled the statute constitutional without reaching a decision on standing. ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438.) If it had, we could have affirmed on the constitutional ground. (\n   <em>\n    Krolikowski v.

The plaintiffs claim the Legislature, by enacting EOLOA, exceeded the authority the Governor conferred and therefore violated the constitution's directive that, during a special session, the Legislature \"has power to legislate only on subjects specified in the proclamation.\" ( Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 3 (b).)

The first five subjects are specific. Three relate to funding for MediCal, In-Home Supportive Services, and rate increase for providers of Medi-Cal and developmental disability services. (Proclamation p. 1.) Two others relate to ensuring rate increases expand access to services and increasing oversight and management of services for consumers with developmental disabilities. (Proclamation p. 2.) EOLOA plainly does not come within the scope of any of these subjects, nor do plaintiffs claim it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The question is whether the aid-in-dying legislation comes within the final approved subject in the proclamation, \"legislation necessary to [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... [i]mprove the efficiency and efficacy of the health care system, reduce the cost of providing health care services, and improve the health of Californians.\" (Proclamation p. 2.) This provision is general and has no explicit tie to funding, which leads me to conclude the Legislature was, if nothing else, reasonable in its determination that the proclamation permitted it to consider topics related to health care services even if they were not directly tied to funding. It is reasonable to read that general topic as extending to\n   <em>\n    any subject\n   </em>\n   germane to improving the effective delivery of health care services to benefit California residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The question we face, then, is whether the Legislature was reasonable to conclude the\n   <em>\n    aid-in-dying legislation\n   </em>\n   concerns a subject germane to improving the effective delivery of health care services to benefit California residents. In my opinion, the Legislature acted reasonably. In the first place, the legislation thoroughly regulates an aspect of the physician-patient relationship. It limits what counts as a terminal disease to \"an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, result in death within six months.\" ( \u00a7 443.1, subd. (q).) In so doing, it chooses who may obtain aid-in-dying services, barring physicians from prescribing aid-in-dying drugs to patients with less dire prognoses. The statute also exhaustively lays out for participating physicians how to proceed when considering whether to prescribe an aid-in-dying drug. The physicians must take great care in diagnosing their\n   patients, advising them of their options, ensuring they can make an informed decision, and confirming they are not operating under undue influence. In my view, the Legislature could reasonably have concluded these provisions concern the effective delivery of health care services to Californians.\n   Indeed, it is hard to imagine taking the contrary view, unless you simply reject the idea that aid-in-dying services can constitute a form of health care. I don't believe that view is sustainable. More relevant to the issue here, I don't believe the Legislature was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to take that view of health care. It is true a patient and a physician who are considering a prescription for an aid-in-dying drug have reached the point where they are no longer attempting treatments aimed at\n   <em>\n    curing\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    abating\n   </em>\n   the underlying disease. Such drugs are available only to a patient whose physician believes will die within six months. Before EOLOA, such patients and their physicians would have considered other treatments to mitigate suffering, such as comfort care, hospice care, palliative care, and pain control. These services are health care services, though they don't attempt to cure the patient or address the underlying disease. EOLOA adds another option, one that is especially valuable to patients who, because of their disease, face extended periods of excruciating pain prior to death. I conclude the Legislature did not act arbitrarily in judging that adding this option was germane to health care and the delivery of health care services, and therefore was germane to an approved subject of the special session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   We received an amicus brief and declaration that is helpful on this point. Andrea Saltzman was for many years a licensed California attorney and appellate law specialist who was diagnosed with stage 4 non-smokers lung cancer in 2015. (Amicus Brief of Andrea Saltzman (Amicus Brief) and attached declaration (Declaration) at p. 15.) She recounts her long battle with the disease, including drug therapies, radiation treatments, and surgeries that helped keep the cancer in check with minimal side effects for several years. (Declaration at pp. 15-16.) Despite these initial successes at abatement, she now appears to have developed a resistance to her most recent medication, and is discussing her treatment options with her physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \"My doctor has suggested chemotherapy but, at best, it would only hold off progression of my cancer for a few months, there are serious side effects, and, most important, unlike my targeted therapies, chemotherapy for lung cancer does not work on the brain [where tumors have developed] because of something known as the 'blood-brain barrier.' [\u00b6] ... My oncologist has also discussed palliative care and hospice with me, and these health care options are fully and readily available to me ... [\u00b6] ... I have also discussed the option of medical-aid-in-dying with my oncologist. Although I-not he-first suggested this option, he agrees that it is one of my health care choices-and that it may be the best choice for me ... [\u00b6] ... Ironically, my oncologist received and relayed my last test results to me on the same day we both heard about respondent superior court's ruling in this case. The ruling distressed both of us.\" (Declaration p. 17.) Ms. Saltzman decided to file an amicus brief and declaration and gave them to her oncologist to review for accuracy. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) He said he found no problems with what she said and agreed with her that EOLOA is \"directly related to [her] health care and health.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Ms. Saltzman's declaration and brief provide an example of how EOLOA augments the medical treatment options for patients who face the very worst prognoses\n   and the prospect of extended suffering. As she points out in her brief, the availability of the aid-in-dying drug affects her physical and her mental health. (Amicus Brief at pp. 11-12.) If she reaches the point of deciding to take the drug, she will do so only to avoid enduring an extended period of suffering at the end of her life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11.) In that regard, the aid-in-dying drug is very similar to other forms of health care, such as palliative care and pain control treatments, which seek to minimize suffering prior to death. (See \u00a7 443.5, subd. (a)(2)(E) [requiring physicians to discuss with patients who request a prescription for an aid-in-dying drug other treatment options like comfort care, hospice care, palliative care, and pain control].) It is impossible, with her experience in mind, to conclude the Legislature acted arbitrarily or irrationally in deciding the Governor's proclamation-which granted authority to address health and health care-embraced aid-in-dying legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   I believe we should be especially wary of invading the province of the Legislature when the Legislature itself specifically considered and decided whether the enactment came within the call of the proclamation. The decision to pass the legislation in special session of course itself\n   <em>\n    implies\n   </em>\n   that judgment. But in this case we have more. An Assembly member opponent of the bill appealed a ruling that EOLOA was germane to the call of the proclamation. He argued at some length that the bill was not germane because it had nothing to do with\n   <em>\n    funding\n   </em>\n   health care. The Speaker responded that the bill was germane to\n   <em>\n    health care\n   </em>\n   , and submitted the issue to the Assembly for a vote. The Assembly rejected the appeal and determined the bill was germane to the topics of the proclamation by a vote of 41 to 28. In my view, this history shows the Legislature rejected the interpretation of the proclamation as limiting the special session to health care\n   <em>\n    funding\n   </em>\n   instead of health care generally. The Legislature evidently considered the proclamation to be sufficiently broad to cover the topic of aid-in-dying legislation. The Governor seemingly agreed. (\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 20 Cal.2d at p. 42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20P.2d%20488\">\n    123 P.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Carter, J., concurring) [\"since the Governor could have included such subjects in his proclamation, and he having approved the legislation by signing the bill embracing such subjects, I am forced to conclude that he considered his proclamation sufficiently broad to cover the subjects embraced in the bill\"].) I would not displace their judgment, and therefore would hold the Legislature validly exercised its power when it enacted EOLOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   I emphasize \"[t]he wisdom or desirability of the manner of\" providing aid-in-dying services \"is of course not a question for the judicia[ry]. It is concerned only with the question of interpretation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 20 Cal.2d at p. 40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20P.2d%20488\">\n    123 P.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The last purpose stated in the proclamation's call gave the Legislature power to enact legislation related to improving the delivery of health care services and the health of Californians. The Legislature enacted a\n   law concerned with the delivery of aid-in-dying services and allows services for terminal patients akin to palliative care and pain management care which physicians and other health care providers already supply. From this, I conclude the Legislature acted within its authority when it enacted EOLOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   I agree with the majority's determination the trial court erred in concluding the pleadings established the plaintiffs had standing, and therefore agree with the disposition letting a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its\n   order and the judgment. However, I disagree with the majority's decision to bypass deciding whether the Legislature's enactment of EOLOA was constitutional. Because I conclude EOLOA is constitutional, I would go further and direct the trial court to enter judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' third cause of action (violation of article IV, \u00a7 3 of the California Constitution ).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    The terminology in this area is highly politicized.

Among other problems, those sources are inherently manipulable. \"Aid-in-dying\" is defined in the statute, whereas \"assisted suicide\" is a term in general currency, too broad to be of use in discussing EOLOA. For example, the statute explicitly prohibits \"lethal injection, mercy killing, or active euthanasia,\" all of which are forms of \"assisted suicide\" if directed by the patient.

The plaintiffs' evidence doesn't come into the matter.

The majority misreads the decision. The Supreme Court says plainly there was no current controversy between the parties in interest, but disregarded the defect to reach the merits. The whole point of the collusion was to manufacture a dispute to resolve the doubts of the beneficiaries and trustees about the validity of the public interest trust. The collusiveness of the litigation may make it more egregious, but only as an example of a lawsuit in which there was no case or controversy between interested parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-279\">\n    The majority points out the\n    <em>\n     California Water\n    </em>\n    court also held the plaintiffs had standing.

I agree this case is not a writ of mandate case. However, use of the phrase \"public interest\" in both lines of cases should not cause us to conflate them. The case law committing to the courts' discretion whether to reach the merits of important cases despite justiciability concerns is independent from the case law concerning public interest standing, is not limited to writ of mandate cases, and\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    counsel resolving the constitutional issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-281\">\n    Justice Fields' concurrence emphasizes\n    <em>\n     Weatherford\n    </em>\n    recommends caution in applying the public interest exception to standing in writ of mandate cases.

In any event, the Supreme Court's note of caution is well-taken, and also perfectly consistent with the majority exercising discretion to reach the merits in a case of such profound public interest as this one, even if-as they believe-standing is in doubt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
