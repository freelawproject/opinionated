Here, the question is who has the burden of proof on the \"reasonable manner\" issue when a valid search warrant authorizes the blood draw. This is an issue of first impression in California. We hold that, where the circumstances of the blood draw are typical and routine, i.e., not peculiarly within the knowledge of the People, the burden of proof is on the defendant. (See\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 301.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant is charged with one count of driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and one count of driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent or more. ( Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subds. (a), (b).) After his arrest, his blood was drawn pursuant to a valid search warrant. The trial court granted defendant's Penal Code section 1538.5 ( section 1538.5 ) motion to suppress the results of the blood test because the People had failed to carry their burden of proving that the blood had been drawn in a reasonable manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The People appealed from the interlocutory suppression order to the Appellate Division of the Ventura County Superior Court (Appellate Division). ( \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (j).) The Appellate Division reversed. We granted the petition to transfer to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant does not dispute that he was lawfully arrested for driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. We therefore omit a summary of the facts leading to his arrest. He filed a written motion to suppress evidence alleging: \"The collection of blood, breath, or urine constitutes a search and\n   seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   must be done pursuant to accepted medical practices. [Citations.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the section 1538.5 hearing the only witness was the arresting officer, Michael Ramos. He testified that, after defendant had refused to submit to a breath or blood test, a blood draw was performed pursuant to a search warrant. The warrant was not received in evidence and is not included in the record on appeal. In its opinion below the Appellate Division \"judicially notice[d] that the form DUI search warrant authorized and used by the Ventura Superior Court contains an order mirroring [the] statutory requirement\" of Penal Code section 1524, subdivision (a)(13), which provides that a blood \" 'sample will be drawn from the person in a reasonable, medically approved manner.' \" As to the circumstances of the blood draw, Officer Ramos testified that the blood was drawn in his presence at a hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the parties had rested, defendant argued that the People had failed to carry their \"burden to prove that the blood was taken according to acceptable medical practices.\" The People responded that, because the blood draw was pursuant to a warrant, the burden was on defendant to show that the blood was not drawn in a reasonable manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court suppressed the blood-test results. It explained that, although \"[t]he defense pled in their moving papers that acceptable medical practices must be followed[,] ... [n]o evidence was adduced as to that fact.\" The court denied the People's request to reopen for the purpose of recalling Officer Ramos to establish that the blood had been properly drawn. The court stated: \"[N]one of this is a secret. This is in the moving papers all the time. So the Court saw this coming a mile away. It's a little disappointing the People didn't. The Court's not inclined to allow the People to reopen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Suppression of Evidence Based on The Manner of How a Search Warrant is Executed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[A] search conducted under color of a warrant is not 'reasonable per se,' but may be unreasonable in the constitutional sense on a number of grounds.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Code, \u00a7 1524, subd. (a)(13).) According to the Appellate Division, the warrant included this requirement. Officer Ramos did not personally draw defendant's blood, but he was personally present at the blood draw. We therefore presume that he oversaw the procedure to assure it was performed in a sanitary manner that did not involve pain or trauma. ( Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Furthermore, the blood was drawn at a hospital. Officer Ramos had an official duty to assure that it was drawn by a person who was statutorily authorized to draw blood for the purpose of determining its alcoholic content. Vehicle Code section 23158, subdivision (a) provides in relevant\n   part, \"[O]nly a licensed physician and surgeon, registered nurse, licensed vocational nurse, duly licensed clinical laboratory scientist or clinical laboratory bioanalyst, a person who has been issued a 'certified phlebotomy technician' certificate pursuant to Section 1246 of the Business and Profession Code, unlicensed laboratory personnel regulated pursuant to Sections 1242, 1242.5, and 1246 of the Business and Professions Code, or certified paramedic acting at the request of a peace officer may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content therein.\" We presume that Officer Ramos performed this duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    The Burden of Proof Rests on Defendant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The official duty presumption and the preference accorded to search warrants do not automatically result in placing the burden of proof on defendant. If the relevant facts are peculiarly within the government's knowledge or control so that it is in a much better position than the defendant to present evidence concerning those facts, the burden of proof may rest on the People.
