We hold that it does not. Hence, we shall affirm the order of Allen, J., in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City) which quashed the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On December 20, 1978, pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Constitution Art. V, \u00a7 3, Acting Governor Blair Lee, III, authorized and directed the Attorney General of Maryland to investigate, among other things, \"the administration of medical assistance under the State\u2019s Medicaid Program,\u201d with power \"to present to any grand jury wdiich may have jurisdiction over the matter any evidence and testimony that [the Attorney General might] consider necessary and appropriate to carry out this authorization and directive.\u201d The letter specified that if criminal charges were brought the Attorney General was \"authorized to prosecute in any courts of this State such violations of the law as [might be] disclosed by the investigation with the full powers and authorities possessed by a State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d On November 21, 1979, Governor Harry Hughes issued a similar letter. Pursuant to that authority the Attorney General has created what he calls \"the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit\u201d of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">This saga began when an Assistant Attorney General issued a subpoena duces tecum under what is now codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 592A to a health care provider in one of the counties of Maryland. The health care provider was directed to produce at the office of the Attorney General on September 24, 1981, virtually every document that had ever been connected with the corporate affairs of that provider. These ranged from the original articles of incorporation and corporate by-laws through all records of income and disbursements and all patients\u2019 medical files and financial records. The health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>provider moved to quash the summons. No hearing was held because the Fraud Unit elected to withdraw the summons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On December 14, 1981, upon the application of the Attorney General, the foreman of the Grand Jury of Baltimore City issued a subpoena duces tecum for the production of a number of documents before it. The list was not as all inclusive as in the prior summons. A motion to quash was filed on December 24. The grand jury\u2019s term expired on January 8. A supplement to the motion to quash was filed on February 1. It pointed out that the grand jury which issued the subpoena expired on January 8, that a new grand jury was empaneled on January 11, that \"[t]he challenged subpoena is from the now defunct grand jury,\u201d and contended that \"the defunct status of the issuing grand jury means that the subpoena ... cannot be enforced and must be quashed.\u201d The State met that with a petition to compel compliance with the subpoena. It asserted that the contentions of the health care provider were \"without merit,\u201d and that the court should \"summarily order [the health care provider] to comply with the Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum returnable December 28, 1981.\u201d The subpoena was quashed. The State appealed. We issued a writ of certiorari ex mero motu prior to hearing of this case in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Code (1974) \u00a7 8-107 (c), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides that on petition by the State\u2019s attorney a judge \"may order a grand jury to be continued beyond its term to conduct a particular investigation.\u201d A grand jury so continued \"has every power it originally had but is limited to the investigation specified by the judge.\u201d It \"shall continue until its investigation is completed unless discharged sooner by the judge.\u201d No such petition or order was filed in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>At common law the term of service and the power of a grand jury ended at the expiration of the term of court for which it was summoned. See 38 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Grand Jury </em>\u00a7 31 (1968), and 38 C.J.S. <em>Grand Juries </em>\u00a7 32 a (1943). It must be presumed that, other than what is plainly stated by the General Assembly, no changes in the common law are intended. <em>Bradshaw v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>284 Md. 294, 302, 396 A.2d 255 (1979); <em>M. &amp; C. C. v. Balto. Gas Co., </em>232 Md. 123, 135, 192 A.2d 87 (1963); and <em>Stoll v. Baltimore, </em>163 Md. 282, 293, 162 A. 267 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Annot., 75 A.L.R. 2d 544 (1961), interprets <em>Holt v. Warden, 211 </em>Md. 619, 125 A.2d 842 (1956), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 1008 (1957), as holding that the power of a grand jury extends after expiration of the term of court for which it is called. Its authors simply did not understand the then prevailing Maryland system or statutes. <em>Holt </em>was a habeas corpus case. Judge Henderson said for the Court there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\"Petitioner also claims he was indicted in what was a non-jury term of court. But obviously, a grand jury can be recalled at any time, and the point is not open on <em>habeas corpus </em>in any event. The court did not lose its jurisdiction to impose sentence in the first case, by the delay and end of the term of court. Cf. <em>Miller v. Aderhold, </em>288 U.S. 206, and cases cited.\u201d 211 Md. at 621.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Formerly, many of the circuit courts in the counties of the State had what were called jury terms and non-jury terms. A jury simply was not empaneled for a non-jury term. The grand jury and the petit jury for each jury term were the grand jury and the petit jury for that court until the next ensuing jury term. A case might be tried at a non-jury term by a jury from the preceding jury term. From time to time grand juries were recalled subsequent to the expiration of a jury term but prior to the beginning of the next jury term. The statute in effect at the time of <em>Holt </em>was Code (1951) Art. 51, \u00a7 25. It is the statutory predecessor of our present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u00a7 8-107, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of Holt\u2019s trial the act provided that whenever the jurors for any term of court in the counties had been drawn and the business of the term had so far proceeded that the daily services in attendance of either the grand jury or the petit jury or both was not necessary, then the court was not to finally discharge them but to excuse them \"from further service for the time being until said jury or juries are reconvened for intermediate sessions, as [tjhereinbefore provided, for the balance of said jury term, and until the beginning of the next succeeding jury term of said court.\u201d The act went on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">\"And during the remainder of said jury term of court until the beginning of the next jury term of said court, the grand and petit juries shall meet on every ninth week computed from the first day of said jury term of court unless that day be a legal holiday, in which event they shall meet the next day for indictments or trials, or either.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">There was an exception for St. Mary\u2019s County, among others, from which <em>Holt </em>came, to the effect that the juries were not to meet on every ninth week unless the court informed the clerk to notify them to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">This case is controlled by <em>State v. Sheridan, </em>248 Md. 320, 236 A.2d 18 (1967). The State there sought to have Sheridan compelled to give testimony before a grand jury. By the time the case reached this Court for decision the term of the grand jury before whom Sheridan was sought to be required to testify had ended. Sheridan moved to dismiss the appeal. Chief Judge Hammond said for the Court there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">\"The State\u2019s petition sought to have Sheridan compelled to give further testimony to the Grand Jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>to which he had already given the source of his information. That Grand Jury\u2019s term has ended and it has been discharged. We could do nothing to undo or correct what has taken place and if we approved the lower court\u2019s action it would be an appeal <em>in vacuo. </em>In <em>Ex parte Maulsby, </em>13 Md. 625 [(1859)], a prisoner who had been jailed for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury was ordered released by this Court because the jury had been discharged. The <em>Maulsby </em>holding was applied by the Supreme Court in <em>Shillitani </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 371, 16 L. Ed. 2d 622, 627 [(1966)], which said: Where the grand jury has been finally discharged, a contumacious witness can no longer be confined since he then has no further opportunity to purge himself of contempt.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\"In the leading case of <em>Loubriel v. United States </em>(2nd Cir. [1926]), 9 F. 2d 807, 809, Judge Learned Hand said for the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">'Nor does it make any difference that the order of committal gave him leave to purge himself before another grand jury. Each investigation is separate and independent; it terminates with the grand jury which undertakes it, and the next does not take it up as unfinished business. The order, if it could be construed as a direction to testify before another grand jury, would have been void. *** '*** But the subpoena did not require his attendance before any other than the September grand jury. When that body adjourned, Loubriel was under no further duty to testify, and could, of course, be no longer compelled to discharge a duty which had ended.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">See also <em>Appeal of McClintock Mercantile Co. </em>(7th Cir. [1966]), 360 F. 2d 917, and <em>Graziadei v. United States </em>(7th Cir. [1963]), 319 F.2d 913.\u201d 248 Md. at 322-23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Sheridan </em>is in accordance with the view around the country. <em>See, e.g., </em>Annot. 75 A.L.R. 2d 544, \u00a7 4 (1961); <em>State v. Superior Court In and For County of Pima, </em>4 Ariz. App. 373, 420 P.2d 945 (1966), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>102 Ariz. 388, 430 P.2d 408 (1967); <em>People v. Brautigan, </em>310 Ill. 472, 477-78, 142 N.E. 208 (1923); <em>In re Frye, </em>173 Kan. 392, 396, 246 P.2d 313 (1952); <em>State v. Brown, </em>195 Mo. App. 590, 591-92, 194 S.W. 1069 (1917); and <em>Adami </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>124 Mont. 282, 291, 220 P.2d 1052 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The cases upon which the State relies are not apposite. The grand jury was dead. There was no one to whom the subpoena was returnable. The fact that the subpoena authorized the material to be delivered to the Attorney General does not change the situation. The Attorney General is not the grand jury. As we held in <em>In re Special Investigation No. </em>185, 293 Md. 652, 446 A.2d 1151 (1982), he has not the power of a grand jury. It thus was impossible to enforce the subpoena. If a succeeding grand jury desired the information sought, it could and should have issued a new subpoena. It did not do so. It follows that Judge Allen correctly quashed the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed; costs to be paid by Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. This withdrawal occurred prior to our opinion of <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 185, </em>293 Md. 652, 446 A.2d 1151 (1982), in which we held that the subpoena power of a State\u2019s attorney is not analogous to that of a grand jury and \"that, in order to utilize \u00a7 592A, the State\u2019s Attorney must have a then present purpose of filing an information based upon facts which, at a minimum, constitute probable cause to believe that an offense chargeable by information has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. Code (1974) \u00a7 8-107 (a), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\"><em>\u2019\u2019Court may excuse. </em>\u2014 A court may temporarily excuse a grand or petit .jury, or both, subject to recall at any time before the start of the next jury term.
