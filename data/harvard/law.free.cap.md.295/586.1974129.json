More particularly, the question is whether a party may have recourse to a court without exhausting statutorily prescribed administrative proceedings and judicial review if the principal question presented before the agency concerns the interpretation of an agency rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">On 12 December 1977, Llewellyn Wakeman (Wakeman) filed a complaint with the petitioner, the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (Commission), alleging that the respondent, Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem), had illegally discriminated against him by forcing him to retire at the age of 65.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On 16 July 1979, after an investigation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Commission issued a \"Written Finding\u201d that there was \"no probable cause\u201d to believe that Bethlehem had engaged in an illegal employment practice and dismissed the complaint: Within 30 days, Wakeman requested that the Commission reconsider its dismissal. This request was made pursuant to the Code of Maryland Regulations 14.03.01.05B that provides that an application for reconsideration \"shall be filed within 30 days\u201d of a Commission finding of \"no probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Wakeman\u2019s application for reconsideration was denied, he appealed to the Baltimore City Court (now Circuit Court for Baltimore City). On 25 June 1980, that Court determined that a Commission finding of \"no probable cause\u201d was not a final, appealable order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and dismissed the appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">On 1 July 1980, five days after the trial court\u2019s adverse ruling, and almost a year after the Commission\u2019s finding of \"no probable cause,\u201d Wakeman once again requested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Commission to reconsider its dismissal. In a letter dated 15 August 1980, the Executive Director determined that \"discretion to reconsider may be inferred from COMAR 14.03.01.05,\u201d and granted Wakeman\u2019s application for reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s finding of \"no probable cause.\u201d On 2 September 1980, the Commission issued an \"Amended Written Finding\u201d that stated that there was \"probable cause to believe LBethlehem] discriminated against [Wakeman] and similarly situated employees.. ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">On 2 September 1980, before a hearing had been held by a hearing examiner, Bethlehem, pursuant to Maryland Rules, Chapter 1100, Subtitle K Certiorari, Rules K 41 through K 48, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Baltimore City Court. In its petition, Bethlehem alleged, among other things, that the Commission had violated its rules and exceeded its jurisdiction by granting an application for reconsideration filed more than 30 days after its initial finding of \"no probable cause.\u201d The Commission sought dismissal on the grounds, among others, that Bethlehem had not exhausted its statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On 9 April 1981, the trial court issued a writ of certiorari to the Commission to \"review [the Commission\u2019s] jurisdiction to hold further proceedings\u201d in the administrative proceeding against Bethlehem. In addition, the trial court ordered the Commission to \"hold no further proceedings in the matter pending [the trial court\u2019s] review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The Commission appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That Court determined that the trial court \"did not rule on the jurisdictional questions but only on the proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>dural one of whether to issue the writ under K 47.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That Court further found that the issue before it was \"not the jurisdiction of the Baltimore City Court but whether that court abused its discretion in issuing the Writ of Certiorari in this case.\u201d That Court held \"that the issuance of the writ is authorized by the K Rules and that the lower court did not abuse its discretion.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>50 Md. App. 647, 439 A.2d 1124 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The Commission filed a petition for a writ of certiorari that we granted.

Mass Transit Admin., </em>294 Md. 225, 230, 449 A.2d 385, 387 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Here, Bethlehem\u2019s recourse to the trial court precluded Wakeman\u2019s complaint of discrimination from being heard by a hearing examiner. As a result, the statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies were not exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">This Court has firmly adhered to the principle that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies must ordinarily be pursued and exhausted. This principle is not only a requirement of our case law, it is a policy embodied in various enactments of the General Assembly. Although this Court has recognized a few limited exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine, it has consistently reiterated that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies ordinarily must be exhausted if the question presented before an agency concerns the interpretation of a statute. <em>Mass Transit Admin., </em>294 Md. at 230-32, 449 A.2d at 387-88; <em>Soley v. State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 527-28, 356 A.2d 254, 258 (1976). Thus, in <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations </em>v. <em>Mass Transit Administration, </em>294 Md. 225, 449 A.2d 385 (1982), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\"This Court has consistently held that <em>statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review remedies must be exhausted in cases involving the interpretation of statutory language. </em>Moreover, to hold that the existence of a statutory interpretation issue furnishes an excuse to abort the administrative proceedings before a final agency decision, would also be inconsistent with the principle that the agency\u2019s construction of a statute which it administers is entitled to weight.\u201d <em>Mass Transit Admin., </em>294 Md. at 233, 449 A.2d at 389 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">There is no reason why the principle that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies must be exhausted should not apply if the principal question presented before an agency concerns the interpretation of an agency rule. This Court has recognized that the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tion of an agency rule is governed by the same principles that govern the interpretation of a statute. <em>See, e.g., Dorsey v. Beads, </em>288 Md. 161, 176, 416 A.2d 739, 747 (1980); <em>Messitte v. Colonial Mortgage Serv. Co. Assocs., Inc., </em>287 Md. 289, 293, 411 A.2d 1051, 1053 (1980). More important, agency rules are designed to serve the specific needs of the agency, are promulgated by the agency, and are utilized on a day-to-day basis by the agency. A question concerning the interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule is as central to its operation as an interpretation of the agency\u2019s governing statute. Because an agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation, the agency\u2019s expertise is more pertinent to the interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule than to the interpretation of its governing statute. Finally, to hold that the existence of an issue of interpretation of an agency rule furnishes an excuse to abort the administrative proceedings before a final agency decision, would be inconsistent with the principle that the agency\u2019s construction of its rule is entitled to weight. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2155 (1977) (controlling weight unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation); <em>Rose v.

New York State Labor Relations Bd., </em>27 N.Y.2d 25, 34, 261 N.E.2d 378, 381, 313 N.Y.S.2d 369, 374 (1970) (controlling weight); <em>Bell v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>641 P.2d 1115, 1121-22 (Okla. 1982) (controlling weight); <em>Concerned Parents of Stepchildren v.

Accordingly, we now hold that in cases involving the interpretation of an agency rule, as in cases involving the interpretation of a statute, statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies ordinarily must be exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Relying upon <em>Prince George\u2019s County </em>v. <em>Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869 (1981), Bethlehem contends that the doctrine of exhaustion of statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">(1) \"[w]hen the object of, as well as the issues presented by, a judicial proceeding only tangentially or incidentally concern matters which the administrative agency was legislatively created to solve, and do not, in any meaningful way, call for or involve applications of its expertise\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(2) \"when an agency requires a party to follow, in a manner and to a degree that is significant, an unauthorized procedure.\u201d <em>Blumberg, </em>288 Md. at 285, 418 A.2d at 1161.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Bethlehem maintains that the first exception is applicable here because the question presented before the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>concerned its jurisdiction, a matter that can more appropriately be determined by a court than by an agency. Additionally, Bethlehem maintains that the second exception is applicable here because, as a result of its misinterpretation of an agency rule, the Commission violated that rule, exceeded its jurisdiction, and required Bethlehem to engage in an unauthorized procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Similar contentions were considered by this Court in <em>Mass Transit Administration. </em>There, this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\"The MTA in the present case has couched the statutory interpretation issue in terms of the Commission\u2019s 'authority\u2019 or 'power\u2019 or 'jurisdiction,\u2019 and has charged that the Commission is attempting to 'expand\u2019 its jurisdiction and proceed in an unauthorized manner. Nevertheless, many, if not most, statutory interpretation issues arising in administrative proceedings could be phrased in terms of the agency\u2019s 'authority,\u2019 'power\u2019 or 'jurisdiction\u2019 to take a certain type of action in a specific case. <em>A party\u2019s argument that an agency will be exceeding its authority if it ultimately interprets the statute and decides the case contrary to that party\u2019s position, does not excuse the failure to await a Gnal agency decision. \u201d Mass Transit Admin., </em>294 Md. at 233, 449 A.2d at 389 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Here, Bethlehem has couched the question presented before the agency in terms of the Commission\u2019s \"authority,\u201d \"power,\u201d or \"jurisdiction\u201d and has asserted that the agency has exceeded its prescribed powers and has proceeded in an unauthorized manner. However, because the Commission concededly has jurisdiction over cases of employment discrimination based upon age, there is no jurisdictional question here. Rather, the principal question presented before the agency concerns the interpretation of an agency rule \u2014 whether a requirement that an application for reconsideration of a finding of \"no probable cause\u201d \"shall be filed within 30 days\u201d is mandatory or permissive. Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>question ordinarily is and should be finally determined by the agency before recourse to the courts. <em>See, e.g., American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Serv., </em>397 U.S. 532, 538-39, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 1292 (1970); <em>Williams v. McHugh, </em>51 Md.App. 570, 573, 444 A.2d 475, 477 (1982); <em>Board of Educ. of Anne Arundel County v. Barbano, </em>45 Md.App. 27, 42, 411 A.2d 124, 131 (1980); <em>Hopkins v. Maryland Inmate Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>40 Md. App. 329, 330-31, 391 A.2d 1213, 1214 (1978), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>285 Md. 120 (1979); <em>see also e.g., United States v. Caceres, </em>440 U.S. 741, 752, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 1472 (1979). Ordinarily, when such a question is at issue, none of the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies, including those relied upon by Bethlehem, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Here Bethlehem is required to exhaust its statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies. Its recourse to the trial court before a final agency determination was improper. Under these circumstances, the questions whether the trial court had asserted jurisdiction by issuing the writ of certiorari, or had abused its discretion in issuing that writ, considered by the Court of Special Appeals, are irrelevant. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals without considering the questions determined by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">\n<em>Case remanded to that Court with instructions to vacate the order of the Baltimore City Court (now Circuit Court for Baltimore City) and to remand the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with instructions to dismiss.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by respondent.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\">.
