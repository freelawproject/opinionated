D. 1886, it was proved by Samuel P. Truax that William H. Grasley, some time prior to the 18th day of April, A. D. 1884, informed him, the said Truax, that he wanted to buy of him a certan horse, and that he, the said Truax, informed him that he would take one hundred and fifty dollars for the said horse. That on the 18th day of April, A. D. 1884, the said William H. Grasley went to the home of the said Truax and renewed the treaty for the purchase of said horse. That said Truax \u2018then told said Grasley that he would take one hundred and fifty dollars for the said horse, and he, the said Grasley, agreed upon that price, and then also said he would like to have time, as he had not the money to pay the cash, to which said Truax replied \u2014all right. That it was then agreed between them that the purchase money for said horse should be secured by two judgment notes for seventy-five dollars each, bearing date April 18th, 1884, and payable in four and six months. That this conversation occurred in the lane running by the barn. That the said Grasley and Truax then went into the house of the latter, and said Grasley filled up and signed two judgment notes, according to the understanding and agreement made between them in said lane. That said Grasley then handed the said notes to said Truax, who examined them, and said, \u201cthey are all right,\u201d and laid them on the table- That immediately afterwards a conversation between them ensued about the horse, lasting for a \"very short time, after which the said Grasley, without any demand or solicitation on the part of said Truax, told him, the said Truax, that he, the said Grasley, had better give him an article of agreement, to show that the said horse was to belong to the said Truax until the said notes were paid, in order to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>him, the said Truax, in case of said Grasiey\u2019s death. That said Truax then said\u2014\u201c Suit yourself.\u201d Whereupon the said Grasley endorged the following writing upon the said note last payable, viz;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-3\"><em>\u201c </em>Smyrna, April, 1884.

GRASLEY.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">Samuel P. Truax also testified that after said Grasley had written and signed the endorsement above mentioned, Graseley and said Truax went to the stable, and Truax put a halter upon the horse and delivered him to the said Grasley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">Samuel P.

Truax further testified that, prior to the issuance of the writ of replevin, that he, the said Truax, in company with Isaac Truax, his brother, went to the said William W. Parvis and told him that he would like to have the said horse ; to which said Parvis <em>replied\u2014\u201c </em>I cannot spare him.\u201d The said Samuel P. Truax then <em>said\u2014\u201c </em>Would he let him have the horse if he could get as much for him as the sheriff sold him for?\u201d to which the said Parvis then replied\u2014\u201c I cannot spare him,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-11\">It was also given in evidence by Isaac Truax, witness for said Samuel P. Truax (who was present at the time the said Samuel P. Truax told the said Parvis that he would like to have the said horse), that the said Samuel P. Truax demanded the said horse; to which the said Parvis replied\u2014\u201c I cannot spare him.\u201d That the said plaintiff also gave in evidene the writ of replevin in the case with return thereon of the Sheriff of Kent County, showing that defendant retained the horse mentioned by giving counter bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-13\">There was evidence on the part of the said William W. Parvis that the said judgment notes were absolutely assigned to William P.

Truax that the said notes were never reassigned to him by the said William P. Smithers, although he states that he had redeemed said notes and paid the principal and interest thereof to the said Smithers and that said notes were delivered into the possession of said Samuel P. Truax by the said William P. Smithers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-10\">That there was further given in evidence, on the part of the said William W. Parvis, a postal card, addressed to John S. Herrington by the said Samuel P. Truax, in relation to the costs of the said suit, in the words and figures following, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Smyrna, March 8, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-12\">Mr. John S. Herrington\u2014Dear Sir : Yours at hand. In reply will say, you will have look to Isaac Truax for the costs, as he agrees to pay all costs in said suit. This agreement he made with Mr. Fulton. I have turned all my claim over to him. He employed Mr. Fulton to work up the matter, and proposes to make witness of me when needed. S. P. TRUAX.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-13\">Samuel P. Truax, being recalled by plaintiff, declared that he had spoken to his brother, Isaac Truax, about paying the costs in the suit, as he was short of funds, and the above card had reference to that fact; and the said Isaac Truax, being recalled, declared he had not a cent\u2019s worth of interest in the case, but it was altogether his brother\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>A question was also made between the counsel on each side in regard to where the alleged demand was made by the plaintiff upon the defendant for the horse, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contending that both Samuel P. Truax and Isaac Truax said it was at defendant\u2019s stables in Leipsic, and the defendant\u2019s counsel contending that the place of the alleged demand was not mentioned by the witness. This question was submitted to the jury by the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-4\">And thereupon the counsel for the said William W. Parvis prayed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">1. That the action being local and the venue not proven, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">2. That it must be proven that there was a positive demand and refusal before the replevin writ was issued, otherwise plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">3. If the jury believe the agreement for conditional sale was signed after the terms of sale were complete; or that said agreement was a mere afterthought and voluntary act of William H. <em>Grasley; </em>or that said agreement was merely for the benefit of said Grasley, and designed to protect the horse from his creditors, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">4. It is for the jury to say whether plaintiff did not, by the absolute assignment of the two notes, or by the transfer of all his claim\u2014as mentioned in the postal card\u2014or by other action or conduct, waive any condition which may have been connected with the original sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-9\">Whereupon the Court charged the jury as reported on page 333, current volume.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-10\">Assignment op Error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-11\">1. That the Court erred in declining to give the first instruction, as prayed for by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-12\">2. That the Court erred in charging the jury that the action of replevin is transitory, except in cases of damage feasant and distress for rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-13\">3. That the Court erred in charging the jury that \u201cthe action \u201c of replevin having been extended, particularly in this country, \u201c to illegal taking of personal property, under any circumstances, \u201c against the owner\u2019s consent, and being in fact a very familiar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201c and, in truth, the only action where the very goods <em>in specie </em>can \u201cbe recovered; which were tortiously taken, it would seem, most \u201c reasonable that it should, as to such cases, be no longer treated \u201c as a local action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-3\">4. That the Court erred in charging the jury that the 12th section of Chapter 106 in the Revised Code, about \u201cpleading and practice,\u201d \u201cwould seem to have been intended to dispense with \u201c any statement of venue, or proof of it, in any suit, except where \u201cthe facts, or nature of the case, show that the suit has (where the \u201c form, for example, is trespass on case) relation to, or is in some \u201c way connected with the realty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ae\">5. That the Court erred in charging the jury that\u2014\u201c without \u201c intending, however, to decide the question,\u201d (that is, the question whether the action of replevin is local or otherwise)\u2014\u201c definitely, \u201c it is sufficient to say, that as we declined to non-suit the plain- \u201c tiff at the close of his case, for alleged want of proof of venue, \u201c so now we refuse to give the jury the instruction the defendant \u201c prays for; besides it would be improper to do so, in view of the \u201cfact that the plaintiff contends, though disputed by the defend- \u201c ant, that he proved the alleged demand and refusal to have been \u201c made on the defendant in the county. That is for the jury.\u201d Whereas the Court ought to have charged the jury that if the jury believed that there was not sufficient proof that the said Samuel P. Truax did make a demand upon the said William W. Parvis for the said horse, and that he, the said Parvis, refused to surrender the same, in Kent county aforesaid, then they should find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">6. That the Court erred in declining to instruct the jury that the action of replevin is local.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">7. That the Court erred in not charging the jury according to the third prayer of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">8. That the Court erred in charging the jury \u201cthat while the \u201c question \u201d (that is, whether the sale of said horse was conditional or absolute,) \u201cis not one altogether free from difficulty, \u201c still we think that everything that was done upon the occasion \u201c of closing the negotiations should be treated as part of them, as \u201c they were simultaneous. It is true that when the notes were \u201c drawn up and signed, read by Traux and approved, the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201c understanding or bargain was complete, and Grasley could then \u201c have demanded the horse, and no right to refuse delivery would \u201c have existed; yet the proposal of Grasley with respect to ownership, accepted by Truax, in effect opened the agreement and \u201c added a new term to it\u2014just as a new stipulation added to a \u201c closed contract, made in the proper manner, before the separa- \u201c tion of the parties, and intended to form a part- of it, is treated \u201cto be a part of it. It is a contemporaneous writing about the <em>44 </em>same subject matter, and, when so intended, is part of the orig- \u201c inal. In this view we decline to give you the third instruction <em>41 </em>in question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-4\">9. That the Court erred in charging the jury in respect to the second prayer of the' defendant, that \u201c it is common enough for a <em>44 </em>party holding another\u2019s obligation, for example, to present it and \u201c say, \u2018 1 should like to have the money on this.\u2019 No doubt a <em>41 </em>debtor well understands what such a communication means.\u201d Because such language or example employed to illustrate the point in hand was calculated to mislead the jury as to the nature and character of the legal demand that said Truax was required to make upon the said Parvis for said horse, in order to maintain his writ of replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">10. That the Court erred in charging the jury that \u201cwith re-<em>4\u2018 </em>spect to the fourth and last prayer, we yield to it so far as to say, <em>41 </em>that if you are satisfied that by the \u25a0 assignment of the notes by \u201c Truax to William P. Smithers he intended to make an election \u201c or choice between his two remedies for the sale of his horse, and <em>'\u2018 </em>chose to rely upon the notes for the purchase money, rather than <em>41 </em>the right to retake, secured by the contract of sale, he must be <em>41 </em>held to that choice and fail in this action.\u201d Whereas the Court ought to have charged the jury that by the absolute assignment of the two notes by Truax to Smithers, the said Truax waived any condition which may have been connected with the original sale, if any condition ever did exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\">11. That the Court erred in charging the jury that \u201c As to the \u201c postal card offered in evidence by the defendant, it cannot be \u201c held to defeat this action, the cause of which having been trans- \u201c ferred to Isaac Truax, is treated as subsisting for his benefit.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>James Pennewill </em>and <em>James L.

At common law in England it was ruled as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth, at least, that the action of replevin is a local action, and that it is necessary to allege in the declaration in it the place of taking, as well as the vill or parish^ otherwise the defendant may demur; but the omission is cured by pleading over or after verdict. The place, and vill or parish are material and traversable. 1 Saund., 347, <em>n. </em>(1.) by William Hob., 16; <em>Reade v. Hawke, </em>Cro. Eliz., 896; <em>Ward v.

Replevin in London, defendant appears upon an <em>elongata, </em>plaintiff declares for taking guns <em>in quodam loco vocal\u2019 </em>the <em>Minories </em>in <em>London-, </em>defendant pleaded <em>non cepit modo et forma. </em>At the trial' the plaintiff proved the taking at Rotherhithe in Surrey; upon which it was objected that the plaintiff had not proved his issue, for the place is material, and therefore part of the issue under the <em>modo et forma. </em>The counsel for the plaintiff admitted that it was traversable; but insisted that by not traversing it particularly, the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>was admitted, and could not be insisted on upon <em>non cepit </em>But the <em>Chief Justice </em>held that where the defendant avows at a different place, in order to have a return, he must traverse the place in the count, because his avowery is inconsistent with it; but where he does not insist upon a return, he may plead <em>non cepit, </em>and prove the taking to be at another place, for it is material. Whereupon the plaintiff was non-suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In the same note Williams also says: The plea of <em>cepit in alio loco </em>is to be considered as a plea in bar and not in abatement <em>; </em>and it is upon this authority and the cases cited by him that Mr. Greenleaf in his American work on evidence lays down the rule of the common law on this question in the action of replevin in the following terms: \u201cThe general issue in this action is <em>non cepit, </em>which admits the plaintiff\u2019s title, and under which it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove, that the defendant had the goods, in the place mentioned in the declaration; for the action being local, the place is material and traversable. Proof of the original taking in that place is not necessary, for the wrongful taking is continued, in every place in which the goods are afterwards detained. But under this issue the defendant cannot have a return of the goods; if found for him, it merely protects him from-damages. If he would defend on the ground that he never had the goods in the place mentioned, he should plead <em>cepit in alio loco </em>which is a good plea in bar of the action. This plea does not admit the taking as laid in the declaration; and therefore, the plaintiff must prove such taking or fail to recover. 2 <em>Greenl. Ev. Sec. </em>562. And this so far as the venue of the county, at least, is concerned, we have always understood and considered to be the rule in the courts of this State in all actions of replevin for the wrongful taking or detention of personal property, and not merely when the action is for distress for rent, or for cattle damage feasant; as it has long been, and still is an action of more frequent occurrence in this State for the wrongful taking or detention of goods and chattels with out such a claim, than with such a claim on the part of the defendant, and has as long existed here without any distinction being recognized between them in respect to the application of this rule, either by statute or the decision of our Courts, until this case occurred in the Court below; for we do not think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>that the statutory provision contained in chapter 106, section 12, Rev, Code, 648, abolishes, or was designed to abolish this rule and principle of the common law so long established in the pleading and practice of the Courts of this State, as to the materiality of the place of talcing mentioned in any action of replevin, nor in any other action or case where the place of taking, or in which the act is alleged to have been done, the place may be material or traversable. \u25a0 The words of the section are, \u201c It shall not be deemed necessary, in any declaration, or other pleading, to lay the venue in the county in which the action is brought, nor to set forth in any manner the place in which an act is alleged to have been done, unless when, from the nature of the case, the place may be material, or traversable.\u201d But we have seen from the authorities before cited that at common law, and according to the long established course of pleading and practice in actions of replevin in the Courts of our State, the place of the taking of the goods alleged in the declaration, on an issue presented <em>by </em>the plea of <em>non cepit modo et forma, </em>or of <em>cepit in alio loco, </em>which have been and still continue to be very common pleas here in the action, has uniformly been considered to be material and traversable; and so far from considering that the Legislature intended to alter or abolish this rule of pleading and practice in the action replevin in this State, we are strongly inclined to think it was designed to exempt and exclude it from the operation of the section just read under the exception embraced in the concluding words of it, as follows: It shall not be deemed necessary in any declaration, or other pleading, to lay the venue in the county in which the action is brought, nor to set forth in any manner the place in which an act is alleged to have been done, \u201c unless when from the nature of the case, the place may be material, or traversable.\u201d As we understand the rule of the common law and the pleading and practice in the Courts of this State at the time of the enactment of the section and chapter referred to in all cases of civil actions, there is none to which this exception would more clearly and conclusively apply than in an action of replevin as then known and recognized here. Nor can we think there,is any good ground for a difference or distinction in the meaning and import of the terms themselves between \u201c the nature of the case \u201d as it occurs in this clause of this section, and <em>\u201c </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>nature of the action \u201d as usually employed by members of the profession and writers on the law. \u201cA case,\u201d as here referred to and the word employed imports means a civil action of some form and nature between two or more parties in a Court of law, either decided or still pending, which may be of different kinds, but the first and most prominent distinction between them, when they differ from each other, is the form and legal nature of the action in which the case is instituted, and the best general indication of this distinction in the nature of these different cases in Courts of law, is the different forms of action in which they are commenced. The judicial record of such cases when completed and made up in Court consist of the original writ which fixes the form of the action at common law, the declarations, pleadings and issues joined in it, and the judgment of the Court thereupon. And if the plaintiff mistakes the nature of his case or the nature and form of the action adapted to it, in general at common law he cannot maintain the action, but will be non-suited by the judgment of the Court if demanded on the other side. The pleadings also vary very considerably in these various actions and cases at common law with the several forms of action appropriately adapted to them, and with the issues of fact as well as law joined and presented in the pleadings; but whatever may be the form of the action or the difference of the pleadings in it from those in any other action, each is alike usually termed a case, or an action at law, and usually import one and the same thing; and accordingly the words <em>\u201c </em>the nature of the case,\u201d as employed in this provision of the section, means the same as if the words employed in this connection had been \u201c the nature of the action,\u201d instead of the nature'of the case, for it is the difference in the nature and character of the various actions at law which constitutes the substantial distinction between them; and we therefore consider this exception in the 12th section of the chapter to mean in general terms the same thing in this case now before the Court, as if it had specially provided, in the following terms: <em>\u201c </em>unless when, from the nature of the case, as in an action of replevin, the place may be material, or traversable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">As it appears from the record that the Court below declined to sustain the motion for a non-suit on the alleged ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove the venue of the action in Kent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>County as laid in the declaration, but concluded to leave the question as to the proof on that point to be decided by the jury subject to the instructions of the Court when it should come to charge them generally on the evidence and the points of law in the case, with our conviction and belief that the action of replevin is a local action in all cases under the rules of pleading and practice long established in the courts of this State, we have come to the conclusion that the Court; below should have instructed the jury in explicit terms in its charge to them in the case, with the further instruction under the circumstances that unless they were satisfied from the evidence before them that it had been proved that the cause of action, the taking or detaining of the horse in question by the defendant from the plaintiff, was in Kent County, the plaintiff could not recover in the action, and their verdict should be for the defendant. But as it declined to give such instructions to the jury, although prayed for by the counsel for the defendant below, we consider that it was error in the Court to do so ; and therefore the the judgment of this Court is, that the judgment of the Court below must be reversed, and it is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
