But if the contract was that the price was to be paid in goods, then it was a special contract and should have been declared on specially, and the plaintiff below cannot recover unless he had demanded the goods. If, however, they were to be paid for in money, then he is entitled to recover t\u00a1he amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Verdict for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
