Proof of such knowledge on the part of defendant is sufficient to enable plaintiff to recover for personal injury thereby sustained ; and the fact that the dog is commonly kept confined by the owner is evidence of such knowledge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-9\">Verdict for plaintiff should include such damages as necessarily arose from the injury sustained, as nursing, medical attendance, pain, fear and apprehension of hydrophobia, and loss from having been disabled from pursuing his usual business.</headnotes>\n<court data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"ANh\">\n<em>(New Castle,</em>\n</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMq\">\n<em>May 26, 1884.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\">Action on the case for injuries to plaintiff by the biting of a dog belonging to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-11\">On July 14, 1883, plaintiff went to the house of defendant to buy milk, as he was wont to do, and was coming away when the dog attacked him and bit him in the calf of his leg. The bite was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>a very severe one, as was testified to by plaintiff and other witnesses. Plaintiff testified that defendant on seeing the wound had said he would not have taken that bite for a thousand dollars. One witness testified that several years prior to this he was attacked by the same dog and had shot- him in the head, but the dog recovered. Other witnesses testified to the bad character of the dog, it having attacked other persons, and that they were in the habit of carrying weapons of different kinds with which to protect themselves from harm by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-3\">Defendant testified that he never knew the dog to bite any one, and children and others used to go through his yard without molestation, and he had endeavored in vain to hiss him on base ball players who trespassed on his property. He went to see Warner . the Sunday after the alleged biting and saw the wound, which was a mere scratch. He offered to send for. Dr. Shortlidge to attend him, but Warner did not want him. The witness denied having said that the dog had. previously bitten an Irishman, and that he would not have been so bitten for $1,000. He gave the dog away after Warner complained, and it was the first complaint, and the dog is now dead. At the time Orr shot his dog he was only a pup. Other witnesses testified that they were near neighbors to the defendant and were well acquainted with the dog and never knew him to bite anyone or to be of an offensive character. One witness, who saw the wound immediately after the biting, said it was a mere scratch on the outer skin which might have been caused by a claw.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">The plaintiff being recalled, testified that defendant had never offered him any assistance or offered to send him a physician; and he had his leg cauterized because he was afraid of hydrophobia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">The wounded leg with its scar was offered in evidence but was ruled out.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-6\"><em>H.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8p\">charging the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">That while in the case of untamed animals, a person keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>them is liable for any injury they may do to others; yet, where animals have been domesticated, for example dogs, the owner of them is only liable in case he knows they are accustomed to bite, or have a ferocious, savage disposition, or spirit, which domestication has not subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">It is not necessary, in order to entitle a plaintiff to recover for the bite of a dog, that he -should prove that another person has been bitten, but it is sufficient if he show by proof that the owner knows him to have a wicked, ferocious spirit, such as renders it dangerous that he should be at large. The fact that he is commonly kept confined by the owner, is evidence from which the jury may infer such knowledge on the part of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">In all cases, before a plaintiff can recover for injury by a dog from having been bitten, it must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant kept the dog, and that he did so knowing he would bite, or was of such a ferocious nature that he had a propensity, or was likely to do so. Such knowledge may be shown as well by circumstances, as by positive proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The plaintiff was rightfully on the defendant\u2019s premises upon his usual errand for milk, and was, in no sense, wrongfully there.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">If the jury should find for the plaintiff, he is entitled to such damages as necessarily arose from such an injury as he sustained, including nursing, medical attendance, pain, suffering in body and fear and apprehension of hydrophobia, if such be shown to have been incurred, or felt; and also any loss he sustained from having been disabled from pursuing his usual business.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Verdict for plaintiff for $36.00.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
