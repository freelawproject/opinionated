In April, 1884, Forbes and Banks came to me and wanted to buy them. Banks said, after we had agreed on the price, that he could pay the money for them, but would like to have time on them. I told him I was not willing to trust them, but would let them have the use of them until they paid for them, receiving two notes, one at four.months for two hundred.dollars, and one at six months for two hundred and fifty dollars, and also the following agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Wilmington, April 25, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-12\"><em>\u201c </em>This may certify that the Spoke, Lathe &amp; Tennon Machine that we borrowed are to remain the property of S.

They have not paid me anything on the notes, when I learned that the sheriff had levied on the machines, I went to him and told him that they belonged to me and were my property and told him about the agreement, and demanded them of him as my property, but he declined to surrender them to riie, and advised me to sue out a writ oil replevin for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-11\">I After other evidence in support of the above, William Ford testified: Was one of the members of the firm of Forbes and Banks, anjd made the agreement in writing with the plaintiff and signed the name of our firm to it. I told him before I did it that our goods had been levied on and it was not drawn by him or signed by me until after the first levy had been made on our property, but before the second levy had been made on them. The first wis made on first day of May, 1884, and the second on the twelfth day of that month.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-12\"><em>William C.

There was an absolute and not a conditional sale when the goods were delivered to the purchaser in this case, and the conditions afterwards sought to be affixed to it by a further agreement between the vender and purchaser after the goods had been levied on at the suit of their creditors, was merely an afterthought and was fraudulent and fraud is against them, and could be no avail to defeat the original and absolute sale and revest the ownership of the goods in the vendor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\"><em>Spruance, </em>in reply, quoted 5 Houst., 192; I do not deny that if it was originally an unconditional sale, and the goods were after-wards levied on as the property of the purchaser at the suit of a creditor of theirs, and the terms of the conditional sale were not agreed on by the parties to the contract of sale until after that, it could have any effect to qualify or render it a conditional sale as against such a creditor. But it was a conditional sale. On the day when the goods were sold and delivered and before any execution was levied on them, then the purchasers could have had no property or ownership of the goods when they were levied on, and the taking of them under it was wrongful against the plaintiff, the owner of them, and no demand and refusal was necessary in the case. 7 Gray, 155; 3 Cush., 257.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Note.\u2014See page 330 current volume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-6\">Comefys, C.
