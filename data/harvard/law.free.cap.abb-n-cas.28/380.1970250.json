Hubbell, as receiver of the Syracuse Iron Works, brought this action against that company and Alfred Wilkinson, as trustee under its mortgage bonds, and Giles and Charles B. Everson, the Merchant\u2019s National Bank and the Robert Gere Bank, and others, to determine questions as to the validity of bonds issued by the Syracuse Iron Works some of which were held by various defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">On a trial by the court it was held that a specified portion of the bonds held by the Merchant\u2019s Bank and by the Robert Gere Bank respectively, and bonds held by the receivers of Wilkinson &amp; Co. were invalid ; and also that Everson was not entitled to a lien which he claimed on the bonds or proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\">Judgment was entered accordingly. The defendants, the Everson\u2019s, appealed to General Term ; but addressed their notice of appeal to and served it upon the attorney for the plaintiff, only, and not to or upon the attorneys for their co-defendants, the banks, nor the receivers of Wilkinson &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney moved at General Term to dismiss so much of the appeal as was taken from that part of the judgment in favor of the bank and the receivers. The motion was made on notice and the affidavit of the attorney which stated the foregoing facts in detail, and that the parties really interested in the controversy were those who were holders of the bonds determined by the judgment to be valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The attorney for the Merchant\u2019s Bank and the receivers made a similar motion, founded on his affidavit, which stated further that the plaintiff, the receiver, had asked leave to appeal from the part of the judgment in question and the application had been denied ; that no case and exceptions had been served on the attorneys for the bank and the receiver, and they had had no opportunity to appear and serve amendments, and had been prevented from appealing by the fact that .the judgment was favorable to them. A similar affidavit and notice of motion was served by the attorney for the Robert Gere Bank and Mr. Gere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\"><em>The Supreme Court at General Term </em>granted the motion and ordered that unless the appellants, Charles B. Everson and Giles Everson, shall perfect their appeal against the defendants, Merchant\u2019s National Bank, Robert Gere Bank, Charles E. Hubbell and Albert K. Hiscock, receivers of Wilkinson &amp; Co., within sixty days from this date, that said appeal of said Everson\u2019s be and the same is hereby dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">And it is further ordered that if such appeal shall be so perfected within sixty days from this date, then and in that event this motion to dismiss be and the same is hereby denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">But it is further ordered, that if the appellants take an appeal from this order to the court of appeals then the sixty days mentioned in this order shall not begin to run until the first day of June, 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">The opinion rendered by the General Term is given below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">From this order the Everson\u2019s appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-10\"><em>Waters &amp; McLennon </em>for the appellants, besides discussing the merits, urged that:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4P\">I. \u201c The question before this court is, are the co-defendants of the appellants adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>parties in the judgment appealed from to the General Term within the meaning of section 1300 of the Code of Civil Procedure, so as to require the notice of appeal to be served upon them to perfect the appeal and so as to defeat an appeal duly perfected as to the plaintiff in the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">II. The co-defendants of the appellants are not adverse parties in the judgment to the appellants for the following reasons, to wit: 1. During the whole litigation from the summons to the judgment they did not comply with the absolute requirement of section 521 of the Code of Civil Procedure and hence they are not adverse parties as to their co-defendants under the provisions of that section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">2. But the case is not one in which they could have entitled themselves to have their ultimate rights determined by the judgment even if they had demanded it in their answers and served those answers upon their co-defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-8\">3. The reason why they could not do so is that their rights or cause of action as against their co-defendants are wholly independent of the cause of action in favor of the plaintiff and wholly disconnected with it (Smith <em>v. </em>Hilton, 50 <em>Hun,236, </em>at page 239; Jones <em>v. </em>Grant, <em>10Paige, </em>348; Kay <em>v. </em>Whittaker, 44 <em>N.
