MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">White Motor Credit Corporation appeals a decision of the Bankruptcy Court of Western Michigan determining that White\u2019s security interest in a truck tractor was not perfected under Michigan law. The bankrupt, a Michigan resident, obtained an Ohio Certificate of Title. The Bankruptcy Court found that the vehicle should have been titled in Michigan and held that the Ohio title was fraudulent and invalid. The District Court affirmed. Because of this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>In re Paige, </em>679 F.2d 601 (6th Cir. 1982), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The facts are not in dispute. The bankrupt, Harold Angier, was a resident of St. Joseph, Michigan. On January 22, 1975, he purchased a truck tractor from Waterland White Trucks Sales and Service of Kalamazoo, Michigan. White Motor Credit, the defendant below, is Waterland\u2019s assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">In connection with the purchase, Angier executed a financing statement and an installment sales and security agreement. White Motor Credit filed the financing statement with the Berrien County Registrar of Deeds in St. Joseph, Michigan. The statement noted White Motor Credit\u2019s security interest and listed Angier\u2019s former business address as it appeared on the title of the vehicle he had traded for the truck. White Motor Credit subsequently corrected the statement to show Angier\u2019s home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">At the time of the sale, Angier was under a long-term lease agreement with Aee-Do-ran Trucking Company. Ace-Doran is a multi-state trucking company with home offices in Cincinnati, Ohio and several regional terminals including Kalamazoo and Perrysburg, Ohio. Angier had an Ohio P. U. C. O. tax-exempt number, and decided to title the truck in Ohio in order to avoid paying Michigan sales tax. In the titling process, Angier filed two documents with the Michigan Department of State. The first document was an \u201cApplication for Michigan Title\u201d, also known as an RD-108, which displayed his former business address in St. Joseph and described the truck as \u201cin-transit.\u201d The RD-108 was the document Angier would have filed had he wished to title the truck in Michigan. An-gier then filed a \u201cMichigan In-Transit Registration\u201d known as an MV-42, in which he indicated his intent to title the truck in Ohio. On the MV-42, he gave as his address the address of Ace-Doran\u2019s headquarters in Cincinnati. Angier then titled the truck in Ohio, listing Ace-Doran\u2019s terminal in Perrysburg, Ohio as his address. Both the Ohio title and the Michigan RD-108 properly listed White Motor Credit as the secured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">On July 9,1975, Angier filed a petition in Bankruptcy Court. White Motor Credit claimed a priority interest in the truck. The issue before this court is whether the notation of the security interest on the Ohio title perfects White Motor Credit\u2019s interest under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">White Motor Credit argued that notation of its interest on the Ohio Certificate of Title satisfied the conflict-of-laws provisions of Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 440.9103(4), Uniform Commercial Code 9-103(4) (1962 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>version). Since Angier titled the truck in Ohio and White Motor Credit met the perfection requirements under Ohio law, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 1309.21 (U.C.C. \u00a7 9-302) and \u00a7 4505.13 (security interests in motor vehicles), White Motor Credit contended that it had perfected its security interest under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In the alternative, White Motor Credit argued that Michigan law required notation of the security interest on the \u201capplication for title.\u201d Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 440.9302. Since the RD-108 was the only document required for an application for title, White Motor Credit argued that it had met this requirement. Michigan-did not issue a title because Angier described the vehicle as \u201cin transit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments. First, the court found that the RD-108 was not an \u201capplication for title\u201d since Angier was not actually applying for a Michigan title. Second, the court ruled that Michigan was the only proper state in which to title the truck. The court held that section 440.9103(4) only applied when the state issuing title was the proper state under section 440.9103(2) U.C.C. 9-103(2) (1962 version). <em>In re Brown, 5 </em>U.C.C.Rep. 401, 408 (W.D.Mich.Bankr.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The facts of this case are almost identical to those of <em>In re Paige, supra, </em>where this court held that registration of a vehicle in Michigan is not required when the vehicle is registered in another state and the lien is noted on the certificate of title. <em>In re Paige, </em>679 F.2d at 603-604. In <em>Paige, </em>a Michigan resident purchased a truck tractor in Indiana and titled the truck in Illinois, using the business address of his employer, another multi-state trucking company. This court held that the provisions of Mich. Comp.Laws \u00a7 440.9103(4), U.C.C. 9-103(4) (1962 version) plainly supercede Mich.Comp. Laws \u00a7 440.9103(2), U.C.C. 9-103(2) (1962 version) when a foreign jurisdiction issues a certificate of title. Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 440.9103(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), if personal property is covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this state or any other jurisdiction which requires indication on a certificate of title of any security interest in the property as a condition of perfection, then the perfection is governed by the law of the jurisdiction which issued the certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clearly means that section (4) will take priority over sections (2) and (3) when title is issued in another state. <em>In re Paige, supra; In re Dawson, </em>21 U.C.C.Rep. 293 (E.D.Mo.Bankr.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">The Trustee argues that Angier\u2019s misuse of business addresses and his failure to list a correct home address on the RD-108 invalidates the title. In <em>Paige, </em>the bankrupt gave his employer\u2019s business address as his title address. In <em>Dawson, </em>the bankrupt listed a fictitious address. In both cases, the court looked to the purpose of Article Nine of the Uniform Commercial Code \u2014 notice to subsequent creditors. Here, as in those cases, the notation of White Motor Credit\u2019s security interest on the Ohio Certificate of Title fulfills that purpose. A potential creditor need look to only one place \u2014 the certificate of title, regardless of issuing state \u2014 to discover this prior security interest. As this court stated in <em>Paige, </em>\u201c[i]f the debtor cannot or will not produce the title certificate the potential creditor is immediately on notice that he acts at his own risk.\u201d <em>In re Paige, supra, </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">We also agree with White Motor Credit\u2019s argument that its interest was perfected under U.C.C. \u00a7 9-302 (1962 version). Mich. Comp.Laws \u00a7 440-9302(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">A security interest in property covered by a statute described in subsection (3) can be perfected only by registration or filing under that statute; except that in the case of a security interest in a vehicle which is not inventory held for sale as referred to in subsection (3) or an accessory as referred to therein, <em>the filing required to perfect, such security interest is not only the filing with the secretary of state of an application for a certificate of title containing a </em>statement with regard to such security interest as provided in section 217 of Act No. 300 of the Public Acts of 1949, as amended, <em>but in addition </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>the filing of a financing statement with the register of deeds </em>as provided in section 9401(1) the effective time of filing required for the perfection of such security interest is determined by the time of filing with the secretary of state and the register of deeds, whichever occurs later, (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">The RD-108 is the document required by section 217. While Angier did not receive a Michigan Certificate of Title, he did receive a temporary \u201cin transit\u201d license by virtue of filing the MV-42 (i.e., a cardboard license plate to be taped in the truck\u2019s rear window). White Motor Credit also filed the required financing statement. Thus, White Motor Credit recorded its interest both in the Berrien County Registrar of Deeds Office and on the official document filed with the Michigan Department of State. Anyone who searched those places in lieu of requesting the certificate of title would be on notice of White Motor Credit\u2019s interest. In short, White Motor Credit took all reasonable steps to notify subsequent creditors of its interest. Any subsequent creditor who made a reasonable search would have found evidence of White Motor Credit\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Trustee argues that Angier\u2019s title is facially void. There is evidence to the contrary. At the bankruptcy hearing Mr. William King, Regional Director of the Michigan Department of State, testified that \u201cresidence\u201d is not the sole criterion by which title is judged, and that a Michigan resident could properly title a vehicle in another state if the vehicle was used in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The Highway Reciprocity Act, 1960 Mich. Pub.Acts 124, Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 3.161-.176, allows Michigan residents to title their vehicles in states with which the Michigan Reciprocity Board has a reciprocity agreement. The Reciprocity Act provides that \u201cthe board may determine the proper jurisdiction for the registration or licensing for all vehicles whose owners or operators seek the privileges and benefits of this act.\u201d Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 3.165. The board \u201cmay require\u201d registration in (1) the jurisdiction of the owner\u2019s legal residence; (2) the jurisdiction of the owner\u2019s commercial enterprise or branch of the owner\u2019s commercial enterprise; (3) \u201cthe jurisdiction in which the vehicle <em>is most frequently dispatched, </em>garaged, serviced, maintained, operated <em>or otherwise controlled in or from\u201d; </em>or (4) the jurisdiction where the states have agreed to register the vehicles. Mich.Comp. Laws \u00a7 3.165(a)-(d) (emphasis added). Since Angier was under a lease agreement with Ace-Doran, he met the prima facie requirements of section 3.165(c) in that the vehicle was \u201cmost frequently dispatched ... or otherwise controlled in or operated from\u201d the jurisdiction of Ohio. White Motor Credit also submitted a letter from the Secretary of the Michigan Highway Reciprocity Board which stated: \u201cWhen a Michigan resident leases his vehicle to an Ohio based carrier, the vehicle is licensed in Ohio.\u201d Appellee argues that since Angler generally received assignments from Ace-Doran\u2019s Kalamazoo terminal, this provision does not apply. However, that is a question for the Michigan Highway Reciprocity Board. Likewise, any question concerning Angier\u2019s use or misuse of addresses on his Ohio Title is a matter for the Ohio authorities. Absent any action by either the Michigan or Ohio authorities, Angier\u2019s title is presumably valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Finally, appellee argues that Angier committed fraud by titling the truck in Ohio to avoid paying Michigan sales tax. However, the fact that Angier successfully avoided paying sales tax on the truck does not <em>per se </em>constitute fraud. Any determination of tax liability lies with the proper state authorities. In any event, we see no connection between Angier\u2019s tax liability and the validity of his Ohio Title. The Uniform Commercial Code was not drafted to enforce local tax laws but to protect commercial transactions. Under Article Nine of the Uniform Commercial Code fraud means a fraud on future creditors. As we have noted, there is adequate notice to future creditors in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
