Commissioner, </em>T.C.M. 1981-112, wherein appellants William Zahler (Zahler) and his wife Rowena were adjudged to have been deficient in their Federal individual income taxes for the years 1972 and 1973 in the amounts of $11,627.99 and $1,124.53, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Zahler was a commission salesman for the brokerage firm of Ball, Burge &amp; Kraus (BB&amp;K), a partnership, until 1972 at which time he became a general partner and continued to receive commission income in conjunction with partnership distributions. In 1972 he received $137,186 as commission on sales, $50,391.24 as net profit distributions of the partnership, and $1,625.99 as interest from capital contributions to the partnership. In 1973 he received $77,037.25 as commission on sales and no income from net profit distribution. The tax returns for 1972 and 1973 treated all income as personal service income subject to the 50% maximum rate of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348. The IRS, however, determined that all such income was derived from a trade or business in which capital was a material income-producing factor and permitted only 30% of such income to be subjected to the favorable tax treatment of \u00a7 1348. Upon a proceeding for a redetermination of deficiencies in the United States Tax Court, Zahler conceded that only 30% of the income received as net profit distributions of the partnership is subject to the 50% maximum tax treatment of \u00a7 1348 but challenged the IRS\u2019 exclusionary classification of commission income. The United States Tax Court upheld the IRS\u2019 finding of a tax deficiency and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Section 1348 provides a favorable tax treatment to individuals whose income consists of \u201cpersonal service income\u201d. This statutory provision limits the tax on this income to a maximum rate of 50% and pertinently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">\u00a7 1348 50-percent maximum rate on personal income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">(a) General rule \u2014 If for any taxable year an individual has personal service taxable income which exceeds the amount of taxable income specified in paragraph</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-16\">(1), the tax imposed by section 1 for such year shall, unless the taxpayer chooses the benefits of part I (relating to income averaging), be the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">(1) the tax imposed by section 1 on the highest amount of taxable income on which the rate of tax does not exceed 50 percent,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-18\">(2) 50 percent of the amount by which his personal service taxable income exceeds the amount of taxable income specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-19\">(3) the excess of the tax computed under section 1 without regard to this section over the tax so computed with reference solely to his personal service taxable income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-20\">(b) Definitions. \u2014 For purposes of this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-21\">(1) Personal service income.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>(A) In <em>general. </em>\u2014 The <em>term \u201cpersonal service income\u201d means </em>any income which is <em>earned income within the meaning of </em>section 401(c)(2)(C) or <em>section 911(b) </em>or which is an amount received as a pension or annuity which arises from an employer-employee relationship or from tax-deductible contributions to a retirement plan. For purposes of this subparagraph, section 911(b) shall be applied without regard to the phrase \u201cnot in excess of 30 percent of his share of net profits of such trade or business,\u201d, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3f\">However, a taxpayer may obtain the benefits of \u00a7 1348 only if the income is \u201cpersonal service income\u201d. Section 1348(b) defines \u201cpersonal service income\u201d as \u201cearned income\u201d within the meaning of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 911(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">(b) Definition of earned income. \u2014 For purposes of this section, the term \u201cearned income\u201d means wages, salaries, or professional fees, and other amounts received as compensation for personal services actually rendered, ... In the case of a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services rendered by the taxpayer, not in excess of 30 percent of his share of the net profits of such trade or business, shall be considered as earned income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aby\">Accordingly, the benefits of \u00a7 1348 are not fully applicable to an individual who, though rendering personal services, is \u201cengaged in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors.\u201d It has been stipulated that BB&amp;G utilizes capital as a material income-producing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Section 911(b) specifically refers to earned income in terms of \u201cnet profits\u201d, stating that \u201c[i]n the case of a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income producing factors .:. a reasonable allowance, ... not in excess of 30 percent of his share of the <em>net profits </em>of such trade or business, shall be considered as earned income.\u201d It has been observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">In section 911 itself, the earned income of a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors is tied to net profits, not to gross income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\"><em>Vogt v. United States, </em>537 F.2d 405, 410 (Ct.C1.1976). Thus, in a trade or business (herein a partnership) which utilizes capital as a material income-producing factor, income received by an individual engaged in this trade or business is subject to the 30% limitation of \u00a7 911(b), as incorporated in \u00a7 1348, if and only if such income represents \u201cnet profits\u201d of the trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Treasury Regulation 1.1348-3(a)(3) supports this conclusion and supplies the following definition of \u201cnet profits\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">(3) <em>Earned income from business in which capital is material.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">(i) If an individual is engaged in a trade or business (other than in corporate form) in which both personal services and capital are material income producing factors, a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services actually rendered by the individual shall be considered earned income, but the total amount which shall be treated as the earned income of the individual from such a trade or business shall in no ease exceed 30 percent of his share of the net profits of such trade or business (which share shall include any guaranteed payment (as defined by \u00a7 1.707-l(c)) received from a partnership). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term \u201cnet profits of the trade or business\u201d means the excess of gross income from such trade or business (including income from all sources, whether or not subject to Federal income tax, and without taking into account any deductions which may be allowable under Section 1202) over the deductions attributable to such trade or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Although BB&amp;G utilized capital as a material income-producing factor, Zahler\u2019s income derived from commission sales will be subject to the 30% limitation of \u00a7 911(b) only if the income represents \u201cnet profits\u201d of the partnership, which it does not. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 703(a) provides that the taxable income of a partnership is to be computed in the same manner as an individual\u2019s and \u00a7 162(a) permits deductions for salaries or personal services actually rendered. The commission income was deducted as an expense from the partnership\u2019s gross income. Therefore, the commission income was not included in the partnership\u2019s net profits and, accordingly, is not subject by the recipient to the 30% limitation of \u00a7 911(b). Rather, all commission income received by Zahler is subject to the preferential treatment and 50% maximum rate established in \u00a7 1348. This conclusion is inherently consistent with Treasury Regulation 1.1348(a)(1)(A) which expressly includes within the definition of \u201cearned income\u201d as used in \u00a7 1348 \u201c[wjages, salaries, professional fees, bonuses, amounts includable in gross income under Section 83, <em>commissions on sales </em>or on insurance premiums, tips, and other amounts received ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">All of Zahler\u2019s commission income is subject to the 50% maximum tax of \u00a7 1348. Accordingly, the decision of the United States Tax Court is hereby REVERSED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion to determine the amount of taxpayers\u2019 recovery.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
