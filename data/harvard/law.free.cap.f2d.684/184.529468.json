The plaintiffs-appellants are two Puerto Rico corporations and an individual citizen of the Commonwealth. In 1964 the parties entered into a distributorship agreement giving the appellants exclusive rights to sell and distribute the appellees\u2019 ceramic tiles in the Antilles. The agreement was reduced to writing on April 22, 1971, and contained the following paragraph 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-16\">\u201cAny dispute related to the interpretation and application of this contract will be submitted to an Arbiter selected by the President of the Tribunal of Modena, [Italy,] who will judge as last resort and without procedural formalities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">In March, 1981, the appellants brought suit in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, alleging that the appellees had breached the contract by unjustifiably terminating their distributorship. The complaint sought damages in accord with the provisions of the Puerto Rico Dealers Act, Law 75 of June 24, 1964, as amended, 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7\u00a7 278 <em>et seq. </em>The appellees removed the case to the United States District Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the District of Puerto Rico. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a)(2), 1441(a). The district court ordered arbitration in accord with paragraph 9 and dismissed the complaint. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Appellants contend first that, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, paragraph 9 is void and unenforceable. They invoke the general principle that contracting parties may not agree to clauses or conditions \u201cin contravention of law, morals, or public order\u201d. 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 3372. And to show that paragraph 9 is contrary to the public order, they direct our attention to the Dealers Act, as amended. The Dealers Act was enacted to help protect Puerto Rico distributors from the allegedly exploitative practices of certain foreign suppliers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantively, it prohibited termination of dealership contracts except \u201cfor just cause\u201d. 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278a. Moreover, it declared that its provisions were of a public order and that the dealers\u2019 rights under it could not be waived. 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278c. In 1978 it was amended to codify prior judicial constructions, <em>see Walborg Corp. v. Tribunal Superior, </em>104 D.P.R. 184 (1975), so that today it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cAny stipulation that obligates a dealer to adjust, arbitrate or litigate any controversy that comes up regarding his dealer\u2019s contract outside of Puerto Rico, or under foreign law or rule of law, shall be likewise considered as violating the public policy set forth by this chapter and is therefore null and void.\u201d 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278b-2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Appellants continue their argument by suggesting that, given the arbitration clause\u2019s unenforeeability under Puerto Rico Law, the federal district court could not enforce it. They observe that Chapter One of the Federal Arbitration Act is limited, in that it makes arbitration clauses enforceable \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. They contend that the Dealers Act provides grounds \u201cat law or in equity\u201d for revocation of paragraph 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">We need not, however, consider to what extent the phrase \u201cgrounds as exist at law or in equity\u201d incorporates Commonwealth law. <em>See County of Middlesex v. Gevyn Construction Corp., </em>450 F.2d 53 (1st Cir. 1971); Note, <em>Incorporation of State Law Under the Federal Arbitration Act, </em>78 Mich.L.Rev. 1391 (1980). In particular, we need not consider whether the phrase incorporates the Dealers Act. The simple reason is that the district court did not purport to exercise authority under Chapter One of the Federal Arbitration Act; rather, it acted under Chapter Two of the Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>which implemented the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, <em>acceded to by United States, </em>September 30, 1970, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S.No. 6997 [reprinted following 9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 (1982 Supp.)] (hereafter referred to as \u201cthe Convention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">A court presented with a request to refer a dispute to arbitration pursuant to Chapter Two of the Federal Arbitration Act performs a very limited inquiry. It must resolve four preliminary questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">(1) Is there an agreement in writing to arbitrate the subject of the dispute? Convention, Articles 11(1), 11(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\">(2) Does the agreement provide for arbitration in the territory of a signatory of the Convention? Convention, Articles 1(1), 1(3); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 206; Declaration of the United States upon accession, reprinted in 9 U.S.C.A. at 154 n.29 (1982 Supp.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(3) Does the agreement arise out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial? Convention, Article 1(3); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">(4) Is a party to the agreement not an American citizen, or does the commercial relationship have some reasonable relation with one or more foreign states? 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">If the district court resolves those questions in the affirmative, as it properly did in this case, then it <em>must </em>order arbitration unless it finds the agreement \u201cnull and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed\u201d. Convention, Article 11(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Appellants argue that the Dealers Act renders paragraph 9 of the contract \u201cnull and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They contend that the \u201cnull and void\u201d clause was intended to incorporate the Dealers Act as an expression of Puerto Rico public policy. We disagree. Such an expansive interpretation of the clause would be antithetical to the goals of the Convention. In <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 517 n. 10, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 2456 n. 10, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974), the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201cThe goal of the Convention, and the principal purpose underlying American adoption and implementation of it, was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The parochial interests of the Commonwealth, or of any state, cannot be the measure of how the \u201cnull and void\u201d clause is interpreted. Indeed, by acceding to and implementing the treaty, the federal government has insisted that not even the parochial interests of the nation may be the measure of interpretation. Rather, the clause must be interpreted to encompass only those situations \u2014 such as fraud, mistake, duress, and waiver \u2014 that can be applied neutrally on an international scale. <em>I. T. A. D. Associates, Inc. v. Podar Brothers, </em>636 F.2d 75 (4th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Nothing in the record suggests that the arbitration agreement was \u201cnull and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed\u201d within the terms of Article 11(3) of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">. The Act\u2019s statement of motives reads, in part: \u201cThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico cannot remain indifferent to the growing number of cases in which domestic and foreign enterprises, without just cause, eliminate their dealers, concessionaires or agents, as soon as these have created a favorable market and without taking into account their legitimate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico declares that the reasonable stability in the dealer\u2019s relationship in Puerto Rico is vital to the general economy of the country, to the public interest and to the general welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it deems it necessary to regulate, insofar as pertinent the field of said relationship, so as to avoid the abuse caused by certain practices.\u201d Laws of Puerto Rico, 1964, p. 231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">. Our textual discussion assumes, without deciding, that the Commonwealth would apply the current interpretation of the Dealers Act to this dispute, even though the contract was reduced to writing before the decision in <em>Wal-borg, supra, </em>and before the 1978 amendments to the Dealers Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-11\">. Our conclusion accords with the general mode by which appellate courts have construed the Convention and Chapter Two of the Federal Arbitration Act. <em>See Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co., Inc. v. Societe Generale de I'Industrie du Papier (RAKTA), </em>508 F.2d 969, 973-74 (2d Cir. 1974) (construing narrowly the \u201cpublic policy\u201d defense to enforcement of awards under Article V(2)(b)); <em>McCreary Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. CEAT, </em>501 F.2d 1032 (3d Cir. 1974) (observing that there is \u201cnothing discretionary\u201d about Article 11(3)). Similar considerations have influenced the construction of other domestic statutes in the context of international arbitration. <em>See Scherk, supra; Societe Generale de Surveillance, S.A. v. Raytheon European Management and Systems Co., </em>643 F.2d 863, 867 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
