We <em>affirm </em>the rejection of claims 5 and 7 and <em>reverse </em>with respect to all remaining claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">\n<em>The Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">Appellants\u2019 invention is in the field of image processing particularly as applied to computerized axial tomography or CAT scans. Specifically, appellants\u2019 invention is directed to an improvement in computed tomography whereby the exposure to X-ray is reduced while the reliability of the produced image is improved. Some understanding of tomography, both conventional and computed, is necessary as background for the subsequent analysis of the present invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">Conventional tomography, also known as laminography, employs the simultaneous movement in opposite directions of an X-ray source and an X-ray film. The method produces a well-defined image of a plane through the body parallel to the plane of the X-ray film. In contrast to an ordinary X-ray, shadows of body structure which lie outside the plane of investigation are blurred so that they do not interfere with a focused image of the plane under investigation. Conventional tomographic systems are not practical when a visualized cross-section transverse to the body axis is desired. Computed tomography was developed to overcome this deficiency among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-20\">Basically, computed tomography provides an image representing a transverse slice of the body. This slicing is accomplished by rotating an X-ray source and a detection means around the perimeter of the section to be viewed. The source and detection means are placed 180\u00b0 from each other to allow the detection means to measure the attenuation of the beam as it passes through the plane of interest. When enough measurements have been taken, a computer is implemented to mathematically interpret the data, which is then displayed as a reconstruction of the slice on, inter alia, a television screen for diagnostic purposes. Computed tomography is also useful for looking at only a section of a slice. Thus, if the plane of interest were in the abdomen region of a human, but only the liver were of concern, the computed tomography ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>chine would act in the manner of a conventional tomograph and blur the images outside of this \u201cRegion of Interest.\u201d It has, however, been necessary that a spread of X-rays \u201cS\u201d be sufficiently wide to subtend the entire body in order to produce an image of the region of interest \u201cR\u201d by this blurring method, as illustrated by the following drawing:</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Appellants have discovered that it is unnecessary to expose the body in the above fashion. Rather, they have discovered that the spread of X-ray, S, can be reduced so as to subtend only the region R thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Narrowing the beam is advantageous not only because the exposure of a body to X-ray is thereby reduced but also because computer calculation time to produce the image is shortened inasmuch as the amount of data to be processed is less. However, because fewer data can be collected due to the narrower beam, there is insufficient information to cancel out an object, n, such as a piece of rib, for example, which is in the beam bath. Thus, the resultant image shows the region R with an artifact<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appearing therein due to that object, n:</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Appellants\u2019 invention is directed to an improvement in CAT scan imaging technique whereby the body is exposed to less radiation and, through use of a weighting function in the calculations producing the image, the artifacts are eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">The examiner rejected the claims on appeal under the authority of <em>Parker v. Flook, </em>437 U.S. 584, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451 (1978). In the final rejection and in the examiner\u2019s answer before the board, the examiner construed <em>Flook </em>as mandating the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-13\">Taking each claim as a whole, it is assumed, for analysis purposes only, that any mathematical calculation in the claim is part of the prior art. If what is left is new and unobvious, then the claim, taken as a whole, protects more than a mathematical calculation and it is deemed statutory. But if the remainder of the claim is not novel nor unobvious, then the claim, taken as a whole, merely seeks to protect the mathematical calculation and, as such, does not comprise statutory subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Applying the above test, the examiner determined that, apart from the mathematical calculations, the remaining steps were well known or were \u201cmerely a necessary antecedent step to provide values for solving the mathematical equations,\u201d and, thus, were directed to nonstatutory subject matter, citing <em>In re Richman, </em>563 F.2d 1026, 195 USPQ 340 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-16\">The board did not address the examiner\u2019s contentions, relying instead on <em>In re Freeman, </em>573 F.2d 1237, 197 USPQ 464 (CCPA 1978), as modified by <em>In re Walter, </em>618 F.2d 758, 205 USPQ 397 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1980). Without resort to detailed claim language, the board affirmed the rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>When the claims are analyzed in [the manner dictated by <em>Walter ], </em>it is manifest that the mathematical algorithm is not implemented in a manner to define structural relationships between physical elements in the apparatus claims or to refine or limit claim steps in the process claims. The claims do no more than present and solve a mathematical algorithm and are manifestly nonstatutory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">One member dissented with respect to rejection of claims 6 and 33-47 concluding that these claims are directed to \u201cproducing a product, an improved tomographic X-ray image,\u201d and are, therefore, directed to statutory subject matter citing <em>Diamond v. Diehr, </em>450 U.S. 175, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">We agree with the board that a two-part analysis <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the proper vehicle for resolution of issues here presented under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. However, we agree with appellants that the second step of the analysis is not as limited as the board held it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">In <em>Gottschalk v. Benson, </em>409 U.S. 63, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972), the Supreme Court concluded that claims directed to a particular \u201calgorithm,\u201d conversion of binary coded decimal numbers to binary numbers, did not define patentable subject matter. In that case the Court defined the term \u201calgorithm\u201d as \u201c[a] procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 93 S.Ct. at 254. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Benson </em>became the basis for the first part of the two-part analysis set forth by this court in <em>In re Freeman, </em>573 F.2d 1237, 197 USPQ 464 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">In <em>Freeman, </em>573 F.2d at 1245, 197 USPQ at 470, this court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">As a bare minimum, application of <em>Benson </em>in a particular case requires a careful analysis of the claims, to determine whether, as in <em>Benson, </em>they recite a \u201cprocedure for solving a given type of <em>mathematical </em>problem.\u201d [Citation omitted. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">Hence, the first part of the analysis requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-15\">First, it must be determined whether the claim directly or indirectly recites an \u201calgorithm\u201d in the <em>Benson </em>sense of that term .... [Jdf. at 1245, 197 USPQ at 471.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">The second part of the <em>Freeman </em>analysis is derived from the further holding in <em>Benson, </em>409 U.S. at 72, 93 S.Ct. at 257, that any patent issued in that case \u201cwould wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself.\u201d Thus, it was concluded that the presence of an \u201calgorithm\u201d in a claim would not render a claimed invention nonstatutory unless the invention claimed <em>only </em>the \u201calgorithm.\u201d Stating this conclusion in the language of <em>Benson, </em>this court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-17\">Second, the claim must be further analyzed to ascertain whether in its entirety it wholly preempts that algorithm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-18\"><em>[Freeman, Id. </em>at 1245, 197 USPQ at 471.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-19\">This latter step in the <em>Freeman </em>analysis was not reached because of this court\u2019s conclusion that the claims did not recite an \u201calgorithm.\u201d In <em>In re Toma, </em>575 F.2d 872, 197 USPQ 852 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1978), the same test was discussed but, again, the second part of the analysis was not reached. Subsequently, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Parker v. Flook, </em>437 U.S. 584, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451 (1978), making clear that the second part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>the above analysis was erroneous. The Court held that the claim need \u201cnot ... cover every conceivable application of the formula\u201d to be nonstatutory. <em>Id. </em>at 586, 98 S.Ct. at 2523.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">In sum, the Court\u2019s decisions have made clear that a claim does not present patentable subject matter if it would wholly preempt an algorithm, <em>Benson, </em>supra, or if it would preempt the algorithm but for limiting its use to a particular technological environment, <em>Flook, </em>supra. However, these decisions leave undefined what does constitute statutory subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In <em>In re Johnson, </em>589 F.2d 1070, 1075, 200 USPQ 199, 205 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1978), this court held that, while reciting an algorithm, the claims did not merely define a method of solving a mathematical equation because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8V\">any calculations which may be performed in practicing the process ... are but a part of the process which includes the other recited steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-6\">... [They] are <em>incident </em>to producing a noise-free signal trace from a reference trace. <em>[Id. </em>at 1080, 200 USPQ at 209 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">This conclusion rests on the premise that an otherwise statutory process remains statutory when implemented by a computer, <em>id. </em>at 1078, 200 USPQ at 207 n.8, a premise subsequently approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Diamond v. Diehr, </em>450 U.S. 175, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981). <em>Accord, In re Bradley, </em>600 F.2d 807, 202 USPQ 480 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1979), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom by equally divided court, Daimond v. Bradley, </em>450 U.S. 381, 101 S.Ct. 1495, 67 L.Ed.2d 311 (1981) (Burger, C. J., not participating).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">In <em>Johnson, </em>supra, the interrelationship of the algorithm to the remaining limitations of a claim was held to be determinative of whether the claim defined statutory subject matter. Relying on the same reasoning, in <em>In re Walter, </em>618 F.2d 758, 205 USPQ 397 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1980), the second part of the two-step analysis<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-12\">If it appears that the mathematical algorithm is implemented in a specific manner to define structural relationships between the physical elements of the claim (in apparatus claims) or to refine or limit claim steps (in process claims), <em>the claim being otherwise statutory, </em>the claim passes muster under \u00a7 101. If, however, the mathematical algorithm is merely presented and solved by the claimed invention, as was the case in <em>Benson </em>and <em>Flook, </em>and is not applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps, no amount of post-solution activity will render the claim statutory; nor is it saved by a preamble merely reciting the field of use of the mathematical algorithm. <em>[Id. </em>at 767, 205 USPQ at 407 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">In <em>Walter, </em>the claims were directed to a process<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for correlating and cross-correlating signals. All of the claims steps were algorithm steps for performing the correlation or cross-correlation. There were no limitations in the claims, other than a field of use set forth in the preamble of the claims which stated that the algorithm was for use in connection with seismic surveying. The court concluded that the claims were directed to claiming only the algorithm, were not applied in any manner to any process steps, and were, therefore, directed to nonstatutory subject matter. <em>Id. </em>at 769, 205 USPQ at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">Appellants summarize the <em>Walter </em>test as setting forth two ends of a spectrum: what is now clearly nonstatutory, i.e., claims in which an algorithm is merely presented and solved by the claimed invention (preemption), and what is clearly statutory, i.e., claims in which an algorithm is implemented in a specific manner <em>to define structural relationships </em>between the physical elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>of the claim (in an apparatus claim) or <em>to refine or limit claim steps </em>(in a process). Appellants urge that the statement of the test in <em>Walter </em>fails to provide a useful tool for analyzing claims in the \u201cgray area\u201d which falls between the two ends of that spectrum. We agree that the board\u2019s understanding and application of the <em>Walter </em>analysis justifies appellant\u2019s position. However, the <em>Walter </em>analysis quoted above does not limit patentable subject matter only to claims in which structural relationships or process steps are defined, limited or refined by the application of the algorithm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Rather, <em>Walter </em>should be read as requiring no more than that the algorithm be \u201capplied in any manner to physical elements or process steps,\u201d provided that its application is circumscribed by more than a field of use limitation or non-essential post-solution activity. Thus, if the claim would be \u201cotherwise statutory,\u201d <em>id., </em>albeit inoperative or less useful without the algorithm, the claim likewise presents statutory subject matter when the algorithm is included. This broad reading of <em>Walter, </em>we conclude, is in accord with the Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">In <em>Diamond v. Diehr, </em>supra, the Court held that a process for curing synthetic rubber constituted patentable subject matter notwithstanding that the process used an equation for controlling the in-mold time which was constantly updated by <em>a </em>digital computer. In <em>Diehr, </em>were the claim to be read without the algorithm, the process would still be a process for curing rubber, although it might not work as well since the in-mold time would not be as accurately controlled. Hence, the Court concluded that the claimed invention fell within \u00a7 101 because it presented \u201can <em>application </em>of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 101 S.Ct. at 1056 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, </em>306 U.S. 86, 59 S.Ct. 427, 83 L.Ed. 506 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Finally, the purpose of the two-part analysis supports the view taken here. The goal is to answer the question \u201cWhat did applicants invent?\u201d If the claimed invention is a mathematical algorithm, it is improper subject matter for patent protection, whereas if the claimed invention is an application of the algorithm, \u00a7 101 will not bar the grant of a patent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">In answering that question,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-12\">[ejach invention must be evaluated as claimed; yet semantogenic considerations preclude a determination based solely on words appearing in the claims. In the final analysis under \u00a7 101, the claimed invention, as a whole, must be evaluated for what it is. <em>[In re Sarkar, </em>588 F.2d 1330, 1333, 200 USPQ 132, 137 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1978) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Hence, the analysis \u201crequires careful interpretation of each claim in light of its supporting disclosure .... \u201d <em>In re Johnson, </em>589 F.2d at 1079, 200 U.S.P.Q. at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">In this case, each of the independent claims and, necessarily, each of the dependent claims, includes the limitation \u201ccalculating . .. the difference\u201d either as a step in a process or as a means in an apparatus. Accordingly, all of the claims may be directed to nonstatutory subject matter as each presents a mathematical formula or a sequence of mathematical operations. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Diehr, </em>supra, wherein the claims included a limitation requiring \u201ccalculating.\u201d <em>Cf. Johnson, </em>589 F.2d at 1078, 200 USPQ at 208 (use of term \u201ccompute\u201d at least suggests the execution of a mathematical algorithm). In any event, appellants concede that their claims \u201cimplement a mathematical algorithm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">III A</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">We now turn to the second part of our analysis to determine whether what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>claimed is a statutory process or apparatus or a nonstatutory algorithm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We begin by contrasting the two broadest process claims, claims 5 and 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-5\">5. A method of displaying data in a field comprising the steps of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-6\">calculating the difference between the local value of the data at a data point in the field and the average value of the data in a region of the field which surrounds said point for each point in said field, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">displaying the value of said difference as a signed gray scale at a point in a picture which corresponds to said data point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-8\">6. The method of claim 5 wherein said data is X-ray attenuation data produced in a two dimensional field by a computed tomography scanner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">We conclude that claim 5 is directed solely to the mathematical algorithm portion of appellants\u2019 invention and is, thus, not statutory subject matter under \u00a7 101. We reach the opposite conclusion with respect to claim 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">The method of claim 6, unlike that of claim 5, requires \u201cX-ray attenuation data.\u201d The specification indicates that such attenuation data is available only when an X-ray beam is produced by a CAT scanner, passed through an object, and detected upon its exit. Only after these steps have been completed is the algorithm performed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the resultant modified data displayed in the required format.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Were we to view the claim absent the algorithm, the production, detection and display steps would still be present and would result in a conventional CAT-scan process. Accordingly, production and detection cannot be considered mere antecedent steps to obtain values for solving the algorithm as in <em>In re Richman, </em>cited by the examiner. Indeed, claim 6 presents data gathering steps not dictated by the algorithm but by other limitations which require certain antecedent steps.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is these antecedent steps that dictate what type of data must be obtained. <em>Compare In re Sarkar, </em>588 F.2d at 1336, 200 USPQ at 139 n.18, where we did not reach the effect of data gathering steps which are not dictated by the algorithm. In any event,, we view the production, detection, and display steps as manifestly statutory subject matter and are not swayed from this conclusion by the presence of an algorithm in the claimed method.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">In <em>Flook, </em>supra, \u201c[t]he patent application did not \u2018explain how to select ... any of the variables\u2019 \u201d used in the algorithm and, thus, no process other than the algorithm was present. <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S. at 186 n.10, 101 S.Ct. at 1056 n.10, <em>quoting Flook, </em>437 U.S. at 586, 98 S.Ct. at 2523. <em>A fortiori, </em>no process steps to which the algorithm could be applied were present. <em>Accord, Walter, </em>supra. In the instant case, claim 6 defines the variables and places the algorithm in a particular relationship to a series of steps in a particular type of process, permitting the algorithm to be applied as a further process step. <em>In re Taner, </em>681 F.2d 787, 790 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">The algorithm, when properly viewed, is merely applied to the \u201cattenuation data\u201d to eliminate what would otherwise appear as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>artifacts upon display of the data in the manner claimed. The algorithm does not necessarily refine or limit the earlier steps of production and detection as would be required to achieve the status of patentable subject matter by the board\u2019s narrow reading of <em>Walter. </em>What appellants have done is to discover an application of an algorithm to process steps which are themselves part of an overall process which is statutory. Hence, claim 6 cannot be construed as a mere procedure for solving a given mathematical problem. As was the case in <em>Diehr </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>both supra, the algorithm is but a part of the overall claimed process.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">We are faced simply with an improved CAT-scan process comparable to the improved process for curing synthetic rubber in <em>Diehr, </em>supra. The improvement in either ease resides in the application of a mathematical formula within the context of a process which encompasses significantly more than the algorithm alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We do not reach the same conclusion with respect to claim 5. This claim presents no more than the calculation of a number and display of the result, albeit in a particular format.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">The specification provides no greater meaning to \u201cdata in a field\u201d than a matrix of numbers regardless of by what method generated. Thus, the algorithm is neither explicitly nor implicitly applied to any certain process. Moreover, that the result is displayed as a shade of gray rather than as simply a number provides no greater or better information, considering the broad range of applications encompassed by the claim. Indeed, this claim does not even attempt to \u201climit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment,\u201d <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S. at 191, 101 S.Ct. at 1058, as was done in <em>Flook, </em>supra. Hence, we view claim 5 as directed merely to a mathematical formula which is not proper subject matter under \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Appellants do not argue and, in any event, we see no basis for treating their apparatus claims differently from their method claims.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-11\">If the functionally-defined disclosed means and their equivalents are so broad that they encompass any and every means for performing the recited functions, the apparatus claim is an attempt to exalt form over substance since the claim is really to the method or series of functions itself. In computer-related inventions, the recited means often perform the function of \u201cnumber crunching\u201d (solving mathematical algorithms and making calculations).
