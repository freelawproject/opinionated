The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-23\">Plaintiff, Floyd E. Cumbey, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint he brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the use of female guards at the state prison where he is incarcerated violates his constitutional right to privacy. We vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-24\">The plaintiff is incarcerated at the Joseph Harp Correctional Center in Lexington, Oklahoma. In his pro se complaint he contends that female prison guards there are assigned to posts where they observe him dressing and undressing and using the toilet and the shower. The complaint alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aye\">At Joseph Harp Correctional Center each inmate occupies an individual solid-walled cell, containing a bed, a toilet and wash-face-basin [sic]. Each cell has a solid door, controlled by guards at the end of each Unit corridor, called a Control Room .... Each cell door has a clear glass window measuring about six inches by nine inches. The interior of the cell, including the bed, toilet and sink-basin, is visible to anyone in the corridor looking through the cell door windown [sic]. Prison rules require an inmate during day and night not to cover the cell door window obstructing view [sic] at any time. If such occurr [sic] the inmate is subject to writeup-misconduct [sic] report for rule violation. Male inmates, while completely or partially unclothed are being subjected to \u201ca certain amount of viewing\u201d by female correctional officers ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aed-dedup-0\">He also contends that he suffered cruel and unusual punishment because of a certain comment a female guard made regarding nudity of male inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-25\">The plaintiff brought the action, requesting injunctive relief and damages, against the director of the state prison system, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>warden of the prison, and a female guard at the prison. Resting its decision solely on the complaint, the district court dismissed the action as frivolous, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), finding that the plaintiff could not make any rational argument on the law or facts to support his claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">There is a constitutional right to privacy. <em>See, e.g., Carey v. Population Services Int\u2019l, </em>431 U.S. 678, 684-86, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2015-16, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977); <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 152-56, 93 S.Ct. 705, 726-28, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973); <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 484-86, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1681-82, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). Although convicted prisoners are not entitled to the full protection of the Constitution, they \u201cdo not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of their conviction and confinement in prison.\u201d <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 545, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1877, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The state may restrict these rights only to the extent necessary to further the correction system\u2019s legitimate goals and policies. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. at 546, 548, 99 S.Ct. at 1877, 1878; <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 555-56, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Although the inmates\u2019 right to privacy must yield to the penal institution\u2019s need to maintain security, it does not vanish altogether. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Downs, </em>641 F.2d 1117, 1119 (4th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Other courts have held that if guards regularly watch inmates of the opposite sex who are engaged in personal activities, such as undressing, using toilet facilities, or showering, the inmates\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy are being violated. <em>See Dawson v. Kendrick, </em>527 F.Supp. 1252, 1316-17 (S.D.W.Va.1981) (male guards viewing female inmates); <em>Bowling </em>v. <em>Eno-moto, </em>514 F.Supp. 201 (N.D.Cal.1981) (female guards viewing male inmates); <em>Hudson v. Goodlander, </em>494 F.Supp. 890 (D.Md. 1980) (female guards viewing male inmates); <em>Forts v. Ward, </em>471 F.Supp. 1095 (S.D.N.Y.1979), <em>vacated in part, </em>621 F.2d 1210 (2d Cir. 1980) (male guards viewing female inmates). <em>Cf. Smith v. Fairman, </em>678 F.2d 52 (7th Cir. 1982) (frisks by female guards of male inmates, if carefully limited, do not violate the inmates\u2019 right to privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Although the frequency of such practices is important, <em>see Hudson v. Goodlander, </em>494 F.Supp. at 891; <em>Avery v. Perrin, </em>473 F.Supp. 90, 92 (D.N.H.1979), the plaintiff\u2019s statement that the male inmates were subject to a \u201ccertain amount of viewing\u201d by female guards does not necessarily fall short of a cognizable constitutional claim. The district court thus erred in dismissing the entire action as frivolous. <em>See, e.g., Phillips v. Carey, </em>638 F.2d 207, 208-09 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 985, 101 S.Ct. 1524, 67 L.Ed.2d 821 (1981); <em>Ragan v. Cox, </em>305 F.2d 58, 60 (10th Cir. 1962). Accordingly, we vacate this portion of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The district court, however, correctly dismissed as frivolous the plaintiff\u2019s claim that a comment made by a guard constituted cruel and unusual punishment. A single comment clearly falls short of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscriptions. <em>See, e.g., Bennett v. Passic, </em>545 F.2d 1260, 1263 (10th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The order of the district court is hereby affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
