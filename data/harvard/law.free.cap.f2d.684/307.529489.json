The Administrator issued his rules and regulations to be followed by such reservists in applying for insurance under the Act. Among the regulations issued by the Administrator was this requirement: \u201cOn and after June 1, 1975, the [qualified reservist] is eligible for coverage provided an application, evidence of insurability and the initial premium is submitted to the administrative office prior to June 1, 1976.\u201d 38 C.F.R. 9.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">The plaintiff is a retired military reservist who met the requirements for full-time coverage as of May 24, 1974. He did not, however, file his application for coverage until December 15, 1977. His application was denied for failure to file \u201cprior to June 1, 1976.\u201d He sought by his action in the district court a declaratory judgment that the Administrator had exceeded his authority in setting the time limits as fixed in 38 C.F.R. 9.3(a). The district court found that the administrative regulation fixing such time limits was \u201creasonably related to the purposes of the Veterans Insurance Act of 1974\u201d and was within the Administrator\u2019s authority, as declared in the Act, to provide \u201cterms and conditions\u201d for the issuance of insurance to qualified reservists within the plaintiff\u2019s classification. <em>Turney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>525 F.Supp. 675 (D.Md.1981). We agree and affirm the judgment of the district court on the opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
