Because this case offers no circumstance and appellant has made no argument to overcome the general presumption under Rule 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure favoring cost recovery by the prevailing party on appeal, the Government is entitled to the costs it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-21\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-22\">On 27 April 1976 appellant Baez made a Freedom of Information Act request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, seeking \u201c[a]ll information or other references or materials, in whatever form or manner, referring to or directly or indirectly concerning Joan C. Baez whether filed under her name or obtainable by searching through other files or materials.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The FBI acknowledged receipt of appellant\u2019s request and advised her that it would be processed in its proper order among the many FOIA requests that had been received. When no further reply was received by 18 October 1976, appellant filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to compel disclosure of the records. On 18 February 1977 the District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings while the FBI finished processing appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-23\">By letter dated 21 March 1977 the FBI released to appellant 365 pages of material located in its main file, but withheld other documents pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E) of FOIA. As a result of appellant\u2019s administrative appeal, the Bureau released 145 additional pages; it continued to claim valid exemptions for the remaining documents, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-24\">In April 1978 the FBI notified appellant that it had completed an additional search for references to her appearing in the \u201csee reference files.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It thereafter released an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>additional 1,075 pages of material, once again withholding portions thereof pursuant to Exemptions 1, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E) of FOIA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">On 7 November 1978, after exhausting her administrative appeals, appellant moved for summary judgment and partial <em>in camera </em>review of the documents withheld. The Government filed a cross motion for summary judgment with supporting affidavits on 1 December 1978. On 21 June 1979 the Government filed additional affidavits with the district court, one of which indicated that the FBI had reexamined all withheld documents under the new classification criteria established by Executive Order No. 12,065.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The examining agent averred that the documents that the FBI had withheld still merited classification under the new standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">At a 25 June 1979 hearing on the respective motions, the district court ruled that Exemptions 1, 3, 7(C), and 7(D) were properly taken. Appellant appealed the district court\u2019s judgment to this court, alleging error with respect to the rulings on Exemptions 1, 7(C), and 7(D). This court found no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings and on 25 August 1980 affirmed the district court\u2019s decision \u201cin all respects.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Following Baez\u2019s unsuccessful appeal, the Justice Department filed a bill of costs in the amount of $365.00, the cost of printing 50 copies of its brief on appeal. The Government relied on Rule 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which provides that \u201ccosts shall be taxed against the appellant, when a judgment of the district court is affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">Appellant gave no indication that she was unable to pay the costs sought, nor did she allege any misconduct or wrongdoing on the part of the Government. She opposed a costs award on two grounds: First, appellant argued that the spirit of the 1974 amendment to FOIA, providing attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to substantially prevailing FOIA plaintiffs,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> worked to deny costs to the Government in all FOIA cases, except where the suit against it is found to be \u201cfrivolous and brought for harassment purposes.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, appellant argued that the amount of costs billed by the Government was excessive, inasmuch as it represented costs for 50 copies of its brief, and this court requires only that 15 copies of a brief be filed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">On 7 May 1981 a panel of this court issued a majority opinion (from which Judge Wilkey dissented) denying the Government\u2019s request for costs on the grounds that the appellant\u2019s appeal was not frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation. It thus ordered that each party should bear its own costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This order was followed, on 21 May 1981, by the Government\u2019s \u201cpetition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc.\u201d </em>The same panel majority of this court, \u201c[ajfter careful consideration of the Government\u2019s Petition, grantfed] the request for rehearing, and vacate[d] the opinion issued by the majority on May 7th, 1981.\u201d The majority of the panel adhered to the result it had earlier reached, but stated simply that \u201cconsistent with our authority under Rule 39(a), we hereby deny the Government\u2019s request for costs in this case. Each side shall bear its own costs.\u201d Judge Wilkey again dissented.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>On 18 August 1981 this court ordered that the costs issue be reheard <em>en banc </em>and vacated all prior orders and opinions regarding costs. Both sides submitted briefs on the issue of costs and oral argument was heard on 11 December 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">A. <em>The Presumption Favoring Cost Awards to Prevailing Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">While there is a dearth of case law dealing specifically with cost awards under Rule 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, this is not so of the issue of cost recovery in general. As early as 1487 English law had codified the common law practice \u201cthat if a judgment be affirmed on writ of error, , the writ be discontinued, or if the party suing it be nonsuited then <em>the defendant in error was to have his </em>costs.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In actions at law prevailing parties were entitled to costs as of right;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in actions at equity the Chancellor exercised discretion when deciding whether to allow costs to the victors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> American courts adopted English practice by the early part of the nineteenth century, typically giving total reimbursement, including attorneys\u2019 fees, to the prevailing litigant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">Over time, the American rule regarding <em>attorneys\u2019 fees </em>began to deviate from the rule governing taxation of costs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, although judges came to hold \u201cthat attorney\u2019s fees are not ordinarily recoverable [by the victor] in the absence of a statute or enforceable contract providing therefor,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the courts of this country continued to recognize a strong presumption favoring cost awards to prevailing litigants.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Two factors called for a legal distinction between the presumptions regarding awards of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees: (1) the sharp disparity between the dollar amounts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>two awards,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cthe time, expense and difficulties of proof inherent in litigating the question of what constitutes reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Unlike attorneys\u2019 fees, whose magnitude and unpredictability have discouraged parties with otherwise meritorious claims from litigation,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the small and predictable costs of court fees, printing costs, and court reporters\u2019 fees have customarily been viewed as necessary and reasonable incidents of litigation, properly reimbursable to the victors.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">While both attorneys\u2019 fee awards<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and taxation of costs<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> have eventually come to be governed by statute in America, both types of statute embody the notions that assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against the losers may be a form of <em>penalty, </em>while taxation of costs merely represents the <em>fair price </em>of unsuccessful litigation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">When law and equity merged in 1937 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopted both equity\u2019s discretionary standard for awarding costs<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the common law presumption favoring the award of litigation costs to the prevailing party. Thus Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahf\">Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, <em>costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party </em>unless the court otherwise directs. .. ,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>The presumption explicitly stated in Rule 54(d) \u2014 that the prevailing party is normally entitled to costs in the district court as a matter of course \u2014 has proven very powerful indeed. In <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. </em>August<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Supreme Court stated clearly that prevailing parties \u201cpresumptively will obtain costs under Rule 54(d),\u201d and that \u201c[b]ecause costs are usually assessed against the losing party, liability for costs is a normal incident of defeat.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Every circuit court that has considered the question (ten out of twelve) has not only <em>recognized </em>the presumption, but has held that a court may neither deny nor reduce a prevailing party\u2019s request for costs without first articulating some good reason for doing so.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, federal courts have placed on the unsuccessful parties some burden of showing circumstances sufficient to overcome the presumption favoring the prevailing party.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The result is that trial judges have rarely denied costs to a prevailing party whose conduct has not been vexatious when the losing party has been capable of paying such costs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Rule 39(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which governs costs awards at the appellate level, states in pertinent part that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law ... if a judgment is affirmed, costs shall be taxed against the appellant unless otherwise ordered.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The presumption favoring costs awards to prevailing parties is no weaker in cases involving this rule than in cases under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d). Not only are the structure and language of the two provisions parallel, but the signals are clear that the two find root in the same principle. The Advisory Committee to the Appellate Rules stated that an appellate court must exercise its equitable discretion under Rule 39 subject to the same presumption which guides trial courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-9\">While only five circuits ([including the] D.C.Cir. ...) presently tax the costs of printing [appellate] briefs, the proposed rule makes the cost taxable <em>in keeping with the principle of this rule that all cost items expended in the prosecution of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number><em>proceeding should he borne by the unsuccessful party.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">Thus, Professor Moore observes, \u201c[a]bsent statute, Rule 39(a) follows the principle of Rule 54[(d)] of the Rules of Civil Procedure that the prevailing party is entitled to costs <em>as a matter of course </em>unless the court orders otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This court has recognized this principle time and again.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">In <em>Saunders v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which involved Rule 39(a) and prevailing <em>appellants, </em>we noted that \u201c[ajppellants, as the prevailing parties, became entitled to an award of costs as a matter of course, save only to the extent that the court might direct otherwise. ... Absent a contrary direction by this court, appellants were entitled, we have said, to their costs as <em>a matter of </em>course.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This applies equally to prevailing <em>appellees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Our court\u2019s local rules direct us to apply Rule 39(a)\u2019s presumption to the very costs at issue here. General Rule 15, governing \u201cCosts of Briefs and Appendices,\u201d states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arh-dedup-0\">Costs [of briefs] shall be taxable <em>in conformity with Rule 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. </em>Costs will be allowed for ... the cost of printing of text of 50 copies of briefs and 25 copies of appendices, any charge for collating, binding, indices, covers, footnotes and tabular matter of briefs and appendices, and the sales tax, if any, for printing services.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">B. <em>The Government as \u201cPrevailing Party\u201d: The Presumption Is Unaffected</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">Appellant\u2019s position assumes several forms, but for the main part centers on a single contention \u2014 that the presumption under Rule 39 somehow is different, <em>i.e., </em>less firm, when the Government, rather than a private litigant, is its \u201cbeneficiary.\u201d We reject this argument.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">It is true that at common law, as Blackstone observed, sovereign immunity barred taxation of costs either for or against the king. Since it was the king\u2019s \u201cprerogative not to pay [costs] to a subject, so it [was] beneath his dignity to receive them.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> But as Professor Moore has wryly commented, \u201cThe United States seems never to have had any kingly dignity <em>preventing it from recovering costs: </em>although for many years it followed the kingly prerogative against <em>paying </em>costs.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, in the 1902 case of <em>Pine River Logging Co. v. United </em>States<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the Supreme Court made the point explicit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-16\">While the rule is well settled that costs cannot be taxed against the United States, <em>the rule is believed to be uni verr sal, </em>in civil cases at least, that the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>States can recover the same costs as <em>if they were </em>a <em>private </em>individual<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">This \u201cuniversal\u201d rule permitting the United States to <em>recover </em>costs as a prevailing party, even if it could not be taxed for costs as a losing party, underwent some equitable adjustment with the advent of Rule 39 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Subdivision (b) of the rule, specifically pertaining to \u201ccosts for and against the United States,\u201d states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-5\">In cases involving the United States or any agency or officer thereof, if an award of costs against the United States is authorized by law, costs shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (a) [which, of course, provides generally for cost awards to the prevailing party of appeal]; otherwise, costs shall not be awarded for or against the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">As the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 39 acknowledge, Rule 39(b) was written \u201cat a time when the United States was generally invulnerable to an award of costs against it, and ... [appears] to be based on the view that if the United States is not subject to costs if it loses, it ought not be entitled to recover costs if it wins.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Since then, of course, the general rule that costs could not be taxed against the United States has been broadly abrogated by statute. In 1966 Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, extinguishing the general sovereign immunity to cost awards previously claimed by the Government. It provides that when the United States is a party,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-12\">[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a judgment for costs, as enumerated in section 1920 of this title but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or official of the United States acting in his official capacity, in any court having jurisdiction of such action.,, ,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">The 1974 FOIA amendment in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), while directed principally toward authorizing awards of <em>attorney fees </em>against the United States,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> affirmed that costs were also recoverable against the Government: \u201cThe court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees <em>and other litigation costs </em>reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\">Since cost awards <em>against </em>the United States (if it is a <em>losing </em>party) are authorized under <em>both </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), the combined operation of Rule 39(b) and (a) place the <em>prevailing </em>Government party in the same position as a prevailing private litigant. There being no express bar against cost awards to the United States in FOIA actions the clear implication is that, regardless of the identity of the prevailing defendant, the ordinary Rule 39(a) presumption favoring an award of costs to the prevailing party \u2014 appellant or appellee \u2014 operates in this case, as it would in any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-17\">While the \u201cunless otherwise ordered\u201d language of Rule 39 preserves this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>court\u2019s discretion to require the parties to bear their own costs on appeal, or otherwise to limit or deny a cost award to the prevailing party, we are guided by the strength of the general presumption favoring cost recovery to require of the unsuccessful party a showing of facts or circumstances supporting any departure from the general rule. In this case appellant has made no such showing to this court. We find no good reasons independent thereof to deny the appellee the award it seeks. The Government thus is awarded the $365.00 in costs at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">TAMM, Circuit Judge, with whom J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Despite the excellent reasoning set forth in the majority opinion in this case, I nevertheless am of the view that, considering all of the factual circumstances involved in this situation, each side should bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">HARRY T.
