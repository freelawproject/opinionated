He alleges, among other things, that the Georgia \u201cfighting words\u201d statute under which he was charged and convicted, Ga.Code \u00a7 26-2610(a), is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to the petitioner. We hold that the statute is not invalid on its face, but reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing on Lamar\u2019s contention that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-21\">On the morning of October 1, 1979, petitioner, a taxicab driver, picked up a passenger at the Atlanta airport. The passenger, a female college student, asked to be taken to Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead of taking the young woman to her requested destination, petitioner drove to an area of the city unfamiliar to his passenger and tried to seduce her. During the course of propositioning the young woman, petitioner made the statement to her that \u201cI bet your honey doesn\u2019t have the nine and one-half inch penis I have.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also held the woman\u2019s hand and insisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>that she give him her address and telephone number. The student was able to persuade petitioner to release her by giving a fictitious address as her residence at Agnes Scott College.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">As a result of making the comment quoted above to the young woman, petitioner was charged with violating Ga.Code \u00a7 26-2610(a), a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was convicted on January 29, 1980, after a non-jury trial in the State Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, and sentenced to the maximum of one year in prison. The testimony at the trial was neither taken down nor transcribed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner was represented by counsel at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Petitioner then filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, the court having jurisdiction over the person of respondent, his custodian.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lamar claimed that his conviction was invalid for essentially the same reasons as he now urges in support of his petition for federal habeas corpus. Counsel attempted to present testimony \u201cto show ... what context is the words that are charged in the ... accusation, and in what context the words were used,\u201d R. 190, but the State objected \u201cto re-trying the case at this time,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and the objection was sustained. R. 191. The state habeas hearing consisted largely of argument of counsel, and promptly after the hearing the Superi- or Court denied the petition on its merits in a written opinion. <em>Lamar v. Banks, </em>Civil Action No. 80-A-681 (Super.Ct. Gwinnett County, Ga., May 2, 1980). Application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal was denied by the Supreme Court of Georgia without opinion, Hill, J., dissenting. <em>Lamar v. Banks, </em>App. No. 1258 (Ga. July 16, 1980). There is thus no question that state remedies have been fully exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"apc-dedup-0\">Petitioner filed this federal habeas petition on May 7, 1980, and the case was referred to a magistrate for consideration. His motion for release on bond pending consideration of his petition was granted by the District Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner requested an evidentiary hearing, but none was held. On March 19, 1981, the magistrate issued his report, recommending that petitioner be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>denied habeas corpus relief. Petitioner then filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, again requesting an evidentiary hearing, but the District Court, after a review of the magistrate\u2019s findings, adopted the report as its own opinion and order. Petitioner now appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Petitioner first attacks the constitutionality of Ga.Code \u00a7 26-2610(a) and contends that the statute is invalid on its face.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that \u00a7 26 \u2014 2610 as a whole and \u00a7 26-2610(a), specifically, have not been limited to \u201cfighting words\u201d and thus may encompass forms of protected speech. It is clearly apparent, however, that the petitioner was charged with violating only subsection (a) of the statute. The criminal warrant for his arrest makes a specific reference to \u00a7 26-2610(a), and the prosecutor\u2019s accusation uses such identifying language <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that there can be no mistake as to which subsection of the statute petitioner was charged with violating. Petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge must therefore stand or fall on the validity of subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Because \u00a7 26-2610(a) punishes only spoken words, it can withstand a challenge to \u201cits facial constitutionality only if, -as authoritatively construed by the Georgia courts, it is not susceptible of application to speech, although vulgar or offensive, that is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 520, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972). Petitioner argues that the Georgia state courts have rendered conflicting decisions on the applicability of the statute and that, for this reason, \u00a7 26-2610(a) should be declared unconstitutional, as was the statute\u2019s predecessor in <em>Gooding v. Wilson, supra. </em>The Supreme Court in <em>Gooding </em>found that Georgia appellate courts had not construed former Ga.Code \u00a7 26-6303 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cso as to avoid all constitutional difficulties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 92 S.Ct. at 1109 (citing <em>United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 369, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 1404, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971)). Because the state courts had \u201capplied \u00a7 26-6303 to utterances where there was no likelihood that the person addressed would make an immediate violent response,\u201d the Supreme Court held the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under the rule of <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942). <em>Id. </em>at 528, 92 S.Ct. at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Petitioner cites a number of Georgia appellate decisions as evidence of the inconsistency of the state courts\u2019 application of Ga.Code \u00a7 26-2610, which was adopted in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gooding. </em>His argument would have some force if all of the cases cited involved subsection (a) of \u00a7 26-2610; however, many of the decisions concern defendants who were charged with violating subsection (b) of the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the cases cited that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>do involve alleged violations of \u00a7 26-2610(a) are not supportive of petitioner\u2019s contention. Application of subsection (a) was specifically limited to \u201cfighting words\u201d by the Georgia appellate courts in <em>Bolden v. State, </em>148 Ga.App. 315, 251 S.E.2d 165 (1978), and <em>Allen v. State, </em>137 Ga.App. 21, 222 S.E.2d 856 (1975), where convictions under the statute were upheld. Reversing a conviction, the court in <em>Rozier v. State, </em>140 Ga.App. 356, 231 S.E.2d 131 (1976), held that a remark made by a young man to a 16-year-old female did not constitute \u201cfighting words.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These decisions indicate that Georgia appellate courts have construed \u00a7 26-2610(a) to be limited to words that \u201chave a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\u201d <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>315 U.S. at 573, 62 S.Ct. at 770. Because the statute\u2019s words do no more than state the <em>Chaplinsky </em>and <em>Gooding </em>standard, and because the appellate courts of Georgia have not permitted it to be more broadly applied, petitioner\u2019s challenge to the facial constitutionality of the statute must fail.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Petitioner also suggests, citing <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), that no one can be validly convicted for using \u201cfighting words\u201d unless the hearer was actually aroused to violence, or the speaker intended such a result. Obviously petitioner did not intend to provoke his passenger to violence. He had quite another object in mind. And it is undisputed that she did not in fact react violently, perhaps because she was afraid, certainly in part because she showed uncommon coolness, resourcefulness, and presence of mind in very frightening circumstances. Section 26-2610(a) has not been interpreted to require either that the defendant intend to provoke violence, or that the addressee actually react violently. See <em>Bolden v. State, supra, </em>148 Ga.App. at 316, 251 S.E.2d at 166. Therefore, if petitioner\u2019s reading of <em>Cohen </em>is correct, \u00a7 26-2610(a) would proscribe some protected speech, as well as speech that is unprotected because it is within the exception for \u201cfighting words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">We disagree with this reading of <em>Cohen. </em>First of all, it makes no sense for a defendant\u2019s criminality to depend on the actual reaction of the hearer of the accused words. Under the rule proposed, if the young woman had struck Lamar, or struck at him, he would be validly convicted, but because she had the prudence to restrain herself, his words would be constitutionally protected.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is the <em>tendency </em>or <em>likelihood </em>of the words to provoke violent reaction that is the touchstone of the <em>Chaplinsky </em>test, not whether in a given case violence was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>sired by the speaker or actually occurred. It is true that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Cohen </em>contains the observation that \u201c[tjhere is ... no showing that anyone who saw Cohen was in fact violently aroused or that appellant intended such a result.\u201d 403 U.S. at 20, 91 S.Ct. at 1785. But this single sentence cannot bear the weight petitioner seeks to rest upon it. We do not read the Court\u2019s opinion to say that the State of California could not use the fighting-words doctrihe to support its prosecution of Cohen unless it proved either that he intended to provoke violence or that someone did become violent. A reading of the entire paragraph in which the cited sentence appears convinces us that that is not its meaning at all. Rather, the Court was simply refuting the possible argument, see <em>Feiner v. New York, </em>340 U.S. 315, 71 S.Ct. 303, 95 L.Ed. 295 (1951), that \u201cexercise of the State\u2019s police power\u201d might be permissible \u201cto prevent a speaker from intentionally provoking a given group to hostile reaction.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 20, 91 S.Ct. at 1785. The Court had already explained its reasons for holding the fighting-words exception unavailable to the State of California in its attempt to defeat Cohen\u2019s First Amendment defense: \u201cWhile the four-letter word displayed by Cohen in relation to the draft is not uncommonly employed in a personally provocative fashion, in this instance it was clearly not \u2018directed to the person of the hearer.\u2019 <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 309, 60 S.Ct. 900, 905, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). No individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably have regarded the words on appellant\u2019s jacket as a direct personal insult.\u201d 403 U.S. at 20, 91 S.Ct. at 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We conclude that Ga.Code \u00a7 26-2610(a) is not unconstitutional on its face. There is no occasion, of course, to express a view about the validity of any of the other subsections, of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The question remains whether the statute is invalid as applied to what Lamar said to his passenger. The words are not inflammatory <em>per se, </em>without regard to the circumstances in which they were uttered. Compare <em>Rozier v. State, supra, </em>in which similar words were held not to be criminal, perhaps because they were spoken in the home of the woman to whom they were addressed, perhaps because the speaker and the addressee were well acquainted before the incident in question occurred. In the instant case, the speaker and the addressee were strangers, a passenger in a cab is in a sense a captive of her driver, and the circumstances must have been alarming. We do not doubt that some women would have reacted violently, and with good reason. On the other hand, the tone of voice may have been jocular rather than hostile, and we do not know, on this record, what the rest of the conversation was like. The circumstances surrounding the words can be crucial, for only against the background of surrounding events can a judgment be made whether these words had \u201ca direct tendency to cause acts of violence\u201d by petitioner\u2019s passenger. \u201c[Constitutional enforcement of even facially valid laws applied to \u2018fighting words\u2019 now appears to depend as much on the factual circumstances surrounding a word\u2019s utterance as on the character of the word uttered.\u201d Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>618 (1978) (footnote omitted). <em>Accord, Hammond </em>v. <em>Adkisson, </em>536 F.2d 237, 239-40 (8th Cir. 1976) (\u201cAlthough the words used may be judicially noted as profane and abusive, a trier of fact might nonetheless find they did not constitute \u2018fighting words\u2019 \u2014 that is, words likely to incite the addressee to a violent reaction under the circumstances of the case\u201d); <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 135, 94 S.Ct. at 973 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">At this juncture in the analysis, we would ordinarily turn to a discussion of the circumstances in which the accused words were uttered. The difficulty is that we do not and cannot know the circumstances. No transcript of petitioner\u2019s trial exists or can be obtained. Both habeas courts refused to have an evidentiary hearing. The facts recounted in the magistrate\u2019s recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>mended findings might well suffice to support a conviction, but they are drawn largely from an unsworn statement of the victim that was apparently not even offered in evidence at the trial. We are driven to the conclusion that the case must be remanded for an evidentiary hearing at which petitioner will be given a chance to establish that what he said, under all the circumstances, did not directly <em>tend </em>to cause his passenger to resort to violence, and was not inherently <em>likely </em>to cause such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">We are mindful of our duty to accord to the state courts\u2019 written findings of fact a presumption of correctness, unless one of the eight paragraphs of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) applies. See <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). We believe our direction that an evidentiary hearing be held on remand in this case comports with that duty for at least two reasons. First, there is no state-court finding of fact here that is \u201cevidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or other reliable and adequate written indicia,\u201d as \u00a7 2254(d) requires in order for the presumption of correctness to arise in the first place. The sentence of the State Court of DeKalb County includes as a handwritten preamble the words, \u201cfinding of guilty having been entered,\u201d R. 18, but those words tell us no more than- a general verdict of a jury would have. Nor do we have, as already noted, a transcription of oral findings delivered from the bench. The state habeas court did file a written opinion, with most of which we are in agreement, but it is directed almost entirely to conclusions of law. A section of the opinion discusses and rejects petitioner\u2019s contention that the statute is unconstitutional as applied, but no finding is made that petitioner\u2019s words tended in fact under all the circumstances to provoke violence from the hearer. The state habeas court did say, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), that \u201cthis court finds that there was sufficient evidence to justify the fact finder in this case finding the Defendant Joseph Lamar, guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d R. 13, but we are at a loss to see what basis such a finding could have. Because of the absence of a transcript neither the state habeas court nor anyone else can ever know precisely what evidence the fact finder heard. There was no effort made by counsel at the state habeas hearing to summarize the evidence presented to the trial court in any formal way, and the state habeas court would not permit petitioner to call witnesses. <em>Cf. White </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>556 .F.2d 1366, 1368-69 (5th Cir. 1977) (state court\u2019s oral denial of post-conviction relief, supported by a certificate of the state judge filed a year later, is not a \u201cwritten finding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Second, even if there were a written finding of fact that petitioner\u2019s words tended to provoke a resort to violence, we should have to hold that \u201csuch factual determination is not fairly supported by the record,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), simply because there <em>is </em>no record in the sense of testimony about the crucial facts. \u201cOrdinarily such a record\u2014 including the transcript of testimony (or if unavailable some adequate substitute, such as a narrative record), the pleadings, court opinions, and other pertinent documents \u2014 is indispensable to determining whether the habeas applicant received a full and fair state-court evidentiary hearing resulting in reliable findings [citations omitted]. Of course, if because no record can be obtained the district judge has no way of determining whether a full and fair hearing which resulted in findings of relevant fact was vouchsafed, he must hold one.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 319, 83 S.Ct. 745, 760, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). <em>Townsend </em>was decided before the latest revision of \u00a7 2254(d), but the statute as presently written does not differ from the rule of <em>Townsend </em>in any respect directly relevant to this case. It necessarily remains true that a finding of fact (assuming there is one) cannot be said to be fairly supported by the record when there is no record, or at least none except an unsworn statement of one witness made neither in court nor in the presence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to hold an evi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>dentiary hearing on the tendency of petitioner\u2019s words to provoke his passenger to violence.

State, supra, </em>had said to the young woman in her home and in the presence of her five-year-old brother, \u201cHow about some pussy.\u201d The court stated, in reversing the conviction, that \u201c[\u00a7 26-2610(a) ] is very plainly designed to punish \u2018fighting words\u2019 which by their very utterance tend to incite an immediate breach of peace.\u201d 140 Ga.App. at 356, 231 S.E.2d at 131.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. Petitioner argues that his words were not \u201cdirected to\u201d the woman but to her boyfriend. We find little merit in this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\">. This is not a case where the words were addressed to a person who by virtue of his profession or training could be expected to absorb a certain amount of abuse without retaliating physically, for example, a policeman. \u201cThe situation may be different where ... words are addressed to a police officer trained to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen.\u201d <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>408 U.S. 913, 913, 92 S.Ct. 2499, 2499, 33 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring). Nor is this a case where \u201clanguage of the character charged might well have been anticipated by the audience.\u201d <em>Brown v. Oklahoma, </em>408 U.S. 914, 914, 92 S.Ct. 2507, 2508, 33 L.Ed.2d 326 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring). See <em>Cohen v. California, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 20, 91 S.Ct. at 1785, to the effect that the fighting-words doctrine covers words \u201caddressed to the ordinary citizen,\u201d like the taxicab passenger in this case. In <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 132 n.2, 94 S.Ct. 970, 972 n.2, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974), the Court declined to decide whether even \u201cfighting words\u201d might be immune from valid punishment when addressed to a trained officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
