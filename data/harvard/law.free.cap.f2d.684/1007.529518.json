(Mo-lycorp), Asarco, Inc. (Asarco) and Magma Copper Company (Magma) seek review of the final regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated under Section 119 of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7419, and governing issuance of primary nonferrous smelter orders (NSO\u2019s).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 40 C.F.R. Part 57, 45 Fed. Reg. 42514 <em>et seq. </em>(June 24, 1980). Asarco and Magma also seek review of EPA\u2019s denial of their petition for reconsideration of those regulations. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-22\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-23\">The Act requires that EPA designate air pollutants reasonably expected to endanger public health or welfare, and that it establish air quality standards for each designat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>ed pollutant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409. In 1971, EPA established ambient standards for a number of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (S02). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The nonferrous smelting process produces waste gas streams, denoted \u201cweak streams\u201d and \u201cstrong streams,\u201d which contain quantities of S02. Constant control technology, typically a sulfuric acid plant, has been used to remove S02 from strong streams but has been considered ineffective in removing S02 from weak streams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smelters have therefore relied primarily upon dispersion techniques,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in conjunction with acid plants, to meet EPA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">In the 1977 amendments to the Act, Congress enacted \u00a7 123, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7423, providing that only constant control technology could be relied upon to meet ambient air quality standards. Congress created an exception, however, for nonferrous smelters, giving them additional time to develop new technology which would enable them to meet their emission limitations solely through constant controls. \u00a7 119, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7419.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Before enactment of the 1977 amendments, EPA had concluded that constant control technology was reasonable for most smelters only to control \u201cstrong streams\u201d and that constant control of \u201cweak streams\u201d was in most cases \u201ceconomically unreasonable and could in some cases result in shutdown.\u201d EPA Stack Height Increase Guideline, 41 Fed.Reg. 7450, 7452 (1976). EPA had therefore allowed smelters to use dispersion techniques in conjunction with acid plants to meet ambient standards. In enacting \u00a7 119, Congress \u201cconfirmed the authority of EPA to pursue the Agency\u2019s present smelter policy.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.95-294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 61 (1977) (House Report), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">Section 119 authorized EPA or the States to issue up to two NSO\u2019s permitting a smelter to continue reliance for a limited time on dispersion techniques, where constant controls sufficient to meet the emission limitations for S02 were not \u201cadequately demonstrated to be reasonably available.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During an NSO term, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>smelter is required, however, to use constant control equipment in addition to dispersion techniques in attaining the ambient standards, \u00a7 119(d)(1)(C),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> unless such equipment \u201cwould be so costly as to necessitate permanent, or prolonged temporary cessation of operations.\u201d \u00a7 119(d)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A smelter already using constant and supplemental controls may not be required, as a condition of receiving a first NSO, to secure \u201cadditional continuous emission reduction technology\u201d without a hearing. \u00a7 119(d)(4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, smelters receiving NSO\u2019s must commit reasonable resources to research and development of appropriate emission control technology. \u00a7 119(d)(l)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">EPA published proposed regulations implementing \u00a7 119 on January 31, 1979. 44 Fed.Reg. 6284 <em>et seq. </em>The proposed regulations set forth, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) a financial test for NSO eligibility, i.e., whether additional constant controls are \u201cadequately demonstrated to be reasonably available\u201d to the smelter pursuant to \u00a7 119(b)(3), and (2) operating requirements for the smelter\u2019s acid plant during the NSO term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">Under EPA\u2019s financial test, a smelter is eligible for NSO if it cannot install the required constant control equipment \u201cwithout reducing the present value of [its] net income and terminal value below [its] current salvage value\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The test thus compares the net revenues a smelter would receive from its operations after installing constant controls with salvage value upon closure. Constant controls are deemed \u201creasonably available\u201d if the smelter, on being required to install them immediately, would elect to continue operation, rather than close down. Hence the parties\u2019 appellation, \u201cclosure,\u201d to EPA\u2019s test. Revenue and cost forecasts for use in making that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>determination are based upon EPA estimates of metals prices, labor and energy-costs, inflation rates, and the cost of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">Respecting operating requirements, the regulations provide that a smelter receiving an NSO must control all of its strong S02 streams in an acid plant and may bypass the acid plant only when necessary because of a malfunction or during start-up following acid plant closure for scheduled maintenance or halts in smelter production.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">Petitioners argued in comments to EPA that both the eligibility test and operating requirements contravene \u00a7 119. EPA rejected those arguments and published its final regulations on June 24, 1980 (45 Fed. Reg. 42514 <em>et seq.). </em>EPA acknowledged in a preamble that a portion of the economic forecast data in the eligibility test was not placed in the docket until shortly before promulgation, and announced that it would consider objections to that material as based on grounds \u201carising after the period for public comment\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> EPA also stated in the preamble that the eligibility test was derived from economic feasibility tests used by the agency before enactment of \u00a7 119, citing financial analyses performed by EPA for two smelters.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">Petitioners Asarco and Magma jointly filed a petition requesting that EPA convene a proceeding to reconsider its eligibility test and forecast data, and asked that EPA provide additional materials respecting its prior economic tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">Responding, EPA made certain changes which it termed \u201ctechnical corrections\u201d to some economic forecast data,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but refused to reinstitute notice and comment proceedings or to place additional materials in the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">Each of the petitioners here filed a petition for review of the final regulations on the ground that the regulations violate \u00a7 119. Kennecott and Bunker also assert unconstitutionality of \u00a7 110(a)(6) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(6), which forbids reduction of employees\u2019 pay as a result of using dispersion techniques under an NSO.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Molycorp says EPA improperly excluded molybdenum roasters from relief under \u00a7 119. The petitions were consolidated by order of this court dated September 3,1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">Asarco and Magma also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial of their petition for reconsideration, asserting certain procedural defects in EPA\u2019s rulemaking and saying that EPA thus violated certain requirements of \u00a7 307(d) of the Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>tion was Consolidated with the others by order of this court dated March 12, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">(1) Whether EPA\u2019s financial test governing NSO eligibility is authorized under \u00a7 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">(2) Whether EPA\u2019s regulations governing interim acid plant operation are consistent with \u00a7 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">(3) Whether \u00a7 110(a)(6) constitutes an unconstitutional impairment of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">(4) Whether EPA properly excluded molybdenum roasters from relief under \u00a7 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">(5) Whether EPA violated the procedural requirements of \u00a7 307(d) in its rulemaking proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">(1) <em>Financial Test Governing NSO Eligibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">Under \u00a7 119(b)(3), a smelter is eligible for an NSO if the constant controls required to meet the ambient standards for S02 have not been \u201cadequately demonstrated to be reasonably available\u201d to the smelter, \u201cas determined by the Administrator, taking into account the cost of compliance, non-air quality health and environmental impact, and energy consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">Petitioners say that EPA\u2019s \u201cclosure,\u201d i.e., shut down of all operations, test is inconsistent with \u00a7 119(b)(3); that the legislative history of \u00a7 119 makes clear that \u201creasonably available\u201d is a less strict standard than closure and was intended to measure whether a smelter would experience a significant decrease in profitability if constant controls were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-18\">In response, EPA says: that \u00a7 119(b)(3) gives the agency broad discretion in formulating an eligibility test, leaving to the agency the precise means and criteria for assessing the significance of the costs of compliance; that had Congress intended application of a specific test, such as that focusing on profitability as suggested by petitioners, it would have expressly so provided; that Congress in \u00a7 119(b)(3) adopted EPA\u2019s pre-1977 practice of authorizing the use of dispersion techniques when the only alternatives are permanent production curtailment, shutdown or delays in attainment of the national standards; and that in enacting \u00a7 119(b)(3), Congress endorsed the holding in <em>Kennecott v. EPA, </em>526 F.2d 1149 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-19\">In reviewing substantive challenges, a court may reverse only those EPA actions found \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.... \u201d \u00a7 307(d)(9).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Though the court must engage in a \u201csearching and careful\u201d inquiry into the facts, <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), it may not substitute its judgment for that of the Administrator. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-20\">We look first to the statute before us, for agency action contrary thereto is necessarily \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d Section 119(b)(3) requires that EPA determine whether controls are \u201creasonably available.\u201d In making its determination, EPA\u2019s application of a closure standard is, in our view, inconsistent with that statutory mandate. To employ EPA\u2019s \u201cif\u201d approach, had Congress intended that a closure standard be applied, it could have chosen lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>guage similar to that of \u00a7 119(d)(2), <em>supra, </em>note 8, wherein it required NSO applicants to demonstrate that interim use of constant controls would cause a \u201ccessation of operations.\u201d Indeed, Congress\u2019 election to employ \u201ccessation\u201d in \u00a7 119(d)(2), and to employ the distinctly different standard \u201creasonably available\u201d in \u00a7 119(b)(3), is strong evidence that Congress intended application of something less than a \u201cclosure\u201d test in determining eligibility for an NSO under \u00a7 119(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">In the 1977 amendments, as EPA correctly states, Congress clearly intended to adopt the substance of EPA\u2019s then existing smelter policy. House Report at 61. The legislative history of those amendments, however, establishes that Congress viewed that policy as mandating a standard short of \u201cclosure\u201d or smelter shutdown. The House Report indicates that Congress viewed that policy as allowing use of dispersion techniques if constant controls were \u201ceconomically unreasonable.\u201d House Report at 63. Quoting from EPA\u2019s Stack Height Guideline, <em>supra, </em>the report states: \u201cIn the case of existing smelters, BACT [best available control technology] will, in most cases, be economically unreasonable and could, in some cases result in shutdown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That the House Report introduces that quotation with: \u201cRetrofitting existing smelters involves additional problems, which EPA cited in the Legal Interpretation and Guidelines explaining its present policy\u201d, indicates the House Committee\u2019s understanding that the Stack Height Guideline did two things: it set forth problems of retrofitting existing smelters; and it explained EPA\u2019s existing policy. Moreover, the report noted that \u00a7 119 is necessary because of \u201ctechnological and economic problems confronting existing primary nonferrous smelters.\u201d Quoting from EPA\u2019s new source performance standards for primary nonferrous smelters (41 Fed.Reg. 2332 (1976)), the report described the difficulties involved in installing constant controls as producing \u201ca significant decrease in profitability, a significant loss in sales, or a closing of some mines and a decrease in mining activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to EPA\u2019s contentions, Congress did not, therefore, endorse a test based solely on preventing smelters from closing. As the legislative history makes clear, it sought to provide relief to the nonferrous smelter industry from a number of adverse economic consequences short of actual shutdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Nor does the holding in <em>Kennecott </em>in any manner indicate the view that Congress endorsed a closure test. Though the court in <em>Kennecott </em>approved EPA\u2019s implementation plan for Nevada which allowed use of dispersion techniques \u201cwhen the only alternatives are permanent production curtailment, shutdown or delays in attainment of the national standards,\u201d 526 F.2d at 1151-52, n. 13, the court did not reach the issue of whether use of dispersion techniques is equally appropriate in other circumstances. It was undisputed in that case that it was economically infeasible for Kennecott to rely solely on constant controls in attaining the ambient standards at its Nevada smelter. The only issue litigated in <em>Kennecott </em>was whether EPA could ever require constant controls where a smelter could attain the ambient standards solely through use of dispersion techniques. Thus, contrary to EPA assertions, the court neither analyzed nor endorsed the position EPA asserts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Because EPA\u2019s regulations establishing a closure standard are based on misinterpretation of the phrase \u201creasonably available\u201d in \u00a7 119(b)(3), they are without support in the statute and are contrary to the intent gleanable from the statute\u2019s legislative history. They are therefore not in accordance with law and cannot stand.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>(2) <em>Interim Acid Plant Operation</em></p>\n<p id=\"aey-dedup-1\">Petitioners Asarco and Magma assert that EPA\u2019s rules requiring treatment of all S02 strong streams in an acid plant<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> are violative of \u00a7 119. Those rules allow a smelter under an initial NSO to bypass the strong stream acid plant in some circumstances.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Asarco and Magma say, however, that bypass should also be permitted during periods of excess S02 production and periods of essential scheduled maintenance, because a smelter would otherwise have to curtail production significantly or install a second acid plant. If a smelter curtails production, Asarco and Magma say it will, contrary to the intent of \u00a7 119, suffer a significant decrease in profitability and a significant loss in sales. They say forced installation of a second acid plant conflicts with \u00a7 119(d)(4), <em>supra, </em>note 9, which prohibits EPA from requiring further constant controls during an initial NSO without a hearing where the smelter already uses an acid plant and dispersion techniques. Though Asarco and Magma concede that EPA\u2019s existing smelter policy did not allow bypass during those periods and that Congress in \u00a7 119 confirmed the general principles of EPA\u2019s existing policy, they say \u00a7 119(d)(4) evidences Congress\u2019 rejection of EPA\u2019s policy specifically respecting acid plant bypass.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">We cannot agree with Asarco and Magma\u2019s basic premise. There is, on this record, no basis to conclude that EPA\u2019s bypass rules require a smelter to install additional acid plant capacity. EPA has imposed no such requirement on either Asarco or Magma. Section 119(d)(4) is thus not on this record implicated, and we need not discuss petitioners\u2019 interpretations thereof. Comments on the proposed rules indicated only three smelters at which excess gas might be a problem \u2014 Asarco\u2019s smelters at Hayden and Tacoma and the Magma smelter.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Magma asserted that its acid plant was designed to handle the full gas volume but that leakage in the flue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>system resulted in a gas volume exceeding acid plant capacity, necessitating bypass or production curtailment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> EPA found that the excess gas could be reduced or eliminated by improved maintenance of flue systems.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That finding is reasonable and supported by testimony of a Magma employee and by that of Asarco\u2019s Hayden plant manager. The challenge of that finding, based on contradictory statements in Magma\u2019s submissions to EPA concerning its acid plant problems and maintenance programs underway,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> is misplaced here. It is not our function to \u201cresolve disagreements ... or to judge the merits of competing . .. views.\u201d <em>Lead Industries Assoc, </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>647 F.2d 1130, 1160 (D.C.Cir.1980). Our task in relation to this issue is the limited one of ascertaining that the finding made by EPA was reasonable and supported by the record. The mere presence of evidence that may support conclusions inconsistent with those of EPA does not require us to conclude that the latter were improper. <em>Id. </em>There is thus no basis in this record for requiring that EPA\u2019s rules be revised to permit bypass of the acid plant during periods of excess S02 production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Respecting bypass for scheduled maintenance, EPA determined that production foregone during scheduled maintenance could be rescheduled at other times. Though Asarco and Magma say a smelter cannot increase its production \u201cat will,\u201d they do not dispute EPA\u2019s finding that sufficient opportunities exist to make up for production foregone during scheduled maintenance. There is thus no basis in this case for requiring that EPA\u2019s rules be revised to permit bypass of the acid plant during periods of scheduled maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Thus EPA\u2019s rules governing interim acid plant operation do not in this case result in a forced addition of a second acid plant, and do not, therefore, implicate \u00a7 119(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">(3) <em>Constitutionality of \u00a7 110(a)(6)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">Section 110(a)(6) of the Act prohibits reduction of any employee\u2019s pay resulting from use of dispersion techniques.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Kennecott and Bunker\u2019s argument that \u00a7 110(a)(6) constitutes an unconstitutional impairment of labor contracts is without merit. Though Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution is applicable only to the states, the courts have recognized a similar limitation present in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>592 F.2d 947, 960 (7th Cir. 1979), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>446 U.S. 359, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">Courts routinely uphold statutes which, like \u00a7 110(a)(6), seek to promote a national purpose (here, clean air) and, at the same time, to adjust the economic burden involved in achieving that purpose. Such legislative acts, \u201cadjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life [carry] a presumption of constitutionality and ... the burden is on one complaining of a due process violation to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\u201d <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 15, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2892, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). In enacting \u00a7 110(a)(6) Congress reasonably implemented its desire to insure that smelter employees do not pay disproportionately for pollution controls.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The section also coincides with Congress\u2019 overall intent to diminish incentives for use of dispersion techniques vis-a-vis constant controls. Whether the section is unnecessary because, as Kennecott and Bunker sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>gest, Congress could have elected to pay idled workers from general tax revenues, is a matter in this case for legislative, not judicial, judgment. Section 110(a)(6) is a reasonable exercise of Congress\u2019 power, which, though it adjusts the \u201cburdens and benefits of economic life\u201d, is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">(4) <em>Exclusion of Molybdenum Roasters</em></p>\n<p id=\"ain-dedup-0\">Molycorp says that EPA erred in determining that a molybdenum roaster is not a \u201cnonferrous smelter\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 119, and in limiting eligibility for relief under that section to copper, lead and zinc smelters. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 57.102(a), 45 Fed.Reg. 42536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">EPA says Congress explicitly sought to adopt EPA\u2019s existing smelter policy which did not apply to molybdenum roasters; and that there is no basis for interpreting \u00a7 119 as including them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Neither the Act nor its legislative history has a word to say respecting the breadth to be given the term \u201cnonferrous smelter.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Section 119 provides that a \u201cprimary nonferrous smelter order\u201d may be issued to a \u201cprimary nonferrous smelter.\u201d \u201cNonferrous\u201d is not a term of art or a specifically technical term. It is unambiguous, encompassing all that which is not ferrous, that is, \u201cof, relating to, or containing iron\u201d. <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(4th Ed. 1976). Molybdenum is not ferrous. EPA does not contest the view that a roaster is a form of smelter. Courts will disregard a term\u2019s literal meaning where it is evident that a special or limited meaning was intended or necessary to effectuate legislative intent. <em>Malat v. Riddell, </em>383 U.S. 569, 571, 86 S.Ct. 1030, 1032, 16 L.Ed.2d 102 (1966). There is no such indication here. On the contrary, Congress\u2019 use of the broad term, without definition or limitation, would indicate an intent contrary to EPA\u2019s election to limit nonferrous smelters to those engaged in the smelting of copper, lead, and zinc. That no EPA actions involving molybdenum roasters had occurred at the time \u00a7 119 was enacted is alone insufficient to establish that Congress intended to exclude such facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">Because a molybdenum roaster falls clearly, on this record, within the statutory term \u201cnonferrous smelter,\u201d EPA\u2019s election to exclude it was not in accordance with law and was thus error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">(5) <em>Procedural Requirements of \u00a7 307(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">In reviewing alleged procedural errors, this court may invalidate EPA rules only if EPA\u2019s failure to observe procedures was arbitrary, specific objections were timely or were of central relevance to the outcome, and the errors were so serious and related to matters of such relevance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had not been made. \u00a7 307(d)(9)(D), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(D).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>Asarco and Magma urge that EPA violated the procedural requirements of \u00a7 307(d) by not placing in the docket for public comment certain data relating to the basis for its NSO eligibility test, including the two prior EPA financial analyses referred to in the preamble to the final regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Section 307(d)(3) requires that notice of proposed NSO regulations be accompanied by a statement of their basis and purpose, including the factual data on which the proposed regulations are based, the methodology used in obtaining and analyzing the data, and the major legal interpretations and policy considerations underlying the proposed regulations.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> When final regulations are promulgated, a statement meeting those same requirements must again be included, together with an explanation of any major changes in the proposed rules. \u00a7 307(d)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Though EPA states in its preamble to the final regulations that its current eligibility test is based upon a closure policy adopted by EPA before 1977, and that it has used financial tests similar to the present closure test under the agency\u2019s existing policy, no documents embodying those tests or demonstrating the methodology used before 1977 were ever placed in the docket. The only document in the docket purporting to explain that a closure test was ever employed by EPA was a memorandum in which EPA economist Hale sets forth his recollection that such a test had been used before 1977 to determine whether smelters would be permitted to rely upon dispersion techniques to meet the ambient standards. That memo, dated August 17, 1979, was placed in the docket on March 12, 1980, approximately eleven months after the close of the public comment period, and reveals neither the actual tests nor the methodology used by EPA. The failure of EPA to observe the procedures mandated by \u00a7\u00a7 307(d)(3) and 307(d)(6) was thus arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">EPA says it did not base the NSO closure test on the two prior financial analyses referred to in the preamble, and did not rely on those analyses in proposing or promulgating the present regulations. It says that the analyses are merely examples of the implementation of prior smelter policy used by EPA in evaluating whether the cost of installing constant controls would likely cause smelter shutdown and as such are not properly part of the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">That argument is disingenuous. In response to challenges that a closure test is inconsistent with \u00a7 119, EPA has elsewhere argued before us, as above indicated, that its closure test was based on EPA\u2019s interpretation of Congress\u2019 intent to adopt the basic features of the agency\u2019s existing smelter policy, that the analyses evidence use of a closure test under its prior policy, and that its closure test is consistent with a prior policy focus on shutdown rather than on profitability. If that argument be factually based, the financial analyses clearly form a basis for the regulations and should properly have been included in the docket. In all events, absence of those documents, or of comparable materials showing the nature and scope of its prior practice, makes impossible any meaningful comment on the merits of EPA\u2019s assertions. In all the circumstances, EPA\u2019s failure to include such documents constitutes reversible error, for the uncertainty that might be clarified by those documents with respect to the test, the data, and the methodology used by EPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>before enactment of \u00a7 119, indicates a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that the regulations would \u201chave been significantly changed\u201d. \u00a7 307(d)(9)(D).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">Finally, Asarco and Magma correctly say that EPA violated \u00a7 307(d) in refusing to allow public comment on its economic forecast data. In <em>Sierra Club v. Costle, </em>657 F.2d 298 (D.C.Cir.1981), this court, in approving EPA\u2019s use of an econometric computer model to forecast future impacts of alternative standards, stated that \u201c[t]he safety valves in the use of such sophisticated methodology are the requirement of public exposure of the assumptions and data incorporated into the analysis and the acceptance and consideration of public comment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">EPA neglected such \u201csafety valves\u201d in promulgating its NSO eligibility test. EPA\u2019s forecast data was placed in the docket only one week before promulgation of its final regulations and differed significantly from the forecast data provided during the public comment period. Thus, there has been no opportunity for the notice and comment proceedings contemplated by \u00a7 307(d)(5).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> That EPA allowed petitions for reconsideration is not an adequate substitute for an opportunity for notice and comment prior to promulgation. <em>See New Jersey v. EPA, </em>626 F.2d 1038 (D.C.Cir.1980). In <em>New Jersey, </em>this court held that reconsideration petitions were insufficient to cure EPA\u2019s failure to follow notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553), and quoted with approval the 5th Circuit\u2019s statement in <em>United States Steel Corp. v. EPA, </em>595 F.2d 207, 214 (5th Cir. 1979), that \u201c[permitting the submission of views after the effective date is no substitute for the right of interested persons to make their views known to the agency in time to influence the rule-making process in a meaningful way ...\u201d 626 F.2d at 1049. There is no reason to imply a different rule under \u00a7 307(d). To the contrary, the Act specifically requires that EPA convene a proceeding for reconsideration of a rule where the objection is based on grounds arising after the period for public comment and is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and also requires that EPA provide the same procedural rights that would have been afforded had the information been available at the time the rule was proposed. \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Review of a petition for reconsideration is an inadequate substitute for the statutorily required hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">Because the reasonableness and accuracy of the forecast data is critical to whether a smelter can qualify for an NSO, Asarco and Magma\u2019s objections to that data, if well-founded, would clearly have been \u201cof central relevance.\u201d \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B). In such circumstances, EPA\u2019s refusal to convene a new round of public comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>proceedings constitutes reversible error under \u00a7 307(d)(9).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Because EPA\u2019s regulations governing NSO eligibility are inconsistent with \u00a7 119, being based on a misinterpretation of \u201creasonably available\u201d in that section, and because EPA committed procedural errors in its rulemaking proceedings, those regulations cannot stand. The regulations are therefore vacated and remanded to EPA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">EPA\u2019s regulations governing interim acid plant operation are, on this record, sustained as consistent with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">Section 110(a)(6) of the Act, which forbids a smelter to reduce employee pay because of use of dispersion techniques, is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Because there is no evidence of a contrary congressional intent, and because the statutory term is unambiguous, NSO relief must be available to all \u201cnonferrous smelters,\u201d including, on this record, molybdenum roasters.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-24\">.

Petitioners\u2019 objection that EPA\u2019s imposition of a single eligibility test usurps the role of the states is without merit. Though \u00a7 119 gives the states authority to issue NSO\u2019s, petitioners do not dispute that it also requires the states to submit each such NSO to EPA for approval. \u00a7 119(a)(1). Nor do petitioners dispute that, under \u00a7 119(b)(3), eligibility for an NSO is contingent on affordability of controls, \u201cas determined by the Administrator.\u201d It is clear from \u00a7 119(b)(3) that Congress intended an independent determination by EPA in reviewing a state\u2019s affordability finding. That EPA may prescribe in advance the criteria the states must use in making affordability determinations appears clear from the statute. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>301(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(a), empowers EPA to prescribe \u201csuch regulations as are necessary\u201d to carry out its functions, one of which is to make affordability determinations. Section 301(a) also requires that regulations \u201casure fairness and uniformity in the criteria, procedures, and policies applied by the various regions in implementing and enforcing the Act.\u201d \u00a7 301(a)(2). Establishing a single set of criteria is consistent with that mandate. The alternative, establishing criteria on an ad hoc, incremental basis, as EPA evaluates NSO applications made to it and also evaluates NSO\u2019s submitted for approval by the states, would not result in the \u201cfairness and uniformity\u201d contemplated by Congress in enacting \u00a7 301(a)(2). <em>See Trans-Pacific Freight v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>650 F.2d 1235, 1244-45 (D.C.Cir. 1980). On the same analysis, Kennecott and Bunker\u2019s argument that NSO rules relating to interim acid plant operation should not apply to state-issued NSO\u2019s is meritless. Section 119(d)(1)(A) requires use of such \u201cinterim measures as may be necessary in the judgment of the Administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Similarly without merit are Kennecott and Bunker\u2019s contentions (1) that, because EPA\u2019s pre-1977 smelter policy considered \u201creasonably available\u201d controls to be control of strong streams in an acid plant, any smelter now using an acid plant should be eligible for an NSO under \u00a7 119(b)(3) without regard to its economic position, and (2) that EPA may not require constant control of weak streams unless it first holds hearings and determines that weak stream controls are \u201creasonably available\u201d industry-wide in accordance with \u00a7 119(d)(4). Section 119(b)(3) clearly focuses on an individual <em>smelter\u2019s, </em>not an industry\u2019s, application for an NSO, and on whether \u201csuch smelter\u201d is eligible, considering costs and other site-specific factors. Petitioners\u2019 argument is, moreover, inconsistent with EPA\u2019s pre-1977 policy, which applied a smelter-specific standard. EPA\u2019s industry-wide determination was that reasonably available control technology for strong streams existed in the form of an acid plant. Interpretation of \u00a7 119(b)(3) as allowing all smelters to use dispersion techniques without regard to economic feasibility would ignore Congress\u2019 desire for increased use of constant controls and its mere toleration of dispersion techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that a hearing is required under \u00a7 119(d)(4) is based on an apparent misunderstanding. That section does not relate to eligibility for an NSO, but to the nature of interim controls that may be required once an NSO has been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 57.301, 45 Fed.Reg. 42539-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 57.304, 45 Fed.Reg. 42540.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">.

The procedures observed by EPA must be judged here as of the time of the rulemaking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">. \u00a7 307(d)(5) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-8\">(5) In promulgating a rule to which this subsection applies (i) the Administrator shall allow any person to submit written comments, data, or documentary information; (ii) the Administrator shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions; (iii) a transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation; and (iv) the Administrator shall keep the record of such proceeding open for thirty days after completion of the proceeding to provide an opportunity for submission of rebuttal and supplementary information.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">. \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-14\">(B) [If] an objection to a rule or procedure is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, the Administrator shall convene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule and provide the same procedural rights as would have been afforded had the information been available at the time the rule was proposed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">. Asarco and Magma request that we order adoption of procedures permitting the cross-examination of economist Hale \u201carbitrarily\u201d denied them by EPA. The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that courts must be particularly reticent about going beyond the procedures established by Congress and in requiring agencies to provide additional rulemaking procedures. <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 540-548, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1209-14, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978). This court has held that judicial restraint is particularly appropriate where, as here, Congress considered and deliberately rejected a cross-examination requirement. <em>Lead Industries Assoc, v. EPA, </em>647 F.2d 1130, 1170 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
