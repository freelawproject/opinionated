Inc. to broaden the commodities authorized in its certificate of public convenience and necessity. A certificate issued in 1973 authorized Port Norris to transport \u201ccullet in bulk\u201d (broken glass) between points in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Following the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-296, 94 Stat. 793 (1980), the ICC, pursuant to the Act and rules and guidelines promulgated by the Commission, granted Port Norris\u2019 application to broaden its authority to \u201ccommodities in bulk\u201d. Rit-ter contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission arbitrarily failed to consider whether Port Norris is \u201cfit, willing, and able\u201d to transport \u201ccommodities in bulk\u201d. For the reasons set forth below we vacate the ICC\u2019s order granting Port Norris\u2019 application and remand to the Commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 requires the Commission to implement, by regulation, procedures to process removal of operating restrictions in order to ... <em>reasonably broaden </em>the categories of property authorized by the carrier\u2019s certificate or permit. ...\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10922(h)(l)(B)(i) (West.Supp.1981) (emphasis added). However, as noted by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">In mandating the removal of unreasonable restrictions, the statute does not dispense with the [Act\u2019s] primary requirement that every carrier be \u201cfit, willing and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate.\u201d [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10922(a)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1981)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-17\"><em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. I. C.C., </em>659 F.2d 452, 464 (5 Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">In <em>Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. I.C.C., </em>666 F.2d 255 (5 Cir. 1982) <em>(\u201cSteere I\u201d), </em>the court reviewed an ICC decision involving the identical question here presented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-20\">We believe that an applicant for removal of a restriction should be required to make a prima facie showing in its application that it is fit, willing and able to provide the transportation for which it is seeking authorization. We do not suggest that such a showing must be elaborate. What form that showing should take and how detailed it should be are, in the first instance, matters that should be addressed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-21\"><em>Id. </em>at 258. Because the applicant had made no such showing, the case was remanded for reconsideration in the light of <em>American Trucking Associations.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-22\">We agree with the Fifth Circuit that the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 did not repeal <em>sub silentio </em>\u00a7 10922(a)(l)(A)\u2019s requirement that an applicant be found \u201cfit, willing, and able to provide the transportation for which it is seeking authorization.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Steere I, </em>supra. The term \u201creasonably broaden\u201d, as used in \u00a7 10922(h)(l)(B)(i), includes a consideration of whether the applicant is \u201cfit, willing, and able.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Commission properly noted that the scope of review is whether the agency action is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ...\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). We recognize that under this standard the scope of review is a narrow one. The reviewing court \u201cmust consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). \u201c[A] finding that a decision is not \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 clearly must rest upon a corollary finding that the relevant factors upon which the decision is assertedly based are supported by some evidence .... \u201d <em>Doe v. Hampton, </em>566 F.2d 265, 271 n.15 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Although Port Norris\u2019 application detailed how expansion of its authority would conserve energy resources, improve efficiency, and increase both competition and revenues, nowhere does it indicate that Port Norris is \u201cfit, willing, and able to provide the transportation authorized by the certificate.\u201d The ICC\u2019s decision to grant the application is likewise void of any consideration of these \u201crelevant factors\u201d. Absent such a consideration, it cannot be said that the ICC <em>\u201creasonably </em>broadened\u201d the categories of property authorized by the applicant\u2019s certificate. Its decision was arbitrary because the Commission failed to consider the relevant factor of whether the applicant was \u201cfit, willing, and able\u201d to perform the expanded service.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We agree also with the holding in <em>Steere I, supra, </em>that the showing that an applicant is fit, willing, and able \u201cneed not be elaborate\u201d and that the form and details of the showing \u201care, in the first instance matters that should be addressed to the Interstate Commerce Commission.\u201d Specifically, the time restraints of the Act contemplate the use of expedited procedures in restriction removal cases. <em>American Trucking Associations, </em>659 F.2d 461.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ICC retains broad discretion, within statutory limits, to define appropriate commodity categories. <em>Id. </em>at 464-65. Likewise, it has discretion in determining what facilities and equipment may be required.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">We vacate the order under review and remand to the Interstate Commerce Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-13\">. The Commission recognizes that the facts in <em>Steere I </em>\u201care substantially similar to the facts in this case,\u201d but argues that the Steere decision \u201cimposes an unreasonable burden upon applicants for restriction removal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-23\">. The same question was raised in <em>Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. I.C.C., </em>667 F.2d 490 (5 Cir. 1982) <em>(\u201cSteere II </em>\u201d). Again recognizing the necessity of finding an applicant \u201cfit, willing, and able\u201d to provide expanded service, the case was dismissed as moot after the ICC granted a new certificate in which the applicant was determined to be \u201cfit, willing, and able\u201d to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>bulk service in separate proceedings on the new application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. The Commission correctly notes that \u201cCongress did not intend to invoke the full panoply of APA formal hearing requirements\u201d and that the APA does not \u201crequire full-fledged adversary-type hearings in restriction removal cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-23\">. We agree with the Commission that an applicant should not \u201cbe compelled to buy all equipment necessary to transport every conceivable commodity encompassed by the expanded authority before the applicant even receives the authority it seeks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
