United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>621 F.2d 992 (9th Cir. 1980), and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>North Haven Board of Education v. Bell, </em>- U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982). The sole issue raised in the cross-motions for summary judgment below was whether Title IX enabled the Department of Education to issue regulations prohibiting employment discrimination in educational programs receiving federal assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-20\">Because the Supreme Court in <em>North Haven </em>determined that employment discrimination fell within Title IX\u2019s prohibition subject to a program-specific limitation, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Seattle University and remand the cause with instruction to grant summary judgment for the Department of Education in light of <em>North Haven.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
