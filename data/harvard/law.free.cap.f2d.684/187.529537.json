Carter resigned on April 12, allegedly as a result of race and sex discrimination, although SGC contends that she resigned because she had recently been injured in an automobile accident and that she had earlier received several warnings about unsatisfactory work performance. Approximately one year later, sometime in April 1974, Carter returned to the store to inquire about reemployment. The manager told her that there were no jobs available. Carter claims that she later learned that the Pathmark store was hiring more employees and that she was not rehired on grounds of race and sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">On January 13,1975, Carter filed charges of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), and she filed similar charges the next day with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). There is no record of what, if any, action MCAD took. The EEOC issued Carter a right-to-sue letter on June 15, 1975. On August 8, 1975, Carter (together with her late husband) filed a complaint in federal district court alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1870, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and of the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d). Carter sought class certification of her suit, but the case was eventually reduced to her individual claims. Little occurred in the case after August 1975 until July 1981, when SGC moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds on both the \u00a7 1981 and Equal Pay Act claims. On August 24,1981, Carter moved to amend her complaint by adding a Title VII claim and by adding an allegation of willfulness to the Equal Pay Act claim (which would have given her the benefit of a longer statute of limitations). The district court denied Carter\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carter appealed this ruling, but we rejected the appeal because it was not taken from a final order. The district court heard the summary judgment motion on November 2, 1981. The court ruled orally that the six-month period contained in Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was the limitations period applicable to Carter\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim and that this period had run before Carter filed her complaint. The court also rejected the Equal Pay Act claim as time-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">We examine first whether the \u00a7 1981 claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Section 1981 not having its own limitations period, we look to the most analogous Massachusetts statute of limitations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 179-82, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2598-2600, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 462, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1721, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). In three recent opinions, we have considered the appropriate Massachusetts statute for federal civil rights claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In all three cases we found that the general contract and tort statutes of limitations in Massachusetts, Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2A (six years and three (formerly two) years, respectively), did not apply to the claims but that more specific statutes did. In the first, <em>Burns v. Sullivan, </em>619 F.2d 99, 105-08 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 893, 101 S.Ct. 256, 66 L.Ed.2d 121 (1980), we held that Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5, which provides a six-month period, was applicable to a policeman\u2019s claim of race discrimination. A six-month period was also applied in <em>Hussey v. Sullivan, </em>651 F.2d 74, 76 (1st Cir. 1981) (per curiam), <em>aff\u2019g </em>498 F.Supp. 594 (D.Mass.), to a policeman\u2019s claim of political discrimination, although there we looked to Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 31, \u00a7 42, which deals with Massachusetts civil servants. Finally, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Holden v. Commission Against Discrimination, </em>671 F.2d 30, 33-34 (1st Cir. 1982), we held that equal protection and free speech claims by an MCAD employee (a Commonwealth employee) were covered by <em>Burns </em>and <em>Hussey, </em>respectively, and that the limitations period for a claim of due process violation was also to be found in Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 31, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We believe that these decisions are helpful here, even though this case is different in two respects; it involves a \u00a7 1981, not a \u00a7 1983, claim, and the plaintiff is a private employee, not a public employee. In applying a state statute of limitations to a federal claim, we examine the exact nature of the federal claim, and distinctions between federal statutes, such as between \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983, are not necessarily important. Sections 1981 and 1983 both attempt to protect a broad range of civil rights, certainly including the right claimed by Carter to employment free from race and sex discrimination. The problems of state statutes of limitations for \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 have long been treated similarly and often interchangeably. <em>Compare Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (\u00a7 1981), <em>and Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980) (\u00a7 1981), <em>with Board of Regents v. Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980) (\u00a7 1983), <em>and Chardon v. Rivera Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981) (\u00a7 1983). In this case, the same statute of limitations should apply to Carter\u2019s equal protection claim under \u00a7 1981 as would apply to such a claim under \u00a7 1983, unless the state statute distinguishes between private employers and the Commonwealth. This brings us to the second problem in applying the <em>Burns-Hussey-Holden </em>trilogy here, the fact that it dealt only with public employees. The Massachusetts statute we held applicable to equal protection claims under \u00a7 1983 does not, however, make a public-private distinction. Moreover, in <em>Burns v. Sullivan, </em>619 F.2d at 107, we adverted to policies militating against allowing public employees a limitations period longer than six months, and we think that similar policies \u2014 preventing employees from foregoing state administrative proceedings in favor of a later federal court action, which would have the unfortunate effect of transforming federal courts into personnel agencies\u2014 apply to private employers as well. We conclude that, like the <em>Burns, Hussey, </em>and <em>Holden </em>plaintiffs, private employees alleging equal protection violations in employment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 are not subject to Massachusetts\u2019 general contract and tort statutes of limitations when Massachusetts has a more specific statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Before we can conclude that Mass. Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5 applies to Carter\u2019s equal protection claim, however, we must consider a question not raised in the previous cases, the applicability of Mass. Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 9 also deals with employment discrimination specifically and provides a two-year statute of limitations for suits brought in a Massachusetts court. Together \u00a7 5 and \u00a7 9 contemplate a dual remedial process. Section 5 applies to complaints filed with MCAD, and there is a right of review of the MCAD\u2019s decision in Massachusetts superior court, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>tion 9 authorizes suits to be brought in a superior or probate court after an MCAD complaint is filed. Thereafter, while the MCAD proceedings are pending, one has two years to elect to go to court \u2014 but this election can be made only if a complaint has been filed before the MCAD within six months after the implicating act. A \u00a7 9 action terminates any complaint pending before the MCAD.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Once the MCAD makes a final decision, however, relief under \u00a7 9 is presumably foreclosed, and a party has recourse only under \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Assuming that \u00a7 9, the statute of limitations provision of which took effect on October 3, 1974,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> applies retroactively,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we do not believe that it applies to Carter\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim as the most analogous Commonwealth statute. By January 13, 1975, when Carter filed her complaint with MCAD, more than six months had elapsed from the time of the last alleged act of discrimination, the refusal to rehire Carter in April 1974. Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5. The MCAD complaint with respect to this incident was therefore time-barred, and by the same token the incident could not be the proper subject of a separate state court proceeding allowed in \u00a7 9 \u2014 as, indeed, the subsequent dismissal of the MCAD complaint, presumably for untimeliness, clearly showed. The two-year period could be of arguable applicability only had the MCAD complaint itself been timely filed within six months. The analogous statute of limitations in this case, then, is the six-month period applicable to MCAD complaints, not the two-year period applicable to judicial actions. Carter\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim is therefore time-barred because the last possible act of discrimination, the refusal to rehire, occurred well over six months before Carter filed suit in federal court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The second issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Carter\u2019s motion to add a Title VII claim to her complaint. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), leave to amend a pleading \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">In the absence of any apparent or declared reason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). With respect to undue delay,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[wjhile courts may not deny an amendment solely because of delay and without consideration of the prejudice to the opposing party, ... where ... a considerable period of time has passed between the filing of the complaint and the motion to amend, courts have placed the burden upon the movant to show some \u201cvalid reason for his neglect and delay.\u201d <em>Freeman v. Continental Gin Co., </em>381 F.2d 459, 469 (5th Cir. 1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\"><em>Hayes v. New England Millwork Distributors, Inc., </em>602 F.2d 15, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1979) (citations omitted in part); <em>accord, Vargas v. McNamara, </em>608 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1979). In the case at bar, Carter waited six years after filing her complaint to seek this amendment, and she attributes the delay to inadvertence and \u201cclerical error.\u201d As we suggested in <em>Vargas v. McNamara, </em>608 F.2d at 19, this explanation is not enough; counsel can be expected to check their work promptly. Carter\u2019s delay was almost entirely her own doing, in contrast to a case such as <em>Farkas v. Texas Instruments, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 849, 851 (1st Cir. 1970), where amendment after delay was acceptable when much of the delay was caused by the court. In addition, Carter\u2019s motion was made only after SGC sought summary judgment, <em>cf. Woodson v. Fulton, </em>614 F.2d 940, 942-43 (4th Cir. 1980) (denial of motion to amend was proper where made by plaintiff after defendant had moved for summary judgment and where plaintiff had known for some time of possible additional claim); <em>Eisenmann v. Gould-National Batteries, Inc., </em>169 F.Supp. 862, 863-64 (E.D.Pa.1958) (motion to amend denied where motion made after opponents had moved for summary judgment and two years after action commenced, no new evidence having emerged). Finally, counsel for SGC has represented that the delay has caused prejudice because the Pathmark store in Springfield has been closed for some years and witnesses have dispersed. In view of Carter\u2019s extraordinarily long and essentially unexplained delay, we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in denying Carter\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>The decisions of the district court are affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-15\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">.

This assumption is not unjustified. Massachusetts follows the general rule that, absent clear legislative intent, statutes affecting substantive rights are prospective, whereas statutes affecting procedure or remedies may be retroactive. <em>E.g., Austin v. Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 363 N.E.2d 515, 517 (1977); <em>Palmer v. Selectmen of Marblehead, </em>368 Mass. 620, 335 N.E.2d 349 (1975); <em>Hein-Werner Corp. v. Jackson Industries, Inc., </em>364 Mass. 523, 306 N.E.2d 440, 442-43 (1974). Because a statute of limitations does not generally affect the nature of a defendant\u2019s liability, we may treat it as retroactive. <em>But see </em>note 11 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b267-14\">. An alternative ground exists for the time bar against the \u00a7 1981 claim based on Carter\u2019s resignation. When the amended \u00a7 9 was enacted and took effect in 1974, the applicable six-month statute of limitations, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 151B, \u00a7 5, had already run on the April 12, 1973 resignation. Where a cause of action has been extinguished by a time bar, a new statute of limitations will not be applied retroactively so as to revive it. <em>See Dirksen v. Hynes &amp; Howes Ins. Counselors, Inc., </em>423 F.Supp. 1290, 1293-94 (S.D.Ia. 1976); <em>cf. City Council of Waltham v.
