Gorsuch, </em>672 F.2d 33 (D.C.Cir.1982) (hereinafter <em>Sierra Club II), </em>we held that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund (\u201cEDF\u201d), non-prevailing parties in <em>Sierra Club v. Costle, </em>657 F.2d 298 (D.C.Cir.1981) (hereinafter <em>Sierra Club I), </em>was \u201cappropriate\u201d under section 307(f) of the Clean Air Act 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(f), because those parties had \u201csubstantially contributed\u201d to the goals of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 by litigating \u201cimportant, complex and novel\u201d issues of statutory interpretation. <em>Sierra Club II, </em>672 F.2d at 39. At the express suggestion of the government, we postponed consideration of the precise amount of compensation to be awarded in order to allow the parties to resume negotiations which had been abruptly ended by a shift in government policy resulting in routine opposition to the grant of attorneys\u2019 fees to non-prevailing parties. <em>Id. </em>at 34 n.2. Unfortunately, a settlement has proven impossible. Accordingly, we must now resolve the matter. Taking into account the decisions of this court in <em>National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, </em>675 F.2d 1319 (D.C.Cir.1982) (as amended July 15, 1982) (hereinafter <em>NACV); Environmental Defense Fund v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>672 F.2d 42 (D.C.Cir.1982) (hereinafter <em>EDF v. </em>EPA); <em>Alabama Power Company v. Gorsuch, </em>672 F.2d 1, 33 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>Anderson v. United States Department of the Treasury, </em>648 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir. 1979); and, most important, <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880 (D.C.Cir.1980) <em>(en </em>banc) (hereinafter <em>Copeland), </em>we find that Sierra Club is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees amounting to $44,715 (plus $644.60 in expenses <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) and that EDF is entitled to $45,-874.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">I. SIERRA CLUB\u2019S REQUEST</p>\n<p id=\"Aj4\">Prior to the termination of fee negotiations in August, 1981, the government made a written offer of $32,265 to Sierra Club, which Sierra Club claims to have accepted before the government withdrew the offer under a revised policy of disputing all attorneys\u2019 fees claims by non-prevailing parties. Following our opinion in <em>Sierra Club II, </em>declaring that the Clean Air Act contemplated attorneys\u2019 fees awards in \u201cappropriate\u201d cases and holding <em>Sierra Club I </em>to be such a case, Sierra Club submitted a proposal for $60,656.75. This figure included Sierra Club\u2019s computation of the \u201clodestar\u201d\u2014 \u201cthe number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate,\u201d <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 891 \u2014 on the basis of 479.5 hours at $110 per hour plus a 15% upward adjustment of the lodestar amount due to the government\u2019s alleged delaying tactics throughout the fee proceedings. <em>See </em>Sierra Club\u2019s Report To The Court And Second Amended Request For Attorneys\u2019 Fees at 2 (May 10,1982) (hereinafter Sierra Club\u2019s Report). The government countered with an offer of $36,335, representing a reduction in hours and an hourly rate of $90 rather than $110 for time spent on the case-in-chief by the Sierra Club\u2019s attorney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Joseph Brecher.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at Exhibit B. The government\u2019s figure, however, included the full 37 hours claimed for work on the attorneys\u2019 fees issue at $110 per hour. <em>Id. </em>The government predictably resisted any upward adjustment in the lodestar amount. <em>Id. </em>Sierra Club\u2019s final counteroffer, which was refused, was for 459.5 hours at $110 or $50,545.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Now Sierra Club requests $106,590 (and litigation costs of $2,642.96) based upon a lodestar of 484.5 hours (an additional 5 hours having been spent on fee negotiations) at $110 per hour, or $53,295, supplemented by a 50% upward adjustment for \u201cexemplary\u201d quality of representation and the public benefit conferred, and an additional 50% for delay in receipt of payment. The three main points of contention between Sierra Club and the government are: number of compensable hours, rate of pay for Breeher\u2019s time and the percentage of upward adjustment, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">A. <em>Number of Hours</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">The government argues that Sierra Club\u2019s claim of 442.5 hours for work on the judicial aspect of its case-in-chief impermissibly includes non-litigation related activities as well as excessive hourly claims for certain litigation related activities. Specifically, approximately 67 hours for which Sierra Club seeks compensation were devoted to preparation of its administrative petition for reconsideration. The government correctly objects to these hours based upon our holding in <em>Sierra Club II, </em>which states: \u201cthe same statutory language that allows us to make attorneys\u2019 fees awards in cases such as <em>Sierra Club </em>[I], limits our power to judicial awards .... Sierra Club and EDF are, therefore, not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees for their participation in the administrative proceedings preceding their appeal.\u201d 672 F.2d at 42. Sierra Club\u2019s claim for these 67 hours is based upon a reading of that statement which lays too much emphasis upon the phrase \u201cpreceding their appeal,\u201d modifying \u201cadministrative proceedings.\u201d While it appears in this case that the petition for reconsideration to the Administrator was filed <em>after </em>an appeal from the decision on the final rule had been noticed, <em>Sierra Club II </em>was not intended to sanction attorneys\u2019 fees awards for administrative proceedings that happen to follow a notice of appeal. Indeed, in our subsequent decision in <em>American Petroleum Institute v. Costle, </em>665 F.2d 1176, 1191-92 (D.C.Cir. 1981), we made it clear that the filing of a petition for reconsideration was a statutory prerequisite to judicial review of procedural objections arising after the close of the comment period. Hence, we disallow the 67 hours spent on the petition for reconsideration, as well as 5.5 hours afterward devoted to research apparently connected therewith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">Another 15.5 hours disputed by the government pertains to time Sierra Club claims to have spent preparing its petition for judicial review, a one-page document. The government concedes, United States\u2019 Response to Sierra Club\u2019s &amp; Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s Status Reports and Amended Requests for Attorneys Fees at 9 (May 10, 1982) (hereinafter U.S. Response), that the \u201creasonable\u201d number of hours spent on that document is \u201csimply a matter of judgment.\u201d Although we note that a less experienced lawyer was allowed 42 hours for this purpose in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>672 F.2d at 50, we believe 10 hours is a reasonable amount here since the preparer was Brecher himself and his hourly rate a premium one. We additionally note the government did not object to 10 hours allocated by EDF for such a purpose in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">Thus we disallow 78 of Brecher\u2019s hours for Sierra Club\u2019s case-in-chief. We also note, however, that Brecher documents 5 hours devoted to attorneys\u2019 fee negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>since our decision in <em>Sierra Club II, </em>and we see no reason to limit the allowable time to the 37 hours previously expended as the government suggests. This makes the allowable total for Sierra Club 406.5 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">B. <em>Hourly Rate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The government vigorously contests a rate of $110 per hour for Sierra Club\u2019s counsel. It suggests, citing <em>NACV, </em>that Sierra Club did not document its claim that $110 per hour was the \u201cmarket rate\u201d for Brecher\u2019s time by affidavits, from Brecher himself or from other counsel with comparable experience, showing billings for private clients at such a rate in comparable cases or recent court awards of fees to them in cases of comparable complexity. We do not think that affidavits of private attorneys like Brecher who represent primarily non-profit public interest organizational clients about their billing practices are necessary in all cases, especially where evidence of recent court awarded fees in comparable cases to comparably experienced lawyers exists to satisfy the demands of <em>Copeland </em>and <em>NACV </em>that court awarded fees be based on the prevailing market rate for the attorney\u2019s services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">For several reasons, we believe that the $110 hourly rate is proper for Brecher\u2019s time. First, Joseph Brecher is a well known environmental lawyer, who is retained by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund to represent them in many litigation matters. He has continuously engaged in the practice of environmental law since 1970, representing primarily environmental organizations and Indian tribes before state and federal courts including the Supreme Court of the United States. He is the author of books and articles on environmental law and teaches that subject at Golden Gate Law School. Second, in our <em>Sierra Club II </em>opinion we alluded to the \u201ctechnical complexity of the case\u201d and its need for \u201cextensive preparation\u201d as well as its \u201cimportance to the national welfare.\u201d Third, we have a very recent precedent in our own court awarding $110 per hour fees expressly based upon prevailing market rates to a comparably experienced public interest lawyer in a comparably complex environmental case. In <em>EDF </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>672 F.2d at 58, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-11\">In this case, given the importance of the post-decision negotiations, the high level of skill required (to maintain a litigation victory and yet accommodate to the legitimate needs and interests of numerous intervenors and a federal agency), the significant public interest value of the litigation, and the going \u201cmarket value\u201d for the services of a lawyer with rate claimed for Mr. Butler is perfectly reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\"><em>See also Palila v. Hawaii Dept. of Land &amp; Natural Resources, </em>512 F.Supp. 1006 (D.Haw.1981) ($110 per hour fee award).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">Finally, the government suggests we lower the hourly rate because Sierra Club did not prevail. We decline to do so for the same reasons we declined to lower the hours \u201creasonably expended\u201d in <em>EDF v. EPA </em>on issues on which EDF did not prevail. <em>See EDF v. EPA, </em>672 F.2d at 55. In so doing, we do not suggest such a reduction may never be proper. <em>See Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 893. Nonetheless, here the public service benefits of the litigation and the relative modesty of the fee for Brecher\u2019s gargantuan efforts on the case do not in our opinion warrant any reduction if the Clean Air Act\u2019s overriding purpose of encouraging constructive legal challenges, which would not otherwise be brought for lack of economic incentive, is to be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">C. <em>Adjustments to the Lodestar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-15\">Sierra\u2019s lodestar then is 406.5 hours at $110 per hour or $44,715. Sierra Club asks for a \u201csubstantial upward adjustment in the lodestar,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>100% based on the three factors identified in <em>Copeland </em>and <em>EDF v. EPA: </em>quality of representation; public benefit; and delay in receipt of payment. We decline, however, to allow any upward adjustment in this case for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>We think it is proper to consider in this regard, as the government suggests, that Sierra Club did not prevail on any issue. The aim of \u201cappropriate\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees is to encourage parties without economic incentives to litigate important issues, but such efforts cannot be risk-free. Compensation for reasonable hours at market rates will generally be sufficient where the partyl has not prevailed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 844 (\u201cThe \u2018lodestar\u2019 itself generally compensates lawyers adequately for their time. An upward adjustment for quality is appropriate only when the attorney performed exceptionally well, or obtained an exceptional result for the client.\u201d) <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>672 F.2d at 59-61, allowed a \u201cmodest\u201d adjustment of 15-20% to reflect benefits to the public as well as the delay in receipt of payment. In that case, however, the claimants had prevailed on several of the issues in the suit. And although it is true that payments were delayed here, as well as in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>through an initial termination in negotiations, on balance we do not consider the government\u2019s desire to test its new \u201cprevailing party\u201d fee policy in court so arbitrary as to court penalties. Sierra Club\u2019s counsel is being paid at $110 per hour, the current market rate, whereas his original request was for $90 per hour, thus according him some compensation for the delay. <em>See EDF </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>672 F.2d at 60; <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 893 n.23. As in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>we allow no adjustment for the contingency factor since Sierra Club is being paid despite its non-prevailing status. And while the quality of representation by Sierra Club_ was exemplary, we believe the $110 rate, though perhaps lower than that billable to private clients, is still near the top level of court awarded fees and incorporates a presumption of skill and dedication of the type exhibited by legal craftsmen of Mr. Breeher\u2019s capabilities in this area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">II. EDF\u2019s REQUEST</p>\n<p id=\"ABvB\">EDF requests attorneys\u2019 fees of $98,-359.50 reflecting $62,010 for services rendered by EDF\u2019s own attorneys, and $36,-349.50 for their retained counsel, Trilling &amp; Kennedy, who worked on the attorneys\u2019 fees portion of the proceeding. The Trilling &amp; Kennedy amounts reflect upward adjustments of 80% (for the period between February and May, 1982) and 100% (for the prior period). <em>See </em>Motion Of The Environmental Defense Fund To Amend And Supplement Its Application For Attorneys\u2019 Fees And Amended Application Therefore at 2 (May 17, 1982) (hereinafter Motion of the EDF).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-15\">A. <em>Number of Hours</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-16\">EDF claims 398 hours for the work of four staff attorneys.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The government has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>no quarrel with this number. It does, however, dispute the additional 179 hours<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> claimed for Trilling &amp; Kennedy, asserting that there was no need for both partners to represent EDF at fee negotiations and consultations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In support the government cites <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 891: \u201cno compensation is due for non-productive time. For example, where three attorneys are present at a hearing when one would suffice, compensation should be denied for the excess time.\u201d We are satisfied, however, that such was not the case here. We have carefully surveyed the documentation by Trilling &amp; Kennedy and have assured ourselves that their efforts were not duplica-tive. <em>See, e.g., </em>Motion of the EDF, Declaration of Bingham Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">We are, however, troubled by a claim of close to $20,000 for time spent attempting to collect $31,005. Of course, the government must pay some price for an unsuccessful, even if <em>bona fide, </em>effort to block an award in <em>Sierra Club I. </em>But approximately half of the 179 hours was for time spent by Trilling &amp; Kennedy during the three months following our decision in <em>Sierra Club II. </em>During that same period, Brecher spent five additional hours on Sierra Club\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees claim. In retrospect, Sierra Club seems to have been more prudent, but we cannot say all but five hours of Trilling &amp; Kennedy\u2019s time was unreasonably spent. However, after examining the time sheets and affidavits of Trilling &amp; Kennedy, we feel that some reduction is in order. We conclude that only 40.38 hours were reasonably expended after February 5. (This represents a downward adjustment of approximately 50%.) With the adjustments noted on Trilling &amp; Kennedy\u2019s May 18, 1982 erratum, the total hours recognized for Trilling &amp; Kennedy are 147.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">B. <em>Rates of Pay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">Although the government makes a general challenge to EDF\u2019s rate of pay for its attorneys on the basis that it does not accord with <em>NACV </em>standards of proof for \u201cmarket value,\u201d we are not convinced. The EDF lawyers are billed per hour respectively at $110 for chief counsel William Butler, $75 for Robert Rauch, and $55 each for Larry Corcoran and David J. Lennett. Since all are employed by a public interest organization, they cannot be expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>submit client billings. Further, <em>EDF v. EPA </em>approved hourly rates for Butler and Lennett of the same amount claimed here. <em>See also Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 902 ($57 hourly rate for associates is reasonable). And as to the other two EDF attorneys (Rauch and Corcoran): Rauch has 7 years of experience in environmental work and is asking $75 per hour \u2014 this is certainly comparable to the rate applied to Ms. Warren who received $90 per hour in <em>EDF v. EPA </em>and who had 9 years of the same kind of experience \u2014 and Corcoran is of the same vintage as Mr. Lennett. The government interposes no specific objection to the rate of pay ($110 per hour) for Trilling &amp; Kennedy\u2019s service and only a minor objection to the rate of pay for EDF\u2019s attorneys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, EDF is entitled to an award of $45,-874.80, calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Butler Rauch Corcoran Lennett</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-8\">Motion for Discovery and Memorandum in Support Thereof (filed 4-11-80) 15 24</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-9\">Reply to EPA\u2019s Opposition to Said Motion to Supplement the Record &amp; Memorandum in Support Thereof (filed 5-14-80) 17.5 40 35 19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-10\">Reply to EPA\u2019s Response to Motion to Supplement the Record (filed 5-28-80) 10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-11\">EDF Brief (filed 7-11-80) 40 25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-12\">EDF Reply Brief (filed 9-30-80) and Preparation for Oral Argument 50 30 14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-13\">Attorneys Fees Request 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-14\">TOTAL 121 123 114 40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Rate/Hr.

Although petitioners need not \u201cprevail\u201d in order to claim attorneys\u2019 fees under TSCA, we believe that \u201cnon-prevailing\u201d is a factor that should militate against upward adjustments in the \u201clodestar.\u201d Here, EDF lost on one of three issues decided by the court in <em>EDF v.

I also agree with the court\u2019s calculation of hours reasonably expended and hourly rates. However, when a litigant loses on every issue in the case, as here, I think the \u201cappropriate\u201d standard under section 307(f) of the Clean Air Act calls for some reduction in the lodestar amount.

Marshall, </em>205 U.S.App. D.C. 390, 641 F.2d 880 (1980) <em>(en banc), </em>this court stated that adjustments to the lodestar \u201cmay be upward or downward,\u201d noting \u201c[a]n upward adjustment for quality is appropriate only when the attorney performed exceptionally well, or obtained an exceptional result for the client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 641 F.2d at 894. Considering result as part of the quality assessment, it is hard to imagine a better case for downward adjustment than this one. If counsel were private practitioners their clients might well complain that they could have lost the case for less money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">This argument applies with special force to statutes such as section 307(f), which permit awards of attorneys\u2019 fees to non-prevailing parties where \u201cappropriate\u201d. One purpose of awarding fees to non-prevailing parties is to shift the costs of a private lawsuit to the \u201ctaxpaying public, which receives the benefits of [the] litigation.\u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v.

Reducing the award in this case would recognize the diminished value of a losing lawsuit to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">This court has refused to reduce the lodestar to account for lack of success when a party lost on only one of three issues. <em>See Environmental Defense Fund v. EPA, </em>217 U.S.App.D.C. 189, 672 F.2d 42 (1982). Here, however, the petitioners lost on every issue; they batted zero. If downward adjustments to the lodestar are ever to be made as <em>Copeland v. Marshall </em>suggests, this is an \u201cappropriate\u201d place to start.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1054-51\"> EDF did not claim any hours for the work of a legal intern in its amended motion.
