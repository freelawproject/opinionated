A. M. National Pension Fund, has appealed from a judgment holding that the Fund\u2019s cancellation provisions are arbitrary and capricious and that plaintiffs-appellees, Madge H. Elser and Margaret C. Thomas, and others similarly situated, were improperly denied pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">I. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcZ4\">The Fund operates a multiemployer pension plan structured in accordance with the requirements of Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor-Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5), and as defined in Section 3(37) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(37). The plan was created in 1960 by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (I.A.M.) and several employers of I.A.M. represented employees. The plan is administered by trustees designated by the international union and participating employers. Each participating employer and local union has agreed to comply with terms established in their collective bargaining agreements and in the trust agreement under which the plan was created and operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The plan provides that employees must have at least ten years of \u201ccredited service\u201d to qualify for pension benefits. \u201cCredited service\u201d is comprised of both \u201cpast service credit\u201d (i.e. credit for periods of eligible employment prior to an employer\u2019s initial contribution) and \u201cfuture service credit\u201d (credit for periods of covered employment for which contributions were actually made).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the pension \u201cvests\u201d when an employee accumulates ten years of credited service, pension payments do not begin until the employee attains age fifty.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">Waste King, former employer of Elser and Thomas, began contributing to the pension plan on January 1,1969, pursuant to its 1968 collective bargaining agreement with 1. A.M. District Lodge No. 94. In December of 1974, approximately fifty of Waste King\u2019s employees met to consider decertify-ing the I.A.M. union. The collective bargaining agreement between Waste King and the union expired January 31, 1975, at which time Waste King ceased contributing to the plan. On February 26, 1975, the employees met again to consider decertifi-cation. Two days later the union lost a decertification election.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">Elser and Thomas were both employed by Waste King for at least ten consecutive years. As a result of Waste King\u2019s withdrawal from the plan on January 31, 1975, both appellees had only six years of future service credit. The remainder of their ten years service was past service credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">When Waste King withdrew from the Fund in 1975, Article IX, Section 4 of the plan provided for retroactive cancellation of all past service credit should an employer cease making contributions to the Fund and remain in business. Excluded from this cancellation were those employees who were already receiving pensions or who had left their employment more than 24 months before or within 30 days after their employer\u2019s termination of participation. The plan also allowed the reinstatement of past service credit if the covered employee earned at least five more years of future service credit within eight years of his employer\u2019s termination of participation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>had attempted to give employees notice of these provisions through pension booklets, union meetings and the I.A.M. newspaper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On June 3,1975, the Fund notified Waste King and the union by letter that pursuant to Article IX, Section 4, all past service credit accumulated by plan participants who had not left the employment of Waste King over 24 months before or 30 days after January 31, 1975 had been cancelled. This letter, which was not mailed to the plan participants, did not mention that past service credit could be restored by accumulating five additional years of future service credit within eight years or indicate that minimum service requirements could be met by obtaining future service credit from a different contributing employer. No plan participant avoided the forfeiture of past service credit by leaving the employment of Waste King during the 30 day grace period provided by the Fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Thomas terminated her employment with Waste King in August 1975 and applied for a pension shortly thereafter. As a result of the cancellation of her past service credit she did not have ten years credited service and her application was denied. Elser terminated employment in October 1977 and was subsequently denied a pension for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">II. <em>Proceedings in District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">In June, 1978 Elser and Thomas brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to \u00a7 302(c)(5) of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5) and \u00a7 404(a)(1) of the ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1). They sought, inter alia, a judgment declaring that the cancellation of past service credit was unlawful, and therefore null and void, and \u201cestablishing plaintiffs\u2019 and the class they represent, eligibility for a pension under the Plan and stating the number of years of credited service to which said employees are entitled.\u201d The Fund\u2019s answer denied that the cancellation was unlawful and alleged that the plaintiffs were barred by waiver and estoppel, because they had voluntarily decertified the union with full knowledge of the consequences to their pension plan eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">The case was submitted on stipulated facts. In a memorandum decision entered on September 5, 1980 the court found that the cancellation provisions were \u201carbitrary and capricious on their face and as applied to plaintiffs,\u201d and, as such, violative of both the LMRA and the ERISA. With respect to Thomas, the court found, as an alternative ground for relief that Thomas had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>received adequate notice of the operation of the cancellation provisions. The court rejected the Fund\u2019s estoppel defense, since the plaintiffs \u201cdid not voluntarily decertify the union.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">On October 29, 1980, the court certified the proposed class of approximately 75 plaintiffs in two subclasses. Subclass No. 1 includes nonretired employees who left Waste King employment before January 31, 1975 (the termination date of Waste King\u2019s contributions), but within 24 months before decertification and withdrawal. Subclass No. 2 includes persons employed by Waste King at the time of decertification and withdrawal. All members of the subclasses had at least ten years of continuous employment with Waste King.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law filed November 26, 1980, the court enjoined the Fund from removing past service credit in calculating plaintiffs\u2019 pension eligibility, and awarded retroactive pension benefits, interest, costs and attorney fees. A formal judgment was entered \u201cin accordance with the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d. The Fund appealed from the judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff. Elser cross-appealed from the finding of adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">III. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The issues presented on appeal are (1) whether the plaintiffs waived their claim to past service credit through decertification of the union; (2) whether the Fund\u2019s rules for cancelling past service credit were arbitrary and capricious under LMRA \u00a7 302 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186) and ERISA \u00a7 404 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104); and (3) whether the Fund gave the plaintiffs adequate notice of the cancellation provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">IV. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Section 302 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186, makes it \u201cunlawful for any employer or association of employers\u201d to pay any money or other thing of value to employee representatives. Section 302(c)(5) creates an exception for employee pension funds, stating that the provisions of Section 302 are not applicable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">with respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established by such representative, <em>for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer, and their families and dependents </em>(or of such employees, families, and dependents jointly with th 5 employees of other employers making similar payments, and their families and dependents). .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5) (emphasis added). Section 302(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e), provides that federal district courts have jurisdiction \u201cto restrain violations of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">This court has consistently recognized that \u00a7 302(e) \u201cgrants district courts jurisdiction to determine whether the provisions of a given retirement fund constitute a structural defect in violation of \u00a7 302(c)(5),\u201d but does not \u201cconfer general power to interfere with provisions of agreements freely entered into between unions and employers which regulate day-to-day administrative matters of pension coverage and eligibility.\u201d <em>Burroughs v. Board of Trustees &amp; Pension Trust, etc., </em>542 F.2d 1128, 1130 (9 Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1096, 97 S.Ct. 1113, 51 L.Ed.2d 543 (1977). See also <em>Alvares v. Erickson, </em>514 F.2d 156, 165 (9 Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 874, 96 S.Ct. 143, 46 L.Ed.2d 106 (1975); <em>Wilson v. Board of Trustees, etc., </em>564 F.2d 1299, 1300 (9 Cir. 1977); <em>Ponce v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust, </em>628 F.2d 537, 541 (9 Cir. 1980). A \u201cstructural\u201d defect is present when \u201cpension trustees, acting under the authority of the trust fund \u2018arbitrarily and capriciously\u2019 den[y] pensions to employees.\u201d <em>Ponce, </em>628 F.2d at 541. \u201cSuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>arbitrary and capricious conduct is deemed not to be \u2018for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees,\u2019 and is therefore structurally deficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541-42. See also <em>Tomlin v. Board of Trustees, </em>586 F.2d 148, 149 (9 Cir. 1978); <em>Burroughs, </em>542 F.2d at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In the recent case of <em>United Mine Workers, etc. v. Robinson, </em>- U.S. -, 102 5. Ct. 1226, 71 L.Ed.2d 419 (1982), the Supreme Court made it clear that the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d provision of \u00a7 302(c)(5) embodies no \u201creasonableness requirement\u201d and that its \u201cplain meaning is simply that employer contributions to employee benefit trust funds must accrue to the benefit of employees and their families and dependents, to the exclusion of all others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\"><em>Robinson </em>involved a collective bargaining agreement where the eligibility requirements and benefit levels were fixed by the agreement. The Court recognized a distinction between <em>Robinson </em>and those cases in which the eligibility rules and benefit levels are fixed by trustees of the fund. The Court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">The Court of Appeals has held in those cases \u201cthat the Trustees have \u2018full authority ... with respect to questions of coverage and eligibility\u2019 and that the court\u2019s role is limited to ascertaining whether the Trustees\u2019 broad discretion has been abused by the adoption of arbitrary or capricious standards.\u201d <em>Pete v. United Mine Workers of American Welfare &amp; Retirement Fund of 1950, </em>517 F.2d 1275, 1283 (CADC 1975) (en banc). Noting that \u201c[t]he institutional arrangements creating this Fund and specifying the purposes to which it is to be devoted are cast expressly in fiduciary form,\u201d the court stated that \u201cthe Trustees, like all fiduciaries, are subject to judicial correction in a proper case upon a showing that they have acted arbitrarily or capriciously towards one of the persons to whom their trust obligations run.\u201d <em>Kosty v. Lewis, </em>319 F.2d 744, 747 (CADC 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 964, 84 S.Ct. 482, 11 L.Ed.2d 414.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Concluding that these cases provided no support for the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that eligibility rules fixed by a collective bargaining agreement must meet a reasonableness standard, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4G\">In <em>NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., </em>453 U.S. 322, 329, 101 S.Ct. 2789, 2794, 69 L.Ed.2d 672, the Court held that in enacting \u00a7 302(c)(5) \u201cCongress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties.\u201d The Court did not decide, nor do we decide today, whether federal courts sitting as courts of equity are authorized to enforce those duties. It is, of course, clear that compliance with the specific standards of \u00a7 302(c)(5) in the administration of welfare funds is enforceable in federal district courts under \u00a7 302(e) of the LMRA. See <em>Arroyo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>359 U.S. 419, 426-427, 79 S.Ct. 864, 868-869, 3 L.Ed.2d 915.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1233, n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">This court need not decide whether federal courts are authorized to enforce the fiduciary duties imposed on trustees by \u00a7 302(c)(5). The <em>Robinson </em>Court held that the \u201csubstantive terms of jointly administered employee benefit plans must comply with the detailed and comprehensive terms of the ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234. \u201cERISA essentially codified the strict fiduciary standards that a \u00a7 302(c)(5) trustee must meet.\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Amax Coal Co., </em>453 U.S. 322, 332, 101 S.Ct. 2789, 2795, 69 L.Ed.2d 672 (1981). The fiduciary duties provisions of the ERISA, \u00a7 404, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>came effective January 1, 1975, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(a), and are applicable to the trustees\u2019 actions in this ease. This court therefore has jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">V. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The trustees of a pension plan \u201chave broad discretion in setting eligibility rules.

Because of the trustees\u2019 presumed expertise and familiarity with the fund, \u201c[i]t is for the trustees, not judges, to choose between various reasonable alternatives.\u201d <em>Ponce, </em>628 F.2d at 542, quoting from <em>Roark v.

Waiver <em>by Decertification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">In contending that appellees\u2019 claims should be barred \u201cby the doctrines of waiver and estoppel,\u201d appellant argues that since the appellees \u201cvoluntarily\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> chose to decertify the union, which led to a cancellation of past service credit, they \u201cshould not be heard to argue now\u201d that the cancellation of past service credit was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d. In contending that the decertification election was an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d forfeiture of past service credit, ap-pellees point out that the members of subclass No. 1 did not even vote in the decerti-fication election and that subclass No. 2 constituted \u201cbut a small fraction\u201d of those who actually voted because all members of the bargaining unit were eligible to vote. The appellees argue, therefore, that their vote was outweighed by that of the non-plaintiff employees who did not stand to lose a vested pension right by voting against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">In response the Fund argues that although subclass No. 1 members did not vote, they \u201cshould be deemed to have participated in the overall process of decertifi-cation, and to have contributed to its result by terminating their employment within the 24 month period preceding the vote, thereby weakening the anti-decertification constituency.\u201d As to subclass No. 2, the Fund argues that if the class members were truly members of a \u201cdissenting minority\u201d who were unwilling to give up their pension benefits, they could have exercised their option to terminate employment within 30 days of Waste King\u2019s withdrawal from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>We agree with the district court that the Fund\u2019s argument is \u201cunconvincing\u201d. There is of course no evidence as to how the class members and other employees voted. The decertification election can hardly be considered a \u201cvoluntary\u201d forfeiture of benefits when those who stand to lose the most from decertification are but a small segment of a larger group voting on decertification. The Fund argues that this case is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to <em>Giler, supra. </em>Giler, however, involved a \u201cbreak-in-service\u201d provision, and \u201cGiler voluntarily left covered employment.\u201d We find <em>Giler </em>and the other cases cited by appellant distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The district court properly found that members of subclass No. 1 simply did not vote in the decertification election, and that members of subclass No. 2 \u201cdid not voluntarily decertify the Machinists Unions.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that appellees\u2019 claims are not barred by waiver or estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">VII. <em>Were Cancellation Provisions Arbitrary and Capricious?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">A. <em>Findings and Conclusions of District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">In both its memorandum decision and subsequent findings of fact and conclusions of law the district court concluded that the cancellation provisions were arbitrary and capricious for several reasons. First, the court noted that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 forfeiture stands in marked contrast to those persons who left Waste King\u2019s employment between January 31, 1970 and January 31, 1973, prior to the 24-month period.\u201d The employees in the latter group did not forfeit past service credit even if they had only one year of future service credit and nine years of past service credit. In contrast, members of the plaintiff class, who had up to six years of future service credit, lost all past service credit. Consequently, the court found that \u201cThese provisions cancelling past service credit for plaintiffs and not employees who left employment at least two years earlier are arbitrary and capricious on their face and as applied to plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Second, the district court concluded that \u201cthe application of the cancellation and relief provisions caused a sizeable exclusion of employees from pension benefits without a reasonable justification for this exclusion.\u201d Although the court recognized that \u201cactuary insolvency is a critical determination\u201d, it concluded \u201cthat there were better ways the Fund could have accomplished this ... if indeed the Fund was faced with an unfunded liability resulting from Waste King\u2019s termination of participation in the Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">Finally, the court found that \u201cThe trustees of the fund violated [ERISA] Section 404(a)(1) because they treated plaintiffs disparately from other employees by canceling their past service credit.\u201d Although the court concluded that the ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(37), specifically permitted a mul-tiemployer plan to provide for cancellation of past service credit, the court determined that this could not \u201cvalidate provisions that are otherwise objectionable because they are discriminatorily applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">B. <em>Application of Arbitrary and Capricious Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">At the outset, we recognize that \u201c[t]he pension is not a defined contribution plan (in which each participant\u2019s entitlement is a function of his contribution) but a defined benefit plan for which \u2018there is no precise \u201cfit\u201d between any individual employee\u2019s contribution history and that employee\u2019s entitlement to benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Central Tool Co. v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists National Pension Fund, </em>523 F.Supp. 812, 817 (D.D.C.1981). The court\u2019s affirmative participation should be limited to \u201cthose cases where the eligibility requirements are so patently arbitrary and unreasonable as to lack foundation. in factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>basis and/or authority in governing case or statute law.\u201d <em>Roark, </em>401 F.2d at 429. And, the courts will substitute their judgments for the judgments of the trustees, \u201conly if the actions of the trustees are not grounded on any reasonable basis.\u201d <em>Ponce, </em>628 F.2d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">After recognizing the limits of the court\u2019s participation in evaluating eligibility requirements of a pension plan, the court in <em>Roark </em>continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">We do say that when such employees are <em>denied </em>pensions by a requirement which would <em>give </em>pensions to employees having worked a substantially lesser period of time for contributing employers, the burden is on the trustees to show some rational nexus between the Fund\u2019s purpose and the requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">401 F.2d at 429.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The appellees have been similarly <em>denied </em>pensions by a requirement which would <em>give </em>pensions to employees having worked a substantially lesser period of time for a contributing employer. The district court examined the effect of the cancellation provisions on various groups of employees. Specifically, the court compared the effect of the rule on the class of plaintiff-appellees to the effect of the rule on those employees who left Waste King employment more than twenty-four months before January 31, 1975. An employee who left Waste King employment more than twenty-four months before that date did not forfeit past service credit, even if that employee had only one year of future service and nine years of past service. On the other hand, members of the plaintiff class who had up to six years of employment while Waste King was making payments into the fund, lost all past service credit. Appellees actually worked for a contributing employer for as many as six years and received no benefits, while others who may have worked only one year for a contributing employer could receive benefits (upon reaching age 50) simply because they left the employer more than two years before the union de-certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">\u201c[T]he primary purpose of section 302(c)(5) is to insure that pension benefits are awarded to \u2018as many intended employees as is economically possible\u2019.\u201d <em>Ponce, </em>628 F.2d at 543, quoting from <em>Gaydosh v. Lewis, </em>410 F.2d 262, 266 (D.C.Cir.1969). See also \u00a7 404(a)(1) of the ERISA, note 7, <em>supra. </em>The Fund urges the court to focus on the fundamental goal of the Fund trustees: \u201cto protect the Fund, that is, the participants and their employers, who have made and are keeping their long-term commitments to contribute to the Fund, against the financial damage which invariably and inevitably results from terminations of employer participation.\u201d We find that the purpose of the Fund is to provide benefits to as many intended employees as is economically possible while protecting the financial stability of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The trustees argue that the cancellation provisions are necessary and reasonable to preserve the financial stability of the Fund. The Fund cannot support an \u201cunfunded liability\u201d to pay pension benefits when the employer\u2019s \u201cstream of contributions\u201d terminates. Thus the cancellation provisions are reasonably designed to encourage continued participation in the Fund, and, in the event of withdrawal from the Fund, to protect the Fund from accumulation of \u201cunfunded liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Appellees concede that the cancellation provisions, if shown to be necessary to preserve the financial integrity of the Fund, would be valid. They agree also that the Fund is correct in contending that the fiscal integrity of the plan depends upon continuing contributions from the. employer to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>not only for the current service credit but also to amortize the liability for past service credit. But, although the Fund\u2019s concerns are \u201clegitimate in the abstract,\u201d appellees argue that \u201cthey have no basis in fact because the Fund did nothing to determine if those concerns [about financial integrity] existed when it cancelled the past service credit of Elser and Thomas and the class they represent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">It is true, as appellees contend, that the Fund offered no evidence to show that the failure to cancel past service credit would result in an unfunded liability that would affect the actuarial soundness of the plan. It was stipulated that \u201cThe Fund has never calculated the total unfunded liability for Waste King as of January 31, 1975.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was, in other words, no evidence to show whether or not Waste King\u2019s four to six years of contributions on behalf of the plaintiffs would be sufficient to provide for the plaintiffs\u2019 pension payment without threatening the financial stability of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In <em>Central Tool, supra, </em>the plaintiff<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> argued, as here, that the cancellation of forfeiture provisions were arbitrary and capricious because they discriminated among participants and because they were not ac-tuarily justified. In a careful analysis of the I.A.M. pension plan, the court noted that \u201cIt is the purpose of the forfeiture provision to protect the fund from the dumping of unfunded liability as a result of an employer\u2019s termination of participation after past service credits have been granted to its employees.\u201d Recognizing that \u201cthe goal itself is unexceptionable\u201d and that \u201c[a] forfeiture provision may be reasonable if it is actuarily necessary,\u201d the court found that the Trustees of the Fund had \u201cnot offered any actuarial evidence to support their claim that the provision is tailored to the need to protect the fund.\u201d 523 F.Supp. at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The court concluded in <em>Central Tool </em>that the forfeiture provisions \u201cmust be reasonably tailored overall to meet their objectives, that is, there must be a rational relationship between the means and the objective . . . and that the forfeiture provisions may not impose a penalty of greater scale than would be necessary to protect the fund from the dumping of unfunded liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817. The court concluded further that in light of the availability of less drastic means to accomplish the objectives of fund preservation<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the challenged provisions were arbitrary and capricious on their face and hence constituted a structural violation of section 302 of the LMRA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">We agree with the holdings in <em>Roark </em>and <em>Central Tool </em>and conclude that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>circumstances of this case the Fund had the burden of showing some rational nexus between the Fund\u2019s purpose and the forfeiture provisions. There is, of course, no question that preservation of the financial integrity of the Fund is a central concern of the trustees. Robinson,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 1226, 71 L.Ed.2d 419. This is clearly recognized in <em>Roark </em>and <em>Central Tool. </em>But here, as in <em>Central Tool, </em>appellant has submitted no actuarial evidence to support its contention that the forfeiture provisions are necessary or reasonable to protect the financial stability of the fund.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">VII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We conclude that (1) the district court\u2019s holding that the plaintiffs-appellees did not waive claims to past service credit by the decertification of the union is correct; and (2) the cancellation provisions depriving the appellees of past service credit are arbitrary and capricious, and have a structural defect in violation of \u00a7 302 of the LMRA and \u00a7 404 of the ERISA, by reason of appellant\u2019s failure to meet its burden of showing a reasonable relationship between the cancellation provisions and the purpose of the fund, i.e., that the provisions were necessary to preserve the financial soundness of the Fund.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-10\">. The crediting of past service is common in multiemployer plans. This feature allows employees who are near retirement age when their employer first contributes to the plan to be eligible for benefits calculated on the basis of all their years of employment, after as little as one year\u2019s contributions have been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-18\">. These provisions were included in an amendment to the plan in 1973. The cancellation provisions had undergone several revisions since Waste King joined in the plan in 1969. Originally the plan excluded from cancellation only those plan participants who were already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>receiving pensions and those who had left their employment more than 24 months prior to their employer\u2019s termination of participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">In December of 1974, the Fund restored its former practice of cancelling only past credited service by repealing the 1973 amendment which required cancellation of future credited service upon an employer\u2019s termination of participation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-9\">. In 1970, the Fund sent copies of its pension booklet, which contained the rules and regulations of the plan, to I.A.M. District Lodge No. 94, which in turn delivered them to Waste King\u2019s payroll office for distribution to the company\u2019s covered employees. In July, 1974, the Fund sent to each contributing employer, I.A.M. union office and each covered employee at his home address the 1974 revised edition of the pension booklet. Neither Elser nor Thomas recall receiving the booklet. In January, 1975, the I.A.M. newspaper printed a special report on the I.A.M. National Pension Fund which specifically referred to the Article IX cancellation provisions. The newspaper was mailed to all union members at their last known address.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">The subject of pension forfeiture was discussed at two meetings conducted by the local I.A.M. union called for the purpose of discussing the upcoming decertification election. The union\u2019s notes of the first meeting, held on December 9, 1974, indicate that in discussing the subject of pension eligibility, the union \u201c[bjrought up the fact that on the pension, if the <em>decert </em>[author\u2019s emphasis] did go through, the employees <em>would be considered short term employees and would stand to lose all pension benefits.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] Elser is shown on the union\u2019s roster as attending the meeting, but she does not recall being present. Thomas did not attend. Although the pension plan was discussed a second time at a February 26, 1975 union meeting, the record does not reflect whether any of the appellees attended or to what extent the cancellation provisions were discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-15\">. At least nine persons who retired from Waste King before January 31, 1975 (and whose 10 years\u2019 service was necessarily based in part on past credit) continued to receive pension payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-14\">. Following the June 3, 1975 letter from the Fund to Waste King the successor union had filed unfair labor practice charges, which were denied by the Regional Director, and the dismissal was affirmed by the General Counsel. Again in 1978, after denial of Elser\u2019s individual pension applications, the successor union filed another unfair labor practice charge. The Regional Director refused to issue a complaint, and the General Counsel affirmed. In its memorandum decision the court concluded that the NLRB proceedings were irrelevant since the issues in those proceedings were different from those addressed in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\">. In <em>Robinson, </em>the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had invalidated the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement allocating health benefits among potential beneficiaries of an employee benefit trust fund. In reversing, the Supreme Court held that pension fund trustees are obligated to enforce the eligibility requirements fixed by the collective bargaining agreement unless modification is required to comply with applicable federal law. <em>Id </em>at 1233.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b729-16\">. \u00a7 404(a)(1) provides that \u201ca fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and (A) for the exclusive purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>of: (i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and (ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">. See also <em>Fentron Industries v. Nat. Shopmen Pension Fund, </em>674 F.2d 1300 (9 Cir. 1982). As the court noted in <em>Gordon, </em>616 F.2d at 437, and <em>Fentron Industries, </em>674 F.2d at 1307, Congress designed ERISA to promote pension plans and to protect their beneficiaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. <em>Rehmar </em>adopted the standard of review established in <em>Danti v.

This court has also recognized a related standard for determining whether a pension plan is structurally deficient, i.e., the \u201csizeable exclusion/reasonable justification\u201d standard. See <em>Burroughs v. Board of Trustees of Pension Trust, etc., supra; Souza v.

The fund bases its argument on the voluntary/involuntary test applied to the \u201cbreak-in-service\u201d eligibility rules considered in <em>Lee v.

In its memorandum decision, the district court relied on <em>Lee v.

The district court had granted the miners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals held that the pension applicants had made a <em>prima facie </em>case of unreasonableness in the requirement that the applicant\u2019s last regular employment must have been with a contributing operator, but remanded for a hearing at which the trustees would be allowed to show what, if any, reasonable relationship existed between the purpose of the trust and the requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">. It was stipulated further that the contributions made by Waste King to the Fund from 1969 to 1975 totaled $433,728.00, and that as of January 31, 1975, there were \u201capproximately 66 individuals employed in a bargaining unit capacity for 10 or more continuous years.\u201d Appellees argue that the contributions, \u201ca substantial portion of which was contributed on behalf of non-class members who did not possess vested pension rights, succeeded in financially backing the past service credit which was arbitrarily rescinded by the Fund.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">. In <em>Central </em>Tool, the cancellation provisions were challenged by an employer, whose employees were former participants in the pension fund. The Fund had cancelled past service credits for all employees who did not fit into any of the excepted categories. The employer had agreed at the time of termination to establish its own pension fund for the benefit of its employees and to pay the benefits that would have been paid under the defendants\u2019 plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\">. In concluding that \u201cfar less punitive means than forfeiture\u201d were available to accomplish the legitimate objectives of fund preservation, the court said: \u201cFor example, the plan agreement itself contains a separate provision, not challenged here, to remedy the problem of employers terminating from the plan within the first four years of plan participation. The agreement provides that, in the event of such a termination, pension benefits shall only be reduced to the extent necessary to prevent the dumping of unfunded liability (calculated on the basis of a comparison of contributions and actuarially anticipated benefits payments). Defendant has proffered no explanation for the failure of the plan agreement to apply such an actuarially-based mechanism to protect the fund from unfunded liability with regard to the employee groups here involved.\u201d 523 F.Supp. at 818.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b733-13\">. See also <em>Winpisinger v. Aurora Corp. of Ill., etc., </em>456 F.Supp. 559 (N.D.Ohio, 1978), where the court considered in detail the I.A.M. pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>sion fund and held invalid a portion of the plan insofar as it applied retroactively to cancel past service credit of two special classes. The court concluded that \u201cif the Trustees choose to \u2018protect the fund\u2019 through a forfeiture of past service credits, the forfeiture must fall evenly on all participants in the Fund. To do otherwise would violate section 1104(a)(1) by virtue of not being an action of the Trustees that is \u2018solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\">. We recognize that there is language in <em>Wilson v.

The court in <em>Wilson </em>concluded: \u201cRules in many settings frequently overreach in order to secure their objectives with certainty. This does not in all circumstances make them unreasonable or arbitrary. One must weigh the extent of the overreaching against the importance of certainty.
