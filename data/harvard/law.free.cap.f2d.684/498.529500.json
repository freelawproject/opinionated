Grant, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b575-5\">BAUER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Appellant Kenneth Jaworski, a former Wisconsin prison inmate, sued Sanger Powers, then Administrator of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that Powers violated Jaworski\u2019s civil rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court granted Jaworski\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on his claim that the manner in which Powers rescinded Jaworski\u2019s parole grant violated due process. Thereafter, the court permitted Powers to amend his answer to plead the affirmative defense of good faith. Jaworski moved to strike the defense as inapplicable in light of <em>Owen v. City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980), and a Wisconsin statute indemnifying state officials for damages liability arising from their good faith execution of their duties. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 270.58(1) (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied Jaworski\u2019s motion on September 3, 1980, and entered judgment on September 19, 1980, granting Jaworski certain injunc-tive relief and dismissing his claim for damages. Following entry of judgment, the parties stipulated that Powers acted in subjective and objective good faith in connection with his acts related to the rescission of Jaworski\u2019s parole and that the rescission of Jaworski\u2019s parole was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">The only issue presented on appeal is whether a state official enjoying qualified immunity may assert the good faith defense when a state statute indemnifies him for any damages liability incurred as a result of his good faith execution of his duties. We hold that the existence of the state indemnification statute is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether the good faith defense may be raised. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">Public officials who enjoy qualified immunity may assert their good faith as a complete defense to damages liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e.g., Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). Qualified immunity has been extended to public officials because overriding public policy considerations demand that these officials be guaranteed protection from personal liability. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 241-42, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1689, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974); <em>Knell v. Bensinger, </em>522 F.2d 720, 724 (7th Cir. 1975). It is feared that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>threat of personal liability will deter public officials from executing their duties with the decisiveness required by the public good. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. at 240, 94 S.Ct. at 1688.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Jaworski concedes, as he must, that defendant Powers enjoys qualified immunity as a prison official. <em>Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 561, 98 S.Ct. 855, 859, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978). Moreover, he concedes that Powers acted in good faith when he rescinded Jaworski\u2019s parole grant in an unconstitutional manner. He contends, however, that Powers should not be permitted to assert the good faith defense in this case because he faces no threat of personal liability since the state has agreed to indemnify him. Wis.Stat. \u00a7 270.58(1) (1971). Relying on <em>Owen v. City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980), Jaworski argues that if the policy underlying the good faith defense is not implicated, the injured plaintiff should not be barred from recovering compensatory damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Jaworski contends that this is a case of first impression. Although we concede that Jaworski\u2019s argument is novel, it is not original. The same argument has been raised in this court before with equally little success.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In <em>Stift v. Lynch, </em>267 F.2d 237 (7th Cir. 1959), the plaintiff argued that we should rely on state law in determining whether justices of the peace enjoyed qualified immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability. Although Illinois law imposed civil liability on the justices, we rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument, holding that the question of \u00a7 1983 immunity is one of federal, not state, law. <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">More recently, a \u00a7 1983 defendant attempted to persuade this court that state law governs the issue of immunity. In <em>Hampton v. Chicago, </em>484 F.2d 602 (7th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 917, 94 S.Ct. 1413, 39 L.Ed.2d 471 (1974), the defendants argued that they were absolutely immune from \u00a7 1983 liability because they enjoyed absolute immunity under state law. We again rejected the argument that state law controls the immunity question. <em>Id. </em>at 608. We held that \u201c[i]n view of the overriding importance of federal law, the area of [a defendant\u2019s] protection cannot be either limited or expanded by a state\u2019s statutory definition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">We believe that these eases were correctly decided, and we decline to overrule them in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Title 42 U.S.C., section 1983 provides a federal remedy for violations of federal civil rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1988 provides that federal law governs issues arising in a \u00a7 1983 cause of action unless federal law is \u201cnot adapted to the object or [is] deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>State law is to be resorted to in resolving an issue if, and only if, federal law is deficient, and if, and only if, state law \u201cis not inconsistent with the constitution and the laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Id.; Robertson v. Wegmann, </em>436 U.S. 584, 590, 98 S.Ct. 1991, 1995, 56 L.Ed.2d 554 (1978); <em>Moor v. Alameda, </em>411 U.S. 693, 702-03, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 1792, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Jaworski concedes that federal law is not deficient concerning whether prison officials have qualified immunity. <em>Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 561, 98 S.Ct. 855, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>859, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978). We are bound to follow this federal law, regardless of whether state law attempts to limit its public officials\u2019 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Jaworski\u2019s reliance on Owen v. <em>City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980), is misplaced. The Court did not hold in <em>Owen, </em>as Jaworski contends, that a defendant protected by qualified immunity cannot assert his good faith when faced with no threat of personal liability. Rather, in that ease of first impression, the Supreme Court construed \u00a7 1983 to determine whether it, as a matter of federal law, accords municipalities qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 100 S.Ct. at 1407. The Court undertook the same statutory and common law analysis it had previously undertaken when it decided that \u00a7 1983, as a matter of federal law, accords public officials qualified immunity. <em>Compare id. </em>at 635-50, 100 S.Ct. at 1407-15 <em>with Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 315-22, 95 S.Ct. 992, 997-1000, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), and <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 238-49, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1687-92, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). The Court decided that the policy reasons favoring qualified immunity for public officials were not implicated when the defendant was a municipal corporation. 445 U.S. at 654-56, 100 S.Ct. 1417-18. Therefore, the Court concluded that municipalities do not enjoy qualified immunity. The Court, however, indicated that it was not retreating from its well-established rule that public officials enjoy qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at' 657, 100 S.Ct. at 1418. Thus, <em>Owen </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Powers, a prison official, enjoys qualified immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability. Because he acted in good faith, he cannot be held liable for damages. Therefore, the judgment from which Jaworski appeals is</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">. Jaworski sued several other officials, but Ja-worski\u2019s cause of action against them was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\">. Jaworski alleged that he was transferred from a minimum security prison to a maximum security facility in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights, that he was transferred without constitutionally required procedural protections, and that he was denied his parole grant without due process. Jaworski dropped the two claims relating to the transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\">. Wis.Stat. \u00a7 270.58(1) (1971) provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">When the defendant in any action or special proceeding is a public officer or employee and is proceeded against in his official capacity or is proceeded against as an individual because of acts committed while carrying out his duties as an officer or employee and the jury or court finds that he acted in good faith the judgment as to damages and losses entered against the officer or employee shall be paid by the state or subdivision of which he is an officer or employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">The statute was revised in 1974, renumbered \u00a7 895.46(l)(a) in 1975, and revised again in 1979. It now provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-20\">If the defendant in any action or special proceeding is a public officer or employee and is proceeded against in an official capacity or is proceeded against as an individual because of acts committed while carrying out duties as an officer or employee and the jury or the court finds that the defendant was acting within the scope of employment the judgment as to damages and costs entered against the officer or employee in excess of any insurance applicable to the officer or employee shall be paid by the state or political subdivision of which the defendant is an officer or employee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A19\">The jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters conferred on the district courts by the provisions of this Title, and of Title \u201cCIVIL RIGHTS,\u201d and of Title \u201cCRIMES,\u201d for the protection of all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and for their vindication, shall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, so far as such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect; but in all cases where they are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the State wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held, so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, shall be extended to and govern the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause, and, if it is of a criminal nature, in the infliction of punishment on the party found guilty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
