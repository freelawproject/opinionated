Walker contends that the trial court erred in not awarding him sufficient back-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>pay and in not permitting him to recover compensatory and punitive damages; Ford asserts that the trial court improperly found that it violated Title VII. Finding no error below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">Appellant Walker is a black man who in 1975 entered a minority dealer training program instituted by Ford and administered through participating local dealerships. During the 18-month training program trainees received a stipend of $1500 per month. Walker was assigned for his training to the Northgate Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Tampa, Florida. He began the program on October 27, 1975, and over the course of the next few months complained to Ford that Northgate management and employees repeatedly used offensive racial epithets, including referring to poorly repaired cars as \u201cnigger-rigged\u201d and referring to the salesman with the lowest sales volume as \u201cthe black ass.\u201d On one occasion the Northgate leasing manager called Walker a \u201cdumb nigger\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> another time, this same employee stated that one of the lease cars had been damaged by \u201cniggers.\u201d On still another occasion, when a black man created a disturbance at the dealership, a salesman was instructed to call the police to \u201cget this nigger out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">Walker was terminated from the training program on June 17,1976, four days after a Northgate co-owner Parks incorrectly reported Walker absent from work and shortly after Walker had requested a transfer to another dealership because of the racial slurs used by Northgate personnel. Walker sought reinstatement from Ford, and when it refused, filed a complaint with the EEOC. After receiving his right-to-sue letter, Walker filed this action in federal district court, alleging that the termination violated Title VII. The district court found that the pervasive use of racial slurs at the North-gate dealership was an unlawful employment practice under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) and that the inaccurate attendance report which resulted in Walker\u2019s discharge was motivated by Walker\u2019s complaints about the racial epithets. Accordingly, the court found that Ford and Northgate were guilty of retaliatory discharge under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The court awarded Walker reinstatement in the training program, or alternatively backpay for the remainder of the training period missed by Walker after the discharge, and attorney\u2019s fees, but denied compensatory damages claimed by Walker and also denied punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">We first address the issues raised by Ford\u2019s cross-appeal. Ford makes two separate arguments concerning the trial court\u2019s finding that it violated Title VII. First, it claims that while a work atmosphere tainted by pervasive racially abusive language can be unlawful under \u00a7 2000e-2, the racial slurs used at the Northgate dealership were not sufficiently pervasive to rise to a violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-11\">We disagree. As Ford correctly notes, \u201can employer violates Title VII simply by creating or condoning an environment at the workplace which significantly and adversely affects [the psychological well-being of] an employee because of his race or ethnicity, regardless of any other tangible job detriment to the employee.\u201d <em>Henson v. City of Dundee, </em>682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982). <em>See Rogers v. EEOC, </em>454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 957, 92 S.Ct. 2058, 32 L.Ed.2d 343 (1972); <em>Calcote v. Texas Education Foundation, Inc., </em>458 F.Supp. 231, 237 (W.D.Tex.1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>578 F.2d 95 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>Accord Johnson v. Bunny Bread Co., </em>646 F.2d 1250, 1257 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>Cariddi </em>v. <em>Kansas Chiefs Football Club, </em>568 F.2d 87, 88 (8th Cir. 1978). Ford argues, however, that the racial slurs used by Northgate personnel were either common parlance of an automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>bile dealership (i.e., \u201cnigger-rigged\u201d) or else were sporadic references and in most instances not aimed at Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">This court recognized in <em>Henson </em>that \u201cthe mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee \u2018does not rise to a Title VII violation.\u2019 For [] harassment to state a claim under Title VII, it must be sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Henson, </em>682 F.2d at 904. Here, however, the district court specifically found that Northgate personnel\u2019s use of the terms \u201cnigger-rigged\u201d and \u201cblack-ass,\u201d as well as other racially abusive language was \u201crepeated,\u201d \u201ccontinuous,\u201d and \u201cprolonged\u201d despite Walker\u2019s objections, and that the language made Walker feel unwanted and uncomfortable in his surroundings. These findings were findings of fact which must be upheld unless clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 907-07 (whether harassment is severe enough to seriously affect the psychological well-being of employees is a question to be determined with regard to the totality of the circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">The findings were not clearly erroneous. Co-owner Karras admitted to repeatedly using the term \u201cblack ass.\u201d Although Parks claimed he had never heard the phrase \u201cnigger-rigged\u201d around the dealership, he admitted it was a common term in the car business. Both men asserted, however, that neither of these terms were intended to carry racial overtones. All other instances of opprobrious language alleged by Walker were confirmed by the record, and even Judson Powell, the manager of Ford\u2019s trainee program, tacitly admitted the conditions at the Northgate dealership by advising Walker that the racial slurs were \u201cjust something a black man would have to deal with in the South,\u201d and that Walker should not dwell on \u201ctrivialities\u201d but concentrate on the broad goal of finishing the training program. Accordingly, we find no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that the work atmosphere at the Northgate dealership violated \u00a7 2000e-2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">Ford\u2019s next argument is that even if the trial court was correct in finding a \u00a7 2000e-2 violation, it erred in finding a retaliatory discharge under \u00a7 2000e-3. Ford contends that the trial court imper-missibly shifted the burden of proof to Ford to show a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the discharge contrary to the Supreme Court decision in <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Further, Ford asserts that no evidence of a retaliatory discharge existed to support the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-11\">We find both these arguments without merit. As to the first, we agree with Ford that <em>Burdine </em>mandates that the plaintiff always bear the burden of persuasion on the ultimate fact of discrimination. We also agree that under the traditional three-step proof in Title VII cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> once a plaintiff carries his prima facie case, the employer must only articulate, not prove by a preponderance, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. <em>See Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095; <em>Jones v. Lumberjack Meats, Inc., </em>680 F.2d 98, 101 (11th Cir. 1982). We do not agree, however, that the court applied the incorrect burden of proof to Ford. Although the district court\u2019s findings did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>clearly delineate the various steps in the proof of a Title VII claim, the transcript makes clear that the judge examined the pertinent facts and applied the proper burden of proof to the ultimate finding of discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the former Fifth Circuit has held, the absence of the labels \u201cprima facie case\u201d and \u201cpretextual\u201d in the trial court\u2019s findings is not fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim as long as the plaintiff proves under the correct allocation of the burden of proof the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>E.g., Sessions v. Rusk State Hospital, </em>648 F.2d 1066, 1071 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Merriweather v. Hercules, Inc., </em>631 F.2d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Ford\u2019s second claim is likewise meritless. The court found after reviewing all the evidence that \u201ca significant motivation\u201d for Walker\u2019s discharge was his complaints about the racial slurs at the Northgate dealership. This finding of ultimate fact can be overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>Pullman-Standard v. </em>Swint,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1787-91, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982); <em>Jones v. Lumberjack Meats, Inc., supra </em>at 101. The trial court\u2019s finding was amply supported by the record. Walker\u2019s discharge resulted from co-owner Parks\u2019 report to Ford that Walker had been absent from work without excuse and Parks\u2019 request that Walker be removed from the Northgate training program. Parks had signed work reports for Walker indicating that the trainee had attended work on the disputed day, however, and the incorrect report and request for Walker\u2019s removal came shortly after Walker had asked Ford for a transfer because of the racial slurs at Northgate. Ford, moreover, offered Walker no viable explanation for his removal other than that he had \u201cfailed to live within the discipline of the dealership\u201d and its proffered excuse at trial \u2014 Walker\u2019s alleged absenteeism \u2014 was rebutted by work reports introduced by Walker. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Ford was guilty of retaliatory discharge under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-13\">We next turn to the claims raised by Walker concerning the backpay award. He first asserts that the trial court erred in awarding his backpay only from the time of dismissal to the end of the training program. The trial court based its denial of further backpay on the theory that because the training program had a fixed term of eighteen months and because the training agreement specifically relieved Ford of any obligation to employ Walker at the program\u2019s end,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Walker was entitled only to backpay for the duration of the program. Walker contends that the evidence showed that Ford placed trainee graduates in dealerships or other management positions and therefore he is entitled to backpay until the time of reinstatement. Ford disputes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>Walker\u2019s characterization of the evidence and urges that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">Although we find under separate analysis that Walker was not entitled to further backpay, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s reasoning was too superficial. The mere fact that the training agreement was for a fixed term did not automatically end Ford\u2019s liability. On the contrary, our cases have recognized that even employees hired for fixed terms may be entitled to backpay from the date of the adverse employment action until reinstatement. <em>See, e.g., McLaurin v. Columbia Municipal Separate School District, </em>478 F.2d 348, 356 (5th Cir. 1973) (teachers employed under one-year contracts entitled to backpay from date of discharge to date of reinstatement); <em>Sparks v. Griffin, </em>460 F.2d 433, 443 (5th Cir. 1972) (same).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, our cases also hold that a Title VII plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing the economic injury resulting from the adverse employment action. <em>See Marks v. Prattco, </em>633 F.2d 1122, 1125 (5th Cir. 1981) (once plaintiff in Title VII case establishes prima facie case and damages resulting from discriminatory acts, burden of producing further evidence on damages to establish amount of earnings or lack of diligence in mitigation falls to defendant); <em>Merriweather v. Hercules, Inc., </em>631 F.2d 1161, 1167 (5th Cir. 1980) (court should not award backpay unless wages are properly owed to employee, but if court determines an economic loss was sustained backpay should be awarded unless special circumstances are present); <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>494 F.2d 211, 259 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1115, 99 S.Ct. 1020, 59 L.Ed.2d 74 (in class action discrimination suit employee carries initial burden of showing he is a class member and describing the harmful effect of discrimination on his employment). <em>Accord Taylor v. Phillips Industries, Inc., </em>593 F.2d 783, 787 (7th Cir. 1979) (\u201cNot until plaintiff establishes what she contends are her damages does the burden of going forward to rebut the damage claim . .. fall on the defendant.\u201d). The essential question before us, therefore, is whether Walker has \u201cestablished damages resulting from the discriminatory acts\u201d of Ford for a period beyond the training program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">An employee\u2019s claim for backpay for a period beyond that set by the employment agreement raises issues of causation which have not been thoroughly analyzed by the courts. In cases involving employment terminable at will or otherwise of indefinite duration, courts in essence have presumed that once the plaintiff shows that discrimination resulted in economic injury, either through improper discharge or a failure to hire, the injury continues until reinstatement. <em>See Merriweather v. Hercules, Inc., supra </em>(once plaintiff proved injury due to discrimination plaintiff was entitled to backpay until date of reinstatement despite questions concerning plaintiff\u2019s health, since record did not show high rate of absenteeism); <em>Mims </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>514 F.2d 106, 110 (5th Cir. 1975) (plaintiff who proves he is victim of unlawful discrimination presumptively entitled to backpay until date of reinstatement). <em>See also Edwards v. School Board, </em>658 F.2d 951, 954-55 (4th Cir. 1981) (Title VII plaintiff who proves intentional discrimination need not prove continuing property interest in job to recover backpay until reinstatement). This presumption is proper not only because the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct prevents accurately reconstructing the plaintiff\u2019s work history but also because in the absence of evidence to the contrary, no reason exists to assume that employment for an indefinite term would not have lasted indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">The Fourth Circuit has held this presumption applicable even in cases which involve fixed terms of employment. <em>Edwards v. School Board, supra. </em>Unlike situations involving employment of indefinite duration where such a presumption is consistent with the facts of the case, however, applying a presumption of continued employment to fixed-term cases runs contrary to the evidence which, absent anything to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>the contrary, shows that the employment relationship would have ended as of a set date. Moreover, other courts have not always awarded backpay to the date of reinstatement in cases of fixed-term employment. In <em>Welch </em>v. <em>University of Texas, </em>659 F.2d 531 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for example, a female research assistant sued under Title VII on a theory of constructive discharge and requested backpay. The district court found a Title VII violation, but awarded backpay only from the date of discharge to the date of expiration of the grant under which Welch had been hired. On appeal the former Fifth Circuit upheld the backpay award, noting that \u201cit is simply a matter of speculation whether Welch would have been shifted to another grant after [the current grant expired].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534. <em>See also Geller v. Markham, </em>635 F.2d 1027, 1036 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 945, 101 S.Ct. 2028, 68 L.Ed.2d 332 (1981) (upholding trial court\u2019s refusal to grant reinstatement under theory that jury\u2019s damage award equal to one-year\u2019s salary amounted to finding that teacher subject to unlawful failure to hire under ADEA was deprived of only one year\u2019s employment). Although <em>Welch </em>initially appears inconsistent with the teacher-discharge cases cited earlier, a close review of these cases reveals a factual difference we perceive as critical: the teacher cases invariably included evidence that either the particular teacher\u2019s limited-term contract had been renewed in prior years or else that the school system involved typically had renewed teacher contracts. Putting this evidence in the perspective of our more general holdings on Title VII damages, this evidence fulfilled an initial burden concerning the plaintiff\u2019s economic loss by showing that absent discrimination a teacher reasonably could expect reemployment despite being hired under a fixed-term contract. Such evidence, in contrast, was lacking in <em>Welch, </em>which limited backpay to the proven economic injury \u2014 the loss of employment for the remainder of the grant term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">Generalizing these holdings to a broad rule of Title VII damages, we conclude that the proper allocation of proof in cases involving fixed-term contracts is that a plaintiff must initially introduce some evidence showing that the economic injury resulting from the discharge extended beyond the employment term. As in the teacher discharge cases, this proof may consist of no more than a showing that the particular plaintiff\u2019s contract had been renewed in the past, that contracts of similarly situated employees had been renewed, or that the employer had made a promise of continued employment. Once the plaintiff carries this burden, and thus in the words of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Prattco, supra, </em>establishes the damages resulting from the discriminatory acts, then the burden shifts to the defendant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff would not have remained in employment beyond the contract term.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>Applying this test to the case before us, we conclude after examining the record that Walker failed to introduce any evidence that he would have continued employment <em>with Ford </em>at the end of the training program. The evidence showed that of 40 trainee graduates, only 11 obtained Ford dealerships, which are independent franchises granted by Ford and not \u201cemployment\u201d with Ford. Ford officials did testify that Ford \u201cmade efforts\u201d to find trainees management positions, but these efforts were directed at other dealerships, not at Ford itself. The record, moreover, is silent as to the success rate of these efforts. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of further backpay to Walker.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">We also reject Walker\u2019s argument that his last three months\u2019 pay<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> should not have been deducted from the backpay award because he was in Detroit seeking reinstatement. In <em>Merriweather v. Hercules, Inc., </em>631 F.2d 1161 (5th Cir. 1980) the court held that \u201cthe amount which an employee would otherwise have been entitled to in the absence of the discrimination will be reduced by any earnings acquired during the interim period regardless of the type of work involved.\u201d This decision is controlling and is decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">Walker\u2019s final complaints concern the district court\u2019s denial of certain compensatory damages claimed by Walker<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and denial of punitive damages. Although the question whether compensatory and punitive damages may be awarded in Title VII actions has not yet been decided by any controlling precedent of this court,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>see Whiting v. Jackson State University, </em>616 F.2d 116, 122 n.4 (5th Cir. 1980), all other circuits but one which have addressed the issues have held that neither compensatory nor punitive damages are available in a Title VII suit. <em>Padway </em>v. <em>Palches, </em>665 F.2d 965, 968 (9th Cir. 1982) (neither compensatory nor punitive damages are available); <em>Farmer v. ARA Services, Inc., </em>660 F.2d 1096, 1107 (6th Cir. 1981) (compensatory damages not available); <em>Shah v. Mount Zion Hospital &amp; Medical Center, </em>642 F.2d 268, 272 (9th Cir. 1981) (neither punitive nor compensatory damages are available); <em>Harrington v. VidaliaButler Board of Education, </em>585 F.2d 192, 194-96 (6th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 932, 99 S.Ct. 2053, 60 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (compensatory damages not available); <em>Richerson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>551 F.2d 918, 926-28 (3d Cir. 1977) (punitive damages not available); <em>Pearson v. Western Electric Co., </em>542 F.2d 1150, 1151-52 (10th Cir. 1976) (neither eom-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>pensatory nor punitive damages available); <em>Russell v. American Tobacco Co., </em>528 F.2d 357, 366 (4th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 1666, 48 L.Ed.2d 176 (1976) (punitive damages not available); <em>EEOC v. Detroit Edison Co., </em>515 F.2d 301, 308-10 (6th Cir. 1975) (punitive damages not available).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The reasoning behind these decisions is three-fold. First, the language of the Title VII remedies provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> limits relief to reinstatement with or without backpay and other equitable relief. Compensatory and punitive damages are legal not equitable remedies, and therefore have been held not authorized by the statute. Second, the courts have noted that the legislative history and language of \u00a7 2000e-5(g) suggest that this section is modeled on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), the provision of the National Labor Relations Act which empowers the NLRB to remedy unfair labor practices, <em>see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 419 &amp; n.ll, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975), and that \u00a7 160(c) has been interpreted not to permit awards of compensatory and punitive damages, liar-<em>rington, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 196-97; <em>Richerson, supra, </em>551 F.2d at 927; <em>Pearson, supra, </em>542 F.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">Perhaps the most persuasive rationale behind the damages ban, however, is the courts\u2019 observation that in 1968 Congress enacted the Fair Housing laws which specifically provided for both actual and punitive damages remedies, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612, yet four years later when Congress amended \u00a7 2000e-5(g) it failed to include any provision for damages. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, \u201cthe very detailed provisions of \u00a7 2000e-5 almost compel the conclusion that Congress intentionally left out any provision for either general or punitive damages.\u201d <em>Padway v. Palches, supra, </em>665 F.2d at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">We find the reasoning presented in these cases persuasive and adopt the rule that compensatory and punitive damages are unavailable in Title VII suits. We caution, however, that the compensatory damages ban does not include concomitants of employment such as fringe benefits, pension benefits, or other lost work benefits which at times have been referred to as \u201cdamages.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As the former Fifth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>noted in <em>Whiting v. Jackson State University, supra, </em>616 F.2d at 122 n.2, a district court order restoring such lost benefits is in the nature of an injunction and falls within the equitable relief provisions of \u00a7 2000e-5(g). Because none of Walker\u2019s claimed damages were benefits of work, however, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Walker\u2019s compensatory and punitive damage claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">. The circumstances surrounding this incident were disputed at trial. Walker claimed that the incident occurred when the Northgate employee spilled coffee on himself after bumping into a door that Walker had left locked. The employee claimed that he and Walker fought over $20 Walker allegedly owed him. The parties do not dispute that the employee later apologized to Walker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">. The fact that many of the epithets were not directed at Walker is not determinative. The offensive language often was used in Walker\u2019s presence after he had voiced objections to Ford. Accordingly, we find that under the circumstances Northgate\u2019s conduct \u201ccreat[ed] a working environment heavily charged with ethnic or racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Rogers v. EEOC, </em>454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert, denied, </em>406 U.S. 957, 92 S.Ct. 2058, 32 L.Ed.2d 343 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">. This three-step process requires a plaintiff to prove certain facts making out a prima facie case, after which the defendant must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the defendant does so, the plaintiff must prove the proffered reason is pretextual. <em>See Burdine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095; <em>Jones v. Lumberjack Meats, Inc., </em>680 F.2d 98, at 101 (11th Cir. 1982). To make out a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, the plaintiff must show (1) a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">. The transcript reveals the Court\u2019s awareness of the correct burden of proof. At one point during final argument, for example, the following colloquy between the court and counsel occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-7\">THE COURT: All right. That will be fine. There is one question which I would like to address to you and it is rather difficult to know how to put it precisely, but I would like to ask whether or not you agree that in order for the Plaintiff to recover in this case he must show that he was discharged or terminated by Ford either because of his race or because he objected to racial conditions at the dealership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-8\">Do you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-9\">MR. MOSS: Yes, sir. (T-286 -287).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">Shortly afterward the court again inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apk-dedup-0\">THE COURT: Wouldn\u2019t I have to find that he was terminated because of discrimination\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATeE\">MR. MOSS: Yes. (T-299).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">. Ford contends that the plaintiff could not have carried his prima facie case of retaliatory discharge because no evidence existed which proved a \u201ccausal link\u201d between the discharge and Walker\u2019s complaints about the racial epithets. See note 3, <em>supra. As we </em>explain in the text, <em>infra, </em>however, the evidence, although circumstantial, was ample for the trial court both to have found such a link and to have rejected Ford\u2019s proffered explanation for the discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1436-15\">. The agreement contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-16\">Nothing herein shall be construed as constituting any assurance or promise by Ford Motor Company that you will be offered a job with it or any dealership, or a Ford or Lincoln-Mercury Dealer Sales and Service Agreement, upon the completion of the Dealer Training Program.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">. The Eleventh Circuit, in the en banc case <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981), adopted as precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">. Because this case was decided by a Unit A panel of the former Fifth Circuit subsequent to October 1, 1981, we do not consider it binding precedent on this court. <em>See Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., 667 </em>F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">. We adopt this test from cases such as <em>Avery v. Homewood City Board of Education, </em>634 F.2d 337 (5th Cir. Unit B, 1982) which involve situations in which the plaintiff has already proven discrimination but the defendant contends that even absent the discrimination, the adverse employment action would have occurred. <em>See also Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <em>League of United Latin American Citizens v. City of Salinas Fire Dept., </em>654 F.2d 557, 558 (9th Cir. 1981) (once intentional discrimination is shown, plaintiff should be appointed retroactively to position denied unless defendant shows by clear and convincing evidence that even in the absence of discrimination the applicant would not have been selected for the open position). These cases involve the analogous issue of whether proven discrimination caused the economic injury alleged by the plaintiff, thus raising issues of causation similar to those raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">We do not find any inconsistency between the allocation of proof we adopt here and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). As the Ninth Circuit noted in <em>City of Salinas, supra, Burdine\u2019s </em>allocation of intermediate burdens of proof applies only to the initial decision whether intentional discrimination occurred. Where a court already has found intentional discrimination, either by defendant\u2019s admission, direct evidence, or through the <em>Burdine </em>circumstan-</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>tial evidence analysis, <em>Burdine </em>is no longer applicable to subsidiary issues such as damages. In the case before us, we have already held Ford liable for intentional discrimination; the only remaining question is damage causation, a question outside <em>Burdine\u2019s </em>scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">Finally, we also consider this test fully compatible with our recent decision in <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>681 F.2d 1259 (11th Cir. 1982) <em>(Pettway </em>V). In <em>Pettway V </em>a panel of this court held that plaintiffs in a class-action discrimination suit did not have to \u201cprove\u201d specific jobs denied and their qualifications for those jobs in order to be entitled to relief, but rather had only to give a \u201cstatement\u201d of the essential facts entitling them to relief. We conclude that this test from <em>Pettway V </em>essentially is the same as requiring a Title VII plaintiff claiming economic loss for a period beyond the fixed term of employment to introduce some initial evidence that the economic loss in fact continued beyond the employment term, which then shifts the burden to the defendant to prove by a preponderance that the claimed loss was not the result of the unlawful discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1439-10\">. We wish to emphasize that the analysis we have adopted here is applicable only in cases involving fixed-term employment and then only in the narrow category where the plaintiff requests backpay for a period extending beyond the employment term. In cases involving employment at will or other employment of indefinite duration, we see no reason to deviate from a presumption that the plaintiff\u2019s economic loss would have continued until reinstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">. Ford paid Walker for 90 days subsequent to his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">. These damages claims included moving expenses to Tampa and then to a new dealership for reinstatement, the loss incurred in the sale of Mrs. Walker\u2019s flower shop to facilitate Walker\u2019s participation in the training program, and damages for Walker\u2019s ruined credit rating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1439-13\">. Our precedents have held that both compensatory and punitive damages are available in actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983. <em>See Whiting v. Jackson State University, </em>616 F.2d 116, 122 n.4 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">. The only circuit court case arguably contra is <em>Williams v. Trans World Airlines, </em>660 F.2d 1267 (8th Cir. 1981), in which the court stated that \u201cthe award of compensatory damages for humiliation or emotional suffering is an appropriate remedy for deprivation of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272. <em>Williams, </em>however, included claims under both \u00a7 1981 and Title VII, and as we noted above, our precedents would permit compensatory damages under \u00a7 1981. Since the Eighth Circuit did not say whether it would permit an award of compensatory damages in a case brought solely under Title VII and did not cite or discuss any of the several circuit cases holding compensatory damages unavailable in Title VII suits, we consider <em>Williams </em>ambiguous and of marginal value to our analysis. <em>But see Fiedler v. Indianhead Truck Lines, Inc., </em>670 F.2d 806, 810 n.3 (8th Cir. 1982) (holding that damages for pain and suffering are unavailable in ADEA cases, but citing <em>Williams v. TWA </em>as holding that damages for emotional distress are available in Title VII cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">Appellant cited <em>Rosen v. Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., </em>477 F.2d 90 (3d Cir. 1973) as supporting an award of compensatory damages in Title VII cases. Although the <em>Rosen </em>court referred to an award of back pension benefits as \u201ccompensatory damages,\u201d the Third Circuit later referred to <em>Rosen </em>as a case of \u201cequitable restitution.\u201d <em>Richerson v. Jones, </em>551 F.2d 918, 927 n.13 (3d Cir. 1977). As we note in the text, <em>infra, </em>moreover, we consider a restoration of lost work benefits such as pension benefits to be within the equitable remedies available in Title VII cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1440-10\">. This section states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-11\">If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1440-12\">. Courts have rarely been precise in defining whether requested relief in Title VII cases is for \u201cdamages\u201d or an equitable remedy. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d as damages \u201csuch as will compensate the injured party for the injury sustained and nothing more.\u201d While certain types of equitable monetary relief such as backpay or restoration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>of other lost work benefits could fit this rather expansive definition, the cases holding that \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d are unavailable in Title VII actions uniformly deal with either claims for emotional distress (or pain and suffering) or else requests for damages resulting from the consequences of an adverse employment action, such as a ruined credit rating. <em>See, e.g., Pearson v. Western Electric Co., </em>542 F.2d 1150, 1151 (10th Cir. 1976) (plaintiff requesting \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d for humiliation and loss of credit rating). Walker\u2019s damage claims fall within this latter category, which more correctly is termed \u201cconsequential damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
