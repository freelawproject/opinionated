Our first opinion is reported in <em>Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, </em>9 Cir., 1979, 611 F.2d 296 <em>(Anti-Monopoly I). </em>On remand the district court again found that the \u201cMonopoly\u201d trademark was valid and had been infringed by Anti-Monopoly, Inc. <em>Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, Inc., </em>N.D.Cal., 1981, 515 F.Supp. 448 <em>(Anti-Monopoly II). </em>We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">I. <em>Prior Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">General Mills is the successor to Parker Brothers, Inc., which had produced and sold a game it called Monopoly since 1935. Parker Brothers registered \u201cMonopoly\u201d as a trademark in that year. In 1973 Anti-Monopoly, Inc. was established to produce and sell a game it called Anti-Monopoly. General Mills claimed that this infringed its trademark. This action was then brought by Anti-Monopoly, seeking a declaratory judgment that the registered trademark \u201cMonopoly\u201d was invalid, and cancelling its registration. In a counterclaim, General Mills sought declaratory and injunctive relief upholding its trademark, and the dismissal of the action. The case was tried without a jury in 1976. The court entered a judgment for General Mills. We reversed and remanded for further consideration of (i) the validity of the trademark, (ii) infringement of the trademark, if it is valid, by Anti-Monopoly, and (iii) state law claims concerning unfair competition and dilution. We also chose to defer consideration of (iv) Anti-Monopoly\u2019s defense that General Mills had unclean hands. On remand, after hearing further evidence, the district court again entered a judgment for General Mills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-7\">II. <em>The Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">We state the standard of review at the beginning of this opinion, lest we be charged with not applying it because our \u201cacknowledgement [of it] came late in [our] opinion.\u201d <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>1982, - U.S.-, at-, 102 S.Ct. 1781, at 1791, 72 L.Ed.2d 66; <em>id., </em>Marshall, J., dissenting, at-, 102 S.Ct. at 1784-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">We must apply the standard stated in Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P., the case having been tried without a jury: \u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, ...\u201d This has been interpreted to mean that the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact cannot be set aside unless, \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>1948, 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-13\">The Supreme Court has recently reminded us of the importance of the rule and of our duty to abide by it. <em>Pullman-Standard, </em>supra,-U.S. at-, 102 S.Ct. at 1789. In that case, the Court held that the rule applies equally to \u201cultimate\u201d facts and to \u201csubsidiary\u201d facts. <em>(Id.). </em>The Court also held that, when a finding is based on an erroneous view of the law, it may be set aside, but that in such a case the appellate court cannot make a contrary finding, but must remand to the trial court for new findings, to be made in the light of the correct rule of law. <em>(Id. </em>at-, 102 S.Ct. at 1791-92). To this there is one exception: A remand is unnecessary if \u201cthe record permits only one resolution of the factual issue.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>citing <em>Kelley v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>1974, 419 U.S. 318, 331-332, 95 S.Ct. 472, 479-80, 42 L.Ed.2d 498.) <em>See also Inwood Laboratories v. Ives Laboratories, </em>1982,-U.S.-,---, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2188-90, 72 L.Ed.2d 606, and the concurrence of Justice Rehnquist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-20\">I also assume, correctly I hope, that the Court\u2019s discussion of appellate review of trial court findings in bench trials, <em>ante, </em>at-, is limited to cases in which the appellate court has not found the trial court findings to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364 [68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746] (1948), upon which the Court relies, establishes the authority of a reviewing court to make its own findings, contrary to those of the trial court, where it has determined the latter to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d (- U.S. at---, 102 S.Ct. at 2193.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>III. <em>The Burden of Proof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-4\">The district court ruled that Anti-Monopoly had the burden of showing genericness \u201cby convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Anti-Monopoly II, </em>515 F.Supp. at 451-452. The case cited for that proposition, <em>Feathercombs, Inc. v. Solo Products Corp., 2 </em>Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 251, does not announce such a rule. The only reference to \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d is at 306 F.2d 256, and says nothing about burden of proof. There is a presumption in favor of a registered trademark, and the burden of proof is upon one who attacks the mark as generic, but the presumption can be overcome by a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the term was or has become generic. <em>See Vuitton et Fils S. A. v. J. Young Enterprises, </em>9 Cir., 1981, 644 F.2d 769, 775-776.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">IV. <em>Generic Terms </em>\u2014 The <em>Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Our opinion in <em>Anti-Monopoly I </em>binds both this court and the district court. There, we set out the law about generic terms and explained how it was to be applied to the particular facts of this case. <em>Anti-Monopoly I, </em>611 F.2d at 300-306. In this opinion, we assume that the reader will be familiar with that opinion. Here, we emphasize what we consider to be its essence. A word used as a trademark is not generic if \u201cthe primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. \u201c[W]hen a trademark primarily denotes a product, not the product\u2019s producer, the trademark is lost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. A registered mark is to be cancelled if it has become \u201cthe common descriptive name of an article,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(c), and no incontestable right can be acquired in such a mark. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065(4). We said \u201cEven if only one producer \u2014 Parker Brothers \u2014 has ever made the MONOPOLY game, so that the public necessarily associates the product with that particular producer, the trademark is invalid unless source indication is its primary significance.\u201d <em>Anti-Monopoly I, </em>611 F.2d at 302. \u201cIt is the source-denoting function which trademark laws protect, and nothing more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. \u201c[0]ne competitor will not be permitted to impoverish the language of commerce by preventing his fellows from fairly describing their own goods.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Bada Co. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>9 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 8, 11. \u201c[W]hen members of the consuming public use a game name to denote the game itself, and not its producer, the trademark is generic and, therefore, invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304:</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">V. Was <em>the Term </em>\u201cMONOPOLY\u201d <em>Generic at the Time of Registration?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-9\">Anti-Monopoly, Inc. claims that the term \u201cMonopoly\u201d was generic at the time when Parker Brothers registered it. On this question, the trial judge made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-10\">Plaintiff [Anti-Monopoly] attempted to show at trial that at the time of Parker Brothers\u2019 trademark registration, MONOPOLY was already a widely played game known by that name. The evidence introduced to support this contention consists chiefly of isolated and sporadic examples of individuals playing old oilcloth games referred to in some instances as \u201cMonopoly,\u201d the \u201cLandlord\u2019s Game,\u201d or some other variation thereof. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-11\">In order to be \u201cgeneric,\u201d the name MONOPOLY, in the minds of the consuming public, must primarily denote product rather than source. It remains unclear how widely played the precursors to modern MONOPOLY were in the 1920s and early \u201930s. Plaintiff has simply made no showing as to what the public conception of the term was at that juncture or indeed how widely played it actually was. As Clarence [sic] Darrow, and later his successor, Parker Brothers, popularized a specific game they called MONOPOLY, this court cannot find that the trademark when registered denoted \u201ca game\u201d rather than the \u201cgame\u2019s producer.\u201d Because Anti-Monopoly has the burden of showing genericness by convincing evidence, <em>Feathercombs, Inc. v. Solo Products Corporation, </em>306 F.2d 251 (2d Cir. 1962), this finding must be for defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">515 F.Supp. at 451-452. The district court found also that Darrow was the inventor of the game <em>(Id. </em>at 451) and that the game <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>was \u201ccreated\u201d by Darrow. <em>Id. </em>at 452 n.l. (The quotation marks are in the original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">We have already held that the district court placed too heavy a burden on Anti-Monopoly, Inc. Moreover, the court\u2019s reference to Darrow as the inventor or creator of the game is clearly erroneous. The record shows, as we stated in <em>Anti-Monopoly I, </em>that \u201cThe game of \u2018Monopoly\u2019 was first played from 1920 to 1982 on various college campuses by a small group of individuals, many of whom were related by blood or marriage. In late 1932 or early 1933 one of these players introduced Charles Darrow to the game, and gave him a handmade game board, rules, and associated equipment. Immediately thereafter Darrow commenced commercially producing and selling \u2018Monopoly\u2019 game equipment.\u201d 611 F.2d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">We have re-examined the entire record on appeal. Here is what it shows. At some time between 1904 and 1934, the game of monopoly developed. Early equipment was handmade and copied from earlier handmade equipment. All the witnesses presented by Anti-Monopoly insisted that the game was known as \u201cMonopoly\u201d by all who played it, although in most cases the name did not appear on the board itself. The game was played in Reading, Pennsylvania, sometime between 1911 and 1917, but this date may be a little early. In the early 1920\u2019s the game was played at Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Smith College, the University of Pennsylvania, and Haverford College. On occasion the rules were privately printed. The game was offered to, but rejected by, Milton-Bradley, a leading competitor of Parker Brothers. It was played in and around Reading, Pennsylvania from the early 1920\u2019s to the early 1930\u2019s. It may have been brought there from the University of Pennsylvania. Players in Reading made up and sold some half dozen sets of equipment at Williams College and the University of Michigan. The game next ap-. peared in Indianapolis, where some players marketed it under the name \u201cFinance.\u201d (Players in Reading sold some of those games too.) The game of monopoly was brought to Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1931 or thereabouts. The street names used in the game were then changed to Atlantic City street names. The game was taught to Darrow. He sold it to Parker Brothers in 1935, claiming that it was his own invention. Parker Brothers also bought the Finance game from its owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">It is true that Darrow, in his correspondence with Parker Brothers, claimed to have invented the game and offered to sign an affidavit stating his story. However, Robert B. M. Barton, the former President of Parker Brothers, who negotiated with Darrow in 1935, testified that he did not believe Darrow\u2019s claim. A precursor of monopoly, the Landlord\u2019s Game, was patented by Mrs. Maggie Elizabeth Phillips of Washington, D.C. in 1904 and again in 1924. Parker Brothers purchased this game from her in 1934 or thereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">In 1957, Barton, the President of Parker Brothers, in a letter to an inquirer, wrote: \u201cSo far as we know The Landlord\u2019s Game, invented by Mrs. Elizabeth Maggie Phillips of Washington, D.C., was the basic game for both FINANCE and MONOPOLY. Mrs. Phillips patented her game and we purchased her patent. Mr. Charles Darrow later made many improvements in The Landlord\u2019s Game and called his game MONOPOLY. He, too, secured a patent which he assigned to us. Because of the fact that we purchased all three games, it does not make very much difference to us who invented either one of the games.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">The evidence clearly shows that the game of monopoly was played by a small number of people before Darrow learned of it, and that these people called the game \u201cmonopoly.\u201d It is unclear just how many people played. General Mills offered testimony that it was not widespread throughout the United States. The burden of proof was on Anti-Monopoly to show that the term was generic. We cannot presume that the evidence offered by Anti-Monopoly is the tip of the iceberg. Thus, we are faced with the following legal question: if a game is known about by a small number of people and they all call it by a particular term, may one member of the group appropriate that name by registering it as a trademark?</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>Ordinarily, because the trial judge imposed too heavy a burden on Anti-Monopoly, we would be required to remand for new findings made under the proper burden. However, because we have concluded that the evidence, construed most favorably to Anti-Monopoly, does not show that \u201cMonopoly\u201d had become generic before Parker Brothers registered it as its trademark, and because our holding in Part VI, <em>post, </em>is dispositive of the case, such a remand is unnecessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">When a small number of people use a particular thing and call it by a particular name, one which is not a common descriptive term for the thing, a person may appropriate the name and register it as a trademark. The purpose of the doctrine that generic terms cannot be made trademarks is to prevent the appropriation of a term that is already in wide use among those who are potential purchasers of the thing that the term describes. If those who might purchase the thing know it by a particular name, then to forbid the use of that name by potential producers will erect unwarranted barriers to competition. As we said in <em>Anti-Monopoly I, </em>\u201cTrademarks ... are not properly used as patent substitutes to further or perpetuate product monopolies,\u201d 611 F.2d at 300. On the other hand, where, as here, the potential market is nationwide, and where the name is used only by a small number of scattered consumers, appropriation of the name as the trademark of one who produces for that potential market does not restrain competition to a significant degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cMonopoly\u201d had not become generic before Parker Brothers registered it as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">VI. <em>Has \u201cMonopoly\u201d Become Generic Since It Was Registered?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">This question is discussed, and the trial court\u2019s findings of fact appear in <em>Monopoly II, </em>515 F.Supp. at 452-455. Under the heading \u201cFINDINGS OF FACT,\u201d the following appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-8\">1. The court again finds as fact each fact found in this Opinion as set forth in the foregoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-9\">2. As a game trademark, MONOPOLY primarily denotes its producer, Parker Brothers, and primarily denoted its producer when registered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 455. We consider finding 2 to be one of ultimate fact, and subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52(a). <em>See Pullman-Standard, </em>supra,-U.S. at-, 102 S.Ct. at 1789.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-13\">The district court also said \u201c \u2018Primary significance\u2019 logically implies a hierarchical priority over a competing alternative.\u201d 515 F.Supp. at 454. Dictionary definitions are in accord. Funk &amp; Wagnalls\u2019 New Standard Dictionary gives \u201cprimary 1. First in ... thought or intention, 2. First in degree, rank or importance, most fundamental, chief....\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.) gives \u201c1. First in ... intention; 2. First in ... importance; chief, principal.... \u201d We are not sure what the district court meant by a \u201ccompeting alternative.\u201d To us, this carries some suggestion of \u201ceither, or.\u201d Yet it is nearly always the case, as the district court recognized, that a trademark will identify both the product and its producer. <em>Anti-Monopoly II, </em>515 F.Supp. at 454. Indeed, its value lies in its identification of the product with its producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-14\">In its opinion, the district court supports its finding 2 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-15\">The difficulty in this regard arises due to the public\u2019s dual usage of the trade-name, denoting both product and source. For example, the mark \u201cFord\u201d to the average consumer denotes <em>both </em>car and motor car company. However, to demonstrate \u201cprimary significance\u201d it is necessary to show more than a high percentage of the consuming public who recognize MONOPOLY as a brand name (as defendant has done: 63% of those polled recognized MONOPOLY as a \u201cbrand name\u201d). It is necessary to show more than a public awareness that Parker Brothers is the sole manufacturer of MONOPOLY (55% correctly identified Parker Brothers in defendant's survey). \u201cPrimary significance\u201d logically implies a hierarchical priority over a competing alternative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>Yet the cumulative weight of the evidence does satisfy this court that the primary significance of MONOPOLY in the public\u2019s eye is to denote a \u201cParker Brothers\u2019 Game\u201d (i.e., source) in contradistinction to that \u201cpopular game of MONOPOLY\u201d (product). Parker Brothers has expended substantial time, energy, and money in promoting and policing their trademark, expending over $4 million in advertising expenditures. One result of these diligent efforts has been the extraordinary success Parker Brothers has achieved in creating public source awareness. Over 55% of the American public correctly identified Parker Brothers as the producer of the game. <em>Cf. Selchow &amp; Righter Co. v. Western Printing &amp; Lithographing Co., </em>D.C., 47 F.Supp. 322, 326 (court finding it \u201cvery evident that any ordinary customer, going into a store, and asking for the game \u201cPARCHEESI\u201d had no information as to who might have manufactured and produced the game.\u201d) An even more impressive display of the amount of goodwill which Parker Brothers has imbued through its various games \u2014 especially MONOPOLY \u2014 is <em>the finding of plaintiff\u2019s survey that one out of three MONOPOLY purchasers do so primarily because \u201cthey like Parker Brothers\u2019 products.\u201d </em>Hence, source attribution is a dominant perceived effect of the MONOPOLY trademark. This court cannot say from the facts before it that it is not the \u201cprimary significance\u201d of the mark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 454-455 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">In considering whether these findings, and finding 2, are clearly erroneous, we have in mind an obvious proposition. The word \u201cMonopoly,\u201d while not in its ordinary meaning descriptive of the game \u201cMonopoly,\u201d is an ordinary English word, and it does describe the objective of the game. This was recognized in the rules of the game published by Parker Brothers in 1935. They begin with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-6\">BRIEF IDEA OF THE GAME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayx\">THE IDEA OF THE GAME is to BUY and RENT or SELL properties so profitably that one becomes the wealthiest player and eventual MONOPOLIST.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">A Monopolist has a monopoly. By choosing the word as a trademark, Parker Brothers subjected itself to a considerable risk that the word would become so identified with the game as to be \u201cgeneric.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">In <em>Anti-Monopoly II </em>the district court also said this: \u201cUnless the Ninth Circuit standard is meant to foreclose the possibility of trademark protection for any producer of a unique game whose corporate name does not appear in the title of the game <em>(e.g., </em>\u2018SCRABBLE,\u2019 \u2018TOWER OF BABBLE\u2019), then its test cannot be used here to thwart MONOPOLY\u2019S trademark rights.\u201d 515 F.Supp. at 455. Nothing in our opinion in <em>Anti-Monopoly I </em>even hints at the relevance of whether or not the corporate name of the producer of a game appears in the title of the game, and our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of trademark protection of the name of a game that does not embody the corporate name of its producer. But our opinion does squarely hold as follows: \u201cEven if only one producer \u2014 Parker Brothers \u2014 has ever made the MONOPOLY game, so that the public necessarily associates the product with that particular producer, the trademark is invalid unless source identification is its primary significance.\u201d 611 F.2d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-9\">The district court obviously felt that our opinion in <em>Anti-Monopoly I </em>gave Anti-Monopoly an easier task in trying <em>to show that </em>\u201cMonopoly\u201d has become generic than the district court would give. Nevertheless, both we and the district court are bound by our decision in <em>Anti-Monopoly I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">We now consider whether finding 2 of the district court is clearly erroneous. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">As we have seen, the district court relied in part upon the fact that General Mills and its predecessor have spent time, energy, and money in promoting and policing use of the term \u201cMonopoly.\u201d That fact, however, is not of itself sufficient to create legally protectable rights. <em>HMH Publishing Co. v. Brincat, </em>9 Cir., 1974, 504 F.2d 713, 719. It is not, of itself, enough that over 55% of the public has come to associate the product, and as a consequence the name by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>which the product is generally known, with Parker Brothers. <em>Anti-Monopoly I, </em>611 F.2d at 302. <em>See also Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>1938, 305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73 (the \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d case). Even if one third of the members of the public who purchased the game did so because they liked Parker Brothers\u2019 products, that fact does not show that \u201cMonopoly\u201d is primarily source indicating. The very survey on which the district court placed emphasis by italicizing its result shows that two thirds of the members of the public who purchased the game wanted \u201cMonopoly\u201d and did not care who made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-4\">The real question is what did Parker Brothers and General Mills get for their money and efforts? To us, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that they very successfully promoted the game of Monopoly, but that in doing it they so successfully promoted \u201cMonopoly\u201d as \u201cthe name of the game,\u201d that it became generic in the sense in which we use that term in trademark law. We recognize that \u201cthere is evidence to support\u201d the trial court\u2019s findings, <em>United States Gypsum Co., supra, </em>333 U.S. at 395, 68 S.Ct. at 542, but \u201con the entire evidence [we are] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">The principal evidence in the case was in the form of consumer surveys, and to these we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">A. <em>The Brand-name Survey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">General Mills conducted a survey based upon a survey approved by a district court in the \u201cTeflon\u201d case, <em>E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Yoshida International, Inc., </em>E.D.N.Y., 1975, 393 F.Supp. 502. In the survey conducted by General Mills, people were asked whether \u201cMonopoly\u201d is a \u201cbrand-name,\u201d and were told: \u201cBy <em>brand </em>name, I mean a name like <em>Chevrolet, </em>which is made by <em>one </em>company; by common name, I mean \u2018automobile,\u2019 which is made by a number of different companies.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) The results of this survey had no relevance to the question in this case. Under the survey definition, \u201cMonopoly\u201d would have to be a \u201cbrand name\u201d because it is made by only one company. This tells us nothing at all about the <em>primary </em>meaning of \u201cMonopoly\u201d in the minds of consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-9\">It is true that the witness through whom the survey was introduced testified on direct examination that as a result of it his opinion was that \u201cMonopoly\u201d primarily denotes source or producer. However, on cross-examination and redirect examination it became clear that this witness had done no more than reduplicate the \u201cTeflon\u201d survey (with appropriate substitutions and slight additions) and had no opinion on the relevance of this survey to any issue in the present case. The brand-name survey is not even some evidence to support finding 2; it is no evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">B. <em>The \u201cThermos\u201d Survey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-11\">Anti-Monopoly\u2019s first survey was based upon that used in the \u201cThermos\u201d case, <em>King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., </em>D.Conn., 1962, 207 F.Supp. 9, 20-21, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>2 Cir., 1963, 321 F.2d 577. In Anti-Monopoly\u2019s survey people were asked the question: \u201cAre you familiar with business board games of the kind in which players buy, sell, mortgage and trade city streets, utilities and railroads, build houses, collect rents and win by bankrupting all other players, or not\u201d? About 53% said they were. Those people were then asked: \u201cIf you were going to buy this kind of game, what would you ask for, that is, what would you tell the sales clerk you wanted\u201d? About 80% said: \u201cMonopoly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">The witness through whom this survey was introduced testified that Anti-Monopoly gave his firm the questions used in the \u201cThermos\u201d survey and asked it to conduct a similar one. Anti-Monopoly provided the wording of the questions in the present survey as well. The research firm was responsible for deciding how to reach a sample that would adequately represent the population of the United States. The witness gave no testimony as to the relevance of the results of the survey to the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">In one of its briefs, General Mills points out that the survey used in the \u201cThermos\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>case was described as \u201cgenerally corroborative of the court\u2019s conclusions drawn from other evidence,\u201d and that the district court which decided the \u201cTeflon\u201d case found a \u201cThermos\u201d-like survey defective because \u201cthe design of the questions more often than not [focused] on supplying the inquirer a \u2018name,\u2019 without regard to whether the principal significance of the name supplied was \u2018its indication of the nature or class of an article, rather than an indication of its origin,\u2019 <em>King-Seeley Thermos Co., supra, </em>321 F.2d at 580.\u201d <em>E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., supra, </em>393 F.Supp. at 527. Be that as it may, we think that the results of this survey are compelling evidence of a proposition that is also dictated by common sense: an overwhelming proportion of those who are familiar with the game would ask for it by the name \u201cMonopoly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">C. <em>The Motivation Survey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">After the remand to the district court, Anti-Monopoly commissioned a further survey. This survey was based upon the following language from our opinion in <em>Anti-Monopoly I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-6\">It may be that when a customer enters a game store and asks for MONOPOLY, he means: \u201cI would like Parker Brothers\u2019 version of a real estate trading game, because I like Parker Brothers\u2019 products. Thus, I am not interested in board games made by Anti-Monopoly, or anyone other than Parker Brothers.\u201d On the other hand, the consumer may mean: \u201cI want a \u2018Monopoly\u2019 game. Don\u2019t bother showing me Anti-Monopoly, or EASY MONEY, or backgammon. I am interested in playing the game of Monopoly. I don\u2019t much care who makes it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-7\">In the first example, the consumer differentiates between MONOPOLY and other games according to source-particular criteria. In the second example, source is not a consideration. The relevant genus, or product category, varies accordingly. At the urging of Parker Brothers, the district court erred by first defining the genus, and then asking the \u201cprimary significance\u201d question about the wrong genus-species dichotomy. The proper mode of analysis is to decide but one question: whether the primary significance of a term is to denote product, or source. In making this determination, the correct genus-species distinction, that is, the correct genericness finding, follows automatically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-9\">611 F.2d at 305-306. The wording of the questions was provided by Dr. Anspach, Anti-Monopoly\u2019s president, and by the expert who testified at trial. The expert had studied our first opinion. The survey was designed to ascertain the use of the term \u201cMonopoly\u201d by those who had purchased the game in the past or intended to do so in the near future. It was conducted by telephone. The results were as follows: 92% were aware of \u201cMonopoly,\u201d the business board game produced by Parker Brothers. Of that 92%, 62% either had \u201cpurchased \u2018Monopoly\u2019 within the last couple of years\u201d or intended to purchase it in the near future. Those people were asked why they had bought or would buy monopoly. The answers exhibited the following pattern: 82% mentioned some aspect of the playing of the game (e.g., that they played it as a kid, it was a family game, it was enjoyable, it was fun to play, it was interesting), 14% mentioned some educational aspect of the game, 7% mentioned the equipment (e.g., saying it was durable) or said they were replacing a set, 1% spoke of price, 34% gave other reasons neutral to the issues in this case (e.g., it was for a gift, the game was a classic, people like the game). The percentages total more than 100 because respondents often gave more than one reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">The people who said that they had purchased the game within the last couple of years or would purchase it in the near future were then given a choice of two statements and were asked which best expressed their reasons. Sixty-five percent chose: \u201cI want a \u2018Monopoly\u2019 game primarily because I am interested in playing \u2018Monopoly,\u2019 I don\u2019t much care who makes it.\u201d Thirty-two percent chose: \u201cI would like Parker Brothers\u2019 \u2018Monopoly\u2019 game primarily because I like Parker Brothers\u2019 products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-11\">A very similar \u201cintercept survey\u201d was conducted by face to face interviews. The results were very close to those of the tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>phone survey, but the expert did not claim that the intercept study was validly project-able.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-4\">The district court indicated its reasons for rejecting this survey. Insofar as these are findings of fact they must be accorded the deference required by Rule 52(a), and, giving them that deference, we hold them to be clearly erroneous. The district court\u2019s major objection to the survey was that it sought an explanation of an actual purchaser\u2019s motivation in purchasing the game rather than the primary significance of the word. <em>Anti-Monopoly, Inc., </em>515 F.Supp. at 453. This objection cannot stand. In our earlier opinion we made it clear that what was relevant was the sense in which a purchaser used the word \u201cMonopoly\u201d when asking for the game by that name. The survey was a reasonable effort to find that out and was modelled closely on what we said in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">The district court thought that the survey was invalidated by the fact that in the first question people were asked if they were \u201caware of \u2018Monopoly,\u2019 the business board game <em>produced </em>by <em>Parker </em>Brothers\u201d (emphasis supplied). It supposed that the presence of the emphasized words somehow inhibited those who might otherwise have responded to later questions that they bought the game because it was produced by Parker Brothers. No evidence or expert opinion was given to support this view and it has no inherent plausibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">In a footnote the district court said of this survey that \u201cother methodological deficiencies abound.\u201d <em>Id., </em>515 F.Supp. at 453 n.4. One suggested deficiency is that Professor Anspach suggested the language that was used. This is taken to be evidence of \u201cinherent bias.\u201d General Mills argues to us that little weight should be given to this survey because it was devised by Dr. An-spach and the survey firm without the mediation of a trademark attorney. We find no merit in these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">The district court found that the study was \u201coverwhelmingly prone to errors of subjective grading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No doubt it was referring to the process by which responses were categorized as, for example, education, enjoyable, \u201cplayed it as a kid,\u201d or equipment. This process of categorization was not purely mechanical, and did involve some use of human judgment. However, we are not prepared to dismiss every process that includes the operation of human judgment as \u201coverwhelmingly prone to errors of subjective grading.\u201d Nor do we find any special reasons to suspect the exercise of judgment in the case of this survey. The categories that were listed strike us as reasonable ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-9\">Neither the district court nor General Mills claims that there were <em>in fact </em>errors of judgment, but only that there might have been. The raw responses to the survey were at one point offered in evidence by Anti-Monopoly, but the offer was withdrawn after General Mills objected, citing F.R. Evidence 705, 1005 and 1006, and the district judge said: \u201cif [counsel for General Mills had] asked for them, he could have received them. If he received them, he could have turned them over to his expert to check them out and see if they give a reliable or non-reliable basis for the opinion. But since he didn\u2019t ask for them, I don\u2019t think they should go into evidence.\u201d Under these circumstances, General Mills cannot now argue that the raw responses were not in fact correctly categorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-10\">Finally, in the same footnote, the district court suggested that the result that 82% of monopoly purchasers buy for \u201cproduct related\u201d reasons <em>cannot be reconciled </em>with the other result that 32% of actual or potential buyers chose the statement \u201cI would buy Parker Brothers\u2019 \u2018monopoly\u2019 game primarily because I like Parker Brothers\u2019 products.\u201d This is a misconception of the survey results. The comparable figure to the 32% is the 65% who chose the statement \u201cI want a \u2018monopoly\u2019 game primarily because I am interested in playing \u2018monopoly,\u2019 I don\u2019t much care who makes it.\u201d The 82% who gave \u201cproduct related\u201d answers no doubt had both product related and source related reasons for buying, and, with some, enough to reduce 82% to 65%, the source related reason was stronger when the person had to choose. But it is still true that 65% chose product, rather than source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>We conclude that the findings regarding the survey are clearly erroneous, and that it does support the conclusion that the primary significance of \u201cMonopoly\u201d is product rather than source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">D. <em>The Tide Survey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-5\">General Mills introduced a survey that was intended as a <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>of the motivation survey. It showed that when asked to supply a reason for buying Tide about 60% of those who might buy it now or in the future said that they would buy Tide because it does a good job. However, when asked \u201cWould you buy Tide primarily because you like Procter and Gamble\u2019s products, or primarily because you like Tide detergent?\u201d about 68% indicated the latter reason. There were various respects in which this survey was different from the motivation survey used by Anti-Monopoly, but we shall not suddenly attach great importance to technical considerations. We suspect that these results tend to show that the general public regards \u201cTide\u201d as the name of a particular detergent, having particular qualities, rather than as one producer\u2019s brand name for the same detergent which is available from a variety of sources. We do not know whether the general public thinks this, or if it does, is correct in thinking this, or whether Procter and Gamble intend them to think it. If the general public does think this, and if the test formulated in <em>Anti-Monopoly I </em>could be mechanically extended to the very different subject of detergents, then Procter and Gamble might have cause for alarm. The issue is not before us today. The motivation survey conducted by Anti-Monopoly, Inc. was in accordance with the views we expressed in <em>Anti-Monopoly I. </em>The results in the <em>Tide </em>Survey are of no relevance to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">E. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-7\">We hold that Finding 2 is clearly erroneous because, although there is some evidence to support it, our examination of the evidence leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. We hold that, as applied to a board game, the word \u201cMonopoly\u201d has become \u201cgeneric,\u201d and the registration of it as a trademark is no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-9\">VII. <em>Other Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\">The district court must determine whether Anti-Monopoly is taking reasonable care to inform the public of the source of its product, and if it finds that this is not so may enjoin the sale of anti-monopoly save upon appropriate conditions. <em>Anti-Monopoly I, </em>611 F.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-11\">We remand the case. The district court shall enter judgment for Anti-Monopoly, Inc. on the question of trademark validity and take whatever actions are necessary and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
