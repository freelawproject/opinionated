(\u201cHubbard\u201d) seeks review under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a) of the decision and order of re-* spondent Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) upholding dismissal on June 9, 1981, by FCC\u2019s Broadcast Bureau of Hubbard\u2019s rulemaking petition to amend FCC\u2019s rule (47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.22 (1981)) to provide for a Class I-A \u201cclear channel\u201d station (KOB) at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the AM radio frequency 770 kiloHertz (\u201ckHz\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">The FCC order not only denied Hubbard\u2019s application for review of the Broadcast Bureau\u2019s dismissal of its rulemaking petition, but also denied: (1) Hubbard\u2019s application for review of the Bureau\u2019s denial of Hubbard\u2019s related request for waiver of section 73.22 of FCC\u2019s rule (Table of Assignments) to permit Class I-A operation for Station KOB; and (2) Hubbard\u2019s application for review of the Bureau\u2019s dismissal of its application for modification of its outstanding construction permit (granted November 2, 1976) to specify nondirectional nighttime operation for Station KOB, which would be expected to follow upon favorable action on either Hubbard\u2019s petition for rulemaking or its request for waiver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">The threshold issue is whether this court has jurisdiction over this appeal in view of the exception contained in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-18\">Any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this chapter (except those appealable under subsection (b) of this section) shall be brought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-19\">47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b) provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_C\">Appeals may be taken from decisions and orders of the Commission to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in any of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(1) By any applicant for a construction permit or station license, whose application is denied by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">(2) By any applicant for the .. . modification of any such instrument of authorization whose application is denied by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The facilities and status sought by Hubbard would require modification of the operation of American Broadcasting Company\u2019s Radio Station WABC (New York City) from Class I-A status, assigned to WABC by 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.22, to Class II-A. In dismissing Hubbard\u2019s rulemaking petition and application, the Broadcast Bureau pointed out that \u201c[ejfforts to reclassify both KOB and WABC as directionalized Class I-B stations on 770 kHz were twice rejected by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,\u00ae on the grounds that disparate treatment of the three network flagship stations [WNBC, WCBS, and WABC], entailed by directionalizing WABC, could not be justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In 1952, Congress amended section 402 to \u201cmake clear that judicial review of all cases involving the exercise of the Commission\u2019s radio-licensing power is limited to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\u201d S.Rep.No.44, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1951); <em>see </em>H.R.Rep.No.1750, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3, 16 (1952) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2234. In accordance with this stated purpose, the courts generally have required that appeals be taken under section 402(b) where the Commission\u2019s action bears a \u201cclose functional similarity\u201d to the types of cases enumerated under that section,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or is \u201cancillary\u201d to,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or \u201cin aid of,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or \u201cintimately associated with\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the FCC licensing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Hubbard cites <em>Campos v. FCC, </em>650 F.2d 890, 893 (7th Cir. 1981), for its statement that \u201cit is well settled that Section 402(b) is to be narrowly construed and confined to the enumerated categories,\u201d citing <em>FCC v. Columbia Broadcasting System, </em>311 U.S. 132, 61 S.Ct. 152, 85 L.Ed. 87 (1940). However, the quoted statement is dictum, and the cited case merely calls for a \u201cclear-eyed\u201d reading of section 402(b). Moreover, the Seventh Circuit panel appears to have overlooked the later case of <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, </em>316 U.S. 407, 416, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 1199, 86 L.Ed. 1563 (1942), wherein, consistent with the Congressional purpose, the court said that, in determining whether an FCC order is appealable under section 402(a) or section 402(b), \u201cit is the substance of what the Commission ... has done which is decisive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Hubbard also cites <em>New Jersey Coalition for Fair Broadcasting v. FCC, </em>574 F.2d 1119, 1121 (3d Cir. 1978), wherein the court held that it had jurisdiction under section 402(a) to review the results of an informal rulemaking proceeding in which FCC terminated an inquiry into the adequacy of television service in the State of New Jersey. This, of course, is unlike the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">In view of the foregoing, and after considering all arguments of the parties and intervenor American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., we are persuaded that FCC\u2019s denial of Hubbard\u2019s \u201cpackage\u201d of applications was, as a matter of substance, the exercise by FCC of its \u201cradio-licensing power\u201d reviewable under section 402(b); further, that to permit Hubbard to split off a part of the \u201cpackage\u201d in a transparent attempt to obtain jurisdiction in a forum other than the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has twice ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>against reclassifying KOB and WABC as directionalized stations on 770 kHz, would frustrate the clear intent of Congress that judicial review of all cases involving FCC\u2019s \u201cradio-licensing power\u201d be limited to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Accordingly, we hold that this court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\">. It should be noted that in March of 1981 Hubbard filed a package of \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d applications (FCC\u2019s description) comprising its petition for rulemaking, its application for waiver of section 73.22 of FCC\u2019s rules, and its application for modification of Hubbard\u2019s construction permit to change the facilities of KOB to accommodate a Class I-A assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-21\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 provides that the court of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend, or to determine the validity of all final reviewable orders of the FCC. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2343 provides that \u201c[t]he venue of a proceeding under this chapter is in the judicial circuit in which the petitioner resides or has its principal office, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\u201d Hubbard\u2019s principal office is in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. <em>Metropolitan Television Co. v.
