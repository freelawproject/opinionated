(ECI) guilty of giving an illegal gratuity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f). The jury also found Judge Robert Campbell guilty of receiving an illegal gratuity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(g). The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 post-verdict motions for judgments of acquittal, and imposed sentence. Despite the range and importance of the questions raised by appellants, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">ECI was formed to engage in trucking and construction work. In 1974, when the company obtained three contracts for construction of Metro subway stations, ECI maintained a fleet of 80-85 dumptrucks to conduct dirt-hauling operations. These trucks were subject to the vehicle weight restrictions of the District of Columbia. They could carry a maximum load of 44,000 pounds unless they displayed special use permits, costing $680 apiece, that raised the limit to 65,900 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">ECI purchased 112 special use permits for the year ending June 1974. It purchased only 60 permits for the year ending June 1975, and no permits at all for the next two years. As a result, ECI received hundreds of traffic tickets charging weight violations. These tickets were handled erratically by the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A number of judges (including some who later testified for the defense) dismissed the tickets or imposed only token fines. One of these judges was Robert Campbell, who had been appointed to the Superior Court bench in 1972. In over 90 percent of the 1,138 tickets involving ECI that were considered by Judge Campbell, the judge suspended sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">ECI\u2019s assistant general manager, Robert Jenkins, had responsibility for supervision of the ECI truck fleet. Jenkins was called before a grand jury in 1978, and at that time testified that he had never delivered anything of value to Judge Campbell. In July 1978, Jenkins discussed his testimony with another ECI employee, Walter \u201cJunior\u201d Jones, and Jones gave similar testimony at his own grand jury appearance. In August 1978, however, the <em>Washington Post </em>reported that ECI employees had assisted in the move of Judge Campbell\u2019s household furnishings under the direction of Jones and Jenkins. Jones was then offered immunity in exchange for testimony against Jenkins, and Jenkins was ultimately indicted and convicted of perjury. We affirmed that conviction in <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>No. 79-2559 (D.C.Cir. Sept. 19, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">In August 1980, the grand jury charged ECI and Judge Campbell in a four-count indictment, alleging conspiracies in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) (RICO) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and the giving and receiving of bribes in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b) and (c). The indictment charged 16 separate instances of bribery. Twelve of these were payments of cash, starting as early as 1966 when Campbell was an Assistant Corporation Counsel. The other four instances were gifts to Judge Campbell of three loads of topsoil, a garden cultivator, several cases of liquor, and the move of his household belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Problems beset the prosecution almost immediately; even after a superseding indictment was filed, the government acted repeatedly to narrow the charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By the time the case went to the jury, the bribery scheme alleged in Count III of the indictment was confined to the move of household goods in August 1975 and five payments of cash between January 1976 and February 1977. At the conclusion of testimony, however, the trial court also agreed to instruct the jury of the lesser included offenses of giving and receiving an illegal gratuity in the third and fourth counts of the indictment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The jury found the defendants not guilty of conspiracy on Counts I and II. By way of a special verdict form, the jury also acquitted the defendants of bribery and found that there was no illegal gratuity given or received in connection with any of the five cash payments alleged. The jury did find each defendant guilty in connection with the 1975 move of the household goods \u2014 ECI for having given an illegal gratuity in the form of that move, and Judge Campbell for having received that gratuity. In June 1981, the trial court fined ECI $10,000, the maximum penalty authorized under the statute, and sentenced Judge Campbell to serve a term of imprisonment of three months to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">II. Issues Raised on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">The defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions, the admission of hearsay evidence, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the alleged misconduct of the jury in reaching a verdict, and the sentencing decision of the trial court. We discuss each of these arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The standards for evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a guilty conviction are well established. We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all justifiable factual inferences from it. The verdict will be overturned only if a reasonable jury could not accept the evidence as sufficient to support the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Staten, </em>581 F.2d 878, 882 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Curley v. United States, </em>160 F.2d 229 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Judge Campbell\u2019s defense sought to negate the existence of criminal intent. It emphasized that Judge Campbell gave $60 to the three ECI employees who assisted during the five-hour move, and that Judge Campbell sought to pay their supervisor, Jones, as well. When Jones refused to take any money for his own time or to let Judge Campbell pay for a truck that Jones had already rented, Judge Campbell \u201cwas confronted, not of his own volition or choice, with a gratuity ... of such a nature that he could not give it back.\u201d Brief for Appellant Campbell at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Although this version of events could be believed, there was clearly sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not so. There was credible evidence to suggest that Jenkins arranged the move pursuant to a meeting with Judge Campbell, that the $60 was intended as a tip rather than as payment for the value of the services given, and that Judge Campbell knew the movers\u2019 assistance was a gratuity rendered for or because of his official acts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was for the jury to resolve the question of Judge Campbell\u2019s intent based on this evidence, and we find no occasion to disturb its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">B. <em>Evidentiary Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALY\">Jenkins was the government\u2019s principal witness at the trial. He had been convicted of three counts of making a false declaration before a grand jury in November 1979, and sentenced the following month to three years probation and a fine of $5,000. Jenkins was then given immunity from further prosecution other than for perjury, and was ordered to testify before the grand jury. In conversations with government prosecutors in February and April, 1980, Jenkins stated that he made numerous cash payments to Judge Campbell between 1973 and 1977. He also discussed other favors that had been given to the judge, including assistance during the household move.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">During the trial a year later, however, Jenkins testified that he no longer remembered certain details of these transactions. He was not formally declared a hostile witness, but the trial judge characterized Jenkins as a \u201creluctant\u201d witness from whom \u201cthe prosecutor literally has to pull every statement,\u201d Tr. 1020-21, \u201cone of the most uncooperative witnesses I have ever seen,\u201d Tr. 1137, and a \u201cstone wall.\u201d Tr. 1102. In particular, Jenkins testified that his first payment to Judge Campbell occurred after Campbell became a judge, but stated that he could not recall the year in which payment was made. In an effort to refresh Jenkin\u2019s memory, he was shown notes made by a prosecutor during an interview in February 1980. Jenkins\u2019 recollection was not refreshed, however, and the prosecution then sought to introduce the substance of the notes as Jenkins\u2019 past recollection recorded. Defense objections were overruled, and appellants now urge that this evidence was inadmissible as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Although the use of prior statements of witnesses as substantive evidence raises one of the thornier issues in the law of evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we cannot say that any error here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>was prejudicial. Jenkins testified at trial from his present recollection concerning roughly a dozen cash payments to Judge Campbell and the provision of other favors, and the defense was not deprived of effective cross-examination as to these events. Jenkins was on the stand for six days of the trial, and any erroneous ruling as to the admissibility of evidence concerning the exact year these payments began could hardly have been prejudicial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Lutwak v. United </em>States, 344 U.S. 604, 619-20, 73 S.Ct. 481, 490, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Appellants also object to the government\u2019s introduction of evidence concerning the conversation between Jenkins and Jones that took place after Jenkins\u2019 first grand jury appearance. Although it is well settled that statements made by co-conspirators after the termination of the conspiracy generally may not be admitted against co-conspirators who were not privy to those conversations as substantive evidence of their association with the conspiracy, <em>Krulewitch v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949), appellants\u2019 objection misapprehends the only purpose for which this evidence was introduced.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We must also note that the defendants made no objection at trial to the questions put to Jenkins and Jones about their meeting, and that any evidentiary error here could hardly be considered plain. <em>See United States v. McCray, </em>433 F.2d 1173, 1175 n.l (D.C.Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">C. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The district court instructed the jury that the offense of giving a bribe charged in Count III of the indictment \u201cnecessarily includes the lesser offense of giving an illegal gratuity.\u201d The court then stated five elements of that offense, of which the final two were \u201cthat the defendant gave the money for or because of an official act,\u201d and \u201cthat the defendant acted knowingly and willfully.\u201d Tr. 6287-88. The elements of the offense of <em>receiving </em>an illegal gratuity were substantially the same, including that the defendant \u201creceived the money for or because of an official act performed or to be performed by him,\u201d and that the defendant acted \u201cknowingly and willfully.\u201d Tr. 6293.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Appellants urge that these instructions were erroneous on two grounds. First, relying on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>506 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>F.2d 62 (D.C.Cir.1974), they contend that it is not enough to support a gratuity conviction that a defendant acted \u201cknowingly and willfully.\u201d Instead, they suggest that the defendant must have specific knowledge of a definite official action for which the gratuity is given, knowledge that they argue has not been shown in this case. Second, appellants observe that in some situations the giving of a gratuity is <em>not </em>necessarily included in the greater offense of bribery. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>506 F.2d at 68. They urge that the verdict be overturned because the jury was not instructed of relevant differences between bribery and illegal gratuities, and thus may have convicted the defendants for an offense that was not charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">As noted above, however, <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra, </em>appellants failed to object to the proposed gratuity instructions at trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">This language is not merely precatory. The rule requires that alleged errors in jury instructions be brought to the attention of the trial judge in order to provide an opportunity for their immediate correction; belated complaints are strongly disfavored. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wiggins, </em>530 F.2d 1018, 1020 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>Moore v. United States, </em>262 F.2d 216, 218 (D.C.Cir.1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 959, 79 S.Ct. 800, 3 L.Ed.2d 767 (1959). We therefore consider only whether the jury instructions were plainly erroneous within the meaning of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). We discuss appellants\u2019 claims in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">1. <em>Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\"> It is true that an illegal gratuity need not always be a lesser included offense of bribery. As we explained in <em>Brewster:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au6\">The bribery section makes necessary an explicit <em>quid pro quo </em>which need not exist if only an illegal gratuity is involved; the briber is the mover or producer of the official act, but the official act for which the gratuity is given might have been done without the gratuity, although the gratuity was produced because of the official act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">506 F.2d at 72. One obvious resulting distinction is temporal. \u201cThe gratuity section . . ., unlike the bribery section . .., applies to past official acts as well as future ones.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. Payments to a public official for acts that would have been performed in any event \u2014 whether before or after those acts have occurred \u2014 are probably illegal gratuities rather than bribes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This does not mean, however, that all bribes must inevitably be paid prior to the official act in question. The statute proscribes offers and promises of bribes as well as the giving of bribes, and it is only logical that in certain situations the bribe will not actually be conveyed until the act is done.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The appellants\u2019 argument is highly conjectural: the indictment alleged only bribery, which contemplates <em>future </em>action; the trial court did not differentiate between gratuities given for past or future actions; ECI had received favorable treatment from Robert Campbell <em>prior </em>to the move of household goods in August 1975;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>may have wrongfully convicted the defendants because of a gratuity for past official acts; and the defendants may therefore have been convicted of offenses that were not charged in the indictment, and on which they did not have notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The argument fails. A bribe may be conveyed after the official act has been performed, and thus the fact that the indictment charged that the first payment was made to Judge Campbell in 1973 does not immunize defendants\u2019 actions prior to that date. The defendants had notice that they were on trial for an on-going scheme that covered an extensive period of time, and in fact the case for the defense did not limit itself to events later than 1973.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, the possible distinction between bribery and illegal gratuities apparently did not strike defense counsel as anything significant at the time the instructions were requested. In the context of the trial as a whole, it was not plain error for the trial court to share this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">2. <em>Intent \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">It is no easy task to articulate the requisite intent necessary to constitute accepting or giving an illegal gratuity. The statute requires that a bribe be given or received \u201ccorruptly,\u201d whereas the intent required by the gratuity section of the statute is expressed by the language \u201cotherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty.\u201d <em>See Brewster, </em>506 F.2d at 76. In <em>Brewster, </em>we remanded for a new trial because the jury instructions did not define the distinction between these requisite intents \u201cwith indisputable clarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. Based on that case, appellants here urge that the trial court erred in not requiring the jury to find that the gratuity was conferred with \u201cspecific knowledge\u201d of \u201ca definite official action for which compensation was intended.\u201d They make the somewhat startling claim that \u201cif Robert Jenkins provided a move of household belongings to Judge Robert Campbell because he felt that Judge Campbell had been (or would be) generally lenient with respect to [ECI] overweight citations, this would <em>not </em>be sufficient for culpable intent.\u201d Brief for Appellant ECI at 17-18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Appellants\u2019 argument reveals a fundamental misconception of the gratuity statute and an overreading of <em>Brewster, </em>which concerned the conviction of a former United States Senator who had received a substantial sum of money from a mail-order company that had an interest in defeating enactment of pending legislation to increase postal rates. The hard question in <em>Brewster </em>involved distinguishing illegal gratuities from innocent campaign contributions, and the court concluded that the trial judge had not made the distinction intelligible to the jury:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">[S]ince \u201cwillfully and knowingly\u201d could mean that defendant Brewster <em>knew </em>when he accepted the money that he was receiving the contribution because of his record of performance in this field of postal legislation, and that if he continued such legislative actions in the future (particularly the near future) he would likely receive further contributions, how does this instruction distinguish the contribution found to be illegal here from a perfectly legitimate contribution? No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>politician who knows the identity and business interests of his campaign contributors is ever completely devoid of knowledge as to the inspiration behind the donation. There must be more specific knowledge of a definite official act for which the contributor intends to compensate before an official\u2019s action crosses the line between guilt and innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4O\">506 F.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We must therefore conclude that appellants have taken <em>Brewster </em>entirely out of context in suggesting that it was insufficient for ECI merely to seek or reward \u201clenient treatment\u201d from Judge Campbell. However difficult it may appear for juries to distinguish illegal gratuities from legitimate campaign contributions to elected officials, no similar problems attend deciding whether a judge has accepted gifts \u201cwith knowledge that the donor was paying him compensation for an official act.\u201d <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>408 U.S. 501, 527, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 2545, 33 L.Ed.2d 507 (1972).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It was more than sufficient in this case for the trial court to require that the alleged gratuities be given and received \u201cknowingly and willingly,\u201d and \u201cfor or because of an official act.\u201d In the context of the trial, and in light of the failure of defense counsel to seek a more specific instruction, we have no doubt that the jury had a clear understanding of the distinctions among bribery, illegal gratuities, and innocence. This was everything that <em>Brewster </em>requires.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">D. <em>Jury Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Following the return of the jury\u2019s verdict, one of the jurors contacted the trial court\u2019s chambers and asked to speak with him concerning her jury service. A transcript of their meeting was subsequently made available to all counsel; pertinent portions are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The parties draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>different conclusions from these remarks. The government views the \u201cmajor concern\u201d of this juror as whether \u201cher intransigence had swayed other jurors, who apparently had initially voted to convict on some or all of the counts, to abandon their convictions and yield to her.\u201d Government Brief at 98 n.48. The defendants conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was not unanimous, because this juror voted contrary to her own beliefs in order to facilitate a unanimous verdict. They urge that the verdict be set aside, or at least that the case be remanded for specific inquiry with counsel present pursuant to District Court Local Rule l-28(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Only in extraordinary circumstances do courts inquire into the deliberative process of juries, and this is not such a case. Ordinarily, a verdict will not be upset on the basis of a juror\u2019s post-trial report of what occurred in the course of deliberations. <em>See, e.g., McDonald v. Pless, </em>238 U.S. 264, 267, 35 S.Ct. 783, 784, 59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915); Fed.R.Evid. 606(b); cf. <em>Jorgensen v. York Ice Machinery Corp., </em>160 F.2d 432 (2d Cir. 1947). The single exception concerns \u201cextraneous influences\u201d that may have improperly influenced the verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cExtraneous influence\u201d has been construed to cover publicity received and discussed in the jury room, consideration by the jury of evidence not admitted in court, and communications or other contact between jurors and third persons, including contacts with the trial judge outside the presence of defendant and his counsel. By contrast, evidence of discussions among jurors, intimidation or harassment of one juror by another, and other intra-jury influences on the verdict is within the rule, rather than the exception, and is not competent to impeach a verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-14\"><em>United States v. Wilson, </em>534 F.2d 375, 378-79 (D.C.Cir.1976) (quoting <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Gereau, </em>523 F.2d 140, 149-50 (3d Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 917, 96 S.Ct. 1119, 47 L.Ed.2d 323 (1976)). When confronted with allegations of irregularity in the jury\u2019s proceedings, the trial judge has broad discretion \u201cto determine what manner of hearing, if any, is warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>534 F.2d at 379; <em>see United States v. Parker, </em>549 F.2d 998, 1000 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">The reasons for the distinction between \u201cextraneous\u201d and \u201cintra-jury\u201d influences on the verdict are self-evident. Outside pressures may distort the jury\u2019s deliberation to the point that its verdict results in injustice. In contrast, the give-and-take within this microcosm of the community leads to a verdict that is often the only way our legal system can define what it means by \u201cjustice.\u201d Inevitably, compromise verdicts and verdicts rendered out of compassion may result. <em>See, e.g., Standefer v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 22, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 2007, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980); <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 101, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2899, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 393-94, 52 S.Ct. 189, 190-91, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932). But these are not unacceptable, and the jury system itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>would be undermined if losing parties could so easily destroy the finality of the verdict. We have no doubt that the jury misconduct alleged in this case concerned only the discussion among the jurors and the way the jurors elected to make their decision. The trial court correctly determined that no further inquiry was required and the judge did not abuse his discretion in responding to these allegations as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">E. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The trial judge was explicit in stating his reasons for imposing the sentences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">This is not a simple case of a judge merely receiving help from a friend in moving household furnishings from one location to another. The evidence that the court heard revealed that this was just one incident in a pattern of corruption which had been going on for a number of years. Now, although the jury has acquitted the defendant on the other counts of the indictment, nevertheless in imposing sentence I may properly refer to the evidence introduced with respect to crimes of which the defendant was acquitted, and for the record I rely principally on the case of <em>United States v. Sweig </em>[454 F.2d 181] in making that statement. . .. In this case, there is evidence that ECI received favorable treatment in court from the defendant in the handling of overweight tickets in return for gifts. It was unrefuted evidence on one occasion, for instance, that defendant received over nine hundred dollars worth of free liquor from Jenkins. After considering the evidence in this case during this lengthy trial, I\u2019m convinced that Jenkins lied during some of his testimony in order to protect this defendant. And that the defendant was very fortunate to escape conviction on some of the more serious charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Sent. Tr. 37, 39. Appellants contend that the trial judge hereby failed to give proper effect to the jury\u2019s acquittals, and thus offended the constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy, deprivation of due process, and deprivation of trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">This is the first occasion for this court to consider the interplay between a jury\u2019s fact-finding function and the judge\u2019s sentencing discretion, although the problem has arisen in other circuits.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We find the issue difficult because two fundamental propositions are at war. On one hand, it is a \u201cfundamental sentencing principle\u201d that \u201c \u2018a judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 50, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2615, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972)). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3577 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence\u201d). Courts have held that a sentencing judge may consider evidence of crimes for which a defendant has been indicted but neither tried nor convicted, <em>e.g., United States v. Bowdach, </em>561 F.2d 1160, 1175 (5th Cir. 1977); evidence of counts in an indictment that has been dismissed by the government, <em>e.g., United States v. Marines, </em>535 F.2d 552, 554 (10th Cir. 1976); hearsay evidence, <em>e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Williams v. Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S.Ct. 421, 426, 3 L.Ed.2d 516 (1959); evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, <em>e.g., United States v. Lee, </em>540 F.2d 1205, 1210-11 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 894, 97 S.Ct. 255, 50 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976); and the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the government in an investigation of the conspiracy in which he was a confessed participant, <em>e.g., Roberts v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On the other hand, it is also fundamental that <em>some </em>limitation on the range of permissible sentencing considerations is required by the constitutional guarantee of due process. It is well established, for example, that a sentence is invalid if it is based upon \u201cimproper or inaccurate information.\u201d <em>Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 431 n.7, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 3047 n.7, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). <em>See, e.g., Townsend v. Burke, </em>334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948) (prohibiting consideration of false information); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972) (sentence may not be based upon prior convictions obtained in violation of the principles found in <em>Gideon v.

Appellants contend that a judicial finding of guilt on charges on which the jury returns a verdict of not guilty \u201cis as effective a denial of the right to a jury trial as if the judge had refused to empanel one in the first place.\u201d Brief for Appellant Campbell at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>United States v.

For all that appears in the record of the present case, the jury may have believed all such evidence to be true, but have found that some essential element of the charge was not proved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALR\"><em>Id. </em>at 184. Although this proposition is obvious, its strength has been undercut in recent years by the reaffirmation of the collateral estoppel principles that are mandated by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Almost a century ago, the Supreme Court ruled that after a defendant had been acquitted of evading taxes on distilled liquor, the government could not begin new proceedings to obtain the forfeiture of his distilling equipment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">It is urged as a reason for not allowing such effect to the judgment, that the acquittal in the criminal case may have taken place because of the rule requiring guilt to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that, on the same evidence, on the question of preponderance of proof, there might be a verdict for the United States, in the suit <em>in rem. </em>Nevertheless, the fact or act has been put in issue and determined against the United States</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-11\"><em>Coffey v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 436, 443, 6 S.Ct. 437, 440, 29 L.Ed. 684 (1886). <em>See Standlee v. Rhay, </em>403 F.Supp. 1247 (E.D. Wash.1975) (parole revocation barred by parolee\u2019s acquittal of criminal charges based on same offense said to require revocation, despite lower standard of proof in revocation proceedings). More recently, the Supreme Court held in <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977), that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a second criminal prosecution for a greater as well as a lesser offense. <em>See generally Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). As a result, we have explicitly held that evidence that has been the subject of a count of which defendants have been acquitted in an earlier trial is inadmissible in a second trial under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>426 F.2d 661 (D.C. Cir.1970); <em>United States v.

Hence, in a second trial the Government cannot introduce evidence with the aim of contradicting any ultimate fact concluded by that judgment. We are convinced that the ultimate facts upon which the Government relies to support its claim that Shef-fey is guilty of the offenses charged in the second trial are the same ultimate facts that the jury in the first trial found did not exist. Hence, to the extent that the Government seeks to use evidence introduced at the first trial to support a claim against Sheffey contrary to the facts essential to the judgment in that case, it is collaterally estopped from doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We therefore decline to pursue <em>Sweig </em>to its ultimate reading, because a judgment of acquittal is a more final and binding determination of facts than the requisite standard of proof might at first seem to allow. At the same time, <em>Sweig </em>is doubtless correct in recognizing that the trial judge can hardly avoid exposure to all the evidence that is presented during the course of a trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">In fact the kind of evidence here objected to may often be more reliable than the hearsay evidence to which the sentencing judge is clearly permitted to turn, since unlike hearsay, the evidence involved here was given under oath and was subject to cross-examination and the judge had the opportunity for personal observation of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">454 F.2d at 184. In this case, the government argues that \u201cthe trial court should not be required to sift from the totality of the evidence only those isolated facts bearing directly on the counts as to which the verdict of guilty was returned.\u201d Government Brief at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Perhaps no- single duty of a trial judge is more onerous and more unpleasant than sentencing. After years of study, it is still not possible to identify precisely the factors that go into this decision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, as the dissenting opinion noted in <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>problems of this sort are subject to appellate review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAe\">only because of the trial judge\u2019s laudable explication of his reasons for imposing the sentence in this ease; In many cases it would be impossible to discern whether a sentencing judge had been influenced by his belief [about the evidence], since there is no requirement that reasons be given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">438 U.S. at 55 n.l, 98 S.Ct. at 2618 n.l (Stewart, J., dissenting). We should not adopt an unrealistic view of the sentencing process that can only deter trial judges from articulating their reasons fully, because those reasons allow correction when the facts relied upon are indeed \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Judges ought not be reprimanded for acknowledging the impact of the evidence presented during the trial unless the weighing in of such evidence confounds a just result. Accordingly, when cases of this nature are heard on appeal, we should review the record to ensure that there is a persuasive basis for the conclusions reached by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Applying this standard, we perceive no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s sentence. The allegations concerning the liquor were eliminated from the third count of the indictment by the government, but only because this transaction fell outside the statute of limitations for bribery. Tr. 4-5. These charges remained in the conspiracy counts, and were the basis of \u201cunrefuted evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>Tr. 764-66, 934-36, 994-1005. Ordinarily, we would be less certain in assessing the trial court\u2019s judgment that \u201cJenkins lied during some of his testimony in order to protect this defendant,\u201d Sent. Tr. 39, because assessing witness credibility is a task that is primarily within the province of the jury and for which courts of appeal, relying only on the sterile record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>are particularly ill-suited. In Grayson, however, the Supreme Court specifically held that a sentencing judge could consider the defendant\u2019s false testimony observed by the court during the trial. 438 U.S. at 50-54, 98 S.Ct. at 2615-17. \u201cNo rule of law, even one garbed in constitutional terms, can prevent improper use of firsthand observations of perjury. The integrity of the judges, and their fidelity to their oaths of office, necessarily provide the only, and in our view adequate, assurance against that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 98 S.Ct. at 2617. Accordingly, we must affirm the trial court\u2019s approach to the arduous sentencing task in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We have discussed the appellants\u2019 arguments at some length because these arguments were all far from frivolous and because they stem from a lengthy and difficult trial challenging the capacity of the judicial system to judge a judge and his criminal co-conspirator fairly. The distinction between bribery and illegal gratuities can be subtle, and we emphasize again the importance of clearly drawing this distinction in jury instructions. <em>See Brewster, </em>506 F.2d at 68. Allegations of jury misconduct and improper sentencing must be considered grave, because either activity undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system. While we need not agree with the broad statements in <em>Sweig, </em>we find nothing improper in the trial court\u2019s sentencing here, and the jury\u2019s behavior in this case was not the sort that justifies overturning a verdict. It is always possible after a lengthy trial to allege that certain evidence was improperly admitted and that certain jury instructions were erroneous, but these claims lose a great deal of their force when counsel was not moved to object at the relevant time. \u201cIt is a commonplace in the administration of criminal justice that the actualities of a long trial are too often given a meretricious appearance on appeal; the perspective of the living trial is lost in the search for error in a dead record.\u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 88, 62 S.Ct. 457, 473, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Finally, we agree with the trial court that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could return its verdict of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We believe that justice has served Judge Campbell better than he served it. He and his co-conspirator have no legal cause for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">.

The superseding indictment, which was returned in September 1980, amended the third count by deleting a year from the alleged duration of the bribery scheme and by withdrawing the allegations as to the cases of liquor. In a bill of particulars filed in November 1980, the government abandoned the charges as to the topsoil and garden cultivator, and listed only nine instances of cash payments. After the jury had been selected, the government discovered documents questioning whether three of these payments could have gone to Judge Campbell, and withdrew these allegations. The trial court denied the prosecution\u2019s request that the withdrawal of these charges be kept from the jury, Tr. 76, observing that the government had been \u201cnegligent\u201d at best in meeting its \u201cresponsibility to return indictments which accurately charge people with offenses.\u201d Tr. 59.

The trial court adopted the defense position on March 12. Tr. 6205.

Finally, although Jenkins could not remember whether Judge Campbell had asked him for help during the move, Tr. 1501, Jenkins testified that the subject came up while Jenkins was at Judge Campbell\u2019s house, Tr. 934, and that it was not unusual for Judge Campbell to telephone when he needed cash or other services.

If a witness testifies that he no longer remembers the facts but does remember making a statement about those facts, the defense is deprived of effective cross-examination if such an out-of-court statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. Accordingly, the use of such statements are tightly circumscribed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 801(d)(1) provides that an out-of-court statement of the witness is not hearsay (and therefore is admissible) only if it was inconsistent with the witness\u2019s present testimony and if it was made at an earlier proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>under oath and subject to a penalty for perjury. Jenkin\u2019s comments during his interview with the prosecutors did not meet several of these requirements. <em>See California v.

It is not even clear which \u201cacts\u201d of Robert Campbell could have been the basis for ECI gratuities prior to 1973, because \u201csympathy to trucking interests\u201d does not constitute an official act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b225-14\">.

Did you just want to talk to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Juror: I just wanted to let you know that I had this uneasiness about \u2014 I felt that I had swayed eleven people maybe in the wrong direction because they should have been able to deliberate more and more and more, and come up with \u2014 but they didn\u2019t seem to want to do that. They wanted to go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">The court: You suggested there be a consensus taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">Juror: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">The court: If the consensus would be guilty or not guilty, you would go along with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">Juror: I did.

We agree with the trial court that the jury\u2019s performance of its functions was not unlawful. The group dynamics of a jury at work may not be a model for high school civics books, but the jury remains the best system yet devised for deciding disputed issues of fact in our system of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">. The question usually concerns whether the sentencing judge may consider a defendant\u2019s acquittal in a <em>prior </em>trial, rather than the evidence introduced in the same trial going to counts on which the defendant is acquitted. <em>See, e.g., Drayton v. New York, </em>556 F.2d 644, 646 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 958, 98 S.Ct. 488, 54 L.Ed.2d 317 (1977); <em>United States v. Marines, </em>535 F.2d 552, 554 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Bowdach, </em>561 F.2d 1160, 1175 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Haygood, </em>502 F.2d 166, 171-72 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1114, 95 S.Ct. 791, 42 L.Ed.2d 812 (1975); <em>United States v. Atkins, </em>480 F.2d 1223, 1224 (9th Cir. 1973). The cases uniformly allow consideration of prior acquittals, although the effect of this consideration is not always clear. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, </em>595 F.2d 1134, 1137 (9th Cir. 1979) (\u201cit is just as reasonable to assume that [the trial court\u2019s] consideration of the acquittal resulted in his imposing the relatively light sentence of two years, as it is to assume ... that his sentence was \u2018enhanced\u2019 because of the prior acquittal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">. <em>See generally </em>A.
