Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"ApH\">A. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">Beginning in 1941, Henry J. Wilson was steadily employed as an insulation worker at various construction sites in the metropolitan Washington, D. C. area. As an inte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>gral element of this employment, Wilson regularly handled and was otherwise exposed to asbestos and asbestos products.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On February 14, 1973, Wilson was x-rayed as part of his local union\u2019s routine program instituted to determine which workers, if any, had contracted asbestosis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Evaluation of these x-rays revealed that Wilson was indeed suffering from \u201cmild asbestosis.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following his receipt of this diagnosis,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wilson began a new job, still in the insulation trade, but involving little, if any, exposure to asbestos.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Subsequent to 1973, Wilson\u2019s health rapidly deteriorated. He suffered two heart attacks in June 1974 and a collapsed lung in February 1975, and was hospitalized on each occasion. Because of these episodes and on the advice of his physician, Wilson retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Complaining of sharp pains in his chest, Wilson was again hospitalized in February 1978. On this occasion, Wilson was diagnosed as having mesothelioma, a cancer of the mesothelial cells<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with a poor prognosis for recovery. Wilson died on May 17,1978.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">B. <em>The District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">On May 16, 1979, just short of one year after Wilson\u2019s death, his widow, Blannie S. Wilson (\u201cAppellant\u201d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> instituted the instant diversity action. Named as defendants (collectively \u201cJohns-Manville\u201d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were designers, manufacturers, and distributors of as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>bestos and asbestos products, which, allegedly, Wilson frequently used, installed, removed, or otherwise encountered. Proceeding under the District of Columbia\u2019s<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Survival<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Wrongful Death<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> statutes, Appellant asserted that Johns-Manville\u2019s actions were the direct and proximate cause of her husband\u2019s pulmonary illnesses and death. Various theories of product liability, incl\u00fcding negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, and strict liability in tort, formed the basis of Appellant\u2019s claim for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">After extensive discovery by the parties, Johns-Manville moved for summary judgment on both statutory counts. Johns-Man-ville asserted that Henry Wilson had one, and only one, indivisible cause of action for all past, present, and future injuries resulting from his exposure to asbestos products. This cause of action, Johns-Manville claimed, accrued, at the latest, when Wilson first knew or should have known that he was suffering from any asbestos-related disease, <em>i.e., </em>in February 1973, when Wilson was diagnosed as suffering from asbestosis. Therefore, Johns-Manville concluded, the applicable three-year statute of limitations<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> barred the 1979 Survival action. Furthermore, Johns-Manville argued, Appellant\u2019s Wrongful Death action was also time-barred; as a wholly derivative claim, Johns-Manville maintained, a Wrongful Death action may not proceed unless the decedent at the time of his death could have initiated a timely action for personal injuries had he lived.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Without a written opinion or memorandum explanation,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but apparently with some insecurity,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the district court granted Johns-Manville\u2019s motion and dismissed Appellant\u2019s complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The applicable statute of limitations, D.C. Code \u00a7 12-301(8),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> provides that a Survival claim \u201cmay not be brought after [3 years] from the time the right to maintain the action accrues.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Survival claim, therefore, is timely only if Henry Wilson had a right of action which \u201caccrued\u201d after May 17, 1976.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">A. <em>The Discovery Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The accrual date of a claim for relief based on a disease with a long incubation period, such as asbestosis or mesothelioma,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is an issue on which judicial opinion is in flux. Some courts adhere to the traditional view that \u201c \u2018the cause of action accrues at the time of invasion of [plaintiff\u2019s] body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steinhardt v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>54 N.Y.2d 1008, 1010, 430 N.E.2d 1297, 1299, 446 N.Y.S.2d 244, 246 (1981) (quoting <em>Thornton v. Roosevelt Hospital, </em>47 N.Y.2d 780, 781, 391 N.E.2d 1002, 1003, 417 N.Y. S.2d 920, 921 (1979)).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Other courts<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> employ the \u201cdiscovery\u201d rule under which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u201ccause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows or through the exercise of due diligence should have known of the injury.\u201d <em>See Burns v. Bell, </em>409 A.2d 614, 617 (D.C. App.1979).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Johns-Manville points out that to date \u201cthe District of Columbia Court of Appeals has not extended the \u2018discovery\u2019 rule to cases beyond the area of professional malpractice.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We are persuaded, however, that, if faced with the issue, the District of Columbia courts would apply the discovery rule to latent disease cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In <em>Burns, </em>the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the discovery rule applies to <em>all </em>medical malpractice claims. 409 A.2d at 617.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Nothing in the court\u2019s opinion implies that the rule should be limited to claims for relief alleging professional malpractice.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> To the contrary, the court indicated that malpractice cases are merely examples of tort claims in which the fact of injury may not be readily discernible.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">With respect to an injury that was not immediately apparent, the <em>Burns </em>court characterized the \u201ctime of the act\u201d rule as \u201cunduly harsh,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 616, and the discovery rule as \u201cjust and equitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">We note too that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in analogous cases, has followed the trend of decisions away from traditional judge-made rules that operate harshly or are not suited to changed conditions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In latent disease cases the trend is clearly toward application of the discovery rule.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Further, federal district judges, called upon to apply District of Columbia law in diversity suits, have employed the discovery rule in latent injury cases. <em>Fear-son v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>525 F.Supp. 671, 674 (D.D.C.1981); <em>Grigsby v. Sterling Drug, Inc., </em>428 F.Supp. 242, 243 (D.D.C.1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>543 F.2d 417 (D.C. Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Finally, we believe the discovery rule is \u25a0sensibly based.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Courts have long recognized that \u201c[the] policy of repose, designed to protect defendants, is frequently outweighed ... where the interests of justice require vindication of the plaintiffs rights.\u201d <em>Burnett v. New York Central Railroad, </em>380 U.S. 424, 428, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 1054, 13 L.Ed.2d 941 (1965). Latent disease claims fit comfortably within this generalization. As Justice Rutledge observed, application of the invasion-of-the-body rule to such cases, which involve \u201cunknown and inherently unknowable\u201d harm, would provide the injured party with only a \u201cdelusive\u201d remedy. <em>Urie v. Thompson, </em>337 U.S. 163, 169, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 1024, 93 L.Ed. 1282 (1949). <em>See also Ricciuti v. Voltarc Tubes, Inc., </em>277 F.2d 809, 813 (2d Cir. 1960) (time-of-the-act rule \u201cwould nullify any right to recover for many serious but slowly and insidiously developing diseases\u201d); <em>Harig, </em>284 Md. at 80, 394 A.2d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Johns-Manville principally argues, however, that even if the discovery rule is applicable to the instant case, Appellant\u2019s claim is nonetheless barred by the three-year limitations period. Henry Wilson, Johns-Man-ville urg\u00e9s most strenuously, had only one indivisible cause of action for asbestos-related injuries and that cause of action accrued five years before he \u201cdiscovered\u201d that he had cancer; it accrued in 1973 when Wilson \u201cdiscovered\u201d he was suffering from \u201cmild asbestosis.\u201d We now turn to that central contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">B. <em>Distinct Illnesses as Separate Causes of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Johns-Manville focuses on the alleged wrongful conduct and asserts that once some harm is apparent, a claim accrues not only for harm then manifest, but for all harm that may eventuate in the future as a result of the same conduct. Johns-Man-ville\u2019s theory is that Henry Wilson\u2019s claim ripened no later than February 1973 when he was diagnosed as having \u201cmild asbestosis.\u201d Within three years of that diagnosis, Johns-Manville reasons, Wilson could have instituted a personal injury action seeking damages, not only for asbestosis, but for consequences that might develop later, including separate and distinct illnesses such as mesothelioma<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or another form of cancer. Had Wilson sued between 1973 and 1976, and then attempted to return to court after the February 1978 malignant me-sothelioma diagnosis, he would have been blocked, Johns-Manville asserts, by the well-established rule that a claim or cause of action may not be split. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 24-26 (1982). It follows, Johns-Manville concludes, that Wilson\u2019s mesothelioma claim is similarly barred when, as occurred here, he simply sat on his right to sue and did not institute any tort action between February 1973 and February 1976. In essence, Johns-Manville argues, Wilson did not have the option to waive tort recovery for asbestosis, and sue for a lethal cancer if and when such a condition developed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Preliminarily, we note that we need not and do not decide whether Johns-Manville\u2019s initial premise is correct, <em>i.e., </em>whether judgment on a claim for asbestosis pursued between 1973 and 1976 would have precluded a subsequent claim based on the 1978 me-sothelioma diagnosis.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It suffices to point out that res judicata (claim preclusion) doctrine and policy would control the decision of that question. But the issue before us is not properly decided under the law govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ing judgments. Rules of res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) concern the preclusive effects of <em>former adjudication. </em>Here, there has been no former adjudication, no prior action resulting in. a judgment to be given effect in a subsequent action. In shaping its position largely on the basis of decisions concerning limitations on the opportunity <em>in a second action </em>to litigate claims that were litigated, or could have been litigated, in a prior action,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Johns-Manville has misdirected its attention and argument. This case requires us to focus, not on judgments and their preclusive effects, but on statutes of limita-</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">tions and the policies they implicate in personal injury actions.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We therefore consider below the appropriate delineation of the claim or cause of action in suit in the relevant context.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u201cStatutes of limitation find their justification in necessity and convenience rather than in logic. They represent expedients, rather than principles.\u201d <em>Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, </em>325 U.S. 304, 314, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 89 L.Ed. 1628 (1945).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Two considerations, particularly, motivate legislation placing time limitations on the commencement of litigation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>which may be designated <em>evidentiary, </em>relates to \u201cthe search for truth [which] may be seriously impaired by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, fading memories, disappearance of documents, or otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The second, <em>repose, </em>concerns the potential defendant\u2019s interests in security against stale claims and in planning for the future without the uncertainty inherent in potential liability<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In the case at hand, these considerations pull in opposite directions. Repose, beyond question, is best served by Johns-Manville\u2019s broad definition of the \u201ccause of action\u201d at stake. But in situations involving the risk of manifestation of a latent disease, unlike the mine run of litigation, the evidentiary consideration counsels narrower delineation of the dimensions of a claim. Key issues to be litigated in a latent disease case are the existence of the disease, its proximate cause, and the resultant damage. Evidence relating to these issues tends to develop, rather than disappear, as time passes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Looking beyond repose and evidentiary considerations, we take into account the interests generally involved in personal injury and death cases: plaintiff\u2019s in obtaining at least adequate compensation, defendant\u2019s in paying no more than that. Integrating these two, the community seeks to advance, through the system of adjudication, relief that will sufficiently, but not excessively, compensate persons for injuries occasioned by the tortious acts of others. In latent disease cases, this community interest would be significantly undermined by a judge-made rule that upon manifestation of any harm, the injured party must then, if ever, sue for all harms the same exposure may (or may not) occasion some time in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The traditional American rule,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> adopted in the District of Columbia<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> is that recovery of damages based on future consequences may be had only if such. consequences are \u201creasonably certain.\u201d \\Recovery of damages for speculative or conjectural future consequences is not permitted. To meet the \u201creasonably certain\u201d standard, courts have generally required plaintiffs to prove that it is more likely than not (a greater than 50% chance) that the projected consequence will occur. If such proof is made, the alleged future effect may be treated as certain to happen and the injured party may be awarded full compensation for it; if the proof does not establish a greater than 50% chance, the injured party\u2019s award must be limited to damages for harm already manifest.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>In view of the \u201creasonably certain\u201d standard, it appears that Johns-Manville is urging for cases of this sort (in which cancer is diagnosed years after asbestosis becomes manifest) more than a time-bar; it is urging, in essence, that there can <em>never </em>be a recovery for cancer unless (1) a lawsuit is filed within three years of the asbestosis diagnosis, and (2) cancer becomes manifest during the course of that lawsuit. For it is altogether likely that had Wilson, upon receiving the \u201cmild asbestosis\u201d diagnosis, sought to recover for a cancer which might (or might not) develop, Johns-Manville would have argued forcibly that the probability of such a development was far less than 50%, and was therefore too speculative, conjectural, uncertain to support a damage award.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Concern for judicial economy also influences our decision. Upon diagnosis of an initial illness, such as asbestosis, the injured party may not need or desire judicial relief. Other sources, such as workers\u2019 compensation or private insurance, may provide adequate recompense for the initial ailment. If no further disease ensues, the injured party would have no cause to litigate. However, if such a person is told that another, more serious disease may manifest itself later on, and that a remedy in court will be barred unless an anticipatory action is filed currently, there will be a powerful incentive to go to court, for the consequence of a wait-and-see approach to the commencement of litigation may be too severe to risk. Moreover, a plaintiff\u2019s representative in such a case may be motivated to protract and delay once in court so that the full story of his client\u2019s condition will be known before the case is set for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">| Our consideration of this appeal persuades us that a model or rule acceptable for more common personal injury actions may not be appropriate in latent disease cases.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>. With respect to the statute of limitations issue before us, we conclude that a potential defendant\u2019s interest in repose is counterbalanced and outweighed by other factors, (including evidentiary considerations, securing fair compensation for. serious harm, and deterring uneconomical anticipatory lawsuits. We therefore hold that the diagnosis of,\u201cmild asbestosis\u2019' received by Henry Wilson in February 1973 did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>start the clock on his right to sue for the separate and distinct disease, mesothelioma, attributable to the same asbestos exposure, but not manifest until February 1978. Blannie Wilson\u2019s action, we decide, to the extent that it seeks recovery based on me-sothelioma, from which her husband suffered and died, was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">For the reasons stated, we hold that Appellant\u2019s Survival and Wrongful Death action was timely.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment order dismissing the complaint and remand this ease for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">. It has been estimated that new asbestos cases are being filed \u00e1t a rate of 450 a month and that 16,000 such cases are currently pending. Wall St. J., June 14, 1982, at 1, col. 6. Responding, <em>inter alia, </em>to the estimate that 1.6 million workers will die from an asbestos-related disease, <em>see </em>127 Cong.Rec. S10033 (daily ed. Sept. 18, 1981) (statement of Sen.

An acute myocardial infarct was found at autopsy; however, there was no evidence to indicate that this latter lesion was the immediate cause of death. The primary disease process suffered by this patient was a malignant mesothelioma originating in the right pleural space. The etiologic relationship between excessive asbestos exposure and the development of malignant me-sothelioma is well established and accepted in the medical literature. In this particular patient, asbestos body (ferruginous body) counts from the left and right lungs were 1184 and 1120 asbestos bodies per five grams of tissue respectively. In a control study of individuals with no known history of sustained asbestos exposure, the asbestos count was less than 100 asbestos bodies per five grams of lung tissue. Therefore, it is my opinion that Mr. Wilson had a sustained heavy exposure to asbestos products and developed pulmonary asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma as a result of this exposure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">J.A. 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b189-19\">.

Although the district judge \u201c[found] the answer a very difficult one to arrive at,\u201d J.A. 25, he apparently believed that Wilson\u2019s exposure to asbestos gave rise to only one indivisible cause of action which accrued when asbestosis was diagnosed. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55.

White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 443-45, 378 A.2d 540, 544 (1977); <em>see also </em>King, <em>supra </em>note 42, at 1387; Cooper, <em>supra </em>note 42, at 195; Note, <em>Damages Contin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>gent Upon Chance, </em>18 Rutgers L.Rev. 875, 876 (1964). Recently, there has been some discussion of, and support for, a \u201csimple probability\u201d or \u201cpro rata\u201d approach. Such an approach would allow a percentage recovery equal to the injured party\u2019s chance of incurring the future harm. <em>See, e.g., Jordan v. Bero, </em>210 S.E.2d at 640-41 (Neely, J., concurring); J. Stein, <em>supra </em>note 42, \u00a7 106; King, <em>supra </em>note 42, at 1381\u2014 87. The \u201cpro rata\u201d approach is followed in England. <em>See </em>Cooper, <em>supra </em>note 42, at 196-97 (citing, <em>e.g., Davies v. Taylor, </em>[1971] W.L.R. 515, 525G, [1971] 3 All E.R. 1259, 1268c (C.A.)). Although the \u201cpro rata\u201d approach may insure that the wrongdoer pays the appropriate amount to the injured class as a whole, it does not eliminate the inequity among individual plaintiffs: plaintiffs who in fact sustain the future harm are undercompensated; those who escape it receive a windfall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. One study estimates that 15% of asbestosis sufferers later contract pleural mesothelioma and 12% contract peritoneal mesothelioma. <em>See </em>Selikoff, Churg &amp; Hammond, <em>Relation Between Exposure to Asbestos and Mesothelio-ma, </em>272 New Eng.J.Med. 560, 562 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Even in those instances where the likelihood of the later disease occurring is greater than 50%, the inequity of the reasonable certainty rule, as interpreted and applied by the courts, is not eliminated. Persons who contract the first, but not the second, disease will receive a windfall and, in the aggregate, the defendant will overcompensate the injured class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">. <em>Cf. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc., </em>633 F.2d at 1219 (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">In a nutshell, [Appellants] urge that we treat asbestosis the same as any other disease and that we not make any \u201cspecial rules\u201d for the cumulative disease situation which asbestosis presents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">We cannot agree. Cumulative disease cases <em>are </em>different from the ordinary accident or disease situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">We recall in this connection Justice Cardozo\u2019s counsel to common law judges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">There should be greater readiness to abandon an untenable position when the rule to be discarded may not reasonably be supposed to have determined the conduct of the litigants, and particularly when in its origin it was the product of institutions or conditions which have gained a new significance or development with the progress of the years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">B. Cardozo, <em>The Nature of the Judicial Process </em>151 (1921); <em>see generally id. </em>at 116-52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b197-18\">. Our determination that Appellant\u2019s Survival action is not time-barred renders it unnecessary to reach the question whether a Wrongful Death claim may be maintained despite a time-bar that would have precluded, at the time of the death, a claim for relief by the decedent had he lived. See <em>supra </em>note 15 and accompanying text. For the reasons we have stated, Henry Wilson, had he lived, could have instituted an action based on the February 1978 mesothelio-ma diagnosis within three years of that diagnosis. Therefore, his widow\u2019s May 1979 Wrongful Death action, brought within the discrete statutory requirement that such actions be commenced within one year after the death, D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2702 (1981), is unquestionably timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
