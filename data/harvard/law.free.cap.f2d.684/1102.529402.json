RUBIN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1180-21\">The scope of admiralty jurisdiction over suits arising from aircraft crashes has never been fully explored by this Circuit. These cases require us to consider the extent of that jurisdiction. If there is jurisdiction, some of the cases also involve the effect of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act on such suits. Finally, <em>one </em>case raises the question whether an aircraft is a \u201cvessel\u201d for Jones Act purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-22\">We first sketch briefly the facts in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-24\"><em>81-3522 Smith </em>v. <em>Pan Air Corp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-25\">Curtis C. Jordan was a pilot regularly engaged in flying a plane to transport passengers engaged in mineral exploration and development activity to and from locations in Louisiana and off its shores. Using a plane equipped to take off from either land or water, he departed from the New Orleans Lakefront Airport with two passengers, one of them to be taken to a Shell Oil Company mineral operation located in Louisiana near the mouth of the Mississippi River. It was not practicable, however, to reach Shell\u2019s site by land travel. Using water flotation equipment, Jordan landed in a canal adjacent to Shell\u2019s facilities. After the Shell-bound passenger disembarked, Jordan took off from the canal, and almost immediately encountered a fog bank. Trying to escape the fog, he came dangerously close to an antenna tower owned by Shell. Although Jordan succeeded in avoiding the tower, the plane struck a set of its supporting guy wires and crashed onto Louisiana soil, killing Jordan instantly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Invoking Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h), his widow and child seek damages in admiralty for his death from his employer, Pan Air, contending that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>plane was a \u201cvessel\u201d and that Jordan was a member of its crew, hence entitled to the benefits of the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 (1976). The plaintiffs also assert maritime tort claims for the alleged unseaworthiness of the plane. Finally, they invoke diversity jurisdiction to support claims against Pan Air for the alleged defective and unreasonably dangerous nature of the aircraft, and against Shell for \u201cgross negligence\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finding claims arising from the aircraft crash not to be within its maritime jurisdiction, the district court granted Pan Air\u2019s motion to dismiss all \u201cadmiralty claims\u201d against it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his opinion, the judge also concluded that Jordan was not a Jones Act seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">\n<em>81-3675 Kolb v. Texaco, Inc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">\n<em>81-3638 Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. v. Pool Co.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Walter Kolb was a helicopter pilot regularly engaged in transporting workers and equipment from the Louisiana mainland to and between drilling rigs and platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico. He was assigned to transport a passenger to work on a fixed platform located on the outer Continental Shelf, owned by Texaco, whose well was being \u201cworked over\u201d by Pool Company. A crane owned by Texaco was situated on the platform; its crane arm extended over the Gulf, and a crane ball hung from the crane arm. After landing on the helipad and discharging the passenger, Kolb took off from the platform. As he departed, the helicopter\u2019s main rotor blade struck the crane ball, causing the helicopter to crash into the Gulf. Mrs. Kolb sued Texaco and the other company engaged in work on the platform in admiralty for damages sustained as a result of her husband\u2019s death; Petroleum Helicopters sought recovery, also in admiralty, for the loss of its aircraft. Mrs. Kolb has abandoned any claim under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331-1356 (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979) (OCSLA), that would be determined by the application of Louisiana law. Petroleum Helicopters invokes diversity as well as admiralty jurisdiction. The district judge dismissed both claims, insofar as they invoked admiralty jurisdiction, for want of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">In 1813, Justice Story, on Circuit, stated that \u201c[i]n regard to torts ... the jurisdiction of the admiralty is exclusively dependent upon the locality of the act.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The federal courts, therefore, defined the scope of maritime jurisdiction over tort claims solely by reference to locality until the Supreme Court reset the compass, at least with regard to claims arising out of aircraft crashes, in 1972. In <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, </em>409 U.S. 249, 93 S.Ct. 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 454 (1972), the Court first considered whether the principles formulated a century and a half earlier for those who go down to the sea in ships apply to air transportation. We, therefore, examine that decision with care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-15\">Justice Stewart, writing for a unanimous court, spelled out the holding of <em>Executive Jet </em>in concluding the opinion: \u201cin the absence of <em>legislation to the contrary, </em>there is no federal admiralty jurisdiction over aviation tort claims arising from flights by <em>land-based aircraft between points within the continental United States.\u201d Id. </em>at 274, 93 S.Ct. at 507, 34 L.Ed.2d at 471 (emphasis added). This holding does not directly dispose of any of the claims under review here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>but its underlying rationale is crucial and the quoted language suggests three of the questions we must consider: (1) What is \u201clegislation to the contrary\u201d? (2) What is the meaning of the restrictive adjectival phrase, \u201cland-based aircraft\u201d? (3) Does jurisdiction extend to flights that are to or from points outside the continental land mass?</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">A. The <em>Smith </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"AUUQ\">At the outset, we note that the <em>Smith </em>claim comes closest of those under review to falling directly under <em>Executive </em>Jet\u2019s holding. No assertion has been made that \u201clegislation to the contrary\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> exists to bring the <em>Smith </em>plaintiffs\u2019 claim within the admiralty jurisdiction. Furthermore, the flight that crashed was apparently \u201cbetween points within the continental United States.\u201d? Therefore, if Jordan\u2019s aircraft were considered \u201cland-based,\u201d it is at least possible<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the district judge could have dismissed the Smiths\u2019 admiralty claims under the literal language of <em>Executive Jet </em>in its narrowest possible reading. For the purposes of this appeal, however, we assume that Jordan\u2019s seaplane, which was ca-' pable both of landing on and taking off from water in normal, nonemergency use, was not a \u201cland-based\u201d aircraft. Therefore, to decide this case, we go beyond <em>Executive Jet\u2019s </em>precise holding to its underlying rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Smith argues that admiralty jurisdiction extends to all claims having a functional relationship to maritime commerce, regardless of the locality of the tort. In <em>Executive Jet, </em>a jet aircraft struck a flock of seagulls during takeoff from a Cleveland, Ohio, airport and crashed into Lake Erie. The plaintiffs sought to maintain a suit in admiralty because the plane had crashed into navigable waters. The Supreme Court first discussed the serious difficulties with the traditional test for admiralty jurisdiction because of that test\u2019s focus solely on the locality of the accident. The Court noted the difficulty of applying that test in \u201cperverse and casuistic borderline situations;\u201d the virtual absurdity of applying the test, and the \u201cfull panoply of the substantive admiralty law,\u201d to injuries to swimmers at a public beach; and the inadvisability of turning jurisdiction on the fortuity that the aircraft finally hit land rather than navigable water, or <em>vice versa.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After considering observations by courts, commentators, and the American Law Institute and discussing congressional extension of admiralty jurisdiction to land structure injuries caused by vessels, the Court stated: \u201cin determining whether there is admiralty jurisdiction over a particular tort or class of torts, reliance on the relationship of the wrong to traditional maritime activity is often more sensible and more consonant with the purposes of maritime law than is a purely mechanical application of the locality test.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">Some commentators, suggesting deficiencies and inconsistencies in any test that relies on locality at all, read <em>Executive Jet </em>as commanding, or at least permitting, the determination of admiralty jurisdiction solely by the relationship of the \u201cwrong\u201d to traditional maritime activity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>that, for example, the traditional maritime remedy of maintenance and cure has always been extended to disabilities arising from injuries suffered on land; that the Admiralty Extension Act expands maritime jurisdiction to include damage to land structures caused by vessels on navigable waters; and that \u201cthe doctrine of unseaworthiness has been extended to permit a seaman or a longshoreman to recover from a ship owner for injuries sustained wholly on land, so long as those injuries were caused by defects in the ship or its gear.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">There are, however, patent difficulties in determining what kinds of \u201cwrong\u201d are related to traditional maritime activities. If we define the \u201cwrong\u201d as the negligent act, then it is difficult to see how defects in the design of an aircraft, faults in its manufacture or maintenance, or pilot error are maritime. Yet we, as well as other courts, have asserted admiralty jurisdiction over such claims.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Those who advocate a \u201crelationship of the wrong\u201d test really look not to the kind of wrong but to the nature of the activity in which the victim and his aircraft are engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">Moreover, nothing in <em>Executive Jet </em>indicates that the Court adopted such a functional test. Instead, the entire thrust of the opinion is that locality a <em>lone </em>cannot support jurisdiction over maritime torts and that something more is required. Thus, in reviewing commentary, the Court said, \u201ccommentators have actively criticized the rule of locality as the <em>sole </em>criterion for admiralty jurisdiction, and have recommended adoption of a maritime relationship requirement as well.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It continued, \u201cthis Court has never explicitly held that a maritime locality is the <em>sole </em>test of admiralty tort jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Then the Court quoted its opinion in <em>Atlantic Transport Co. v. Im-brovek, </em>234 U.S. 52, 34 S.Ct. 733, 58 L.Ed. 1208 (1914):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-10\">Even if it be assumed that the requirement as to locality in tort eases, <em>while </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number><em>indispensable, </em>is not necessarily exclusive, still in the present ease the wrong which was the subject of the suit was, we think, of a maritime nature and hence the District Court, from any point of view, had jurisdiction .... If <em>more </em>is required than the locality of the wrong in order to give the court jurisdiction, the relation of the wrong to maritime service, to navigation and to commerce on navigable waters, was quite sufficient.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">In short, the <em>Executive Jet </em>Court expressed concern about \u201cthe difficulties involved in trying to apply the locality rule as the <em>sole test </em>of admiralty tort jurisdiction,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> concluding that \u201cmaritime locality <em>alone </em>is not a sufficient predicate for admiralty jurisdiction in aviation tort cases.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court referred to the criterion it was rejecting as the <em>\u201clocality-alone </em>test,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and stated, \u201cthe mere fact that the alleged wrong \u2018occurs\u2019 or \u2018is located\u2019 on or over navigable waters \u2014 whatever that means in an aviation context \u2014 is not <em>of itself </em>sufficient to turn an airplane negligence case into a \u2018maritime tort.\u2019 It is far more consistent with the history and purpose of admiralty to require <em>also </em>that the wrong bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">After these cases were briefed and argued, the Supreme Court decided that admiralty jurisdiction extends to the collision of two pleasure boats on navigable waters. <em>Foremost Insurance Co. v. </em>Richardson, U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 2654, 2660, 73 L.Ed.2d 300 (1982), <em>aff\u2019g </em>641 F.2d 314 (5th Cir. 1981). Although it stated, \u201cthe <em>Executive Jet </em>requirement that the wrong have a significant connection with traditional maritime activity is not limited to the aviation context,\u201d - U.S. at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2658, the Court quoted our opinion in <em>Richardson </em>for the proposition that \u201cadmiralty, jurisdiction requires <em>more </em>than the occurrence of the tort on navigable waters \u2014 .. . <em>additionally </em>there must be a significant relationship between the wrong and traditional maritime activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 102 S.Ct. at 2657 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Richardson, </em>641 F.2d at 315). These comments in both <em>Executive Jet </em>and <em>Richardson </em>lead ineluctably to the conclusion that maritime locality is still an indispensable element of maritime jurisdiction, an interpretation we have already adopted. <em>See, e.g., Sohyde Drilling &amp; Marine Co. v. Coastal States Gas Producing Co., </em>644 F.2d 1132, 1135 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 635, 70 L.Ed.2d 615 (1981); <em>Moser v. Texas Trailer Corp., </em>623 F.2d 1006, 1009, <em>modified per curiam in other respects, </em>630 F.2d 249 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-16\">We conclude, therefore, that, because the <em>Smith </em>claim arose from the crash of an aircraft in an inland Louisiana marsh, the district court properly dismissed it for want of maritime jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-17\">B. The <em>Kolb </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-18\">We next turn to the death claim in <em>Kolb, </em>which arose out of a helicopter crash on the high seas over the outer Continental Shelf. In this case we consider the meaning of the Court\u2019s observation in <em>Executive Jet </em>that admiralty jurisdiction is not conferred in aviation cases absent \u201clegislation to the contrary.\u201d We conclude that the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Executive Jet, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 274, 93 S.Ct. at 507, 34 L.Ed.2d at 471, of \u201clegislation to the contrary\u201d and its illustration of such legislation by reference to the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 761-768 (West 1975 &amp; Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>1982) (DOHSA), indicate that the <em>Kolb </em>claim is within the admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">DOHSA, enacted in 1920 to overrule <em>The Harrisburg, </em>119 U.S. 199, 7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358 (1886), provides a cause of action for \u201cthe death of a person ... caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore[s] of ... the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While the Act says nothing about the jurisdiction of federal courts, the Court, with apparent approval, noted in <em>Executive Jet </em>that federal courts have repeatedly sustained maritime jurisdiction over such cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As the Court further noted, DOHSA has not been limited by its literal terms to wrongful acts on the high seas but extends to \u201ctorts ... with a maritime locality, in that the alleged negligence became operative while the aircraft was on or over navigable waters, and also with some relationship to maritime commerce, at least insofar as the aircraft was beyond state territorial waters and performing a function \u2014 transoceanic crossing \u2014 that previously would have been performed by waterborne vessels.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, the Court concluded on this point: \u201c[Ujnder the Death on the High Seas Act, a wrongful-death action arising out of an airplane crash on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of a State may clearly be brought in a federal admiralty court.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">The <em>Kolb </em>death claim, then, could ordinarily be asserted in admiralty simply by virtue of the fact that it arose from an aircraft crash \u201con the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of a State.\u201d But because Kolb\u2019s accident occurred on the outer Continental Shelf, we must determine the effect, if any, of the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331-1356 (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979) (OCSLA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">OCSLA makes the law of adjacent states, to the extent such law is not inconsistent with federal law, applicable as \u201csurrogate\u201d federal law to the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and to the platforms erected thereon.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In 1969, the Supreme Court decided, in <em>Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360 (1969), that accidents occurring on fixed platforms located on the outer Continental Shelf are governed by the OCSLA, which \u201cdeliberately eschewed the application of admiralty principles\u201d to platforms; that Act requires the application of state law. 395 U.S. at 355, 365-66, 89 S.Ct. at 1837, 1842, 23 L.Ed.2d at 369-70. While <em>Rodrigue </em>deals solely with the body of substantive law applicable to platform-related accidents, not with the jurisdiction of an admiralty court to entertain the action and to apply state law principles, the opinion appears to assume that admiralty jurisdiction entails the gover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>nance of admiralty substantive law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In reaching the conclusion that DOHSA did not apply, the Court repeatedly referred to accidents occurring \u201con\u201d fixed platforms,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and, indeed, most cases decided under the <em>Rodrigue </em>principle involve an accident which occurred, and an injury which was sustained, \u201con\u201d the platform.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In several cases, however, we have applied OCSLA and, consequently, state law, to incidents in which platform workers who were the victims of torts originating on these artificial islands were not actually injured or killed until they fell, jumped, or were pushed into the surrounding seas.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In each of these cases, the injured party was a platform worker and the original impact occurred on the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">We have applied OCSLA-dictated state law in only one case in which a platform worker was injured by a tort whose initial impact was not sustained on the platform. In <em>In re Dearborn Marine </em>Service, <em>Inc., </em>499 F.2d 263 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>423 U.S. 886, 96 S.Ct. 163, 46 L.Ed.2d 118 (1975), a platform worker, Monk, was on a \u201cstandby\u201d vessel tied up seventy-five feet from a platform when an explosion occurred on the platform. With the explosion, a \u201cflaming ball of oil\u201d rose above the platform. Carried by the wind, the ball of fire engulfed the standby vessel, killing all aboard. Monk\u2019s heirs sought to maintain a suit against the platform defendants for negligence under the DOHSA and general maritime law. The district court sustained admiralty jurisdiction over these claims. We reversed, concluding that \u201c\u00a7 1333(a)(2) of the [OCSLA], when read against the background of legislative history outlined in <em>Ro-drigue </em>and the increasing judicial and legislative dissatisfaction with strict locality as the sole test of jurisdiction, precludes us from treating Monk\u2019s claim against [the platform defendants] as a suit in admiralty.\u201d 499 F.2d at 276.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">Texaco and Pool argue that Kolb\u2019s claim against them is indistinguishable from Monk's claim against the platform defendants in <em>Dearborn, </em>in that in both cases, platform-based negligence had its first impact on the decedent on or over the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>seas and not on the platform. Although the two situations are alike in that regard, there is a critical difference between Monk\u2019s status as a \u201cplatform worker\u201d and Kolb\u2019s status as the pilot of an aircraft in navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">The basic thrust of the <em>Dearborn </em>opinion holding Monk limited to state law remedies (as against the platform defendants) is that Monk, as a platform worker, was only fortuitously on a vessel at the time of the explosion and that, otherwise, there was virtually nothing to distinguish between him and his fellow platform-workers who perished on the platform.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Kolb, by contrast, cannot be considered a \u201cplatform worker\u201d under any standard. Instead, his duties constantly carried him back and forth above the high seas over the outer Continental Shelf. Moreover, Kolb\u2019s death claim, considered apart from its relationship to the OCSLA,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> was clearly within admiralty jurisdiction. As we have already noted, the simple fact that Kolb\u2019s death occurred as a result of an aircraft crash into the high seas is alone enough to confer jurisdiction under the DOHSA. Even apart from this \u201cspecial treatment\u201d accorded airplane crash victims, there would still be admiralty jurisdiction over Kolb\u2019s accident, as we show below in regard to Petroleum Helicopters\u2019 property claim arising from this same accident. <em>See </em>Part IIC <em>infra. </em>In products liability cases, admiralty jurisdiction has repeatedly been extended to cases in which death or injury occurred on navigable waters even though the wrongful act occurred on land.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The place where the negligence or wrongful act occurs is not decisive. The place injury occurs and the function the injured person was performing at the time are more significant. In these respects, the <em>Kolb </em>claim is different from Monk\u2019s claim in <em>Dearborn </em>and similar to the claims of the vessel\u2019s captain and crew members in that case. Unlike both Monk and the workers considered in <em>Rodrigue, </em>the helicopter pilot was engaged in a maritime-type function, transporting persons over the seas.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>We hold, therefore, that admiralty jurisdiction over Kolb\u2019s claim against nonemployer third parties<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> is not ousted by section 1333(a) of the OCSLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">C. The Property Damage Claim</p>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-1\">Petroleum Helicopters\u2019 claim for property damage to its helicopter, sustained as a result of the same accident which claimed Kolb\u2019s life is patently not affected by DOH-SA. In <em>Executive Jet, </em>the Supreme Court left open the question of jurisdiction over a tort claim arising in the course of an aircraft\u2019s performance of a \u201cfunction traditionally performed by waterborne vessels.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It referred to situations in which such jurisdiction might be arguable: a plane flying from New York to London that crashed in mid-Atlantic<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and the mid-air collision of two aircraft used in spotting schools of fish resulting in the \u201ccrash of those aircraft <em>into </em>the Gulf of Mexico <em>within </em>one marine league of the Louisiana shore.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">The logic of <em>Executive Jet </em>appears to require extension of admiralty jurisdiction to nondeath claims arising on the high seas if the aircraft flight has the essential maritime nexus. Not only is the locality-plus criterion met, but judicial economy is also accomplished by submitting claims arising out of the same event to the same forum. While high seas injuries may occur without death, the <em>Kolb-Petroleum Helicopters </em>case is not atypical in that both death and property damage claims are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">The <em>Kolb-Petroleum Helicopters </em>crash had the necessary watery locality. As to the essential maritime nexus, we recently held, in <em>Ledoux v. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., </em>609 F.2d 824, 824 (5th Cir. 1980) (per curiam), that the \u201ccrash of [a] helicopter, while it [is] being used in place of a vessel to ferry personnel and supplies to and from offshore drilling structures, bears the type of significant relationship to traditional maritime activity which is necessary to invoke admiralty jurisdiction.\u201d Therefore, both the locality and maritime nexus requirements being met, we hold that the <em>Petroleum Helicopters </em>claim, like the <em>Kolb </em>death claim, may be brought in admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">As we have noted, admiralty jurisdiction for Jones Act purposes, as opposed to admiralty jurisdiction over claims asserted under the general maritime law, extends to injuries sustained on land. <em>See </em>note 12 <em>supra. </em>In the <em>Smith </em>case, claims were asserted under both the Jones Act and the general maritime law, and the district court, somewhat ambiguously, dismissed all \u201cadmiralty claims\u201d for want of subject matter jurisdiction. As we have already held, <em>see </em>Part IIA, <em>supra, </em>it was proper to dismiss the non-Jones Act admiralty claims because of the absence of a \u201cwatery locale.\u201d Because Jones Act claims may be asserted in admiralty even if the injury occurs on land, it would have been improper to dismiss them on the locality basis. As it appears, however, that the district court dismissed the Jones Act claims, not because of the absence of a maritime locality, but because it believed that Jordan was not a \u201cseaman,\u201d <em>see </em>Part I <em>supra, </em>we deem that \u201cdismissal\u201d as having been on the merits for failure to state a cause of action. Thus viewing the judgment, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Jordan\u2019s seaplane was not a \u201cvessel,\u201d and that, therefore, Jordan was not a \u201cseaman\u201d entitling his survivors to bring claims under the Jones Act.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>The Congress that enacted the Jones Act was concerned with overcoming the effects of <em>The Osceola, </em>189 U.S. 158, 23 S.Ct. 483, 47 L.Ed. 760 (1903), which had denied crew members the right to relief in admiralty for injuries arising from their employer\u2019s negligence, while recognizing the traditional unseaworthiness remedy. Congress, following the example of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60 (1976), enacted a tort remedy limited to members of the crew of a vessel instead of the traditional workers\u2019 compensation remedy. It can hardly be thought that, in 1920, Congress intended or believed that the term \u201cvessel\u201d included the primitive aircraft then in use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">We recognize, however, that statutes are not confined in application to contemporary instances and that their principles are to be extended to embrace new factual situations and new technological developments. We have, therefore, held that, for Jones Act purposes, the term \u201cvessel\u201d may include \u201cspecial purpose structures not usually employed as a means of transport by water, but designed to float on water,\u201d even though such structures were not conceived of until long after the Jones Act was adopted. <em>Offshore Co. v. Robison, </em>266 F.2d 769, 779 (5th Cir. 1959).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> While it cannot be gainsaid that a seaplane is \u201cdesigned to float on water,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it is clear that <em>Robison </em>and many cases following it<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> are concerned with \u201cspecial purpose structures\u201d employed by the offshore oil drilling industry that are designed to \u201cfloat\u201d and be towed across water to the drilling site despite, their incapacity for <em>self-propulsion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">The primary function of a seaplan\u00e9, by contrast, is transportation through air, not on water.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The perils of the air are great but they are different from the dangers of the sea, to which those who work on water are exposed. Thus, we do not find <em>Robi-son\u2019s </em>language, directed to another question, dispositive. Furthermore, when Congress has legislated with seaplanes in mind, it has distinguished them from \u201cvessels.\u201d For example, section 1509(a) of Title 49 of the United States Code incorporates a provision of its predecessor, the Air Commerce Act of 1926, to the effect that the navigation and shipping laws of the United States, including any definition of vessels, are not to be construed to apply to seaplanes or other aircraft. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1509(a) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">Virtually every court confronted with the question has decided that a seaplane is not a vessel, either under the Jones Act or in other contexts. For example, Judge Christian, in a thorough and well-reasoned opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>ion, decided in <em>Hubschman </em>that a seaplane is not a vessel for Jones Act purposes. 440 F.Supp. 828, 852 (D.V.I.1977). In <em>Wendorff v. State, </em>318 Mo. 363, 1 S.W.2d 99 (1977), the Missouri Supreme Court held that a seaplane was an aircraft, not a vessel, within the meaning of a life insurance policy clause excluding coverage for death occurring as the result of an airplane accident. Seaplanes have been held not to be vessels for purposes of the Limitation of Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181-196 (1976). <em>Noakes v. Imperial Airways, Ltd., </em>29 F.Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y.1939); <em>Dollins </em>v. <em>Pan-American Grace Airways, </em>27 F.Supp. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1939).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">An airplane flying through the ozone does not appear to be a vessel within the meaning of an act addressed to the relief of seamen. The definition is not altered by the fact that the plane is equipped with gear that enables it to begin and end an airborne trip on water.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that, in <em>Smith </em>the Jones Act claim was properly dismissed for its lack of merit. Jones was simply not a seaman or a member of the crew of a vessel.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">For the reasons given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-8\">(1) The dismissal of Mrs. Smith\u2019s suit for want of jurisdiction of the non-Jones Act admiralty claims is AFFIRMED. The dismissal of the Jones Act claim is treated as a dismissal on the merits and, as such, is AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-9\">(2) The dismissal of both Mrs. Kolb\u2019s and Petroleum Helicopters\u2019s claim for want of jurisdiction is REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-10\">(3) The Kolb and Petroleum Helicopters cases are REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">.

Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 diversity claims against Pan Air, as well as all claims against Shell, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra, </em>are still pending. The district judge\u2019s granting of Pan Air\u2019s motion to dismiss the admiralty claims is nevertheless an appeal-able order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3). Of course, to the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Shell is grounded in admiralty, our reasoning with regard to the admiralty claims against Pan Air is equally applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1181-17\">.
