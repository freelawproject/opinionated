Because the interpretation at issue raised significant and undecided questions under the law of Puerto Rico, we certified two questions of law to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. (See Appendix.) <em>Gual Morales v. Hernandez Vega, </em>604 F.2d 730, 732-33 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Pan American Computer Corp. v. Data General Corp., </em>112 D.P.R__, 82 J.T.S. 78 (May 14, 1982). The Supreme Court has responded to our certification. It has determined that under the law of Puerto Rico a creditor need not exhaust other assets of a debtor\u2019s patrimony before attaching the debtor\u2019s participation in a civil partnership. <em>Torruella Serralles v. Credito e Inversiones de San Miguel, Inc., </em>112 D.P.R__, 82 J.T.S. 87 (May 27,1982). Consequently, we vacate that portion of the judgment of the district court of Puerto Rico of March 2, 1981, as amended on August 31, 1981, and September 30, 1981, which sustained the bankruptcy court when it set aside (on grounds of \u201cfailure to exhaust\u201d) the appellant\u2019s attachment of appellee\u2019s participation in the civil partnership \u201cSucesi\u00f3n Serralles.\u201d We remand this case to that court for further proceedings consistent with the law of Puerto Rico as enunciated in <em>Torruella Serralles v. Credito e Inversiones de San Miguel, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-23\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-24\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b246-25\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b246-26\">United States Court of Appeals For the First Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b246-27\">No. 81-1749</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>IN RE GUILLERMO TORRUELLA SERRALLES, ETC., DEBTOR,</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">CREDITO e INVERSIONES de SAN MIGUEL, INC., APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">CERTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">This case turns on a question of Puerto Rico law, as to which we have found no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, no authoritative decisions of other high courts dealing with similar provisions, nor any clear guidance in the relevant commentaries. Hence, on our own motion, we certify the question of law to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, pursuant to its Rule 27, 4 L.P.R.A. App. I-A, 422-24 (1978). <em>See Gual Morales v. Hernandez Vega, </em>604 F.2d 730, 732-33 (1st Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\n<em>Statement of Facts and the Legal Controversy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">In the course of civil proceedings in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, Cr\u00e9dito e Inversiones de San Miguel, Inc. (\u201cCr\u00e9dito\u201d) attached the participation of Guillermo Tor-ruella Serralles in the civil partnership \u201cSucesi\u00f3n Serralles.\u201d Whether or not one of Credito\u2019s claims subsequently made in federal court against the bankrupt, Torruel-la Serralles, is \u201csecured\u201d evidently depends upon the validity of that prior attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Both the bankruptcy court and the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico held that the attachment was invalid under Article 1590 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 4373. Invoking the commentaries of Prof. J. Puig Brutau on Article 1590, they concluded that a creditor cannot attach a debtor\u2019s participation in a civil partnership unless all other assets in the debtor\u2019s patrimony have been \u201cexhausted,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>there are no other assets sufficient to cover the debt. <em>See </em>J. Puig Brutau, <em>Fundamentos de derecho civil, </em>tome II, vol. 2, 430 (1956). The courts below also held that it is up to the creditor to establish the insufficiency of other assets before he will be allowed to attach the debtor\u2019s interest in a partnership. Since Cr\u00e9dito did not prove that, when it attached Torruella Serralles\u2019 participation in \u201cSucesi\u00f3n Serralles,\u201d there were insufficient other assets in the patrimony, the attachment was declared void and Credito\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy proceeding was viewed as \u201cunsecured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">The issues in this case touch upon basic areas of the Puerto Rico civil law of obligations, <em>see </em>J. Giron Tena, <em>Derecho de socie-dades, </em>tome I, 292 (1976), and important provisions regulating the dissolution of civil partnerships, <em>see, e.g., </em>Art. 1591(3), 31 L.P. R.A. \u00a7 4391(3); <em>cf. </em>A. Gullon Ballesteros, <em>Curso de derecho civil </em>\u2014 Contratos <em>en especial </em>352 (1968); J. Ma. Manresa y Navarro, <em>Commentarios al Codigo civil espa\u00f1ol, </em>tome XII, 345 (1931); J. Santamar\u00eda, <em>Comentar-ios al Codigo civil, </em>tome II, 723 (1958). For one thing, there seems to be some dispute among the commentators as to the existence of the \u201cexhaustion of assets\u201d rule recognized by the courts below. <em>Compare </em>J. Puig Brutau, <em>supra, with </em>J. Ponsa Gil, <em>So-ciedades civiles, mercantiles, cooperativas y de seguros, </em>vol. 1, 132 (2d ed. 1923). Foreign courts, whose opinions might otherwise be helpful, apparently have not had an opportunity to face the controversy. <em>See </em>M. Rodriguez Navarro, <em>Doctrina civil del Tribunal Supremo, </em>tome IV, 5426-29 (1951) (Spain); E. Menendez, <em>Codigo civil, </em>tome III, 138-40 (1959) (Cuba).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">For another thing, it is not clear to us whether or not the \u201cexhaustion of other assets\u201d rule \u2014 if it applies \u2014 requires the creditor to prove \u201cexhaustion\u201d or whether the rule should apply only as a defense raised by the debtor or his partners. While the courts below held that the creditor must prove that the rule\u2019s requirements are satisfied, we note Credito\u2019s argument that the debtor, not the creditor, is likely to have the necessary information, and we also note certain civil law analogies in support of Credito\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>Article 1731, 31 L.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>R.A. \u00a7 4893; <em>Polanco v. Goffinet, </em>33 P.R.R. 319 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Because we believe that the resolution of these questions about the exhaustion requirement will control the court\u2019s disposition of this case, we submit for certification to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico the following</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>Questions of Law:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">1. Is a creditor required by the relevant provisions of the Civil Code to exhaust all other assets of the debtor\u2019s patrimony before attaching and executing upon the debt- or\u2019s participation in a civil partnership?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">2. If so, must the creditor assert, or prove, satisfaction of this requirement before he can attach the partnership participation, or does the requirement simply make a defense available to the debtor or the other parties, should they choose to assert it? <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">By FRANK M.
