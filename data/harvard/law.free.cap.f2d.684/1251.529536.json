(\u201cSioux\u201d) and the cross-application of the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) for enforcement of the Board\u2019s decision and order reported at 257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 (1981). In that decision and order, the Board affirmed and adopted the findings of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that Sioux unlawfully interrogated employees about their union activities and threatened to eliminate profit sharing if the employees approved a union as their bargaining representative (alternatively promising to retain profit sharing and grant pay raises if the union was not so approved). The Board, in affirming the ALJ, also found that Sioux threatened to fire employees and create problems with immigration authorities if they supported the union. All these activities were held to be in violation of section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976). The Board also adopted the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sioux unlawfully reprimanded and discharged employee Julia Arroyo in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act. We conclude that substantial evidence on the whole record supports the Board\u2019s decision and order except with respect to alleged interrogation of certain union leaders in Sioux\u2019s plant, and we thus enforce the Board\u2019s order as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">I. <em>Section 8(a)(1) Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"aff-dedup-1\">Sioux produces various injection molded plastic parts at its suburban Chicago plant, employing 110 workers \u2014 most of whom speak Spanish as their primary or only language \u2014 during the times relevant here. A majority of these employees voted in favor of representation by the Production Workers Union of Chicago, Local 707, at an election held on February 1,1980.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The various alleged section 8(a)(1) violations forming the basis of the Board\u2019s action in this case occurred during the union representation campaign which preceded the February 1 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">Before considering the specific incidents involved in the alleged section 8(a)(1) violations, we note that the Board\u2019s findings on factual questions, if supported by substantial evidence on the whole record, are conclusive on appeal. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1976); <em>see Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Several recent decisions of this court have further explicated that standard when factual questions are resolved by the ALJ (and the ALJ\u2019s findings are accepted by the Board) relying in part on credibility determinations based upon witness demeanor. \u201cTo the extent that the ALJ\u2019s decision rests explicitly on his evaluations of demeanor, we are required to weigh those particular findings more heavily.\u201d <em>Kopack v. NLRB, </em>668 F.2d 946, 954 (7th Cir. 1982); <em>accord Consolidation Coal Co. v. NLRB, </em>669 F.2d 482, 487-88 (7th Cir. 1982). In this case, several of the ALJ\u2019s crucial factual findings were premised upon his demeanor-based assessment of the credibility of opposing witnesses who presented differing accounts of the same events.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have carefully reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>all of the ALJ\u2019s findings in this case, but, in accord with our decisions in <em>Kopack </em>and <em>Consolidation Coal, </em>we have placed especial weight on those findings based upon the candor and demeanor of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">To establish a violation of section 8(a)(1), the Board must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s conduct might reasonably tend to interfere with the exercise by employees of rights protected under the Act. <em>See NLRB v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., </em>153 F.2d 811, 814 (7th Cir. 1946). With this standard to guide our analysis under section 8(a)(1), we turn to the facts of the instant case involving alleged violations under that section. In this endeavor, we should accept the Board\u2019s decision involving violations of the Act unless the evidence on the record as a whole indicates that the Board\u2019s decision is unjustified as either a fair interpretation of the evidence or as an informed exercise of the Board\u2019s judgment on matters within its area of general competence. <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">Employees Julia Arroyo and Hilda Reyes testified that on the day before the representation election, the employees were addressed in Spanish by Sioux\u2019s translators.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The translators told the employees that they would lose profit-sharing and other benefits if the union won the representation election, but that they would retain their profit sharing and receive increased benefits and better \u201ctreatment\u201d if the union lost the election. Employees Arroyo and Angelina Lopez also testified that their votes were solicited individually before the election by one of the translators, accompanied by the owner of Sioux, with the same pitch: you will lose your profit-sharing and other benefits if the union wins the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">Sioux does not argue \u2014 nor could it contend \u2014 that the employees\u2019 testimony, if true, fails to establish a violation of section 8(a)(1). Indeed, threats to take away benefits upon a union victory in a representation election constitutes precisely the type of conduct which is a demonstrable obstacle to the exercise by employees of the free choice guaranteed by sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of the Act. <em>See First Lakewood Associates </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>582 F.2d 416, 419-21 (7th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, Sioux asserts that the ALJ (and consequently, the Board) erred by accepting the testimony of Arroyo and Reyes, while rejecting the testimony of the company owner and one of the translators to the effect that, although profit-sharing was discussed with employees, there was no threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>to eliminate that benefit as a result of a union victory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">But the ALJ\u2019s appraisal cannot be upset on this basis. The ALJ carefully explained that Arroyo, Reyes and Lopez were more candid and straightforward in their testimony than Sioux\u2019s witnesses \u2014 and as we indicated above, this demeanor-based credibility determination is entitled to considerable weight. Moreover, the ALJ inferred from other facts that the testimony of the three employees more likely approached the truth than the contradictory testimony of Sioux\u2019s witnesses. For example, two of the employee witnesses (Reyes and Lopez) testified under subpoenas from the General Counsel; the ALJ noted that these witnesses, who were still employed by Sioux, did not \u201cappear[] anxious to testify on behalf of [the] General Counsel against Respondent [Sioux],\u201d and thus, their testimony was more believable. 257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 12. Sioux\u2019s translator, on the other hand, was originally hired to counter the union drive and the ALJ inferred from that fact that he probably testified in a manner consistent with the purpose for which he was employed; the company owner\u2019s testimony was unbelievable in part, according to the ALJ, because the owner did not speak Spanish and thus did not know precisely what the translator told the employees in Spanish. In such circumstances, we find no reason to fault the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact about the threats to take away benefits since these findings are, in our view, well supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">Several employees, including Marta Arroyo, Silvina Andrade, Angelina Lopez and Humberta Lopez, also testified that in various meetings with Sioux\u2019s management personnel and translators, they were threatened with loss of jobs, shorter working hours, strikes, and plant shutdowns if the union won the election. The employees further testified that they were told that those employees lacking proper immigration documents would be either fired or picked up by immigration authorities if the union won the election. Sioux cannot, of course, deny the illegality of such threats if they were indeed communicated to its employees. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) (employer coerced employees in violation of section 8(a)(1) by predicting adverse consequences, not based on objective facts beyond employer\u2019s unilateral control, upon unionization).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, Sioux again argues that the ALJ improperly accepted the employees\u2019 testimony and rejected the contradictory testimony of Sioux\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">We believe that the ALJ properly credited the testimony of employees Marta Arroyo, Angelina Lopez and Humberta Lopez and correctly found that the statements attributed to Sioux violated section 8(a)(1). Although the ALJ\u2019s determination here was not based upon demeanor evidence and thus is not entitled to exceptional weight under our <em>Consolidation Coal </em>decision, the ALJ nonetheless satisfactorily explained why he chose to believe some testimony and disbelieve other testimony, and we are unable to fault his determinations as lacking substantial evidentiary support. The ALJ accepted the testimony of Arroyo and the two Lo-pezes because Borgerson, whom the ALJ regarded as Sioux\u2019s most unbiased witness <em>(see </em>note 9, <em>infra), </em>testified inconsistently; Gibson, the personnel manager, was too closely tied to Sioux\u2019s interests in the case; and, translator Garza, a third potential witness, was not called by Sioux to refute the allegations made by Angelina and Humber-ta Lopez. In the absence of consistent, unbiased testimony to the contrary, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>ought not to disapprove the Board\u2019s acceptance of the ALJ\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">The final section 8(a)(1) violation alleged here involved interrogation by Sioux\u2019s translator, John Garza, of employees Eulo-gio Arroyo, Marta Arroyo and Julia Arroyo. The Arroyos testified that on separate occasions Garza asked each of them whether they planned to vote for the union. Eulo-gio Arroyo testified that Garza also asked him after the election whether he had actually voted for the union. Garza did not appear or testify at the hearing. In contrast to his otherwise detailed analysis of the facts and law on other matters, the ALJ here simply and cryptically concluded that the employees testified credibly that Garza did not refute their assertions and that Garza\u2019s actions therefore \u201cconstitute^] interrogation in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act.\u201d 257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 13 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">We disagree. Even if we accept as true the employees\u2019 testimony that Garza asked them whether they would vote, or had voted, for the union, we cannot find that these remarks reasonably tended to \u201cinterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in section 7 [of the Act].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976). Interrogation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of employees is not per se violative of the Act. \u201cTo fall within the ambit of \u00a7 8(a)(1), either the words themselves or the context in which they are used must suggest an element of coercion or interference.\u201d <em>Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>635 F.2d 1255, 1267 (7th Cir. 1980); <em>accord NLRB v. Berger Transfer &amp; Storage Co., </em>678 F.2d 679 (7th Cir. 1982). We must strain beyond a normal and realistic sense of the industrial scene to find that Garza\u2019s remarks \u201ccoerced\u201d these three employees in the exercise of their rights. At least two of the employees were ardent union supporters and were experienced in union representation campaigns. Neither the questioner\u2019s identity, nor the nature of the information sought, nor the method of questioning, nor the particular employee-employer relationships involved indicate that these employees tended to be coerced by these statements. Moreover, the ALJ cited no evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>tended to indicate that other employees may have overheard the alleged \u201cinterrogation\u201d and were thus indirectly coerced in the exercise of their rights. As in <em>Midwest Stock Exchange, supra, </em>we cannot find any threats, express or implied, in the brief and limited questions Garza put to the three Arroyos. <em>See </em>635 F.2d at 1268. We therefore deny enforcement of that part of the Board\u2019s order finding that Sioux unlawfully interrogated the Arroyos about their voting intentions or performance in violation of section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">II. <em>Section 8(a)(3) Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">The alleged section 8(a)(3) violations that are challenged by Sioux involve the issuance of disciplinary warnings to, and the discharge of, Julia Arroyo during February, 1980, shortly after the union election victory. Julia Arroyo actively supported the union during the representation drive and served as a union-appointed observer during the election. Although her disciplinary record for the five year period of her employment at Sioux preceding the election showed only two minor infractions, Arroyo\u2019s record after the election, according to witnesses called by Sioux, was replete with rules infractions and other misbehavior that ostensibly prompted Sioux to ultimately discharge her on February 28, one month after the election. Not surprisingly, Arroyo presented a different version of these post-election events. The ALJ carefully untangled a web of snarled testimony, concluding (with the help of an important credibility assessment of Sioux\u2019s employee-witness, Borgerson) that Julia Arroyo\u2019s discharge was prompted by her involvement in protected activities and was not justifiable as a response to charges of misconduct proffered by Sioux. We think that the ALJ correctly identified the motive for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">Before examining the facts surrounding Julia Arroyo\u2019s discharge, we note that the burdens of proof assigned, respectively, to Sioux and to the Board in a \u201cmixed motive\u201d section 8(a)(3) case like this were set out in our recent opinion in <em>Peavey Co. v. NLRB, </em>648 F.2d 460 (7th Cir. 1981), and are further explicated by the First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>NLRB v. Wright Line, Division of Wright Line, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 899 (1981), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 1612, 71 L.Ed.2d 1612 (1982). Under the <em>Peavey/Wright Line </em>standard, the Board, to establish a prima facie violation of section 8(a)(3), must first show that the employee\u2019s protected activities were a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s action affecting the terms and conditions of employment. The employer may rebut this prima facie showing with evidence indicating that the same action would have been taken even in the absence of the employee\u2019s protected activities. The Board, which always carries the ultimate burden of persuasion, must then establish that the discharge was motivated by the employee\u2019s protected activities, demonstrating, for example, that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is pretextual or could not support the action taken by the employer. But even when using this analysis, we note that a reviewing court is bound to a substantial evidence standard and may not reject, absent the most exceptional circumstances, properly supported findings of fact \u2014 especially findings derived from a demeanor-based evaluation of credibility made by the judge who heard the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">In this case, the evidence reveals that various conflicts over unionization arose among employees, even after the union\u2019s victory in the February 1 representation election. On February 5, Sioux\u2019s personnel manager, Carol Gibson, was told by employee Maricella Ramos (admittedly an opponent to the union) that Julia Arroyo was harassing another anti-union employee, Jeanete Bojorquez. Gibson testified that Bojorquez told her that Arroyo and another pro-union employee were bothering some of the other employees with regard to the union; Arroyo and Bojorquez allegedly engaged in a \u201c \u2018screaming match\u2019 \u201d in the ladies\u2019 washroom concerning Arroyo\u2019s authority to \u201c \u2018fire\u2019 \u201d employees because of Arroyo\u2019s position with the union. 257 N.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>R.B. No. 56 at 4.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After hearing this report Gibson conferred with Sioux\u2019s general manager, Jay Maher, and they then held a meeting in Gibson\u2019s office to \u201c \u2018nip this in the bud\u2019 \u201d before a \u201c \u2018brawl\u2019 \u201d started. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">At the meeting in Gibson\u2019s office, all of the employees involved in the altercation were warned verbally, according to Maher and Gibson, to stop bickering among themselves and to go back to work. Maher testified that Gibson also warned the employees that future outbursts of this sort would result in discharge. The written notations placed in the files of each employee subsequent to this meeting, however, suggest a much less evenhanded handling of the problem. Thus the files of the two pro-union employees, including Arroyo, show that they were reprimanded for \u201c \u2018antagonizing &amp; intimidating employees\u2019 \u201d and were warned \u201c \u2018next offense \u2014 discharge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The file of the anti-union employee Bojorquez, on the other hand, read: \u201c \u2018Involved in dispute with Julia Arroyo, Maria Anaya and Anna Garcia over Union. Although on receiving end and not one of the aggressors \u2014 all girls to air their differences on the outside.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>These file notations are even more suspect in that the hearing showed that neither of the two employees (other than Bojorquez) allegedly harassed by Arroyo complained to management, and one of these employees even told Gibson during the office meeting that she had no complaint against Arroyo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">On February 12, Julia Arroyo received another disciplinary warning, this time from her immediate supervisor, Jackie Haltmeyer, for leaving her work station to go to the bathroom without seeking permission. Sioux\u2019s witnesses testified that this rule is contained in the employee handbook; Julia Arroyo admitted that she had a copy of this handbook. However, Arroyo and other witnesses testified that it was shop policy and practice for employees to go to the bathroom without seeking permission. One of Sioux\u2019s witnesses, employee Roci Andrade, testified that Arroyo went to the bathroom without permission (and without incident) before the union election, and supervisor Haltmeyer further admitted that she allowed employees to go to the lunch truck without seeking permission, in apparent violation of the employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">The final incident occurred on February 28. Employee Roci Andrade (admittedly a union opponent), accompanied by supervisor Haltmeyer and employee Maricella Ramos (who translated), complained to Gibson that Julia Arroyo pushed her and twice called her, in its Spanish equivalent, a \u201cson-of-a-bitch.\u201d Gibson then told the plant\u2019s general manager, Maher, that Arroyo would have to be fired or else there would be a \u201criot\u201d on the plant floor. Gibson said she was going to tell the company owner of her decision to fire Arroyo. Maher concurred in Gibson\u2019s decision, although he told Gibson to find other witnesses to the pushing incident before reporting it to the owner. Gibson then called into her office two employees who, according to the accusing employee, An-drade, also witnessed the incident. Although both of these employees told Gibson that they did not see Arroyo either push Andrade or use profane language in An-drade\u2019s presence, Gibson did not change her mind about firing Arroyo. Indeed, Gibson never bothered even to seek out Arroyo to hear Arroyo\u2019s side of the story. Gibson went to the owner, secured his permission to fire Arroyo, and then returned to her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-9\">Notwithstanding the asserted need to prevent an impending \u201criot\u201d on the plant floor, Gibson waited until the end of the shift to fire Julia Arroyo. The ALJ heard conflicting testimony about what was said and done in the meeting in Gibson\u2019s office at the end of the shift when Arroyo was fired. In a crucial credibility determination based in part on demeanor and based in part on inference, the ALJ accepted the testimony of Sioux\u2019s own witness, supervisor Brent Borgerson (who acted as a translator at this meeting), which tended to support Julia Arroyo\u2019s version of the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>contradicted the testimony of Maher and Gibson. 257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 8 n.6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Borgerson testified that he was given a \u201cticket\u201d to read to Arroyo immediately after she entered Gibson\u2019s office, that the ticket was a dismissal notice and that Arroyo was not allowed to present her side of the story before receiving the dismissal notice. Although Maher testified that Julia Arroyo admitted in this meeting that she pushed Andrade, Borgerson supported Arroyo\u2019s claim that she denied pushing An-drade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">We believe that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Sioux discriminated against Julia Arroyo through its discipline and discharge of her because of her union conduct, and Sioux has failed to support its claim that Arroyo would have been similarly disciplined notwithstanding her protected activities. Sioux\u2019s discipline of Arroyo revealed, as the ALJ found, a clear pattern: a complaint by either an anti-union employee or a supervisor about misconduct by Arroyo; no investigation of Arroyo\u2019s side of the story, and the ignoring of evidence in her favor; discipline of Arroyo but no discipline of anti-union employees involved in the same misconduct; the occurrence of all the events shortly after the union victory and the involvement of employees and supervisors with strong animus against union representation. Even when accusations against Arroyo were not fully supported by either the employees involved (February 5) or the alleged employee witnesses (February 28), Sioux still disciplined \u2014 and even discharged \u2014 Arroyo. We agree with the ALJ and the Board that the asserted justifications for Sioux\u2019s actions are pretexts to disguise disciplinary action for protected activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">Moreover, Sioux\u2019s actions against Arroyo are further stripped of legitimacy by the very procedure followed in decreeing discharge. Thus, although Gibson admitted that her customary method of handling misconduct complaints was to talk to all involved employees before imposing discipline, she did not talk to Arroyo before deciding to fire her on February 28. Finally, the strikingly disparate warnings issued to the various employees involved in the trivial incidents of February 5 and 12 reveal a disposition on the part of Sioux to utilize even the pettiest infractions to build a record against an apparently unpopular union supporter, whom they wanted to fire. In sum, we agree with the ALJ that Arroyo was disciplined and discharged because of her union activities in violation of section 8(a)(3). The ALJ and the Board sifted the facts and articulated their premises and reasoning so carefully that it would be error for us to disturb the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">The order of the National Labor Relations Board is enforced in all respects except insofar as it found a violation of section 8(a)(1) based on alleged interrogation of Sioux\u2019s employees, Eulogio, Marta and Julia Arroyo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-14\">Enforced As Modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">. We note incidentally that the Board recently found in unrelated proceedings that the union was, as a result of this election, properly certified as the collective bargaining representative of these employees and that Sioux unlawfully refused to bargain with the union in 1981. <em>Sioux Products, Inc., </em>258 N.L.R.B. No. 35 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">. We do not place any exceptional weight on the ALJ\u2019s <em>inferential </em>findings based merely upon his assessment of the evidence, in contrast with findings based upon his assessment of the <em>demeanor </em>of witnesses and the relative demeanor-based credibility accorded to those witnesses. In particular, the ALJ here chose to accept the testimony of employees Borgerson, Arroyo, Lopez and Reyes at several crucial points over the contradictory testimony of other witnesses because those four employees, in the opinion of the ALJ, testified in the most candid and straightforward manner. <em>See </em>257 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 12-14; <em>cf. Consolidation Coal Co. v. NLRB, </em>669 F.2d 482 (7th Cir. 1982) (ALJ\u2019s findings, although allegedly credibility-based, were not based upon demeanor observations and thus were entitled to no special weight).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">. The translators were actually outside \u201cconsultants\u201d hired by Sioux after the union drive started to translate management\u2019s messages into Spanish. The ALJ found that these Spanish-speaking consultants engaged in general campaigning against the union throughout the union representation drive, and that they were agents of Sioux under section 2(2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2) (1976). 257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 11 n.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">. The Board upheld the ALJ\u2019s apparently distinct but unexplained finding that Sioux\u2019s promises to increase benefits upon a union defeat constituted a separate violation of section 8(a)(1). See Order to be posted by Sioux by direction of the Board, 257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 16. The Supreme Court has reasoned that a promise to grant benefits made during a union representation election violates section 8(a)(1) because one may infer from the promise an implied threat to take away benefits if the union wins the election. See <em>NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., </em>375 U.S. 405, 84 S.Ct. 457, 11 L.Ed.2d 435 (1964). Although that inference may not seem plausible in every case where an employer promises benefits to persuade employees to vote against the union, it is evident in this case that the promise of increased benefits made by Sioux was coercive in nature and was utilized to mask Sioux\u2019s threat to decrease benefits upon a union victory. Both the promises and the threats made here by Sioux were closely linked in time and circumstances as part of Sioux\u2019s otherwise coercive efforts to discourage support for the union. In such a case, it is preferable to analyze the promise of benefits as violating section 8(a)(1) because it is so closely associated with threatening conduct rather than to rely on inferences and assumptions about how an employee may have interpreted the promise. It is with this understanding that we enforce this portion of the Board\u2019s order since neither the Board nor the ALJ explained the basis for their decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">. Sioux\u2019s reliance upon <em>Utrad Corp. v. NLRB, </em>454 F.2d 520 (7th Cir. 1972), is misplaced. In <em>Utrad, </em>the court held that an isolated statement by a foreman made without the knowledge or acquiescence of higher management authority and threatening a plant closing upon a union victory did not violate section 8(a)(1). Here, on the other hand, the statements were made both by Sioux\u2019s personnel manager and by the translators interpreting directly for the company owner; moreover, the numerous statements threatening loss of jobs and troubles with immigration authorities were far from isolated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">. The ALJ also based his finding of illegal threats of job losses and immigration problems in part on the testimony of a fourth employee, Silvina Andrade. We cannot accept the ALJ\u2019s rationale for relying on Andrade\u2019s testimony and we disclaim any reliance on that testimony here. As part of his decision in another aspect of this case, the ALJ ruled that Sioux properly discharged Andrade shortly after the union election. (The Board accepted the ALJ\u2019s finding that Andrade was lawfully discharged and thus, that issue is not before us.) In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ found that Andrade\u2019s testimony \u201cstrained the limits of believability,\u201d conflicted with the testimony of other witnesses, and lacked internal consistency. <em>See </em>257 N.L.R.B. No. 56 at 9. Notwithstanding his rejection of Andrade\u2019s testimony on the discharge issue, the ALJ accepted those portions of Andrade\u2019s testimony about illegal threats that were not directly contradicted by any other witnesses. In effect, the ALJ accepted An-drade\u2019s claim that one of Sioux\u2019s translators (John Garza) threatened her with loss of her job because Garza did not testify, but the ALJ rejected all of Andrade\u2019s other claims because they were refuted by Sioux\u2019s testifying witnesses. The error in the ALJ\u2019s approach to An-drade\u2019s testimony here was to effectively place the burden of proof on Sioux to refute the testimony of an otherwise admittedly unbelievable witness. This approach is erroneous since the burden of proof in a section 8(a)(1) case always rests with the General Counsel. We thus will not allow the ALJ to rely on the unrefuted assertions of a witness otherwise found to be lacking in credibility to support the ALJ\u2019s findings under section 8(a)(1). However, our rejection of the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the testimony of Silvina Andrade does not change the resuit since the credible testimony of three other witnesses is entirely adequate to sustain the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">. Once a conversation is labelled \u201cinterrogation,\u201d it is quite easy \u2014 indeed, appealing \u2014 to find a section 8(a)(1) violation. But the label \u201cinterrogation\u201d must be used with some restraint. In this matter, we find little evidence suggesting the kind of coercive interrogation that is proscribed by the Act. Each employee was asked by a known company agent how he would vote or had voted; no threats were made or intimated; the questioning was brief; it is not claimed that any other employees overheard the conversations; and each employee either publically supported the union or was a union leader both before and after the questioning. None of these employees even asserted that Garza\u2019s questions coerced or restrained them from exercising their rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">. Bojorquez did not testify; her alleged remarks were presented as hearsay evidence through Gibson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">. The inference relied on by the ALJ is a rather strong one. Borgerson was a supervisor, called as a witness by Sioux, who assisted Sioux\u2019s witnesses and counsel throughout the hearing as a translator. The ALJ concluded that Bor-gerson would be unlikely to testify knowingly in a false manner to the detriment of his employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
