At sentencing, the district court concluded that Rias-cos\u2019s prior conviction was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the guidelines and sentenced R\u00edaseos to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Counsel filed a notice of appeal, but the appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Eight months later, R\u00edaseos filed a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that he had been improperly sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines and that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations and sentencing. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation, recommending that the court deny R\u00edaseos\u2019 application. The magistrate judge concluded that R\u00edaseos\u2019 sentencing error claim was procedurally barred as he could have raised this issue on appeal but failed to do so and had not shown cause for this failure and actual prejudice. The magistrate judge also reviewed the record and rejected R\u00edaseos\u2019 allegations as unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">R\u00edaseos filed a \u201cPetitioner\u2019s Traverse to the Magistrate\u2019s Recomendation\u201d [sic], in which he, <em>inter alia, </em>alleged that his counsel had been ineffective for failing to argue this sentencing issue on appeal. After considering R\u00edaseos\u2019 \u201ctraverse,\u201d the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, with minor modifications, and denied the application. The district court made no specific reference to R\u00edaseos\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, but found R\u00edas-eos\u2019 sentencing issue without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">On appeal, R\u00edaseos reiterates the claim, first made in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, that he asked counsel to appeal but counsel failed to file a brief. The record supports R\u00edaseos\u2019 allegation that he was denied counsel on appeal. Prejudice is presumed when movant experiences complete denial of counsel, whether actual or constructive. <em>Sharp v. Puckett, </em>930 F.2d 450, 451-52 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The district court may construe an issue raised for the first time in an objection to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation as a motion to amend complaint. <em>Johnson v. Bartlett, </em>No. 94-50238, slip op. at 8-9 (5th Cir. Sept. 30, 1994), citing <em>Sherman v. Hallbauer, </em>455 F.2d 1236, 1242 (5th Cir.1972) (leave to amend pleading out-of-time should be given freely when justice so requires). We review the district court\u2019s failure to allow such an amendment for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">R\u00edaseos\u2019 pleadings, taken together, clearly advised the district court that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal. To penalize R\u00edaseos for less-than-perfect pleading is a clear violation of the rule that courts must liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Macias v. Raul A. (Unknown), Badge No. 153, </em>23 F.3d 94, 97 (5th Cir.1994). Further, the district court\u2019s disposition was based, in part, on the fact that the one appeal issue that R\u00edaseos has identified with no assistance from counsel was, in the district court\u2019s opinion, without merit. The right to counsel on direct appeal is not limited to those individuals who can articulate a meritorious appeal issue without the assistance of counsel. For these reasons, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>conclude that the district court\u2019s failure to construe R\u00edaseos\u2019 \u201ctraverse\u201d as a motion to amend was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Based on the foregoing, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
