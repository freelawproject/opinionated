Defendant claims it was error for the court to instruct with CALJIC No. 4.20 because it prohibits the application of the defense of intoxication in a general intent crime. As a result, defendant maintains section 22 is unconstitutional, since it restricts the presentation of a defense that \u201cnegates an element of the charged crime,\u201d specifically, the \u201cknowledge\u201d element for implied malice. We begin by presenting an overview of section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>C. <em>Section 22</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Section 22 states the basic principle of law recognized in California that a criminal act is not rendered less criminal because it is committed by a person in a state of voluntary intoxication. Evidence of voluntary intoxication is not admissible to negate the capacity to form any mental states for the crimes charged. However, evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible with respect to the actual formation of a required specific intent. (\u00a7 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In addressing defendant\u2019s claim, it is useful to examine the history of the latter amendments to section 22, as explained by the California Supreme Court in <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1114, 1124-1126 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 959 P.2d 735]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cIn 1982, the Legislature amended section 22 to provide, as relevant: \u2018(a) No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication is less criminal by reason of his having been in such condition. Evidence of voluntary intoxication shall not be admitted to negate the capacity to form any mental states for the crimes charged, including, but not limited to, purpose, intent, knowledge, premeditation, deliberation or malice aforethought, with which the accused committed the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-8\">\u201c \u2018(b) Evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged.\u2019 (Stats. 1982, ch. 893, \u00a7 2, pp. 3317-3318.) The Legislature stated that the 1982 amendment was \u2018declaratory of existing law.\u2019 (Stats. 1982, ch. 893, \u00a7 5, p. 3318.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-9\">\u201cMost recently, in 1995, effective January 1, 1996, the Legislature amended section 22 to provide, as relevant: \u2018(a) No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication is less criminal by reason of his or her having been in that condition. Evidence of voluntary intoxication shall not be admitted to negate the capacity to form any mental states for the crimes charged, including, but not limited to, purpose, intent, knowledge, premeditation, deliberation, or malice aforethought, with which the accused committed the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-10\">\u201c \u2018(b) Evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent, or, when charged with murder, whether the defendant premeditated, deliberated, or harbored express malice aforethought.\u2019 (Stats. 1995, ch. 793, \u00a7 1; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Castillo </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1009, 1014, fn. 1 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 648, 945 P.2d 1197].) [\u00b6] . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Whitfield, </em>we concluded \u2018that section 22 was not intended, in murder prosecutions, to preclude consideration of evidence of voluntary intoxication on the issue whether a defendant harbored malice aforethought, whether the prosecution proceeds on a theory that malice was express or implied.\u2019 <em>([People </em>v.] <em>Whitfield </em>[(1994)] 7 Cal.4th [437,] 451 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 858, 868 P.2d 272].) Justice Mosk, joined by Chief Justice Lucas and, in a separate opinion, Justice Baxter, would have found voluntary intoxication not admissible to negate implied malice. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 456-477 (conc, and dis. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 477 (conc, and dis. opn. of Baxter, J.).) The most recent amendment to section 22 came in apparent reaction to this holding. The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest to the bill amending section 22 stated: \u2018Under existing law, as held by the California Supreme Court in People v. Whitfield, 7 Cal.4th 437, the phrase \u201cwhen a specific intent crime is charged\u201d includes murder even where the prosecution relies on a theory of implied malice, ffl] This bill would provide, instead, that evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent, or, when charged with murder, whether the defendant premeditated, deliberated, or harbored express malice aforethought.\u2019 (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 121 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.).)\u201d (18 Cal.4th at pp. 1124-1126.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The issue in <em>Mendoza </em>was whether evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible on whether a defendant tried as an aider and abettor had the required knowledge and intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1123, 1126.) The court concluded the intent requirement for aiding and abetting liability is a \u201c \u2018required specific intent\u2019 \u201d for which evidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible under section 22. (18 Cal.4th at p. 1131.) However, the court cautioned: \u201cOur holding is very narrow. Defendants may present evidence of intoxication solely on the question whether they are liable for criminal acts as aiders and abettors. Once a jury finds a defendant did knowingly and intentionally aid and abet a criminal act, intoxication evidence is irrelevant to the <em>extent </em>of the criminal liability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133; see also <em>Ginns v. Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689] [\u201cLanguage used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">It is clear that the effect of the 1995 amendment to section 22 was to preclude evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate implied malice aforethought. As explained in <em>People v. Reyes </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 975, 984, footnote 6 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 39]: \u201cAs part of the 1995 amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>section 22, subdivision (b), evidence of voluntary intoxication is no longer admissible on the issue of implied malice aforethought. . . , thus superseding the holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitfield. </em>However, the court\u2019s analysis remains germane to the admissibility of evidence of intoxication to refute the element of knowledge in other types of crimes, such as receiving stolen property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">D. <em>Constitutionality of section 22</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Relying on the dissenting opinions in <em>Montana </em>v. <em>Egelhoff </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 37 [116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361], defendant argues that section 22 unconstitutionally removes a relevant category of evidence\u2014the defendant\u2019s mental state\u2014from the jury\u2019s consideration. Defendant maintains section 22 prevented her ability to attack an element of the offense (i.e., implied malice) in violation of her due process rights. Defendant\u2019s analysis is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The due process clause precludes a conviction unless the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the accused is charged. This burden cannot be shifted to a defendant. <em>(Patterson v. New York </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 197, 204-205 [97 S.Ct. 2319, 2324, 53 L.Ed.2d 281].) Thus, \u201cthe Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the offense of which the defendant is charged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 210 [97 S.Ct. at p. 2327].)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In a plurality opinion, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Montana </em>held that a defendant\u2019s right to have a jury consider evidence of his voluntary intoxication in determining whether he possessed the requisite mental state was not a \u201cfundamental principle of justice.\u201d As a result, the court held Montana\u2019s statutory ban on consideration of a defendant\u2019s intoxicated condition in determining the existence of a mental state, which is an element of the offense, did not violate the due process clause. <em>(Montana v. Egelhoff, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp. 40-43, 48-51, 56 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2016-2017, 2019-2021, 2023-2024] (plur. opn.); see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 58-59 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2024-2025] (conc. opn. of Ginsburg, J.).)  The court reasoned: \u201cIt is not surprising that many States have held fast to or resurrected the common-law rule prohibiting consideration of voluntary intoxication in the determination of <em>mens rea, </em>because that rule has considerable justification\u2014which alone casts doubt upon the proposition that the opposite rule is a \u2018fundamental principle.\u2019 A large number of crimes, especially violent crimes, are committed by intoxicated offenders; modem studies put the numbers as high as half of all homicides, for example. [Citations.] Disallowing consideration of voluntary intoxication has the effect of increasing the punishment for all unlawful acts committed in that state, and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>deters drunkenness or irresponsible behavior while drunk. The rule also serves as a specific deterrent, ensuring that those who prove incapable of controlling violent impulses while voluntarily intoxicated go to prison. And finally, the rule comports with and implements society\u2019s moral perception that one who has voluntarily impaired his own faculties should be responsible for the consequences. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Montana, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp. 49-50 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2020], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The <em>Montana </em>court noted the well-settled principle that \u201cthe introduction of relevant evidence can be limited by the State for a \u2018valid\u2019 reason . . . .\u201d <em>(Montana </em>v. <em>Egelhoff, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 53 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2022].) As long ago as 1969, the California Supreme Court recognized the commonly held public belief that \u201ca person who voluntarily gets drunk and while in that state commits a crime should not escape the consequences.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 455 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370].) The 1982 and 1995 amendments to section 22 are a reflection of this public perception.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Several courts have addressed the constitutional validity of the legislative enactments abolishing the defense of diminished capacity (specifically, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 28 and 29), and found no due process violation. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1116 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitler </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 337, 340-341 [214 Cal.Rptr. 610]; <em>People v. Lynn </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 715, 732-733 [206 Cal.Rptr. 181]; <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 961, 967-970 [199 Cal.Rptr. 848].) It is informative to review the basis for such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In <em>People v. Lynn, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d 715, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-7\">\u201cThe exclusion of the capacity evidence represented by sections 22, 28 and 29 is not of constitutional dimension [citation]. It is \u2018nothing more than a legislative determination that for reasons of reliability or public policy, \u201ccapacity\u201d evidence is inadmissible\u2019 [citation]. The enactment neither prevented [the defendant] from disproving the mental state necessary to the charges nor deprived him of his constitutional right to require the People to prove every fact necessary to constitute the crime beyond a reasonable doubt [citations]. [^] . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">\u201cWe observe it has recently been held there is no due process impediment in the substantive statutory definition of felony murder which omits malice as an element of that crime [citation]. The deletion of malice gives rise to no presumption which must pass due process muster [citation]. It occurs to us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>that if the Legislature may constitutionally delete malice as an element of felony murder, it may also constitutionally delete diminished capacity as a defense to crimes requiring particular mental states. In both cases, we are dealing with a matter of substantive statutory definition [citation]. In neither case is there a presumption involved that must withstand constitutional due process scrutiny because of its burden shifting effect.\u201d <em>(People v. Lynn, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at pp. 732-733; see also <em>People v. Saille, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1116 [abolition of diminished capacity defense and limitation of admissible evidence to actual formation of various mental states does not violate due process right to present a defense].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The Legislature\u2019s most recent amendment to section 22 is closely analogous to its abrogation of the defense of diminished capacity. We therefore find the reasoning of <em>Lynn </em>applicable here. The 1995 amendment to section 22 results from a legislative determination that, for reasons of public policy, evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate culpability shall be strictly limited. We find nothing in the enactment that deprives a defendant of the ability to present a defense or relieves the People of their burden to prove every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, including, in this case, knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Accordingly, we find no due process violation. Thus, the court did not err in instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 4.20, rather than CALJIC No. 4.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">III.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The conviction of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated is reversed.
