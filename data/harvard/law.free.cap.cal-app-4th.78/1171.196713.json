J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATh\">Petitioners Michael Thomas Cheek and Allen Douglas Butler were found to be sexually violent predators under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and were committed to the custody of the State Department of Mental Health (DMH) for two years. We affirmed those commitments in <em>People v. Cheek </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 282 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 125], review granted December 15, 1999 (S083305),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 421 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 357].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Before those two-year commitments expired, the district attorney filed petitions to commit Butler and Cheek for additional two-year periods. The petitions were each supported by one evaluation from a DMH clinical psychologist. Both Butler and Cheek contend that the petitions for commitment should be dismissed because the Sexually Violent Predators Act requires the DMH conduct a \u201cfull evaluation,\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (b)), which involves <em>two </em>evaluations of the person subject to commitment (\u00a7 6601, subd. (d)), before the district attorney may file a petition for extended commitment. We agree, and therefore in each case we will issue a writ of mandate commanding the superior court to dismiss the petition for commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">\n<em>Sexually Violent Predators Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA), adding sections 6600 through 6608 to the Welfare and Institutions Code, was enacted October 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>1995, effective January 1, 1996. (Stats. 1995, chs. 762 &amp; 763.)In section 1, the Legislature set forth its findings and summarized the purpose of the new law, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-5\">\u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators that have diagnosable mental disorders can be identified while they are incarcerated. These persons are not safe to be at large and if released represent a danger to the health and safety of others in that they are likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. The Legislature further finds and declares that it is in the interest of society to identify these individuals prior to the expiration of their terms of imprisonment. It is the intent of the Legislature that once identified, these individuals, if found to be likely to commit acts of sexually violent criminal behavior beyond a reasonable doubt, be confined and treated until such time that it can be determined that they no longer present a threat to society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-6\">\u201cThe Legislature further finds and declares that while these individuals have been duly punished for their criminal acts, they are, if adjudicated sexually violent predators, a continuing threat to society. The continuing danger posed by these individuals and the continuing basis for their judicial commitment is a currently diagnosed mental disorder which predisposes them to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior. It is the intent of the Legislature that these individuals be committed and treated for their disorders only as long as the disorders persist and not for any punitive purposes.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 762, \u00a7 1; <em>id., </em>ch. 763, \u00a7 1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">A \u201csexually violent predator\u201d is defined in section 6600, subdivision (a), as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d Sexually violent offenses, for purposes of the SVPA, are listed in section 6600, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">If the Director of the Department of Corrections determines that a prisoner may be a sexually violent predator (SVP), the director shall refer that person for an initial screening evaluation at least six months prior to his or her scheduled release date. (\u00a7 6601, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) The initial screening is performed by the Dep\u00e1rtment of Corrections and the Board of Prison Terms. If \u201cas a result of this screening it is determined that the person is likely to be a sexually violent predator,\u201d he or she is then referred to the DMH for a \u201cfull evaluation of whether the person meets the criteria in Section 6600.\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>Upon referral, the DMH evaluates the potential SVP \u201cin accordance with a standardized assessment protocol.\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (c).) The evaluations are performed \u201cby two practicing psychiatrists or psychologists, or one practicing psychiatrist and one practicing psychologist.\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (d).) \u201cIf both evaluators concur that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody,\u201d the DMH requests that the county attorney file a petition for commitment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cCopies of the evaluation reports and any other supporting documents shall be made available to the attorney designated by the county pursuant to subdivision (i) who may file a petition for commitment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">A probable cause hearing is then held before a superior court judge. (\u00a7 6602.) The individual named in the petition is entitled to assistance of counsel at this hearing and is permitted to call and cross-examine witnesses. (See <em>People v. Butler, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 421.) If the judge determines there is probable cause to believe that the person is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his or her release from prison, the judge shall order that a trial be conducted \u201cto determine whether the person is, by reason of a diagnosed mental disorder, a danger to the health and safety of others in that the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence upon his or her release (\u00a7 6602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The person subject to the petition is entitled to a trial by jury, the assistance of counsel and the right to retain experts or professional persons to perform further evaluations, and is entitled to have access to all relevant medical and psychological records and reports. (\u00a7 6603, subd. (a).) A unanimous verdict is required in any jury trial. (\u00a7 6603, subd. (d).) The burden of proof is on the state to show that the person is a sexually violent predator beyond a reasonable doubt. (\u00a7 6604.) If it is so determined, the person shall be committed for a period of two years \u201cto the custody of the State Department of Mental Health for appropriate treatment and confinement in a secure facility . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[T]he person shall not be kept in actual custody longer than two years unless a subsequent extended commitment is obtained from the court incident to the filing of a new petition for commitment . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The SVP\u2019s confinement is subject to annual review and is entitled to the appointment of an expert and review of all records. (\u00a7 6605, subd. (a).) The SVP is entitled to an annual \u201cshow cause hearing\u201d whereby his or her mental condition is reviewed. (\u00a7 6605, subd. (b).) The SVP may also petition for conditional release after a year of commitment (\u00a7 6608), and the DMH can request conditional release (\u00a7 6607) at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>While confined, the SVP must be provided with treatment for his or her diagnosed mental disorder, whether or not he or she is amenable to treatment. (\u00a7 6606, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) The treatment \u201cshall be consistent with current institutional standards for the treatment of sex offenders . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6606, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">\n<em>Butler</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">On May 14, 1996, Butler was found to be an SVP and committed to the custody of the DMH for a two-year period. On May 8, 1998, a few days before Butler\u2019s commitment was set to expire, the District Attorney of Santa Cruz County filed a new petition seeking to recommit Butler for another two-year period. Attached to the petition for commitment was an April 9, 1998, evaluation of defendant performed by DMH clinical psychologist Diane Imren. In her evaluation report, Dr. Imren recommended that Butler be recommitted: \u201cIt is the opinion of the treatment team that Mr. Butler has a diagnosed mental disorder .... Based on Mr. \u00c9utler\u2019s history, his current level of functioning and known risk factors associated with reoffense, Mr. Butler is more likely than not to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The trial court set the probable cause hearing (\u00a7 6602) on the petition for recommitment for June 25, 1999, after numerous continuances related to the pending appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 421. The district attorney moved into evidence Dr. Imren\u2019s April 9, 1998, evaluation report, as well as a June 10, 1999, addendum to that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Dr. Imren testified at the probable cause hearing and Butler was permitted to cross-examine her. Dr. Imren explained that Butler was in phase I of the treatment program at Atascadero State Hospital. She testified that Butler had told her he had \u201cno intention\u201d of going to phase II of the treatment program because \u201c[i]t would be like admitting I have a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">After Butler cross-examined Dr. Imren, the district attorney requested the trial court read the two 1996 evaluation reports that supported the original petition for commitment. Butler\u2019s counsel argued that the trial court should not rely on the 1996 evaluation reports to determine Butler\u2019s current mental, condition, and he further asserted that the district attorney was required to present two evaluations by separate psychologists or psychiatrists rather than the one evaluation he had presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The trial court ruled that it was not necessary to consider the 1996 reports and that it was not necessary for the district, attorney to present two evaluations \u201cbecause of the type of hearing that we have.\u201d At the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>probable cause hearing, Butler\u2019s counsel reiterated her argument that \u201cthey have to, present two evaluators\u201d and moved to dismiss'the petition for recommitment. The trial court denied the motion, made a finding that there was probable cause \u201cto believe that [Butler] is an individual who is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his release,\u201d and set a trial date of September 7, 1999. We stayed the trial date pending disposition of Butler\u2019s petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">\n<em>Cheek</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">On July 14, 1997, Cheek was found to be an SVP and committed to the custody of the DMH for a two-year period. On May 27, 1999, about six weeks before Cheek\u2019s initial two-year commitment was set to expire, the District Attorney of Santa Cruz County filed a new petition seeking to recommit him for another two-year period. The petition for commitment included an April 19, 1999, evaluation of Cheek performed by DMH clinical psychologist Dale Arnold. In his evaluation report, Dr. Arnold recommended that Cheek be recommitted: \u201cIt is the opinion of this evaluator, as well as Mr. Cheek\u2019s treatment team, that, as a result of his diagnosed mental disorder, Mr. Cheek is more likely than not to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The trial court held the probable cause hearing (\u00a7 6602) on the petition for recommitment on August 20, 1999. The district attorney moved into evidence Dr. Arnold\u2019s evaluation report, and Dr. Arnold testified at the probable cause hearing. Cheek was permitted to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">At the end of the probable cause hearing, Cheek\u2019s counsel argued that the trial court should dismiss the petition because the district attorney was required to present two evaluations by separate psychologists or psychiatrists rather than the one evaluation presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The trial court did not explicitly rule on the issue whether the district attorney was required to present two evaluations. It stated: \u201cPursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 6602, and the following considerations of the petition which has been filed in this case, as well as the forensic evaluation report. . . and the testimony that the Court received here today, I find there is probable cause to believe that Mr. Cheek is likely to engage in sexually violent predator[y] criminal behavior upon his release at this time . . . .\u201d The trial court set a trial date of November 29, 1999. We stayed the trial date pending disposition of Cheek\u2019s petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Petitioners argue that the procedures for recommitment under the SVPA are the same as for an initial commitment. That is, the person must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>evaluated by two practicing psychologists or psychiatrists, and the DMH may request a petition for commitment only \u201c[i]f <em>both </em>evaluators concur that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (d), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">We have found only one published case that addresses issues relating to recommitment under the SVPA: <em>People v. Superior Court </em>(Ramirez) (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1384 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 402]. <em>Ramirez </em>held that the SVPA does not require that a recommitment trial be completed before the expiration of the initial term of commitment. It is unclear whether the defendant in that case was evaluated by more than one evaluator prior to the filing of the recommitment petition; the opinion specifies simply that \u201c[t]he petition was based on a request from the medical director of Atascadero State Hospital that [the defendant] be recommitted because the treatment staff believed that [the defendant] remained a danger to the health and safety of others and was likely to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior if discharged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In construing the SVPA we apply settled rules of statutory construction.  \u201c \u2018The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] Ordinarily, the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent. [Citation.] When the statutory language is ambiguous, the court may examine the context in which the language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cWhen the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation . . . , we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 94 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The SVPA does not contain any explicit provisions regarding the process of recommitment. The only reference to recommitment is contained in section 6604, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the court or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, the person shall be committed for two years to the custody of the State Department of Mental Health . . . and the person shall not be kept in actual custody longer than two years unless a subsequent extended commitment is obtained from the court incident to the filing of a new petition for commitment under this article . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">The fact that the Legislature did not provide any specific procedures for the filing of a petition for recommitment indicates that it intended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>recommitment procedures to be the same as the procedures for the filing of an initial petition for commitment, including the requirement that the person be evaluated by <em>two </em>psychologists or psychiatrists and the requirement that the DMH make available to the designated county attorney \u201c[c]opies of the evaluation reports.\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (d), italics added.) Indeed, the SVPA does not use the term \u201cpetition for recommitment,\u201d but instead refers to \u201cthe filing of <em>a new petition for commitment </em>under this article.\u201d (\u00a7 6604, italics added.) This language indicates that the Legislature intended the procedures for obtaining a \u201csubsequent extended commitment\u201d to be the same as the procedures for obtaining an initial commitment. The Legislature specifically provided that the DMH may not request a petition for commitment if only one of the two evaluators concludes that the person meets the criteria for commitment under the SVPA. (\u00a7 6601, subd. (e).) This indicates that the Legislature felt it important for two professionals to concur in their evaluations of a potential SVP\u2019s mental condition before a petition for commitment could be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The fact that the SVPA specifically requires a \u201cnew petition for commitment\u201d after the initial two-year term of commitment indicates that the Legislature intended the new petition to be based on the SVP\u2019s mental condition at the end of the initial two-year term. The evaluations performed at the initial commitment stage would not reflect the defendant\u2019s current mental condition. \u201cThe nature of the [SVPA] envisions a special civil commitment proceeding that is begun and then continues, changes or ends depending upon the <em>current </em>mental condition and dangerousness of the proposed or committed SVP .... Although the same requirements or issues are involved in alleging any \u2018cause\u2019 filed via petition under the Act, the actual facts or circumstances comprising that \u2018cause\u2019 in a subsequent petition will necessarily be different due to the addition of new facts bearing on those issues based on the sheer passage of time which may support the release or commitment of the proposed SVP.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hedge, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1476, italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The People argue that the procedures specified in section 6601 do not apply to petitions for recommitment. They point out that section 6601 appears to contemplate that the person named in the petition for commitment will be \u201cin custody under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections,\u201d because he or she is serving a determinate prison sentence or because his or her parole has been revoked. (\u00a7 6601, subd. (a).) The fact that some of the preliminary procedures would not apply to an extended commitment does not mean that none of the statutory requirements apply. Clearly, the person will not be in custody under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections at the time the recommitment process begins; rather, the person will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>in custody under the jurisdiction of the DMH. Thus, there will be no need for the initial determination by the Director of the Department of Corrections that the person \u201cmay be a sexually violent predator\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (a)) and no need for the initial screening by the Department of Corrections and the Board of Prison Terms to determine whether \u201cthe person is likely to be a sexually violent predator\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (b)). The recommitment procedure would begin with the \u201cfull evaluation\u201d conducted by the DMH. (\u00a7 6601, subds. (b) &amp; (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">In support of their argument, the People provide a DMH memorandum explaining that the DMH has established a policy whereby SVPA recommitments \u201cwill be made in a manner consistent with reports to the court used for extensions in other legal classes.\u201d The memorandum specifies: \u201cThe recommendation to the district attorney for extended sexually violent predator commitment shall consist of a recommendation from the state hospital medical director and relevant materials from the state hospital staff. . . .\u201d As petitioners point out, we may not consider this document. The document is not properly before this court, as it was not presented to the trial court. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 56(c).)  In any event, the interpretation of the SVPA\u2019s recommitment procedures by the DMH, a state agency, is \u201cnot binding or necessarily even authoritative.\u201d <em>(Yamaha Corp of America, </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 7-8 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031].) We are required to independently review the statutory scheme. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The People point out that the procedure followed here was similar to the procedures prescribed for extended commitments under the Mentally Disordered Offenders (MDO) Law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2970),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the procedures prescribed for extending the commitment of a person found not guilty by reason of insanity (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the procedures prescribed for extending commitments under the former Mentally Disordered Sex Offenders (MDSO) Law (former \u00a7 6316.2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that the Legislature prescribed procedures for recommitment under those laws supports our analysis and conclusion, because it demonstrates that the Legislature knows how to specifically prescribe recommitment procedures that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>differ from initial commitment procedures. Its failure to prescribe specific recommitment procedures under the SVPA indicates that it did not intend to create a scheme different from the initial commitment process. (See <em>In re Parker </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1453, 1467 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 167] [in light of Legislature\u2019s use of language providing that qualifying SVP offenses could be proved with documentary evidence, its failure to provide that probable cause to believe a person is an SVP could be shown by documentary evidence indicates it did not intend to limit probable cause determination to paper review].)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">We conclude that before the district attorney may file \u201ca new petition for commitment\u201d (\u00a7 6604), the DMH must conduct a \u201cfull evaluation\u201d of the person subject to the petition as provided in section 6601, which includes evaluation of the person \u201cby two practicing psychiatrists or psychologists, or one practicing psychiatrist and one practicing psychologist.\u201d (\u00a7 6601, subd. (d).) As neither petitioner was subject to a \u201cfull evaluation\u201d before the instant petitions for commitment were filed, the petitions should have been dismissed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\"><em>Butler </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>H020240: Let a peremptory writ issue commanding the superior court to vacate its ruling that there was probable cause to believe that Butler is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his release and enter a new ruling dismissing the petition for commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\"><em>Cheek v.

We further held that the evidence was sufficient to support Butler\u2019s commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b920-6\">In <em>Hedge, </em>the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction over an SVPA petition even though a previously filed petition was still pending before the California Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Under Penal Code section 2970, the district attorney may file a petition for \u201ccontinued involuntary treatment\u201d of an MDO for one year upon receiving a \u201cwritten evaluation\u201d of the person from the medical director of the state hospital treating the person, the community program director in charge of the person\u2019s outpatient program, or the Director of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Under Penal Code section 1026.5, subdivision (b)(2), the prosecuting attorney may file a petition for \u201cextended commitment\u201d of a person found not guilty by reason of insanity upon' receiving an \u201copinion\u201d from the medical director of the state hospital treating the person or the medical director of the person\u2019s treatment program that the person meets the requirements for extended commitment set forth in Penal Code section 1026.5, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Under former section 6316.2, the prosecuting attorney may file a \u201cpetition for extended commitment\u201d of a person committed under the former MDSO Law if the Director of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>DMH has \u201cgood cause\u201d to believe that the person meets the requirements for extended commitment and submits \u201csupporting evaluations and case file.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b922-11\">We note that if petitioners are ultimately subject to subsequent extended commitments upon the proper filing of new petitions for commitment, such extended commitments would be deemed to begin on the date upon which petitioners\u2019 initial commitments terminated.

(a) [\u201cFor subsequent extended commitments, the term of commitment shall be from the date of the termination of the previous commitment.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
