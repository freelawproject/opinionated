The blow was so hard that it ruptured an artery at the back of his abdomen, and he died of internal bleeding. At various earlier times, somebody had broken his leg and four of his ribs, smashed him in the face, and shaken his head so violently that the resulting bleeding in his brain might have killed him if the bleeding from the ruptured artery had not killed him first.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The person who hit and killed Joey had to be either defendant Karen Lois Culuko, who was his mother, or defendant Leslie Eugene Garcia, who had moved in with Culuko two months earlier. The person who inflicted Joey\u2019s other injuries could have been the one who killed him, the other one, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Defendants were charged with murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a)), fatal assault on a child under the age of eight (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273ab), and felony child abuse (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273a, subd. (a)). The jurors were instructed that if (1) one defendant aided and abetted the commission of felony child abuse by the other, (2) the defendant who committed felony child abuse committed murder, and (3) murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the crime of felony child endangerment, the aider and abettor was guilty of murder. The jurors were also instructed that they did not have to decide individually, nor agree unanimously, as to whether either defendant was guilty as a perpetrator or as an aider and abettor. Both defendants were found guilty as charged; the murder was set as second degree. Defendants were sentenced to 19 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Defendants raise a host of challenges to their convictions. Most of these seek to capitalize on the fact that it is hard to feel sure which defendant actually struck the fatal blow; many of them revolve around the jury instructions summarized above. We will conclude, however, that the jury was properly instructed, and, based on those instructions, could properly find both defendants guilty on all charges. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"AKa\">A. <em>The Arrival at the Medical Clinic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">On Friday, January 26, 1996, about 8:40 a.m., Culuko entered Colton Community Family Health, a medical clinic. She said her baby, who was outside, had fallen, was fussy, and would not eat. She was told to bring him in.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">About five minutes later, she came back. She was crying and clutching the baby to her chest. She said he was not breathing. His body was \u201cbluish-gray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">At first, Culuko said the baby had fallen off her bed. Later, she said he had fallen from his crib a few days earlier and hit his head. Still later, she repeated that he had fallen from a bed. She explained that, the day before, he had not eaten well; he had been awake most of the night. Just as they got to the clinic, he had stopped breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Garcia came into the clinic. He appeared calm. When asked if he was the father, he said no, he had just given Culuko a ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">About 8:50 a.m., clinic personnel began administering CPR to the baby. There were \u201ca lot of bruises and marks all over his body\u201d and dried blood on his feet. He had no pulse. His pupils did not react to light. His body was limp, blue, and cool. From his temperature, Dr. Elisabeth Richards concluded he had stopped breathing more than 30 minutes earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Paramedics transported the baby to Loma Linda Medical Center. At 9:12 a.m., he was seen by Dr. John Jones. He had multiple bruises, in various stages of healing, on his face, chest, arms, legs, genitals and both feet. There had been bleeding in the white of his right eye; his frenulum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was torn. By 9:40 a.m., Loma Linda personnel noted rigor mortis in his arms and legs as well as postmortem dependent lividity. Dr. Jones concluded that, at that point, the baby had been dead for at least two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">B. <em>The Physical Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Dr. Frank Sheridan, who performed the autopsy, believed Joey had been dead at least an hour or two before he arrived at the clinic. About two hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>after death, rigor mortis would have begun. Because it was noted in the arms and legs by 9:40 a.m., and it begins even earlier in the face, Dr. Sheridan believed it had already begun at the clinic, although clinic personnel did not note it because they were focused on resuscitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Joey died of internal bleeding from a ruptured artery at the back of the abdomen. It would have taken \u201c[m]ajor force, like a violent punch,\u201d to rupture this artery. After the blow, \u201c. . . you have a time frame from instantaneous up to a couple of hours ... for the artery to rupture.\u201d Then, after the rupture, death would have occurred within one hour. In sum, Joey died \u201c[a]t the outside, about three hours\u201d after the blow. Dr. Sheridan concluded the blow had been struck sometime after 3:45 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Joey\u2019s body was covered with bruises. On his face alone, there were bruises on the forehead, both eyes, nose, right cheek and mouth. There was \u201cextensive injury to the inside of the mouth,\u201d including .the tom frenulum. He had four broken ribs. They were the result of at least two separate blows, in addition to the later blow which had ruptured the artery. His left leg had been broken. This was a spiral fracture of the tibia, which indicated \u201cthat at the moment the bone was breaking, the leg was being twisted . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Human bite marks were found on Joey\u2019s pubis and scrotum, his right arm, and both of his feet. Based on dental molds taken from both defendants, Dr. Gregory Golden, a forensic dentist, testified the usable bite marks and Culuko\u2019s teeth \u201chad very consistent points of matching characteristics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">There was subdural bleeding around the brain. This indicated \u201cviolent shaking . . . combined with an impact to the head . . . .\u201d It could not have been caused by a fall off a bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Dr. Sheridan was able to approximate the age of the injuries based on inflammation, which would begin six to eight hours after injury, and hemosiderin, which would appear several days after injury. Most of the injuries showed no inflammation, indicating they were inflicted \u201cvery shortly before death\u201d\u2014most likely at the same time as the fatal blow. The rib fractures, the bite mark on the right arm, and one set of forehead bruises showed slight inflammation, indicating they were \u201crecent,\u201d meaning a few hours to a few days old. The broken leg and one of the bite marks on the right foot were the oldest injuries. Even so, they showed no hemosiderin, indicating they were not more than five days old.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Room 210 of the Early California Motel was rented to Garcia. In a search of the room, the police found both male and female clothes in the dresser. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>There was a makeshift baby bed on the floor; on the blankets of the baby bed, there were human bloodstains.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">C. <em>Defendants\u2019 Statements to Police.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">1. <em>Culuko\u2019s Statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">While Culuko was still at Loma Linda, a police officer interviewed her. She told him she had been staying in room 210 of the Early California Motel in Riverside. On Wednesday, January 24, 1996, around 9:00 a.m., she was changing the baby\u2019s diaper when he fell off the bed. He cried briefly, but seemed fine. About 9:00 p.m. on Thursday, January 25, however, he seemed to be sick. He was up most of the night. That morning, she took him to the clinic. She was changing his diaper when she noticed he was not breathing. She said Garcia was her boyfriend. She denied that he lived in the motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Defendants were taken to the police station and interviewed separately. Culuko said she and Garcia were the only people who had been around the baby in the week before he died. From Tuesday through Thursday, Garcia had been home sick.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On Wednesday, the baby had fallen off the bed. On Thursday, the baby started coughing and whimpering and would not eat much. On Friday morning, after Garcia had already left for work,, the baby refused to eat and appeared dehydrated. Around 7:30 a.m., she called Garcia at work;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he came back and drove them to the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Culuko went to check in. At that point, Garcia was holding the baby. When she got back to the car, the baby was in the passenger seat. When she picked him up, \u201cHe started going flimsy on me.\u201d She changed his diaper, then realized he was not breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Culuko admitted using methamphetamine \u201cinfrequent[ly].\u201d Her face was bruised; she explained the bruise as a \u201chick[ey].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">2. <em>Garcia\u2019s Statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Garcia told police he had been home sick for two days during the previous week; he made inconsistent statements as to which days they were and as to when he had gone to see a doctor. When asked how the baby had gotten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>bruised, he said that on Wednesday, around 9:00 a.m., the baby had fallen off a bed. On Wednesday or Thursday night, while giving the baby a bath, Garcia had noticed bruises on his face and scratches on his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On January 26, at 2:30 a.m., Garcia awoke. The baby was also awake, moving and \u201ctalking\u201d but not crying. He gave the baby a bottle. At 6:00 a.m., when he got up, the baby was awake and seemed normal. At 6:10 a.m., he left for work. His work hours were 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Around 7:30 a.m., Culuko called him at work. She said the baby was sick; she asked him to come back and take them to the clinic. As he drove them there, the baby made \u201ca wheezing sound,\u201d but seemed fine otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Garcia gave two different accounts of events at the clinic. At first, he said the baby never got out of the car seat; Culuko opened the back door, then saw he was not breathing. When confronted with Culuko\u2019s version, however, he admitted he had held the baby and put him in the passenger seat, and Culuko had changed his diaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Garcia insisted that he never took care of the baby. He was never alone with the baby for more than 10 or 15 minutes. He admitted using methamphetamine with Culuko \u201ca couple of times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">D. <em>Testimony About Defendants\u2019 Relationship.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">On or about December 1, 1995, Culuko and Garcia met and began living together. At first, they moved in with Sandra Hinz and Hinz\u2019s then boyfriend. They all used drugs, every day. Hinz had seen Culuko lose her temper with the baby and drop him onto a bed or couch. Culuko showed Hinz bruises on the baby\u2019s arms and legs and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where they came from.\u201d Hinz responded, \u201c[0]bviously they\u2019re being brought to him. He can\u2019t hurt himself . ...\u201d A few days later, Culuko said she had found out that the baby was pinching himself. Garcia was usually at work during the day. Although he had \u201ca lot more patience,\u201d Hinz had seen him lose his temper and curse at the baby. He also frequently got upset with Culuko for not taking care of the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Around Christmas of 1995, defendants moved in with James Strawn. All three used methamphetamine daily. Generally, Garcia went out to work while Culuko slept all day. Sometimes, Culuko would be sleeping while the baby was crying; Strawn would either wake her up or take care of the baby himself. Garcia took care of the baby, but he \u201cbitched about it.\u201d Several times, when Garcia was alone with the baby, Strawn heard a slap or \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>thump up against the wall,\u201d and then the baby crying. Once, when Strawn asked what had happened, Garcia said, \u201c[N]othing\u201d; another time, he said the baby had fallen off the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Tanja Stams lived next door to Strawn. When defendants were living with Strawn, she visited them often. Once or twice, she used methamphetamine with them. Because there was a hole in the common wall between them, Starns could hear what was going on in their apartment. Culuko slept a lot during the day. If the baby cried while Culuko was asleep, Garcia got \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the baby and angry with Culuko. She also heard Culuko yell at the baby. She heard both Culuko and the baby being slapped. Once, Stams saw braises on the baby\u2019s forehead. Culuko explained that the baby had rolled off a chest they were using as a table.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Angelic Starns, Tanja Stams\u2019s nine-year-old daughter, played with the baby every day. She saw braises on his arm and leg. She saw both Culuko and Garcia spank the baby\u2019s bottom\u2014Garcia because he was \u201cgetting into stuff\u2019 or \u201ccrying.\u201d She also saw Culuko and Garcia hitting each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Darla Roberts had known Culuko for nine years. She thought of Culuko as her daughter; Culuko called her \u201cmommy.\u201d Roberts often baby-sat Joey. Roberts never saw Culuko hit the baby. However, she did see Garcia regularly flick his finger or swat his hand against the baby\u2019s head or chest. Once, she saw Garcia slap Culuko in the face. In November 1995, \u201c[because things weren\u2019t going on right with the baby,\u201d Roberts began keeping a journal. In December 1995, Roberts called child protective services about the way the baby was being treated, but she was told they were overworked and understaffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">On January 9, 1996, Roberts noticed a bruise the size of a baseball on the baby\u2019s bottom and a scratch on his thigh. Both defendants said he had pinched himself. On January 13, 1996, the baby\u2019s right ear was braised, both outside and inside the ear canal, and there was a knot on his forehead. Garcia said he had fallen off the bed again.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">On January 15, 1996, defendants went to stay with Garcia\u2019s sister, Tracy Garcia-Todd. Although Garcia-Todd changed the baby, she denied seeing any braises on him. Once, she heard the baby prying; she found him on the floor, wedged between a pillow and a bed. Culuko was asleep on the floor next to him. Garcia-Todd tried to wake her up, but could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">On January 20, 1996, Culuko and Garcia moved into the motel. On January 21, 1996, they left the baby with Roberts overnight. He had no fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>bruises. Garcia said he was not letting Culuko touch the baby; he wanted full responsibility for caring for the baby, so the baby would bond with him. Culuko confirmed this.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On January 25, 1996, about 3:00 p.m., Roberts spoke to Culuko on the phone. She could hear the baby crying. Culuko said the baby had a cold; she also said he had fallen off the bed again, but seemed okay. Roberts told her to take him to a doctor. Garcia came on the phone; he said, \u201c[I]f you care so much then you take the baby yourself,\u201d because Culuko had to cook his dinner, then hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">E. <em>The Tape of Defendants\u2019 Conversation at the Police Station.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The police left defendants alone together in an interview room and videotaped their ensuing conversation. In it, they agreed that one of them had to be'guilty; they each denied responsibility, yet also refused to blame the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201cCuluko: [I]f it isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s me, if it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201cGarcia: True. Is that not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">\u201cCuluko: In other words, it\u2019s pointing on both of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">\u201cGarcia: Yeah, and I never did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">\u201cCuluko: Neither did I.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">Later, Garcia said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know how to explain . . . beat to death. [10 I only punched his heart like that.\u201d Culuko responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Defendants also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-15\">\u201cCuluko: And you promised me that my son would be all right. That nothing would go down until we find out what happened. . . . [Y]ou promised me you were going to keep it this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-16\">\u201cGarcia: Karen, what promise did I break?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-17\">\u201cCuluko: That\u2019s the only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-18\">\u201cGarcia: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-19\">\u201cCuluko: That he would be alive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>F. <em>Defendants\u2019 Correspondence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In February 1996, Culuko wrote to Garcia, \u201cI explained the teeth impressions to you, so I don\u2019t have to say no more, right? Right. Drop that subject and try very hard not to repeat any of this case in the letters, okay? Thank you. It\u2019s better for both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In March 1996, she wrote, \u201c[I]f you want to know what I do, then you better tell me what you know. If I wanted to hurt you, I would, and you know how I could do that, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think I have to remind you, but if I do, let me know.\u201d She also wrote; \u201cTell the truth .... That is what I am doing, and telling what I know, which is Nothing, if you get what I am saying.\u201d Finally, she wrote: \u201cLord Jesus, I realize I am a lost, guilty, hell-deserving sinner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">G. <em>Defense Expert Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Garcia called Dr. Barry Silverman, an expert pathologist. He agreed that the cause of death was a ruptured artery. He believed, however, that death had occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m., and the fatal injury had occurred less than an hour before death. The bruises and bite marks had been inflicted two hours, at most, before death. He agreed with Dr. Sheridan that the broken leg was the oldest injury, inflicted \u201c[sjeveral days\u201d before death.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Culuko called Dr. Jon Rowland, an expert pediatric pathologist. He agreed that rigor mortis had probably already begun before the baby arrived at the clinic. Based on the appearance of rigor mortis in the arms and legs by 9:40 a.m., he testified the time of death was between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m. The artery had to have ruptured \u201cvery shortly before death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Liability for Murder Without Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Defendants contend the jury instructions erroneously permitted them to be found guilty of murder without malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">The jury was instructed on the natural and probable consequences doctrine, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">\u201cOne who aids and abets another in the commission of a crime i[s] not only guilty of that crime, but is also guilty of any other crime committed by a principal which is a natural and probable consequence of the crime originally aided and abetted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cIn order to find a defendant guilty of the crime of murder . . . based upon aiding and abetting, you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201c1) The crime of felony child endangerment was committed,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201c2) The defendant aided and abetted the crime of felony child endangerment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201c3) A [c]o-[p]rincipal in the crime of felony child endangerment committed the crime of murder . . . and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201c4) The crime of murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the crime of felony child endangerment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201cIn determining whether the crime of murder was a natural and probable consequence, you must determine whether a reasonable person in the [d]efendant\u2019s position would have known that the crime was a reasonable foreseeable consequence of the act aided and abetted. In making this determination, you must consider those circumstances which the defendant knew, taking into account all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular defendant[\u2019]s conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The jury was also given the following special instruction, which defendants call the \u201c \u2018either/or\u2019 instruction\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">\u201cThose who aid and abet a crime and those who directly perpetrate the crime are principals and equally guilty of the commission of that crime. You need not unanimously agree, nor individually determine, whether a defendant is an aider and abettor or a direct perpetrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">\u201cThe individual jurors themselves need not choose among the theories, so long as each is convinced of guilt, There may be a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the direct perpetrator, and a similar doubt that he was the aider and abettor, but no such doubt that he was one or the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Defendants note that, under the second degree felony-murder rule, a defendant can be found guilty of murder, even in the absence of malice, if he or she committed the homicide in the perpetration of an inherently dangerous felony. (See <em>People v. Hansen </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 300, 308 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 609, 885 P.2d 1022]; <em>People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 244, 257-258 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 7].) Defendants also note that felony child abuse is not an inherently dangerous felony for this purpose. (See <em>People v. Lee </em>(1991) 234 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Cal.App.3d 1214, 1220-1229 [286 Cal.Rptr. 117]; <em>People v. Caffero </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 678, 682-684 [255 Cal.Rptr. 22].) Defendants apparently argue the <em>only </em>way they could be found guilty of murder, absent malice, is under the felony-murder rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">This is not the law. Under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, \u201c1 \u201c. . . the aider and abettor in a proper case is not only guilty of the particular crime that to his knowledge his confederates are contemplating committing, but he is also liable for the natural and reasonable consequences of any act that he knowingly aided or encouraged.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 12, fn. 5 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392], italics omitted, quoting <em>People v.

It allows an aider and abettor to be convicted of murder, without malice, even where the target offense is not an inherently dangerous felony. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Lucas </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 721, 732-733 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 282] [target offense of brandishing a firearm]; <em>People v. Laster </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1463-1466 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 680] [target offense of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Indeed, defendants eventually concede that: \u201c[W]here two or more defendants have committed an unlawful act in which a death has resulted, and the state has proven that one of the defendants actually harbored the malice necessary for a murder conviction (either express or implied), it may be appropriate to rely on the natural and probable consequence doctrine to hold the other defendants liable.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) We agree. <em>(People v. Mendoza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1114, 1123 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 959 P.2d 735] [to find perpetrator guilty of murder, jury had to find he acted with malice; to find aider and abettor guilty of murder, jury had to find he knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted target offense, and murder was natural and probable consequence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Defendants therefore argue that, here, the jury was not required to find that either defendant harbored malice.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the contention that an instruction on the natural and probable consequences doctrine is erroneous because it permits an aider and abettor to be found guilty of murder without malice. <em>(People v. Garrison </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 777-778 [254 Cal.Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1231-1232 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795].) \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>mens rea of an accomplice is \u2018not designed to ensure that his conduct constitutes the offense with which he is charged. His liability is vicarious. . . . [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018It is the intent to encourage and bring about conduct that is criminal, not the specific intent that is an element of the target offense, which . . . must be found by the jury.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garrison, supra, </em>at p. 778, quoting <em>People v. Croy, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 12, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Defendants point to the \u201ceither/or\u201d instruction. Despite this instruction, however, the jury <em>did </em>have to find that some defendant harbored malice. The obvious candidate was the one who delivered a piledriver blow to Joey\u2019s stomach. The jury simply did not have to find whether that defendant was Garcia or Culuko.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The \u201ceither/or\u201d instruction was a correct statement of law. It derived from cases holding the jury need not agree unanimously on whether the defendant was the perpetrator or the aider and abettor, and, accordingly, the trial court need not instruct the jury to agree unanimously on this. <em>(People v.

First, defendants are not arguing the trial court failed to give a unanimity instruction; they are arguing it erred by <em>affirmatively </em>instructing the jurors that they did <em>not </em>have to agree unanimously. As it has been held that there is no applicable unanimity requirement, however, we cannot see how the trial court erred by telling the jury so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Second, the instruction stated that <em>each individual juror </em>did not have to decide whether any given defendant was the perpetrator or the aider and abettor. This particular aspect of the instruction was nearly a direct quote from <em>People v. Santamaria </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 903, 919 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884 P.2d 81], in which the Supreme Court said: \u201cNot only is there no unanimity requirement as to the theory of guilt, the individual jurors themselves need not choose among the theories, so long as each is convinced of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>guilt. Sometimes, as probably occurred here, the jury simply cannot decide beyond a reasonable doubt exactly who did what. There may be a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the direct perpetrator, and a similar doubt that he was the aider and abettor, but no such doubt that he was one or the other.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 919.) The court concluded it would be \u201cabsurd ... to let the defendant go free because each individual juror had a reasonable doubt as to his exact role.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p, 920, fn. 8; accord, <em>People v. Garrison, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at pp. 781-782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">We therefore hold the instructions quoted above did not permit the jury to find defendants guilty of murder without the necessary finding of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Application of the Merger Doctrine<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The Application of the Natural and Probable Consequences Doctrine to an \u201cAct\u201d as Opposed to a \u201cCrime\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Defendants contend the instructions erroneously allowed the jury to apply the natural and probable consequences doctrine to the \u201ccrime\u201d of felony child abuse rather than to any particular \u201cact\u201d of felony child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The Supreme Court has not clearly specified whether the natural and probable consequences doctrine looks to the consequences of an \u201cact\u201d or a \u201ccrime.\u201d In earlier cases, the court stated the doctrine in terms of an \u201cact.\u201d For example, in <em>People v. Durham, </em>it said: \u201c \u2018[T]he aider and abettor in a proper case is . . . also liable for the natural and reasonable or probable consequences of any <em>act </em>that he knowingly aided or encouraged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

Similarly, in <em>People v. Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318], it said: \u201cThe liability of an aider and abettor extends also to the natural and reasonable consequences of the <em>acts </em>he knowingly and intentionally aids and encourages.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 560, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">More recently, however, the court has stated the natural and probable consequences doctrine in terms of a \u201ccrime\u201d or \u201coffense.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Prettyman </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 248 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013], it said: \u201c[A] person who aids and abets a confederate in the commission of a criminal act is liable ... for any other offense (nontarget crime) committed by the confederate as a \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of the <em>crime </em>originally aided and abetted.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 254, italics added.) Likewise, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, </em>it said: \u201c[T]he aider and abettor is guilty ... of any other crime the direct perpetrator actually commits that is a natural and probable consequence of the target <em>offense.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1123, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On a few occasions, the court has spoken out of both sides of its mouth. <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 679, fn. 16 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 573, 941 P.2d 752], cert. den.

Felony child abuse, however, has been held to be a continuous course of conduct crime. <em>(People v. Vargas </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1455, 1460-1464 [251 Cal.Rptr. 904]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheffield </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 158, 167 [214 Cal.Rptr. 40]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewing </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 714, 717 [140 Cal.Rptr. 299].)  A continuous course of conduct crime is one in which the actus reus is defined as a series of acts over a period of time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitham </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1295 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 571]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 287, 300 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 483].) Typical continuous course of conduct crimes include misdemeanor child annoyance, pimping, pandering, failure to provide for a minor child, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and dissuading a witness from testifying. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gear </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 86, 92 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 261], cert. den. (1994) 511 U.S. 1088 [114 S.Ct. 1846, 128 L.Ed.2d 471], and cases cited.) The primary significance of defining a crime as a continuous course of conduct is that the jury need not agree unanimously that the defendant committed any particular act or acts; it need only agree unanimously that he or she engaged in the prohibited conduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adames </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 198, 206-208 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 631]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitham, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1294-1297.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Here, there was evidence of a number of discrete acts, any one of which the jurors could have found to constitute felony child abuse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These included the twisting and breaking of Joey\u2019s leg, the fracturing of his ribs, the punch to his face, and the violent shaking, in addition to the final, fatal punch. Also, it is at least arguable that the jurors could have found felony child abuse based on the bruises on Joey\u2019s arms and legs, bottom, and forehead (i.e., the one Tanja Starns saw, plus the ones found at the autopsy), the bruise on his ear, and/or the bite marks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, as to Culuko, the jurors could have found felony child abuse based on her merely leaving Joey in Garcia\u2019s dubious care.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Defendants therefore argue the trial court should have instructed that the natural and probable consequences doctrine applies to an \u201cact.\u201d In essence, in defendants\u2019 view, the jurors should have been required to: (1) identify each particular act of felony child abuse; (2) determine whether the defendant who did not perpetrate that act of felony child abuse did aid and abet it; and, if so, (3) determine whether murder was the natural and probable consequence of that act of felony child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Instead, the jurors were instructed to determine whether \u201c[t]he crime of murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the <em>crime of </em>felony child endangerment.\u201d (Italics added.) According to defendants, this opened the door to a legally incorrect conviction; for example, it permitted the jurors to reason that: (1) Culuko aided and abetted <em>some </em>act of felony child abuse by Garcia; (2) murder was the natural and probable consequence of some <em>other </em>act of felony child abuse by Garcia; and hence, (3) Culuko was guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Defendants\u2019 instructional model suggests the aider and abettor must intend to facilitate the specific \u201cact\u201d by which the perpetrator ultimately commits the intended crime. This is clearly not the law. \u201c \u2018A person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she, (i) with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator, (ii) and with the intent or purpose of committing, facilitating or encouraging commission of the crime, (iii) by act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the commission of the <em>crime.\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 851 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673], italics added, quoting <em>People v. Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1158, 1164 [282 Cal.Rptr. 450, 811 P.2d 742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">If, however, the perpetrator ultimately commits some different or additional crime, the natural and probable consequences doctrine is triggered.  \u201c[T]he test of natural and probable consequences is an objective one. [Citation.] \u2018[T]he issue does not turn on the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind, but depends upon whether, under all of the circumstances presented, a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have or should have known that the charged offense was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the act aided and abetted by the defendant.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Smith </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1480 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 604], quoting <em>People v. Nguyen </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 518, 531 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 323].) Thus, in applying the natural and probable consequences doctrine, the jury must consider the aider and abettor\u2019s actual circumstances. The aider and abettor may intend or expect the perpetrator to commit the crime in the form of a single, well-defined criminal \u201cact.\u201d On the other hand, the aider and abettor may have only the vaguest idea of the precise \u201cact\u201d by which the perpetrator will commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>People v. Prettyman, </em>the Supreme Court held that instructions identifying the target crime will help the jury with this analysis: \u201c[[Identification of the target crime will facilitate the jury\u2019s task of determining whether the charged crime allegedly committed by the aider and abettor\u2019s confederate was indeed a natural and probable consequence of any uncharged target crime that, the prosecution contends, the defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted. The facts of this case illustrate this point. If . . . the jury had concluded that defendant Bray had encouraged codefendant Prettyman to commit an assault on Van Camp but that Bray had no reason to believe that Prettyman would use a deadly weapon such as a steel pipe to commit the assault, then the jury could not properly find that the murder of Van Camp was a natural and probable consequence of the assault encouraged by Bray. [Citation.] If, on the other hand, the jury had concluded that Bray encouraged Prettyman to assault Van Camp with the steel pipe, or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, then it could appropriately find that Prettyman\u2019s murder of Van Camp was a natural and probable consequence of that assault. Therefore, instructions identifying and describing the crime of assault with a deadly weapon or by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury ... as the appropriate target crime would have assisted the jury in determining whether Bray was guilty of Van Camp\u2019s murder under the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>(People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>In our view, merely instructing the jury to determine whether murder was the natural and probable consequence of the \u201cact\u201d aided and abetted could hurt more than it helps. The jury could take this too broadly, as meaning the \u201cact\u201d the perpetrator actually performed\u2014in the Supreme Court\u2019s example, assault with a steel pipe\u2014even if the aider and abettor could not reasonably foresee it. Contrariwise, the jury could also take it too narrowly, as limiting it to some \u201cact\u201d that the aider and abettor actually intended. Thus, if it found the aider and abettor intended to facilitate an assault with a knife, but the perpetrator actually committed an assault with a steel pipe, the jury might erroneously conclude that murder was not the natural and probable consequence of the assault aided and abetted.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We believe the best way to convey the crucial legal principle is by an entirely separate instruction. Here, the trial court gave such an instruction. It explained: \u201cIn determining whether the crime of murder was a natural and probable consequence, you must determine whether a reasonable person in the [defendant's position would have known that the crime was a reasonable foreseeable consequence of the act aided and abetted. In making this determination, you must consider those circumstances which the defendant knew, taking into account all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular defendant[\u2019]s conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">This instruction was adequate. It prevented the jurors from finding Culuko guilty of murder, merely because she aid\u00e9d and abetted Garcia\u2019s commission of felony child abuse, if it was unforeseeable that Garcia would commit murder as a result. At the same time, it <em>allowed </em>the jurors to find Culuko guilty of murder if she <em>did </em>aid and abet <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>commission of felony child abuse, and if it <em>was </em>foreseeable that Garcia would commit murder as a result. Moreover, it did not erect an artificial requirement that Culuko had to intend and encourage Garcia to deliver the fatal punch to the abdomen. It could be sufficient that she intended and encouraged Garcia to brutalize the baby any way he chose, as long as murder was a foreseeable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Indeed, defendants concede that, \u201c[i]n the typical case,\u201d this instruction would be adequate to \u201cresolve any confusion.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They argue, however, it was inadequate here because felony child abuse is a continuing course of conduct crime, and therefore the jurors did not have to agree unanimously on the \u201cact\u201d or \u201cacts\u201d constituting felony child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Precisely <em>because </em>unanimity was not required, however, the jury instructions were adequate. Defendants were not entitled to an instruction requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the jurors to identify or agree on an act of felony child abuse. Defendants also were not entitled to an instruction requiring the jurors to agree on whether either of them was guilty as an aider and abettor rather than as a perpetrator; a fortiori, they were not entitled to an instruction requiring the jurors to identify or agree on an act of aiding and abetting. Defendants <em>were </em>entitled to an instruction limiting their liability for murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine to the reasonably foreseeable consequences of an act of felony child abuse which they aided and abetted. Such an instruction was given. We reject defendants\u2019 claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The Liability of a Perpetrator Under the Natural and Probable Consequences Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">At our request, the parties submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing the question of whether each defendant was a perpetrator of felony child abuse, rather than an aider and abettor, so that the natural and probable consequences doctrine did not apply. Understandably, defendants took the affirmative in this debate, while the People argued the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">We have since concluded that, even if defendants were perpetrators, they could still be liable under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. This is the teaching of <em>People v. Olguin </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 596]. There Olguin, Mora, and Hilario, all members of the same gang, encountered several members of a rival gang, including victim Ramirez. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1366-1367.) After an initial verbal confrontation, Mora punched Ramirez in the face, knocking him down. Ramirez got up and started walking toward the defendants. Olguin then shot and killed Ramirez. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1367.) Both Olguin and Mora were found guilty of second degree murder. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">On appeal, Mora argued the natural and probable consequences doctrine did not apply to him because he was the perpetrator of the target assault on Ramirez. <em>(People v. Olguin, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 1375.) The appellate court disagreed: \u201cThe flaw in Mora\u2019s reasoning is that a perpetrator of an assault and an aider and abettor are <em>equally </em>liable for the natural and foreseeable consequences of their crime. Both the perpetrator and the aider and abettor are principals, and <em>all </em>principals are liable for the natural and reasonably foreseeable consequences of their crimes. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1376.) \u201cIn fact, this case aptly demonstrates the folly of Mora\u2019s position. If it were adopted, Hilario, who did nothing but stand by and watch, could be convicted of murder if the jury were convinced he was there to back up his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>homeboys and. thereby encouraged Olguin and Mora in the assault on Ramirez. But Mora, who actually perpetrated the assault, would escape liability on the basis that he was the party who initiated the action, [f] Fortunately, that is not the law. Mora was a principal in the assault on Ramirez and therefore responsible for the natural and probable consequences of that assault.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Here, the jury could have found that Garcia and Culuko were both liable for felony child abuse as perpetrators. Even if so, each of them could be liable, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, for a murder perpetrated by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Although the jury was never so instructed (see pt. VI, <em>post), </em>this lacuna was entirely favorable to defendants. It precluded them from being found derivatively liable for murder based solely on their perpetration of \u201cpassive\u201d felony child abuse, i.e., permitting suffering, injury, or danger to a child. Rather, each of them could be found derivatively liable for murder only as the aider and abettor of felony child abuse. As the jury was instructed, this required some \u201cactive\u201d conduct. Nevertheless, the fact that each defendant could have been found guilty, as the perpetrator, of felony child abuse did not bar the operation of the natural and probable consequences doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u201cActive\u201d Aiding and Abetting Versus \u201cPassive\u201d Felony Child Abuse</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Defendants contend that aiding and abetting liability\u2014particularly liability under the natural and probable consequences doctrine\u2014requires an affirmative act, whereas felony child abuse can be committed by an omission to act. They conclude that \u201c. . . the natural and probable consequence theory of liability . . . should have had no application to a [felony child abuse] prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Defendants raised this contention for the first time in response to our request for supplemental briefing. However, it does not appear to be within the scope of our request. For this reason, and because it was not raised in their opening briefs, or even in their reply briefs, this contention has been waived. <em>(People v. Adams </em>(1990) 216 Cal.App.3d 1431, 1441, fn. 2 [265 Cal.Rptr. 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Alternatively, even if not waived, it lacks merit. We recognize that, at least ordinarily,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> mere failure to prevent a crime falls short of aiding and abetting. <em>(In re Michael T. </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 907, 911 [149 Cal.Rptr. 87].) Aiding and abetting requires that the defendant \u201cby act or advice, aids, promotes, encourages or instigates[] the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>(People v. Beeman, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 561.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Here, however, the jury was so instructed. Moreover, it was instructed that, to find a defendant guilty of murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, it had to find that that defendant aided and abetted the crime of felony child abuse. Thus, arguably the jury could have con-' victed either defendant of felony child abuse <em>as a principal </em>based solely on inaction. However, it could not have convicted him or her of felony child abuse <em>as an aider and abettor </em>based solely on inaction. It follows that it could not have convicted him or her of murder, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, based solely on inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">There was ample evidence that each defendant aided and abetted felony child abuse by more than mere inaction. There was evidence that Garcia personally hit the baby, even before the fatal blow was struck. Culuko called Hinz\u2019s attention to bruises on the baby and said she did not know where they came from. The jury could reasonably conclude Garcia inflicted them. Several times, when Garcia was alone with the baby, Strawn heard a slap or a thump against the wall, followed by the baby crying. Several witnesses saw Garcia strike the baby, admittedly in harmless ways, such as spanking him or flicking his finger against his forehead or chest; witnesses also saw severe bruises on the baby. The jury could put two and two together to conclude that, when no eyewitnesses were around, Garcia struck Joey more violently.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">There also was evidence that Culuko personally injured the baby by biting him. At least one of the bite marks was a few days older than the others. Both defendants repeatedly covered up for the perpetrator, explaining Joey had pinched himself or had fallen off a bed. The jury could reasonably find that, no matter which defendant perpetrated felony child abuse, the other defendant affirmatively aided and encouraged him or her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Failure to Instruct on Involuntary Manslaughter<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The Sufficiency of the Evidence That Garcia Was Guilty of Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Garcia contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Obviously, there was evidence that Garcia killed Joey. Garcia had stated he was taking full responsibility for the baby and was not letting Culuko touch him. Culuko accused Garcia of breaking a promise that Joey would be alive. The jury could take Garcia\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain . . . beat to death, [f] I only punched his heart like that,\u201d as an admission. In addition, as we discussed in part VI, <em>ante, </em>there was evidence he had hit Joey many times before. Finally, as we have already discussed at length in the nonpublished portion of this opinion, there was ample evidence that the person who struck the fatal blow did so with implied malice; indeed, there was no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Alternatively, there was ample evidence that, even if Garcia did not strike the fatal blow, he was guilty of murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine. After all, Garcia and Culuko were the only people who were with Joey during the final five days of his life. As defendants themselves acknowledged, one or the other of them had to be the killer. Also, as we have already held, the killer acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The jury could reasonably find that the nonkiller aided and abetted felony child abuse by the killer., Even assuming Culuko, rather than Garcia, was the killer, there was evidence that Garcia struck Joey repeatedly. Culuko bit him; Garcia admitted seeing the bite marks on his feet. When a bruise the size of a baseball appeared on Joey\u2019s bottom, both defendants told the same story: he had pinched himself. Garcia explained other bruises by claiming Joey had fallen off the bed. Inferably, defendants used the baby as a punching bag, then covered up for each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>On January 25, at 3:00 p.m., Roberts talked to Culuko on the phone. At that point, Joey had a broken leg; he may even have had broken ribs. Roberts could hear him crying. Culuko claimed he had fallen off the bed \u201cagain.\u201d Garcia must have known this was false. Nevertheless, when Roberts suggested that Culuko take the baby to a doctor, Garcia grabbed the phone, told Roberts to take the baby to a doctor herself because Culuko had to cook his dinner, and hung up. The jury could quite properly conclude that Garcia encouraged, aided, and abetted any felony child abuse perpetrated by Culuko.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Finally, there was evidence that murder was the natural and probable consequence of the felony child abuse. \u201cThe . . . question is not whether the aider and abettor <em>actually </em>foresaw the additional crime, but whether, judged objectively, it was <em>reasonably </em>foreseeable. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{People v. Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1133.) It had long been apparent that both Garcia and Culuko were, at best, callously unconcerned about Joey\u2019s well-being. Roberts had become sufficiently alarmed to call child protective services and, when that failed, to start keeping notes. During Joey\u2019s last five days, Garcia and Culuko were living alone with him in a single motel room. Joey had begun with only old bruises, but the severity of his injuries was escalating rapidly. He was in pain; he would have been crying. He was a helpless, utterly dependent seven-month-old baby. Given this evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendants should each have foreseen that the other would assault the baby, with deadly force, and with conscious disregard for his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As we noted earlier, in part II, <em>ante, </em>the jurors did not have to decide whether Garcia or Culuko actually delivered the fatal punch. Once they found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that each defendant was either guilty of murder as the perpetrator, or else was guilty of murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, it could properly find both defendants guilty of murder. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Garcia\u2019s second degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Garcia also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of fatal assault on a child under eight. In support of this contention, he incorporates by reference his arguments to the effect that there was insufficient evidence of murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore reject this argument for the same reasons we reject his arguments regarding murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>IX-</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Sufficiency of the Evidence of Care and Custody as to Garcia</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Garcia contends there was insufficient evidence that he had care and custody of Joey.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Fatal assault on a child requires, among other things, that the perpetrator have \u201ccare or custody\u201d of the child victim. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273ab.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Felony child abuse requires,' among other things, that the perpetrator \u201cwillfully causes or permits any child to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or having the care or custody of any child, willfully causes or permits the person or health of that child to be injured, or willfully causes or permits that child to be placed in a situation where his or her person or health is endangered . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273a, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Garcia contends that, under the latter statute, liability for inaction cannot be imposed absent evidence of some legal duty to take positive action. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Heitzman </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 189, 209-214 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 886 P.2d 1229] [defendant cannot be guilty of elder abuse under Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (a), based on failure to prevent abuse, unless defendant had either care and custody of victim or duty to control conduct of perpetrator].) We question Garcia\u2019s assumption that his felony child abuse conviction was necessarily predicated on his inaction. However, if we were to sustain this conviction based on the evidence that Garcia directly inflicted felony child abuse, we would still have to reach his \u201ccare and custody\u201d contention for purposes of his conviction for fatal assault on a child. Accordingly, we accept his assumption for the sake of argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">We reject, however, Garcia\u2019s apparent assumption that he had to be convicted of either crime as a perpetrator. The jury was essentially instructed that he could also be convicted as an aider and abettor. Although fatal assault on a child requires that the perpetrator have care and custody of the child, it does not so require as to an aider and abettor. <em>(People v. Fraize </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1722, 1725 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 64] [\u201c[U]nder an aiding and abetting theory ... a defendant can properly be convicted of a crime even though by statutory definition the defendant would be incapable of committing the substantive offense by himself.\u201d].) Likewise, even assuming felony child abuse required in this case that the perpetrator have care and custody, there is no such requirement as to an aider and abettor. Thus, even assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>there was no evidence that Garcia had care and custody of Joey, his conviction of both offenses would stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We also reject Garcia\u2019s contention for a separate and alternative reason: There <em>was </em>sufficient evidence that he had care and custody of Joey. \u201c[There is] no special meaning to the terms \u2018care and custody\u2019 beyond the plain meaning of the terms themselves. The terms \u2018care or custody\u2019 do not imply a familial relationship but only a willingness to assume duties correspondent to the role of a caregiver.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cochran </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 826, 832 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 257].) Here, Garcia and Culuko were living together as husband and wife, in one room, with a baby. Strawn testified that Garcia took care of the baby; at times, Garcia was left alone with the baby. When interviewed by police,- Garcia admitted he bathed the baby, changed the baby, and gave the baby a bottle at 2:30 a.m. Finally, and most significantly, Roberts testified that, five days before Joey died, Garcia said he was taking full responsibility for caring for the baby so the baby would bond with him. The jury did not have to believe Garcia\u2019s protestations that he never had anything to do with the baby. To the contrary, it could take this obviously f\u00e1lse claim as additional evidence that, as Garcia well knew, he had care and custody of Joey.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Multiple Punishment in Violation of Penal Code Section 654<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">XI</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Gaut, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b231-12\">McKINSTER, Acting P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuY\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">I disagree with nearly every aspect, published and unpublished, of the majority opinion. However, I will not elaborate on each of the many ways in which I disagree with the majority. In my view, the approach the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>sanctions in this case absolved the prosecution of its duty to present evidence that proves each defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That, simply stated, is my primary disagreement and the focus of this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The facts of this case are distressing, to say the least. Jos\u00e9 (Joey) Galindo, in his short and tragic life, was unquestionably subjected to severe physical abuse and ultimately died as a result of that abuse. The fact of the abuse is clear and undisputed. What is not clear is who was responsible, either directly or indirectly, for Joey\u2019s injuries and ultimately for his death. Because the prosecutor could not prove which defendant inflicted the injury that killed Joey or the circumstances under which that injury was inflicted, the prosecutor relied on the theory that one defendant must have punched Joey and, therefore, was guilty as the actual perpetrator of second degree murder, and that the other defendant was an aider and abettor in the target crime of felony child endangerment, of which murder was the natural and probable consequence. Although I have serious doubts about the validity of the theory, I will not discuss those concerns. Even if correct, I part company with the majority in their application of that theory to the facts of this case, for reasons I now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The Prosecution\u2019s Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In an effort to prove both defendants guilty of murder, the prosecutor relied on the so-called natural and probable consequences theory of criminal responsibility which makes an aider and abettor in a target crime criminally responsible for an unintended crime committed by a coparticipant if the unintended crime is the natural and probable consequence of the originally agreed-upon target crime. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Prettyman </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 248 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013], a person who encourages or facilitates the commission of a crime is criminally responsible for that crime and \u201cany other offense that was a \u2018natural and probable consequence\u2019 of the crime aided and abetted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 260.) \u201cTo convict a defendant of a nontarget crime as an accomplice under the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 doctrine, the jury must find that, with knowledge of the perpetrator\u2019s unlawful purpose, and with the intent of committing, encouraging, or facilitating [i.e., aiding and abetting] the commission of the target crime, the defendant aided, promoted, encouraged, or instigated the commission of the target crime. The jury must also find that the defendant\u2019s confederate committed an offense other than the target crime, and that the nontarget offense perpetrated by the confederate was a \u2018natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and probable consequence\u2019 of the target crime that the defendant assisted or encouraged.\u201d <em>(People v. Prettyman, supra, </em>at p. 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s theory in this case was that both defendants engaged in a several-day course of conduct during which they each, individually and/or jointly, inflicted serious bodily injury on Joey and thereby each committed felony child endangerment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because both defendants allegedly abused Joey, the prosecutor asserted they were aiders and abettors of each other in committing felony child endangerment. According to the prosecutor\u2019s approach, as aiders and abettors in the target crime of felony child endangerment, defendants each were guilty of murder under the natural and probable consequences theory if one defendant, acting with express or implied malice, punched Joey and thereby committed second degree murder, and the other defendant aided and abetted in the target crime of felony child endangerment of which murder was a natural and probable consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In accordance with the above noted theory, and at the prosecutor\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jury, \u201cIn order to find a defendant guilty of the crime of murder as charged under Count I based upon aiding and abetting, you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that: [ft 1) [t]he crime of felony child endangerment was committed, [ft 2) [t]he defendant aided and abetted the crime of felony child endangerment, [ft 3) [a] [c]o[pjrincipal in the crime of felony child endangerment committed the crime of murder as charged under Count I, and, [ft 4) [t]he crime of murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the crime of felony child endangerment.\u201d According to the theory of felony child endangerment relied on in the trial court, and as the trial court instructed the jury, a person who has care or custody of a child, who, \u201cunder circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death . . . willfully causes or, as a result of criminal negligence, permits the child to be placed in a situation that endangers the child\u2019s person or health\u201d is guilty of felony child endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">In addition to instructing the jury on the natural and probable consequences theory of criminal liability based on aiding and abetting in felony child endangerment, the trial court also instructed the jury, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s special instruction, that the jury \u201cneed not unanimously agree, nor individually determine, whether a defendant is an aider and abettor or a direct perpetrator. [ft| The individual jurors themselves need not choose among the theories, so long as each is convinced of guilt. There may be a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the direct perpetrator, and a similar doubt that he was the aider and abettor, but no such doubt that he was one or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">These instructions, if correct statements of law, were incorrect as applied to the facts in this case and had the effect of allowing the jury to convict both defendants of murder without first deciding that either defendant committed that crime, and without agreeing that defendants aided and abetted each other in either committing felony child endangerment or in committing the act that caused Joey\u2019s death\u2014the blow to the abdomen. The defect is demonstrated by a review of the pertinent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The evidence showed more than one act of felony child endangerment\u2014 someone bit Joey, someone broke his leg, someone caused his severe bruises, someone broke his ribs, someone violently shook him and someone inflicted a severe blow to his abdomen that ultimately killed him. The pathologist testified that with the exception of the broken leg, most of Joey\u2019s injuries occurred very shortly before the infant died and most likely were inflicted at the same time as the fatal blow. From that testimony, a jury could \u25a0infer that whoever shook Joey also inflicted the fatal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">There is no direct evidence to show who inflicted each of the above noted injuries. Therefore, the validity of the prosecutor\u2019s theory depends on the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence to show that defendants aided and abetted each other in committing felony child abuse of which Joey\u2019s murder was a natural and probable consequence. Absent such evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s theory, regardless of its questionable legal correctness, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is evidence that, if found to be true, proves a fact from which an inference of the existence of another fact may be drawn. An inference is a deduction of fact that may logically and reasonably be drawn from another fact or group of facts established by the evidence.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.00 (6th ed. 1996).)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">With respect to the bite marks on Joey\u2019s foot and arm, the evidence shows that those marks appeared to match defendant Karen Lois Culuko\u2019s bite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>pattern. From that evidence, the jury reasonably could infer that Culuko bit Joey and thereby committed felony child endangerment. In order to hold defendant Leslie Eugene Garcia liable as an aider and abettor in Culuko\u2019s act of biting Joey the evidence had to show, as the trial court instructed the jury, that he aided, promoted, encouraged or instigated Culuko\u2019s conduct. There was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, presented at trial regarding Garcia\u2019s involvement in Culuko\u2019s infliction of the bites. Consequently, a jury could not find that he aided, promoted, encouraged or instigated Culuko\u2019s act because such a finding would not have been supported by any evidence. On this state of the evidence, it is as possible that defendant Culuko bit Joey without defendant Garcia\u2019s participation or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Absent evidence that Garcia aided arid abetted Culuko\u2019s act of biting Joey, the only other basis for holding Garcia liable for felony child endangerment as a result of Culuko\u2019s act was that Garcia negligently permitted that act of endangerment to occur. As previously discussed, there was no evidence showing that defendant Garcia knew Culuko intended to injure Joey by biting him and, therefore, the evidence does not prove Garcia\u2019s liability for permitting that conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Apart from statutory liability for felony child endangerment based on negligently permitting Joey\u2019s injuries to occur, there is no other basis for holding Garcia criminally responsible for Culuko\u2019s act of biting Joey. Thus, assuming there was evidence to support an inference that Garcia knew Culuko was injuring Joey and that he failed to protect the child from continued injury, because Garcia was not Joey\u2019s father, he had no duty to intervene apart from that imposed by the felony child endangerment statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the author of the majority opinion recently noted, before criminal liability may be predicated on a person\u2019s failure to act, the person first must be under a legal duty to take affirmative action. <em>(People v. Laster </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1466-1467 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 680], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Heitzman </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 189, 198 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 886 P.2d 1229].) No such duty existed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Applying the above analysis to Joey\u2019s remaining injuries, I must reach the same conclusion\u2014there is insufficient evidence to show that Garcia aided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>and abetted any of Culuko\u2019s actions. More particularly, assuming without actually deciding that the fact Culuko bit Joey is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support an inference that she also inflicted the other injuries,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there was no evidence to show that Garcia, with knowledge of Culuko\u2019s unlawful purpose and with the intent of committing, encouraging, or facilitating that purpose, aided and ab\u00e9tted Culuko in the commission of those acts. Thus, at best the evidence would support Culuko\u2019s conviction for the charged offenses on the theory that she was the actual perpetrator of those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The remaining question is whether there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to show that Garcia actually perpetrated the acts that caused Joey\u2019s other injuries and ultimately his death and that Culuko, in turn, aided and abetted Garcia\u2019s conduct. According to the evidence presented at trial, as recounted by the majority, witnesses saw Garcia spank Joey on the bottom, \u201cflick\u201d him with his finger, \u201cswat\u201d him in the head and on the chest and slap him, presumably in the face. This evidence supports an inference that Garcia, like Culuko, was capable of injuring Joey and therefore was also capable of inflicting the other injuries. Once again, assuming without actually deciding that such evidence is sufficient to support an inference that Garcia actually inflicted Joey\u2019s other injuries, there is no evidence that Culuko with knowledge of Garcia\u2019s purpose, and with the intent of committing, encouraging, or facilitating that purpose, aided and abetted Garcia in the commission of his acts of felony child endangerment. In short, this evidence might be sufficient to support Garcia\u2019s conviction on the charged offenses had the jury been instructed to actually and separately determine each defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In summary, the evidence is insufficient to show that each defendant aided and abetted the other in a continuing course of felony child abuse, of which Joey\u2019s murder was a natural and probable consequence. Any contrary conclusion, given the total absence of evidence on this point, is purely speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Error</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The above analysis reveals the defect in the majority\u2019s resolution of the issues in this case. The evidence was insufficient to establish that defendants aided and abetted each other, either actively or passively, in the individual acts of alleged felony child endangerment. Therefore, the evidence could not establish that they engaged in a joint course of conduct involving felony child endangerment. The evidence shows separate and distinct acts of felony child endangerment but no acts of aiding and abetting and thus no aider and abettor liability for murder under the natural and probable consequences theory. The failure of proof was not corrected or otherwise altered by describing the individual acts as a joint course of conduct. The defect, i.e., the absence of aiding and abetting evidence, persists despite the description. In short, if the acts were insufficient to establish guilt when considered individually they remain insufficient when considered collectively because, to put it bluntly, zero plus zero equals zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Had the trial court required the jury to unanimously agree on the specific act of felony child endangerment that constituted the basis for the natural and probable consequences theory of liability, the defect in the prosecutor\u2019s approach in this case would have been exposed early on. However, the trial court not only did not instruct on unanimity but, in fact, instructed the jury precisely the opposite in giving the prosecutor\u2019s special instruction on aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">That instruction, as previously noted, told the jury that they \u201cneed not unanimously agree, nor individually determine, whether a defendant is an aider and abettor or a direct perpetrator, [f] The individual jurors themselves need not choose among the theories, so long as each is convinced of guilt. There may be a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the direct perpetrator, and a similar doubt that he was the aider and abettor, but no such doubt that he was one or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The instruction is taken from <em>People </em>v. <em>Santamaria </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 903 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884 P.2d 81], in which the Supreme Court held on appeal from a murder conviction that an acquittal on a knife-use special allegation did not collaterally estop the prosecution from retrying the defendant for murder on the theory the defendant stabbed and killed the victim. In addressing the requirement under the collateral estoppel doctrine that the previously resolved issue and the current issue be identical, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Court noted the jury could have found the defendant guilty of murder as either an aider and abettor or the actual perpetrator. In the context of discussing that point, as well as discussing the defendant\u2019s assertion that the acquittal on the knife-use allegation necessarily meant the jury unanimously found the defendant guilty as an aider and abettor, the Supreme Court stated, \u201cNot only is there no unanimity requirement as to the theory of guilt, the individual jurors themselves need not choose among the theories, so long as each is convinced of guilt. Sometimes as probably occurred here, the jury simply cannot decide beyond a reasonable doubt exactly who did what. There may be a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the direct perpetrator, and a similar doubt that he was the aider and abettor, but no such doubt that he was one or the other.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Santamaria, supra, </em>at p. 919.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The majority notes that the instruction is a correct statement of law and, therefore, the jury properly was instructed on the legal principle. I am not as sanguine. Although the instruction is a correct statement of law, there is nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Santamaria, </em>or any of the cases cited by the majority, to suggest that a jury should be instructed on the above quoted principle. Assuming, however, that the principle is one about which a jury should be instructed, the instruction was erroneous in this case. The principle embodied in the prosecutor\u2019s special instruction is derived from cases that address the question of whether a unanimity instruction is necessary when the evidence supports guilt on a single criminal charge under more than one theory of criminal liability. Thus, for example, in <em>People v. Gonzales </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1248 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 537], cited by the prosecutor in the trial court as authority for the above quoted special instruction, the defendant was charged with first degree burglary. There was evidence that the defendant entered the burglarized residence and thus was the actual perpetrator of that crime and there also was evidence that the defendant aided and abetted his companion\u2019s entry into the residence. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that such evidence required a unanimity instruction, the Sixth District held that it was not necessary for the jury to unanimously agree whether the defendant was an aider and abettor or the actual perpetrator of the burglary. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1255.) In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Gonzales </em>court discussed various cases that have rejected the requirement of unanimity in this context, i.e., evidence showing the defendant could be guilty as an aider and abettor and also as the actual perpetrator. <em>(People v. Gonzales, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1252-1255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The cases the <em>Gonzales </em>court relied on to support its conclusion all involved prosecutions for a single crime but on different theories of criminal liability. For example in <em>People v. Beardslee </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 68 [279 Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311], the defendant was prosecuted for murder on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the theory that he was an aider and abettor or the actual perpetrator. The facts were undisputed that the defendant kidnapped the victim and personally loaded the gun that was used to inflict the fatal wound. The only factual dispute was whether the defendant or his coparticipant pulled the trigger and thereby inflicted the wound that actually killed the victim. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that the jury should have been instructed that they had to unanimously agree on whether the defendant was the actual killer or an aider and abettor, the <em>Beardslee </em>court first noted that the unanimity requirement \u201ctypically applies to acts that could have been charged as separate offenses. ... A jury may convict a defendant of first degree murder, however, without making a unanimous choice of one or more of several theories proposed by the prosecution, e.g., that the murder was deliberate and premeditated or that it was committed in the course of a felony. \u2018[I]t is sufficient that each juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of first degree murder as that offense is defined by the statute.\u2019 [Citations.] Pursuant to the latter rule, it was held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Forbes </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 807, 816-817 [221 Cal.Rptr. 275], that a conviction of second degree murder did not require unanimous agreement by the jurors on whether the accused was the actual perpetrator or was an aider and abettor.\u201d <em>(People v. Beardslee, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 92.) Unanimity is required, however, \u201c \u2018if the jurors could otherwise disagree which act a defendant committed and yet convict him of the crime charged.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">This case involves multiple alleged acts of felony child endangerment about which the jury could disagree, as previously discussed, and the instruction was incorrect for that reason alone. More significantly, however, under the natural and probable consequences theory of liability relied on in this case, whether a defendant was an aider and abettor or the actual perpetrator was not merely a theory of liability. Instead, it was an element of the crime, specifically, murder based on the natural and probable consequences of aiding and abetting in felony child endangerment and therefore the jury had to determine in this case whether a defendant was one or the other. In other words, the special instruction arguably would have been appropriate if the prosecutor were only proving the target crime of felony child endangerment based only on a single instance of such conduct. However, in order to elevate defendants\u2019 guilt on the target offense to guilt for murder under the natural and probable consequences theory, the prosecutor had to prove not only that one person aided and abetted in an act of felony child endangerment but, also, that the other person committed second degree murder as the actual perpetrator. .Therefore, the defendant\u2019s status as either an aider or abettor or the actual perpetrator was an element of the offense about which the jury had to unanimously agree. By instructing the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>they need not \u201cunanimously agree, or individually determine, whether a defendant is an aider and abettor or a direct perpetrator,\u201d the trial court allowed the jury to find both defendants guilty of murder without requiring them to decide that either defendant actually committed that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In fact, the prosecutor made that precise argument to the jury in closing. In explaining how the jury could find murder based on the evidence that both defendants engaged in felony child endangerment, the prosecutor stated, \u201cThey encouraged it, they facilitated it. [\u2018]This is the way we treat Joey. I hit him, you hit him, we both neglect him. This is the way it is.[\u2019] [ft Mr. Swanson [Culuko\u2019s attorney] told you during his opening that at the end of this case you would not be able to find his client guilty because I would not be able to prove to you that she inflicted the fatal blow, [ft <em>An instruction the Court will give you, [\u2018]those who aid and abet a crime and those who directly perpetrate the crime are principals and equally guilty of the commission of the crime. You need not unanimously agree nor individually determine whether a defendant is an aider and abetter </em>[szc] <em>or the direct perpetrator, </em>[ft <em>The jurors themselves need not choose among the theories so long as each are [sic] convinced of guilt, </em>[ft <em>There may be a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the direct perpetrator and a similar doubt that he was the aider and abetter [sic], but no such doubt that he was one or the </em>other.[\u2019] <em>And isn\u2019t that what you have here. As I said before, some of you may believe Defendant Culuko did this crime, committed this murder. Some of you may think that Defendant Garcia did, and some of you, quite frankly may not know, but you cannot have any doubt that they each aided and abetted in the endangerment of this baby and that the natural and probable consequences of their conduct resulted in this baby\u2019s death.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The effect of the trial court\u2019s erroneous jury instructions in this case, as evidenced by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, was that they enabled the jury to convict both defendants of all the charged offenses without deciding that either of them committed those crimes and, in fact without having to agree on any fact pertinent to those convictions. The impact of this error was that it enabled the jury to convict defendants without requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>prosecutor to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For this reason, I would reverse defendants\u2019 convictions on all counts and remand the matter to the trial court for new trials as to both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Appellants\u2019 petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied May 24, 2000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-13\">An expert witness defined the frenulum as \u201cthat little fold on the inside of your upper lip you can feel in the middle if you run your tongue across it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-12\">According to Garcia\u2019s time card, he was off sick on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 23 and 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-13\">The making of this call was also shown by the testimony of Garcia\u2019s father\u2014who doubled as his employer\u2014as well as a telephone bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Felony child abuse is committed by: \u201cAny person who, under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, [1] willfully [a] causes or permits any child to suffer, or [b] inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or [2] having the care or custody of any child, willfully causes or permits the person or health of that child to be injured, or [3] willfully causes or permits that child to be placed in a situation where his or her person or health is endangered . . . .\u201d (Pen.

That fact supports an inference that Culuko was capable of injuring the child and thus could have inflicted the other injuries. Since the jury in this case was not called upon to assess the individual liability of each defendant, I will not determine whether such evidence is sufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Culuko in fact broke Joey\u2019s leg, broke his ribs, shook him or hit him in the abdomen with sufficient force to rupture abdominal arteries. In my view, that determination is one that a properly instructed jury should make and is why the convictions in this case cannot stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Apart from the obvious error in advising the jury that they did not have to decide who committed what act, or even agree on what happened, the prosecutor also incorrectly told the jury that all they had to decide, in order to find both defendants guilty of murder, was that Joey\u2019s <em>death </em>was the natural and probable consequence of the target offense. Correctly stated, what the jury had to find in order to convict both defendants of murder was that one defendant killed Joey and in doing so acted with express or implied malice such that the killing constituted <em>murder </em>and that the murder was the natural and probable consequence of the target crime in which the other defendant aided and abetted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The record reveals that the jury relied on the aiding and abetting theory in reaching its verdicts as evidenced by a note they sent during their deliberations asking the judge to clarify which counts that theory applied to. The judge responded that it applied to all counts. The jury rendered its verdicts almost immediately after receiving the judge\u2019s answer to their question and after only one full day of deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
