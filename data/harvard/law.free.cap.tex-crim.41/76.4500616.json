A. Gray (the deceased in this habeas corpus trial) by shooting him, the said W. A. Gray with a pistol. That said indictment is in due form, and is the identical transaction and homicide for, the commission of which he was duly committed to the custody of the sheriff of Robertson County upon the hearing from which the appeal in this cause was prosecuted.
