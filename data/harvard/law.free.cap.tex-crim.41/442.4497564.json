On the day of the general election in November, 1898, deceased, appellant, and. Bis brother, George Van Young, were at Stubners, the polling place, in Harris County. Deceased left, starting home on his usual route. Defendant got in his buggy, and followed hastily after him. George Van Young, brother of defendant, followed on horseback. T. R. Cochran was riding with deceased, and they were on horseback at the time of the difficulty, and he testified: \u201cDeceased and myself left the polls after 11 o\u2019clock in the morning, and on our way home, after we were off from the schoolhouse about 250 or 300 yards, Wallace Young, in his buggy, and George Young on horseback, came up. We turned to the right to let them pass. Wallace Young drove up even with us and stopped. He s,aid \u2018Good morning\u2019 to us; and said to deceased, T have heard that you have been before the grand jury to get a bill against me.\u2019 Sutton said, \u2018Yes, I have been to Houston.\u2019 Defendant said to deceased, \u2018You are a damned\u2019 something. I do not exactly remember the word. It might have been \u2018damned rascal\u2019 or \u2018damn dirty pup;\u2019 something to that effect. Deceased seemed to ask what he was going to do about it. \u2018Do you want to settle it ?\u2019 Defendant told him it was all right with him; that he was ready to settle it then. Deceased said: T am ready to settle it. Wallace and I will settle it any way you want to.\u2019 Defendant then got out of his buggy on the left side, and George Van Young got off from his horse, and stepped in between them. Deceased was still on his horse. It seems then that deceased unbuttoned his vest; and it seemed to me it was going to be a fist fight from his actions. He was still on his horse after he made these motions with his coat and vest. He reached for his saddle pocket. After getting his saddle pockets unbuckled, he pulled out his gun (a 45 Colt\u2019s), and I asked and begged him not to do that, or \u2018Don\u2019t do that Bob; don\u2019t shoot.\u2019 I said that several times. Sutton, as soon as he had his gun out, shot while I was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t shoot;\u2019 and shot George Van Young. George Van Young never said a word when Sutton fired. After the second shot, defendant reached and pulled out a Winchester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>from his buggy, just while Sutton was firing the second shot at him. Sutton\u2019s horse got excited, and ran down the road. All the while Sutton was leaning forward on the horse\u2019s neck; all the time firing behind. About fifty yards his horse commenced pitching. Sutton then fell from his horse in the ditch. After falling in the ditch, defendant walked towards, him; deceased firing, leaning on his elbow, two more shots at defendant; defendant firing also. George Van Young was killed at the first shot fired by Sutton.\u201d Appellant testified in his own behalf: That after he overtook deceased and Cochran, he spoke to them as stated above, and said: \u201c \u2018Bob, I have heard you went before the grand jury to get a hill against me on account of that Lopez yearling. Is that true?\u2019 And he replied: \u2018Yes, I did. What are you going to do about it?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I think you have acted the part of a low-down pup.\u2019 He said, \u2018Do you want to fight about it ?\u2019 at the same time throwing back his coat, as if he wanted a fisticuff; and I said, \u2018I will fight with you,\u2019 and got out of my buggy to tie my horse, and fight him a fist fight, as I thought. I walked out in the road away from my Winchester, which I left under the seat, and my brother walked in between us. Deceased was still on his horse. My brother had nothing in his hand, and did not say a word or do a thing. Deceased then pulled his pistol, and shot him down and killed him, and then fired at me; and I then turned, got my gun, and began firing at him; and his; horse ran, and he leaned and fired hack, and fell in the ditch, and raised on his arm, and fired at me, and I fired at him until I killed him. I do not know how many shots I fired. I had no idea of making a fight to kill him. If so, I would and could have killed him with my gun long before he murdered my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Bill of exceptions number 1 shows: \u201cCounsel for State asked the witness Willis Dillon \u2018What, if anything, deceased, Boh Sutton, said to him about the reason he was going home;\u2019 to which defendant objected, because hearsay, self-serving, and incompetent for any purpose. The court overuled the objections, and permitted witness to state that about five or ten minutes before-deceased left he told witness that he was going to leave, and go home, because he was afraid the Youngs were going to raise a difficulty with him.\u201d The court qualifies this bill as follows: \u201cThe State having rested its case, defendant called witness Willis Dillon for and did prove by him the reputation of George Van Young, when the State, as part of the res gestae, and in view of the fact that the reputation of both deceased, Bob Sutton, and George Van Young had been put in issue by defendant, asked the question of said witness; and the court permitted the same and the answer as set out in said bill; the evidence having shown that the place where the shooting occurred was about 150 to 200 yards from the election polls where the witness said Sutton had made the declaration.\u201d We do not think the evidence was res gestae, and believe appellant\u2019s contentions are correct,\u2014that the matter is self-serving and incompetent for any purpose. Certainly, .an ex parte statement made by deceased before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the difficulty commenced, not being brought home to appellant, could not prove anything in this case. It merely evidences the fears of deceased, and is not criminative evidence on the part of appellant. Johnson v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">By bill number 3 appellant excepts to the argument of counsel for State in discussing the fact \u201cthat defendant had brought a gun, in his buggy, to the place of election, which was in contravention of, and was punishable under the statutes of this State. The defendant, being apprehensive that such discussion, in the conclusion of the case, to which he had no opportunity to reply, or against which to caution the jury, asked the court to give instructions that they would disregard and give no significance to the fact that the law provided against and punished the carrying of weapons to a polling place; that defendant, was not now on trial for such an act, and they would not give any such act any consideration in this case,\u2014which request by counsel for defendant the court refused, which refusal by the court was clearly prejudicial, and did, in connection with the argument of the prosecution; prejudice the minds of the jurors against defendant in this cause, on account of the provisions against carrying deadly weapons to or near a polling place. To which defendant excepted,\u201d etc. The following qualification is added: \u201cCounsel for defendant stated all of the foregoing objections to the court in the pres\u00e9nce and hearing of the jury, and stated that defendant was not on trial charged with violating -the-law in carrying weapons to a polling place, but that he was on trial on a charge of killing deceased; and the court declined to give any instruction to the jury about it.\u201d We do not think the bare statement of counsel\u2019s objection to erroneous and hurtful argument should relieve the court of the duty of charging the law applicable to such conduct, and believe the court should have given the charge asked by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Appellant also contends that the court erred in permitting \u201cthe State to prove that deceased, George Van Young, had had a difficulty about a year preceding his death,\u2014such testimony being offered to counteract the testimony of defendant that he was a man of good,, peaceable, and orderly disposition and reputation; such- evidence of specific acts being wholly inadmissible for any purpose, except for the purpose of overcoming the testimony of the general good repute of said George Van Young, as there was nothing in the evidence itself, or any concurring evidence, which showed that the particular difficulty which he had was not one most unjustifiably forced upon himy and did not in any way tend to show that he was aggressive, or was not peaceable in his habits.\u201d We think this testimony was admissible on cross-examination of appellant\u2019s own witness, which witness had testified to the general good reputation of deceased, George Van Young, as being a peaceable and quiet citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is \u201cthat the court erred in failing to give a charge on the law of manslaughter, which was a part of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>clearly applicable to the case, and should have informed the jury, if they believed that defendant provoked or brought on the difficulty, but without any intention of killing deceased, or doing him some bodily harm, merely intending to inquire of deceased if he had undertaken to have him indicted, and thereafter made no demonstration of a graver nature than something looking to a simple assault and battery, and that, too, arising on the suggestion of deceased, * * * then, in that event, he would not be guilty of any grade of homicide above manslaughter.\u201d We think this contention is clearly within the line of the decisions of this court, and the facts in this case beyond dispute raise the issue. In Meuly v. State, 26 Texas Criminal Appeals, 274, this court said: \u201cHow, if the party\u2019s right of self-defense as to its extent \u2014that is, whether perfect or imperfect\u2014depends upon the intention with which he provoked the difficulty, and the intent is a fact to he found by the jury, then it seems clear that the charge of the court 'in cases where the evidence creates any doubt as to the character of the intent should always instruct the jury as to the distinction between the right of perfect and imperfect self-defense as applicable to the particular act committed by the accused, and the extent of his liability when measured by it.\u201d Jackson v. State, 25 Texas Crim. App., 314; Shannon v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 2; Green v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 449; Jones v. State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 612; King v. State, 13 Texas Crim. App., 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">In appellant\u2019s last ground of complaint he insists that the court -erred in his charge in limiting the right of appellant to kill deceased to the fact that deceased drew his pistol on, or first shot at, appellant, \u201cand defendant had reasonable apprehension of death or serious bodily injury at the hands of Bob Sutton; and if, acting under such apprehension, defendant thereupon shot and killed deceased, then you will acquit him, unless you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant sought the meeting with deceased for the purpose of provoking a difficulty with said Sutton, with intent to take the life of said Sutton, or do him such serious bodily injury as might end in the death of said Sutton. Then, if you so believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, you are instructed that, if defendant sought said meeting with such purpose and with such intent, defendant would not he permitted to justify on the ground of self-defense, even though he should thereafter have been compelled to act in self-defense; but, if he had no such purpose and intention in seeking to meet said Sutton, then defendant\u2019s right of self-defense would not be forfeited, and he could stand his ground, and defend himself by the use of such means of defense as the facts and circumstances indicate to be necessary to protect himself from danger, or what reasonably appeared to him at the time to be danger.\u201d Appellant\u2019s criticism to this charge is that it limits his right of defense to himself alone, and does not authorize him to defend his brother under the given state of facts. He also insists that the charge is erroneous in failing to tell the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>appellant had the right to kill Sutton in defense of his brother from death or serious bodily harm. The latter clause of the charge we do not think injured the rights of appellant, but gives him the perfect right of self-defense, if he did not intend to kill deceased at the time he provoked the difficulty. As indicated above, we think the court should have charged on both phases of the law of provoking the difficulty. Furthermore, the \"court should have charged the jury that, if they believed from the evidence that deceased shot appellant\u2019s brother, and that appellant had provoked the difficulty, without the apparent intention of killing deceased, and, after deceased had shot appellant\u2019s brother, his mind having been rendered incapable of cool reflection, he thereupon shot and killed deceased, either before deceased retreated or afterwards, still appellant, under this state of facts, would not be guilty of any higher grade of offense than manslaughter. In other words, if appellant seeks a difficulty, without the apparent intention of killing, and deceased shot his brother, and actuated by that\" cause alone, and sudden passion produced thereby, appellant slays deceased, he would not be guilty of any grade of homicide above manslaughter. We do not think the evidence raised the further issue, as contended by appellant, of the perfect right of self-defense on the part of appellant against deceased on account of deceased killing appellant\u2019s brother. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
