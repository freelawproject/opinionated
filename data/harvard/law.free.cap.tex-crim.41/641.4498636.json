H. Creesey did make an assault, and did then and there, by said assault and by violence upon the said K. H. Creesey, and by putting the said K. H. Creesey in fear of life and bodily injury, attempt to fraudulently take from the person and possession of the said K. H. Creesey the personal property of the said K. H. Creesey, with the intent then and there to appropriate said property,\u201d etc. Motion in arrest of judgment was made on the ground there was no charge of assault or violence, or putting in fear of life or bodily injury, in said indictment. The particular phase of the indictment criticised is found in that portion which uses the language \u201cin and up K. H. Creesey.\u201d It is contended that the failure to charge that this assault was made \u201cin and upon K. H. Creesey\u201d renders the indictment insufficient. We do not think so. The expression \u201cin and up K, H. Creesey\u201d can be omitted from the indictment without rendering it invalid. This is a well settled principle of criminal pleading: If, eliminating- surplusage, the indictment so avers the constituent ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ments of the offense as to apprise the defendant, of the charge against him, and enable him to plead the judgment in bar of another proseeution, it is good in substance, under our Code, and therefore sufficiently charges the offense. McConnell v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 354; Coleman v. State, 2 Texas Crim. App., 512; Burke v. State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 74; Mayo v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 342; Holden v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App., 91; Cudd v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 124; Hammons v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 445; Taylor v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 466; Lomax v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 318. Omitting the expression \u201cin and up K. H. Creesey,\u201d the indictment would charge that appellant \u201cdid make an assault, and did then and there, by said assault, and by violence upon said K. H. Creesey, and by putting the said Creesey in fear of life and bodily injury, attempt to fraudulently take from the person,\u201d etc. The expression \u201cin and up\u201d refers to the assault, and we are of opinion that the assault is sufficiently charged if this expression is omitted, under the authorities cited. This is the only question presented for revision. The indictment is sufficient, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
