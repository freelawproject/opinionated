Appellant objected on the ground that Green\u2019s testimony was not in rebuttal. The court, in his sound discretion, can permit the introduction of the testimony of witnesses at any time before the argument closes. Furthermore, the testimony is in rebuttal of the testimony for the defense; hence the court did not err in admitting this testimony. Article 698, Code Crim. Proc.; Wright v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 146; Pilot v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In bill of exceptions numbers <em>2, </em>3\u00bf 6, and 7, appellant complains' of the failure of the court to give the following charge: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that defendant was not engaged in the playing of a game of cards, but was helping Hairston in playing a trick or joke, you will find him not guilty.\u201d We do not think the court erred in refusing to give said charge, since appellant may have been playing a trick or joke, and still be guilty, as the statute expressly inhibits the playing at a game with cards in a house for the retail of spirituous liquors. The court properly defined a game as follows: \u201cA game is a trial of skill or chance, or of skill and chance, between two or more contending parties, according to some rule, by which each may succeed or fail in the trial.\u201d An inspection of Stearnes v. State, <em>21 </em>Texas, 692, shows that this definition is an exact copy of the one there laid down; and we hold the same to be correct. Bouv. Law Diet., 704; 8 Am. and Eng. Enc. of Law, p. 1033. The court having properly defined the word \u201cgame,\u201d it would be immaterial if appellant\u2019s act was a trick or joke, if it came within the definition of \u201cgame\u201d as defined by the court, and would certainly leave appellant without ground of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In bill number 4 appellant complains the court failed to charge the jury that the offense was committed in Falls County. There being no question raised as to venue in the trial court, this can not be considered here. See Acts 25th Leg., p. 11. Furthermore, being a misdemeanor, appellant must specially except, and tender a proper charge, before the matter can be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">. Appellant complains in bill number 5 of the following portion of the court\u2019s charge: \u201cDefendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt; and if you have a reasonable as to his guilt, you will give him the benefit of such doubt.\u201d This clearly is hypercritical. It is a well known aphorism of the law that that is certain which can be made certain, and the jury could not have been misled by the mere absence of the word \u201cdoubt\u201d in one instance. A casual inspection of the charge shows there was no error. We have frequently held that charges must be construed as a whole. Furthermore, that an omission in one part of the charge, substantially supplied b]7\" another part, is not error, unless misleading. White\u2019s Ann. Code Crim. Proc., sec. 824; Jackson v.

The evidence shows appellant played at a game with cards in a house for retailing spirituous liquors.
