He was sentenced to concurrent terms of-21 months of imprisonment. He argues that the district court clearly erred in adjusting his sentence for transporting aliens in a way that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. Citing <em>United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d 886 (5th Cir.2006), he argues that his pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sengers had access to oxygen, were protected from the weather, could communicate with the driver, and could exit the vehicle quickly. Because the danger posed if an accident occurred was no greater than a passenger not wearing a seatbelt, Cardona-Lopez asserts, the adjustment to his sentence was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cuyler, </em>298 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir.2002). It is undisputed that Car-dona-Lopez was transporting 14 individuals in a vehicle rated to carry seven passengers and that nine of his passengers were unrestrained in the cargo area of the minivan. Unlike the defendant in <em>Solis-Garcia, </em>Cardona-Lopez was \u201ccarrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), comment, (n. 5). Moreover, Cardona-Lopez does not dispute that he was speeding on a busy section of Highway 77 while transporting the unrestrained passengers. In light of these additional aggravating factors, the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) adjustment was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
