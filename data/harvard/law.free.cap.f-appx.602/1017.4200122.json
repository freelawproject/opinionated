Hernandez\u2019 application was based on persecution on account of his religion and membership in a particular social group. Where, as here, the BIA\u2019s decision adopts or is affected by the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the decisions of the IJ and BIA are reviewed. <em>E.g., Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Whether an alien demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal is a factual determination reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517-18 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-23\">To be entitled to withholding of removal, an applicant must establish a clear probability of persecution on account of one of five protected grounds, either by showing that persecution upon removal is more likely than not to occur or by establishing past persecution, thereby creating a presumption that future persecution is more likely than not to occur. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Persecution generally requires a showing that \u201charm or suffering will be inflicted upon\u201d the applicant. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-24\">Aside from receiving three threats over a three-year period, Hernandez does not allege he suffered physical harm or that harm is more likely than not to occur upon his return. While threats of violence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>along with evidence of intent to carry out the threats, may be sufficient to constitute persecution, <em>e.g., Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 348-49 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (5th Cir.2006), Hernandez continued working as a youth coordinator without incident for more than three years, his wife and children continue living in Honduras without incident, and there is no indication the threats will be, or are intended to be, carried out. Because a reasonable factfin-der would not be compelled to find that Hernandez would more likely than not face persecution upon removal, the BIA\u2019s decision that he is not entitled to withholding of removal is supported by substantial evi.dence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1043-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
