We do not reach this issue because we must dismiss Valentine\u2019s suit because he lacks standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-25\">Valentine was convicted of disorderly conduct under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 42.01(a)(5), a provision that prohibits unreasonable noise in certain circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Valentine appealed his conviction to the Seventh Court of Appeals of Texas, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his right to free speech was violated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Seventh Court of Appeals indicated that the First Amendment issue was not preserved for review, overruled Valentine\u2019s remaining issues, and affirmed the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused Valentine\u2019s petition for discretionary review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-26\">Valentine then filed suit in federal district court under'\u00a7 1983, seeking a declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>atory judgment that his conviction violated the First Amendment and that the Texas state courts afforded him inadequate processes to raise his First Amendment defense. Valentine attempted to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>so a magistrate judge made recommendations on the merits of Valentine\u2019s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The magistrate concluded that <em>Heck v. </em>Humphrey\u2019s favorable-termination rule barred Valentine\u2019s suit. The district court agreed and dismissed the case. Valentine now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">A federal court must, when necessary, raise the issue of Article III standing <em>sua sponte</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Article III standing requires a showing of \u201cinjury in fact, causation, and redressability.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We examine standing on a claim-by-claim basis; standing to bring a claim for damages does not confer standing to bring the case as a whole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">Valentine requests only declaratory relief, seeking to establish that his conviction violated the First Amendment and that the Texas courts did not afford him adequate processes to raise his First Amendment defense. Even construing Valentine\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he only seeks relief from his conviction, not prospective relief \u2014 i.e., relief from future applications of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 42.01(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">Valentine lacks standing because his suit does not meet the redressability requirement. \u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court; that is the very essence of the redressability requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By itself, a declaration that Valentine\u2019s First Amendment rights were violated by his conviction will afford Valentine no remedy. Valentine does not seek damages,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> so his only conceivable remedy would be having his conviction invalidated. Valentine is not in custody, so we cannot construe his suit as a petition for writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have also held that a party cannot \u201cuse the Declaratory Judgment Act to appeal his criminal conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Valentine\u2019s suit will not remedy any injury stemming from his conviction. Because Valentine\u2019s suit must be dismissed for lack of standing, we do not reach his argument that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>court misapplied <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable-termination rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for an entry of dismissal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1041-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
