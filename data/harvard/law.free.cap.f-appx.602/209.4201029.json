In the underlying lawsuit, Samuels asserted product-liability claims against the manufacturers arid retailers of the Dr. Miracle\u2019s hair-care product, and the defendants removed invoking diversity jurisdiction. Samuels settled her case for $15,250.00. Having previously withdrawn as counsel from the underlying case, Murphy intervened under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) after the settlement was reached; Murphy sought $42,611.00 in litigation costs and expenses, and a contingency fee. The district court.adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the intervention because the court lacked federal supplemental subject-matter jurisdiction since Murphy had established neither diversity of citizenship nor the amount-in-controversy requirement. Murphy timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We review a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Robinson v. TCI/US W. Commc\u2019ns Inc., </em>117 F.3d 900, 904 (5th Cir.1997). Subsection (b) of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 provides that \u201cdistrict courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction ... over claims by persons ... seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24\u201d if the Rule 24 intervention does not itself meet the diversity requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Section 1332\u2019s familiar requirements necessitate that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and that the action be between citizens of different states to invoke federal jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">The issues, then, are whether Murphy is a \u201cperson ... seeking to intervene as [a] plaintiff[ ] under Rule 24\u201d and whether Murphy\u2019s intervention under Rule 24 requesting attorney\u2019s fees meets the diversity and amount-in-controversy requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). We confronted a similar situation in <em>Griffin v. Lee, </em>621 F.3d 380 (5th Cir.2010) (per cu-riam). There, as here, an attorney who represented the plaintiff in an underlying lawsuit intervened after the suit was dismissed, seeking $54,087.51 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 382-83. We noted that, as an attorney who had previously represented the plaintiff, his claim for attorney\u2019s fees \u201calign[ed] him as a plaintiff ... intervening under Rule 24.!\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 388. Thus, the attorney\u2019s.intervention was obligated to meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a). <em>See id. </em>(citing \u00a7 1367(b)). Because his claim for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfell below $75,000,\u201d we held that the attorney\u2019s \u201cintervention was clearly inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 1332.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386. Accordingly, we sua sponte vacated the district court\u2019s decision awarding attorney\u2019s fees \u201cbecause there was no supplemental jurisdiction over [the attorney\u2019s] claim in intervention,\u201d and we remanded with instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We conclude that <em>Griffin </em>decides this appeal. As in <em>Griffin </em>and as Murphy concedes, Murphy is aligned with the plaintiff and, thus, is \u201cseeking to intervene as [a] plaintiff'] under Rule 24.\u201d \u00a7 1367(b). Thus, Murphy must meet both of \u00a7 1332(a)\u2019s requirements. As in <em>Griffin, </em>the district court in this case correctly concluded that it is legally certain that Murphy\u2019s intervention does not meet the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirement. After all, Murphy seeks at most $48,711.00 in costs and expenses, including its maximum possible 40% contingency fee. Therefore, <em>Griffin </em>requires that we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that it lacked jurisdiction over Murphy\u2019s intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\">. We reject Murphy\u2019s request that we remand to the district court for remand of its intervention to the state court instead of affirming the district court's dismissal without prejudice. Murphy neglects to cite authority for this remedy, and we are aware of none. Further, we note that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7. 1447(c) provides for remand of the entire \"case,\u201d not specific claims or complaints in intervention. <em>See also </em>14C Charles A. Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3739 (4th ed. 2015) (\"If the federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over an action removed under Section 1441(a) and (b), that court must remand the entire case; it may not remand some, but fewer than all, of the claims that comprise the case.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
