The district court affirmed the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board\u2019s denial of Sandshaker\u2019s petition to cancel Quietwater\u2019s BUSHWACKER trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">For decades until 2004 Linda Taylor owned the Sandshaker, a bar on Pensacola Beach. .Sometime during the 1970s Taylor traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where she was served a creamy, chocolaty aleo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>holic drink called a bushwacker.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When she returned to Florida, Taylor experimented and created her own drink, which has the consistency of a milkshake and contains rum, Kahlua, cream of coconut, cr\u00e9me de cacao, and milk. She began selling that concoction under the name \u201cbushwacker\u201d at the Sandshaker in 1977. The drink became hugely popular in the region and soon other nearby beach bars began serving their own versions. Taylor did not object to the other bars selling her drink because she felt the drink\u2019s popularity would be a rising tide lifting all local boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Across Pensacola Beach Boulevard from the Sandshaker is the Pensacola Beach boardwalk. Quietwater, \u25a0 owned by June Guerra, helped construct the boardwalk in the 1980s and has owned or operated several establishments there, including Capt\u2019n Fun\u2019s bar, the Jubilee restaurant, and Bushwacker\u2019s Backside. In 1988 a group of local business owners, including Taylor and Guerra, met to brainstorm ideas to address the slowdown in beach trade that happened each August. Guerra offered to hold a festival celebrating the bushwacker drink during the first weekend in August, featuring a \u201cbest bushwacker\u201d contest and some bands. Taylor again believed that any event that drew people to the area would benefit all of the local businesses, and she did not object to the use of the \u201cbushwacker\u201d name.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Both Sandshaker and Quietwater scheduled live music events on the first weekend in August 1988 to celebrate the bushwacker. Quietwater\u2019s event was unquestionably larger and more elaborate, but the testimony and documentary evidence suggest that each party advertised its own bushwacker celebration that year and most years since. Quietwater called its event variously the \u201cBushwacker Fest,\u201d \u201cBush-wacker Festival,\u201d \u201cFamous Bushwacker Festival,\u201d and \u201cFamous Bushwacker and Music Festival.\u201d Sandshaker called its event \u201cBushwacker Weekend\u201d or \u201cBush-wacker Beach Weekend.\u201d Both companies held their events the same weekend each year. Quietwater\u2019s event took place on the boardwalk and at its bar and restaurants, and Sandshaker\u2019s event took place across the street at the Sandshaker. Quietwa-ter\u2019s festival reached its zenith in 1996 when Three Dog Night played.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">In September 2004 Hurricane Ivan struck Pensacola as a Category 8 storm. Local businesses including Quietwater properties Jubilee and Bushwacker\u2019s Backside were hit hard, and both establishments closed their doors soon after. Worried its remaining facilities might not be repaired in time for the 2005 Bushwacker Festival and that mainland businesses might try to appropriate the event, Quiet-water filed an application to register the BUSHWACKER mark in the category of \u201cEntertainment services in the nature of a festival featuring live musical groups.\u201d Quietwater did not disclose to the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) that Sands-haker had simultaneously used the mark throughout the preceding seventeen years. The PTO granted the application and published Quietwater\u2019s registration on February 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">In May 2005 Sonny Campbell bought the Sandshaker. He set about preparing for the 2005 \u201cBushwacker Beach Weekend,\u201d but in July Guerra called him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>told him Sandshaker could not hold its event because Quietwater owned the BUSHWACKER trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">In October 2009 Sandshaker filed a petition for cancellation of Quietwater\u2019s BUSHWACKER mark as applied to the music festival. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) denied the petition after determining that Sandshaker had no protectable interest in the BUSHWACKER mark as applied to the drink and that it was not a prior user of the mark as applied to the music festival. Sandshaker filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida seeking to overturn that decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sandshaker sought cancellation of Quiet-water\u2019s trademark under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1052, 1064, and 1125; damages and an injunction under \u00a7 1125; and a declaration of Sandshaker\u2019s common-law right to exclusive use of the BUSHWACKER mark in Sandshaker\u2019s zone of reputation. Each of these arguments was premised on the theory that Sandshaker owned protectable rights in the BUSHWACKER mark as applied to the drink. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled in favor of Quietwater. This is Sandshaker\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>McCullum v. Orlando Reg\u2019l Healthcare Sys., Inc., </em>768 F.3d 1135, 1141 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Sandshaker\u2019s arguments all stem from its contention that it owns protecta-ble rights in the BUSHWACKER mark as applied to the drink and that those rights trump any rights Quietwater has in the mark.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But Sandshaker does not have any such rights. Generic marks may not be registered. <em>Welding Servs., Inc. v. Forman, </em>509 F.3d 1351, 1358 (11th Cir.2007). That prohibition against federal registration reflects the principle that generic marks are in the public domain and may not be appropriated from it. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cCourts have generally held that a term used generically cannot be appropriated from the public domain; therefore, even if the name becomes in some degree associated with the source, a generic mark cannot achieve true secondary meaning.\u201d). The TTAB found that BUSHWACKER \u201cappears to be generic for a type of drink sold locally and at multiple locations throughout Pensacola Beach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">A court reviewing the TTAB\u2019s findings may not reverse those findings absent \u201ctestimony which in character and amount carries thorough conviction.\u201d <em>Coach House Rest., Inc. v. Coach &amp; Six Rests., Inc., </em>934 F.2d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1991). Far from thoroughly convincing us that the TTAB is wrong, the testimony introduced in the district court thoroughly convinces us that the TTAB is correct that \u201cbushwacker\u201d is a generic term for a chocolaty frozen drink containing rum and coffee liqueur. Both parties agree that bars throughout the area and beyond make bushwackers. Perhaps most tellingly, Sandshaker concedes that any new bar opening on Pensacola beach could sell a drink using the name \u201cbushwacker\u201d and that it was \u201ca little too late [for Sandshaker] to have a problem with that.\u201d The drink served at the Sandshaker is merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>species of the genus \u201cbushwacker,\u201d and thus BUSHWACKER is a generic mark for the drink. <em>See Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc., </em>469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 661, 88 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985) (\u201cA generic term is one that refers to the genus of which the particular product is a species.\u201d). Because it is generic as applied to the drink, it may not be registered as a trademark for that usage. <em>See id. </em>Nor may Sandshaker appropriate it from the public domain. <em>See </em>Forman, 509 F.3d at 1358. Sandshaker has no protectable right to BUSHWACKER as applied to the drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">We turn now to Quietwater\u2019s contention that it has a protectable interest in the BUSHWACKER mark as applied to \u25a0 musical performances. When a mark has been on the Principal Register for less than five years at the time of the cancellation petition, \u201cany ground that would have prevented registration in the first place qualifies as a valid ground for cancellation.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp., </em>222 F.3d 943, 946 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(1); <em>Coach House, </em>934 F.2d at 1557 (requiring \u201cvalid grounds for discontinuing registration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Federal registration protects only trademark rights already acquired through adoption and use. <em>See Turner v. HMH Publ\u2019g Co., </em>380 F.2d 224, 228 (5th Cir.1967) (\u201cUnder the Lanham Act, registration of a trademark confers only procedural advantages and does not enlarge the registrant\u2019s rights, for ownership of the trademark rests.on adoption and use, not on registration.\u201d) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And trademark rights are appropriated under Florida law \u201conly through actual prior use in commerce.\u201d <em>Crystal Entm\u2019t &amp; Filmworks, Inc. v. Jurado, </em>643 F.3d 1313, 1320 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). Regardless of who .came up with the idea of having a festival to celebrate the bush-wacker drink, the district court found\u2014 and Quietwater concedes \u2014 that both parties began using the mark in commerce simultaneously in August 1988 to identify a festival event featuring live music. As between Sandshaker and Quietwater, there was no prior user. Thus Quietwater did not make \u201cactual prior use in commerce\u201d of the mark. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Further, whatever rights Quietwater might have had, its slumber on them rivaled Rip van Winkle\u2019s.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Both </em>parties used the mark in connection with live music events for nearly two decades, until Quietwater finally objected to Sandshaker\u2019s use in 2005.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>rejected Sandshaker\u2019s trademark claim over the BUSHWACKER mark for the drink, it reasoned that Sandshaker\u2019s \u201cknowing acquiescence to use of the name by other unrelated establishments\u201d supported a finding that \u201cSandshaker did not have trade identity rights sufficient to create priority.\u201d True, but that reasoning applies with equal force to Quietwater\u2019s claim to its own mark. If Sandshaker\u2019s failure to enforce its rights killed its trademark, Quietwater\u2019s identical failure had the same lethal effect on its trademark. The evidence shows that throughout the entire relevant time period Sandshaker openly held and advertised its annual \u201cBushwacker Beach Weekend\u201d featuring live musical performances. And it did so in plain view, across the street from Quiet-water\u2019s properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">It is a \u201cbedrock principle of trademark law that a mark can identify and distinguish only a single commercial source.\u201d <em>Jurado, </em>648 F.3d at 1320. Because both companies were using the mark, it never \u201cidentif[ied] and distinguish[ed] only a single commercial source\u201d of musical celebrations of the bushwacker drink. <em>See id. </em>Quietwater thus never acquired any pro-tectable right to the BUSHWACKER mark, and its registration is due to be canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it found that Sandshaker did not have protectable rights in the BUSHWACKER mark as applied to the drink. We REVERSE the remainder of the judgment and REMAND for further consideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. Although the word presumably derives from \u201cbushwhacker,\u201d it is spelled \"bushwacker\u201d for all purposes related to the drink. Because this opinion deals with three closely related and identically named concepts (the drink, the word, and the mark), we will use the following convention: bushwacker with no quotes for the drink, \"bushwacker\u201d in quotes for the word, and BUSHWACKER in all caps for the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071, a party dissatisfied with the TTAB\u2019s decision may either appeal directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or file a civil action in a United States District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\">. We emphasize that our discussion here applies only to the BUSHWACKER mark. We express no opinion about the HOME OF THE ORIGINAL BUSHWACKER mark that Sands-haker seeks to register.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">. <em>See </em>Washington Irving, <em>Rip Van Winkle and Other American Essays From the Sketch Book </em>27 (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. 1891) (\"Rip\u2019s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">. To the extent the district court's contrary conclusion on this point relies on a finding that Sandshaker was merely advertising its own participation in Quietwater\u2019s event, that finding is clearly erroneous. <em>See Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010) (\"[W]e review ... the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.\"); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). The record contains clear and ample evidence in the form of testimony and Sandshaker\u2019s advertisements for Sands-haker\u2019s events on Sandshaker\u2019s property that it always considered its musical event a celebration related to but separate from Quietwa-ter's festival. A finding that Sandshaker's ads for its own events were actually advertising Quietwater\u2019s festival is akin to a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Quietwater\u2019s ads for $1.75 bushwackers sold at its restaurants were really advertising Sandshaker\u2019s drinks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
