Grayer alleged that the defendants violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment by failing to provide timely and adequate medical treatment for an injury he received to his shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-22\">. A district court is directed to dismiss a claim by a prisoner or an in forma pauper-is litigant if it is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A(b)(l) &amp; 1915(e)(2)(B). A district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-23\">Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Grayer has failed to show that any of the defendants engaged in conduct \u201cthat would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, 463 </em>F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although there was a six-month delay between Grayer\u2019s transfer to the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) and his first appointment with a doctor at \u00c9MCF, Grayer received medical treatment with the nursing staff and diagnostic testing at EMCF during those six months. He has not shown that any of the defendants disregarded an excessive risk to his health or safety, <em>see Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), or that any delay in arranging the appointment rose to the level of deliberate indifference that resulted in substantial harm, <em>see Rogers, 709 </em>F.3d at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">He also cannot show that any delay in seeing an orthopedic specialist constituted deliberate. indifference, as the question whether \u201cadditional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment is indicated is a classic example of a matter for medical .judgment.\u201d <em>See Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 107, 97 S.Ct. 285. After Grayer was evaluated by a doctor, he received conservative treatment, including physical therapy, and was referred to an orthopedic specialist who continued conservative treatment. Grayer\u2019s disagreement with the course of treatment is insufficient to show deliberate indifference to his medical needs. <em>See Go</em>b<em>ert, </em>463 F.3d at 346. This is true even if the conservative treatment did not ultimately relieve his symptoms. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_r\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Grayer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint. Because this case does not present the type of exceptional circumstances that warrant the appointment of counsel, the district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Grayer\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Grayer\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Grayer is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
