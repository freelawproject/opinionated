Keith contends that the exhaustion requirement does not apply to his case because \u201cthere is no administrative remedy available and extraordinary circumstances exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-21\">We review de novo a dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999). Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, prisoners must properly exhaust \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available\u201d prior to filing a \u00a7 1983 action concerning prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Exhaustion is mandatory, and ' \u201c[district courts have no discretion to excuse a prisoner\u2019s failure to properly exhaust the prison grievance process before filing their complaint.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Seal, </em>702 F.3d 785, 788 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-22\">After reviewing Keith\u2019s complaint, the district court determined that Keith failed to exhaust both steps in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice administrative grievance remedies prior to filing his complaint. On appeal, Keith does not dispute that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Because exhaustion is mandatory, the district court did not err in dismissing Keith\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>702 F.3d at 788. Additionally, even if the exhaustion requirement could be excused, apart from his conclusional assertions, Keith does not describe extraordinary circumstances that justify relief, from the exhaustion, requirement or otherwise explain why exhaustion is unavailable. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, Keith has \u201ceffectively abandoned\u201d any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to exhaust. <em>See Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1037-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
