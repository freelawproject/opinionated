(\u201cADS\u201d) in this action alleging violations of the Florida Security of Communications Act (\u201cFSCA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 934.01. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Briefly stated, Plaintiff claims that ADS intercepted and recorded \u2014 in violation of the FSCA \u2014 phone calls that ADS placed to Plaintiffs Florida home about certain credit-card accounts. It is ADS\u2019s company policy to record all incoming and outgoing calls between ADS employees and third-party account holders. ADS records the calls using a digital recording system, or \u201clogger\u201d: a separate piece of equipment connected to the telephone system. That ADS made and recorded several outgoing calls to Plaintiff in accordance with its company policy (and without Plaintiffs consent) is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The FSCA prohibits the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communication. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 934.03(1). The term \u201cintercept\u201d is defined as \u201cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 934.02(3). The phrase \u201celectronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d includes \u201cany device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, electronic, or oral communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 934.02(4). But, under what is known as the \u201cbusiness extension exception,\u201d the term \u201celectronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d does <em>not </em>include telephone equipment that is \u201c[f]urnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 934.02(4)(a)(l). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">In granting summary judgment in favor of ADS, the district court relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Royal Health Care Serv., Inc. v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., </em>924 F.2d 215 (11th Cir.1991). In <em>Royal Health </em>\u2014 as in this case \u2014 plaintiff alleged a violation of the FSCA based on defendant\u2019s automatic recording of outgoing calls to plaintiff, without plaintiffs consent. <em>Royal Health Care Serv., Inc., </em>924 F.2d at 216. The <em>Royal Health </em>defendant asserted that its conduct fell under the FSCA\u2019s business-extension exception and, thus, no \u201cinterception\u201d occurred under the Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">To determine whether the business-extension exception applied, this Court first considered whether the alleged interception was made by the telephone extension used to make the calls or by the tape recorder used to record the calls. <em>Id. </em>at 217. Based both on Florida case law and on Circuit precedent interpreting the Federal Wiretap Act (upon which the FSCA is modeled), this Court concluded that the calls were intercepted (under that term\u2019s common meaning) by the telephone extension, not the recording device. <em>Id. </em>at 217-18. Because (1) the telephone used was supplied by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business, and (2) the calls were recorded pursuant to defendant\u2019s company policy in the ordinary course of business, the business-extension exception applied. <em>Id. </em>Thus, no \u201cinterception\u201d within the meaning of the FSCA occurred; and defendant was entitled to summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The parties agree that the facts in <em>Royal Health </em>are materially indistinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>able from the facts in this appeal. So, <em>Royal Health </em>controls. Applying this Court\u2019s binding precedent in <em>Royal Health, </em>the district court concluded correctly that it was the telephone, not the \u201clogger,\u201d that intercepted (under that term\u2019s common meaning) the calls from ADS to Plaintiff. Because the telephone was supplied by a provider of wire or electronic communication services in the ordinary course of business, and because ADS recorded the calls pursuant to its company policy, we conclude that the business-extension exception applied and that no \u201cinterception\u201d occurred within the meaning of the FSCA. Accordingly, ADS is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">On appeal, Plaintiff asks the Court to certify questions to the Florida Supreme Court about the proper application of the FSCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends that since <em>Royal Health </em>was decided, five other federal circuit courts (interpreting the Federal Wiretap Act) and various non-Florida state courts (interpreting analogous state statutes) have \u2014 contrary to the reasoning in <em>Royal Health </em>\u2014 concluded that a telephone call is \u201cintercepted\u201d for purposes of the pertinent federal and state statutes by the recording device, not the telephone. Plaintiff contends that these intervening foreign decisions cast sufficient doubt on this Court\u2019s earlier interpretation of Florida law that certification to the Florida Supreme Court is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Under our prior-precedent rule, we are bound by an earlier panel\u2019s decision (including those involving federal or state law) unless it is overruled by this Court sitting en banc or \u201cif <em>subsequent </em>decisions of the United States Supreme Court or the Florida courts cast doubt on our interpretation of state law.\u201d <em>Venn v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>99 F.3d 1058, 1066 (11th Cir.1996) (emphasis in original). Plaintiff cites no intervening decision (nor have we found such a decision) of the United States Supreme Court or of the Florida courts that calls into question our interpretation of the FSCA\u2019s business-extension exception in <em>Royal Health. </em>Thus, <em>Royal Health </em>remains binding precedent. Nothing establishes that the law of Florida is unclear or that the Florida Supreme Court would likely decide the issue differently; certification is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-11\">. On 23 October 2014, this Court dismissed this appeal by Plaintiff Jeremiah Hallback for want of prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\">. In his notice of appeal, Plaintiff purports to challenge several orders of the district court. Because Plaintiff\u2019s appellate briefs contain substant\u00edve argument only about the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to ADS, Plaintiff's challenges to the district court\u2019s remaining orders are abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop </em>v. <em>City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">. In the alternative, Plaintiff urges the Court to review en banc its decision in <em>Royal . Health. </em>Because the determinative issue in this appeal is one of state law, en banc consideration is inappropriate. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 35-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
