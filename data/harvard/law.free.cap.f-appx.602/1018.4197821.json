The immigration judge (IJ) rendered an adverse credibility finding, giving numerous specific and cogent reasons in support thereof. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-20\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cunless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Here, because the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s decision based on the latter\u2019s credibility determination, we may review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See id.; Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). We review the factual determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT under the substantial-evidence standard. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-21\">Thapa has not pointed to any evidence that goes beyond merely supporting his interpretation of the' inconsistencies and compels a contrary credibility conclusion. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2012). His claims for relief are based on the same evidence that the BIA found lacking in credibility, and he has not shown that, under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>See Wang, </em>569 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>F.3d at 538 (quoting <em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The IJ and the BIA\u2019s decision that Thapa was not entitled to asylum because he had not provided credible evidence of either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518. It therefore follows that he necessarily cannot establish an entitlement to withholding of removal or relief under the CAT, both of which require a higher burden. <em>See Dayo v. Holder, </em>687 F.3d 653, 658-59 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Thapa assigns error to the IJ\u2019s determination that his asylum application was untimely. The BIA, however, declined to address this finding; therefore, we do not consider it. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 903. We lack jurisdiction to entertain his unex-hausted claim that he was not afforded the opportunity before the IJ to reconcile the contradiction in his testimony and his father\u2019s letter regarding whether he suffered physical or mental torture, when kidnapped. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1986) (per curiam). Insofar as Thapa argues that the BIA erroneously made an adverse credibility determination based on the contents of his father\u2019s letter concerning Thapa\u2019s kidnapping, the BIA is permitted to review a credibility determination on facts already in the record, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), and the IJ had already noted that the letter from Thapa\u2019s father was vague and inconsistent with Thapa\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART. .</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1044-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
