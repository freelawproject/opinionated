Starling, of the town of Princeton, Bureau Co., Illinois, of the first part, and the St. Paul Plow Works of St. Paul, Minnesota, of the second part, witnesseth:' That the party of the first part does hereby grant to the party of the second part the right to make and sell the Starling \"sulky plow under patent number 154,293, dated August 18th, 1874, in the following territory, viz.: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Dakota and all that part of Iowa north of the Northwestern railway and all that territory -west and north of above described territory. In consideration of the above grant the party of the second part agrees to make said sulky plows in a good and workmanlike-manner, and advertise and sell them in the usual manner, and at a price not, to exceed the usual price of this class of imples ments sold by other manufacturers, and render an account on the first day of January and July of each year,' of all plows sold prior to those dates on which the royalty has not been paid, and pay; to the party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, two and fifty one-hundredths dollars for each and every plow sold, said royalty for spring sales to be paid July 1st and for fall sales January 1st of each year. The party of the first part also grants to the party of the second part the right to make and sell the improvement in whiffletrees under patent 151,S04, in consideration of which the party of the second part agrees to pay the party of the first part, at the time of the payment of the royalty for the sulky plows, and in the same manner, the sum of one cent for every, pound of said irons used or sold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-4\">The complaint also averred that the defendant had failed to comply with the agreement, had rendered but two accounts to the plaintiff of plows made by it under the contract, the first one in July, 1878, and the second in January, 1879, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>had never paid to the plait yff any of the agreed royalty except on the plows so reported in said accounts, but had made and sold great numbers of said sulky plows, since the date of the contract, for which it had never accounted to the plaintiff-, nor paid any royalty, a portion of them being made and sold under the name of \u201c Starling sulky plow,\u201d by which name the patented plow was known at the date of the contract, and the greater part whereof were made and sold under the name of \u201c Star sulky plow,\u201d with slight modifications of construction from that of the Starling sulky plow, but which were' in fact the plaintiff\u2019s said plow, the making and selling whereof was. so licensed to the defendant, the defendant falsely alleging-the same not to be the plaintiff\u2019s said plow, for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff of his said royalty.

It admitted the execution of the agreement between the parties, and denied any liability on the part of the defendant. It alleged that it had made and sold a sulky plow under the name of the \u201c Star sulky plow,\u201d constructed on an entirely different principle from that described in and covered by the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and that on or about December 5, 1878, it gave to the plaintiff due written notice that the construction of said sulky plow under- the plaintiff\u2019s patent was unsatisfactory, that a large proportion of those made and sold had been returned to the defendant as unserviceable, and that it would thereafter manufacture a sulky plow of its own design, and renounce its license and all claim of right to construct plows in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and would construct and sell no more; and ' that since that date it had not made or sold any plows under said license or in accordance with the alleged invention of th\u00e9 . plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">\u25a0\u25a0 To this answer there was \u00e1 reply, admitting that about December, 1878, the plaintiff received letters from the defendant, in which the latter stated that it had decided not to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>manufacturing the plaintiff\u2019s said plow; but denying that such notice was of; any force or effect, and alleging that any difficulty which the defendant had in selling and introducing the-plaintiff\u2019s plow arose wholly from the failure of the defendant \u2022 to perform the conditions of the said contract; and; denying the other allegations of the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\">A trial by jury was duly waived, and the case was tried by the court. There appears in the record a statement that on the.8th of February, 1887, \u201can opinion was filed in this cause, which said \u00bfopinion and. order pursuant thereto are in the words and' ifigures following, viz.\u201d Then follows a paper which is he\u00e1d\u00e9d \u201c Opinion.\u201d This opinion-is reported in 29 Fed. Rep. 790.. It contained the following statement: \u201cAfter the defendant had manufactured\u2019and sold between thirty-five and forty plows under the license, and on or about December 5, 1878, written notice was given the plaintiff that the con-. \u25a0 struction of the sulky plow was unsatisfactory \u00e1nd useless, and many had been returned as unserviceable, and that the defendant would thereafter manufacture a sulky plow of its own design, and renounced its license. The defendant, after-the notice, rendered an account up to January 1st, and since then has manufactured about 960 plows, called Star plow, designed by Berthiaume, and about 350 plows called the Harris plow.\u201d The opinion concludes with these words: \u201c The conclusion is that the plaintiff is entitled to a royalty on 1310 plows at =$2.50 each, making the amount of $3275, for which sum judgment is ordered.\u201d There is no finding of \u25a0 facts separate from such findings as the opinion contains. The \u201c order pursuant thereto,\u201d made February 8, 1887, is headed \u201cOrder' pursuant to opinion,\u201d and states that tile . action was tried by the court, and that., the court \u201c files its. written decision and findings in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, viz.: \u2018 That the plaintiff is entitled to the royalty on 1310 plows at $2.50 each, making the amount of $3275.\u2019 \u201d The order then stays the entry of judgment for forty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\">On the 14th of March, \u00bf1887, the defendant filed a motion . for a new trial, which was heard by the court, and was denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>on the 10th of Oetober, 188.7, in an- opinion reported in 32 Fed. Rep. 290. On the same day, a judgment was entered, which recited that a jury had been duly waived and the cause had been tried by the court, and the court, on February 8, 1887, had filed its written findings, \u201c.wherein it finds for the plaintiff as follows, to -wit: \u2018 The plaintiff is entitled to a royalty on 1310 plows at $2.50 each, making the amount of $3275, for which sum judgment is ordered,\u2019 \u201d that the entry of judgment pursuant to the findings had been stayed pending the hearing of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and that that motion had been made and denied; and the judgment proceeded to order that the plaintiff recover from the defendant <em>\u201c </em>the aforesaid sum of $3275 so found to be dub by the court, with interest thereon from the date of said findings,\u2019 to wit, February 8th, 1887, being $154.10, and all amounting to $3429.10, besides plaintiff\u2019s costs and disbursements herein to be taxed, and that he have\u2019execution therefor.\u201d To review this judgment, -the defendant brought a writ of error. <em>A </em>motion to dismiss the writ for want of jurisdiction was made, at October term, 1887, 127 U. S. \u2019376, and was denied on the ground that the case was one \u201ctouching patent rights,\u201d under \u00a7 699 of the Revised Statutes, and, therefore, the writ would lie without regard to the sum in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-4\">There was a bill of exceptions, which stated that the plaintiff offered in evidence his'letters patent, No. 154,293; that it was admitted by the pleadings, proved on the trial, and found to be a fact-by the judge, that on or about.the 5th of December, 1878, -after the defendant had manufactured and sold about; -35 or 40 plows under the license, it gave to the plaintiff written notice that the construction of the sulky plow under the plaintiff\u2019s patent was unsatisfactory, and large quantities of said plows had been returned as unserviceable, and that the defendant renounced its license and would thereafter manufacture a spiky plow of its own design; that the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that, after defendant renounced its license, it manufactured and sold 960 plows called the Berthiaume plow and 350 plows called the Harris plow; that the defendant obiected to this evidence as incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>and immaterial, on the grounds that the plaintiff could not recover for those 'plows on the contract of license after it had been renounced, that the Berthiaume and Harris plows were not similar to the plaintiff\u2019s and were 'manufactured under other patent's, and that the character of thos\u00e9 plows was indicated and described in the prior patents pleaded in the answer; that the court overruled the objections and the defendant excepted; that the plaintiff then offered evidence tending to show that the defendant, after it renounced the license, did not advertise the Starling sulky plow in the usual manner; that the defendant objected to that evidence that it -was incompetent, immaterial and irrelevant, on the ground that the license had been renounced and the defendant was not bound to advertise thereafter; that the court overruled.the objection and received the evidence, -and the defendant excepted ; that the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that two Starling plows made by the defendant according to the plaintiff\u2019s patent were sold by it after said notice was given to the plaintiff, for which the defendant did not account and pay royalty to the plaintiff; that the defendant objected to' this evidence as immaterial-and incompetent, because it was after it had notified the plaintiff that it had done with manufacturing his plows; and that the court overruled this objection and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">The bill of exceptions then set forth the evidence of several witnesses produced by the respective parties, and several patents introduced by the defendant, being the six patents set up in the answer and two others. When the six patents were offered in evidence by the defendant, it was stated that the object of offering them was to prove that the plaintiff\u2019s invention was not novel. The plaintiff then and there objected to them, on the ground that the defendant was estopped from denying the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s patent; but the objection was overruled and the plaintiff excepted, and the patents were received in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">The bill of exceptions, at its close, stated that \u201c the court made the following rulings, contained in the opinion which follows below, and ordered judgment against the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>for thirty-two hundred and seventy-five dollars,\u201d and that \u201cthe opinion was as follows.\u201d Then followed the opinion, in the same words previously set out . in the record, which, after the paragraph before quoted from it, proceeds to describe the plaintiff\u2019s invention as authorized to be manufactured and sold by the defendant, and recites the first two claims of the plaintiff\u2019s patent, there being three claims in all. It then said: \u201c 1. I find that the defendant could not, without the consent of the plaintiff, terminate the rights conferred by the license, and, there being no limitation on its face, the license continued until the expiration of the present letters patent. 2. The Starling plow is of utility and an operative machine, although it might work better in some soils than in others. 3. I find that the first claim of the plaintiff is manifestly infringed in the Berthiaume and Harris plows, so designated, and the mechanism used is only such mechanical change as increases the power of the lever from a single to a compound action, reversing its m\u00f3vement from a lever moving forward to one pulled towards the driver. In the Berthiaume plow a perforated segment and a spring dog are used, in connection with which the lever operates to raise and lower the plow and beam, which are mechanical changes and equivalents only. In the Harris plow substantially 'the same device is used. While in the Berthiaume plow the-device used for depressing the plow-beam in front is unlike Starling\u2019s, the change in that particular would not defeat the right of plaintiff to an action for breach of contract. '4.. I have hesitated about going into \"the question of novelty, but there being in the contract of license no recital or admission that plaintiff had invented the improvement in sulky plows, and the plaintiff having joined issue on the defence of want of novelty set up in the answer, and not pleaded an estoppel, I have reluctantly allowed the defendant to introduce evidence on that issue, and find that the plaintiff\u2019s improvement is not anticipated by any of the patents introduced in evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-4\">The opinion then discussed in detail the six prior patents set up in the answer, with the conclusion that no one of those patents had the combination of the plaintiff, for the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>described in his patent, or anticipated his invention. Then, followed the conclusion set forth as the finding, in the order of February 8, 1887. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">. The bill of exceptions then stated, that the defendant excepted to the ruling and order directing the judgment for the plaintiff, and to the ruling and conclusion of law, \u201cthat the defendant could not, without the consent of the plaintiff, terminate the rights conferred by the license, and, there being no limitation\u2019on its face, the. license continued until the expiration of the present letters patent,\u201d and to the ruling and conclusion of law, that \u201c while in the Berthiaume plow, the device used for depressing the plow-beam in front is unlike Starling\u2019s, the change in that particular would not defeat the right of plaintiff to an action for breach of contract,\u201d and to each of the rulings and conclusions of law as to each of- five of the six prior patents set up in the answer, and to the ruling and conclusion of law that no one of the patents in evidence had the combination of the plaintiff for the purposes described in his patent or anticipated his improvement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>Mr. Walter II.

It was so .utterly void that no damages could be recovered from either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>party for failing to permit on the one hand the manufacture and sale, or failing . to manufacture and sell on the other. <em>Bailey </em>v. Austrian, 19 Minnesota, 535; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Van Buren School </em>Township, 77 Indiana, 447; Addison on Contracts, Vol. 1, star pages 390, 435, 436; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 Q. B. (N.

Tbe plaintiff in error had not agreed not to make and sell other plows, but as to these other plows it stood out from under its license, was liable' for infringement like any stranger if it infringed the Starling patent, and could defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>against such suits on the same ground that any stranger could defend, but for these other plows the defendant in error could not recover any royalty under the contract, because that was confined to the <em>Starling sulky plow, </em>and that alone, and none of these plows contained the distinguishing characteristics of that plow. <em>Burr </em>v.

This ground is main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tamed upon the view that, where the patentee grants ah. exclusive right, he deprives himself of the privilege of granting.any right to others in the given territory; and that, therefore, the .exclusive licensee will not be permitted, after he has thus deprived the licensor of his-privilege of licensing others, to renounce the.license and thus damage the licensor, while that-reason does not exist under a contract or license like that in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">Bftt' we think that this attempted distinction is fanciful'and. not sound. Irrespectively of the point that it might well be \u2022urged that the plaintiff, in granting to the defendant \u201c <em>the </em>right to make and sell the Starling sulky plow under patent No.. 154,293,\u201d did not grant simply <em>a </em>right, but' granted <em>the </em>right, that is, all the right which the plaintiff had, under the . patent, to make and sell the plow in the specified territory, we are of opinion that the Circuit Court was correct in hold-. ing that the defendant could not terminate, without the consent of the plaintiff, the rights conferred by the license, and that, as there was no limitation on its fa.ce, the license continued until the expiration of the patent. The contract has no. provision for its-termination or its .'renunciation. The grant is of \u2022 the right to make and sell the Starling sulky plow under the patent, that i$, under the patent so long as it is a patent, for the whole, term of its duration. For plows made and sold under, the patent, and in accordance with any of its claims, the defendant, at all times during the existence! of the patent, could set up the contract as a defence against a claim for infringement, and limit .its liability for plows made and sold in accordance with any one or more of the claims of the patent, to the royalty fixed by the terms of the contract. \u25a0 In consideration-of the grant, the defendant bound itself to -make the plows in a good and workmanlike manner, and to advertise and sell \u2022 them in the usual manner and at the price specified\u00bb as limited, and to render accounts and'pa;f royalties \u00e1s agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u25a0 The Circuit Court finds that the Starling, plow \u201c is of utility and an operative machine, although it might work better in \u2022some soils than in others.\u201d It, therefore, finds against the defendant as to the ground set up in the .notice which the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>fendant gave, that the construction of the plow under the patent was unsatisfactory. The fact that the defendant continued, after the alleged renunciation, to make and sell the plow with features embodying the first claim of the patent, and that the plow so made was successful and salable, indicates \\that the notice was a mere pretence, and that the defendant ' Continued to act under the license, or else that the allegation th^,t the construction of the plow was unsatisfactory was founded upon something in the workmanship, and not in the inherent character of the patented improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"AOpm\">We are of opinion that the license, in the absence of a stipulation providing for its revocation, was not revocable by the defendant, except by mutual consent or by the fault of the other party. If the plaintiff, after receiving the notice, had sued the defendant for infringement, he would have been properly regarded as acquiescing in the renunciation; but, instead of that, he elected to regard the. license as still in force, and brought an action, to recover the royalties provided for by it, which he was entitled to do. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Harris Mfg. Co., </em>63 Wisconsin, 276; <em>Patterson\u2019s Appeal, </em>99 Penn. St. 521; <em>Union Mfg. Co. v. Lounsbury, </em>41 N. Y. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"A76\">The defendant could not coerce the plaintiff into putting an end to the contract, by the means it adopted. It must bring a suit to set aside the contract before it can be allowed to say that, in regard to what it afterwards^does, it does not act under ,the contract, provided the machines it makes embody a claim of the patent. Notwithstanding the defendant gave' notice that it renounced the license, yet it did not in' fact renounce it, for it continued to make plows embodying one of : the claims of the patent., The Circuit Court found that the first claim of the plaintiff\u2019s patent was infringed in the 1310 plows, and that the changes made in those plows were mechanical changes and equivalents only, which would not defeat the right of the plaintiff to an action for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">We cannot review the finding of the Circuit Court that none of. the earlier patents put in evidence by the defendant anticipated the plaintiff\u2019s invention. Although the defendant excepted to this finding as a conclusion of law, yet it was really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>a conclusion of fact on the evidence which th\u00e9 Circuit Court had before it. Witnesses were summoned on both sides as to what the earlier patents showed; and we cannot consider the evidence, as if this were a suit in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">After the defendant had introduced the alleged anticipating patents, and examined three expert witnesses in regard to. them, the plaintiff rebutted such evidence by two expert witnesses, The defendant then offered further evidence to show why its contention as to the question of novelty was correct, but the court refused to permit this to be done, stating that.it had heard sufficient testimony to enable it to understand the operation of the different devices, to which ruling the defendant excepted. This is assigned for error. But we are of opinion that it was a matter within the discretion of the Circuit Court. The defendant had had an opportunity of taking the testimony in question when it examined its three expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">. After the plaintiff had introduced evidence tending to show that his plow, properly made, was practical and successful, and the defendant had introduced evidence for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff\u2019s plow, well constructed, was unsalable, whiie the Berthiaume and Harris plows made by it were salable, the court refused to permit the defendant to show by one Carter, a practical dealer in plows, that he sold a plow substantially the same as the Berthiaume plow for $45, in competition with a plow substantially the same as the plaintiff\u2019s plow at $25, and was able to sell the former without diffi- \u2022 culty, while the'latter had no sale. The evidence was excluded as immaterial and the defendant excepted. The court found as a fact that the so-called Berthiaume plow was substantially the plaintiff\u2019s plow. The offer of evidence amounted merely to showing that one person could sell a plow for $45, while another person could not sell substantially the same plow for $25. This was certainly Immaterial on any issue in the case. Moreover, both parties had gone through their testimony, and the plaintiff had given evidence in rebuttal, and it was after that that this offer was made. It was discretionary with the court whether to admit the evidence or not, as the defendant had before had an .opportunity to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"ANK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The plaintiff, in rebuttal of the defendant\u2019s principal evidence, offered proof tending to show that he first constructed a plow containing the elements of the first claim of his patent, before the date of the earliest patent introduced by the defendant on the question of novelty. The defendant objected to this evidence as immaterial, and that it was a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief; but the court overruled the objection, and the defendant excepted. After the defendant had introduced in evidence the earlier patents, it was proper for the plaintiff to show that, prior to the date of any of them, he had reduced the invention covered by his first claim to practice, in a working form. <em>Elizabeth </em>v. <em>Pavement Company, 97 </em>U. S. 126, 130; <em>Loom Company </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>105 U. S. 580, 592. Proof of the date of the plaintiff\u2019s invention was strictly a matter of rebuttal, after the defendant had put in- the patents which were prior in date to the plaintiff\u2019s patent. The defendant might afterwards have offered evidence on the same point.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The defendant, in its principal testimony, offered to show by a witness that the lever device shown in the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and substantially the same as that shown, in his model, was used on two sulky plows prior to 1872. The plaintiff objected to the evidence as incompetent and immaterial, and because the fact had not been set up in the answer; the objections were' sustained, and the defendant excepted. We think the evidence was immaterial. There was no offer to prove' that the lever device was so combined that' the combination operated in the same way, for the same purposes, as in the first claim of the plaintiff\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">These are all the matters alleged on the part of the defendant which we think it important to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We find no error in the record, and the judgment is.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-8\">Mr. Justice Bradley did not sit in this case or take any part in its decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
