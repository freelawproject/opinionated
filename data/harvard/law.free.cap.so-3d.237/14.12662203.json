Nathaniel Joseph and Kecia Esteen (formerly known as Kecia Joseph) (collectively the \"Josephs\") commenced this case against Gerald Wasserman, an attorney who handled numerous business and property dealings on their behalf (the \"Malpractice Case\"). The Josephs appeal from the trial court's May 3, 2017 judgment granting, but staying, the exception of no right of action filed by Mr. Wasserman (the \"May 2017 Judgment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Wasserman answered the appeal. Because the May 2017 Judgment is conditional, interlocutory, and non-appealable, we dismiss the Josephs' appeal and Mr. Wasserman's answer to the appeal and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and procedural background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2004, the Josephs commenced the Malpractice Case. In May 2006, the trial court rendered a judgment dismissing the Malpractice Case with prejudice; the reason for the dismissal is not relevant here. Although the Josephs timely appealed the May 2006 judgment by filing a motion for appeal (the \"Motion for Appeal\"), the Motion for Appeal was not signed until a decade later, in 2016. Meanwhile, in July 2013, the Josephs filed a Chapter 7, Voluntary Bankruptcy Petition, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the \"Bankruptcy Case\"). In the Bankruptcy Case, the Josephs failed to disclose the Malpractice Case as a potential asset of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, the Josephs filed in the Malpractice Case a motion seeking to have the Motion for Appeal signed by the trial court; instead, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , declared their appeal from the May 2006 judgment of dismissal abandoned. This court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Joseph v. Wasserman\n   </em>\n   , 15-1193 (La.

Moreover, Mr. Wasserman filed his answer to the appeal on July 27, 2017, well beyond the thirty-day period for filing an application for supervisory writ from the judgment, which was rendered on May 3, 2017. Under these circumstances, we decline to exercise our discretion to convert his answer to a writ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sellers v. El Paso Indus.

The trial court's judgment named the Josephs as the only plaintiffs. The notice of appeal, however, was signed by not only the Josephs, but also three other individuals-Frank Mitchell, Lucinda Mitchell, and Nathan Joseph. These three individuals all filed a notice to intervene as a plaintiff in the Malpractice Case. Nathan Joseph's motion to intervene was denied. Given that we dismiss the instant appeal on jurisdictional grounds, we decline to address the issue of whether these three individuals have standing to appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In 2016, while the appeal in\n    <em>\n     Joseph I\n    </em>\n    was pending before this court, Mr. Wasserman filed an exception of no right of action in this court, asserting the same grounds as set forth in the exception of no right of action that he filed in the trial court.
