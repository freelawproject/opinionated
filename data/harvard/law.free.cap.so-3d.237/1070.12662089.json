For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1996, during a drug sweep in South Miami Heights, Jordan used a firearm against one police officer and brandished it against two others. Jordan was charged with one count of attempted first degree murder of a law enforcement officer and two counts of aggravated assault on two different law enforcement officers. Following trial, Jordan was convicted of: (1) attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm (upon Officer Macken); (2) aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer with a firearm (upon Sergeant Gallagher); and (3) aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer with a firearm (upon Officer Guerrier).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court sentenced Jordan to thirty years in prison on the attempted second-degree murder conviction (Macken), a consecutive five years in prison on the aggravated assault (Gallagher), and another consecutive five years in prison on the aggravated assault (Guerrier), for a total of forty years. Each conviction carried a three-year firearm minimum mandatory sentence to run consecutively, thereby, \"stacking\" to a nine-year minimum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 10, 2015, Jordan filed a motion (through counsel)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to correct illegal sentence pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jordan contended that the stacking of the minimum mandatory portions of the three sentences was impermissible because the evidence did not show that each use of the firearm by Jordan was a separate transaction or episode. The motion was summarily denied by the trial court in its order. That order was timely appealed to this Court, and this Court reversed, as we could not \"determine from the record provided whether the consecutive three-year mandatory minimum sentences for multiple counts of aggravated assault with a firearm were allegedly committed during a single criminal episode and whether such sentences are illegal.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

This appeal ensued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Jordan argues the same issue raised in his March 10, 2015, motion, namely whether the \"stacking\" of mandatory\n   minimum sentences is permitted under the circumstances of this case. The answer turns on whether the incidents in the instant case consisted of separate criminal episodes, or alternatively, if a single criminal episode, the incidents caused injury to multiple victims or multiple injuries to one victim, thus bifurcating the episode for sentencing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard for Stacking Mandatory Minimums\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As recognized by the Florida Supreme Court, \"[a]ny discussion as to this issue should begin with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.

We now apply these legal standards to the case before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Application to the Instant Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the instant case, the facts established at trial show that Jordan's offenses were not committed as part of a single episode. In relevant part, on the day in question, Sergeant Gallagher (the supervisor), Officer Macken (the driver), and Officer Guerrier (the rookie) were conducting a drug sweep operation of the South Miami Heights area in a black Chevy Blazer. As they turned on SW 113th Place, they observed four males standing together, one of whom was holding what appeared to be a marijuana cigarette. Macken stopped the vehicle, and Gallagher and Guerrier exited from the right side, with Macken's exit being delayed as he waited for a vehicle to pass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Gallagher and Guerrier approached and gestured for two of the males to place their hands on a vehicle parked nearby. The two males complied and were searched while Jordan and the fourth male stood by and watched. After the approaching car passed the Blazer, Macken exited. As he did so, Gallagher instructed Jordan to place his hands on the vehicle too, but Jordan turned and fled west, first running behind, then around, a residence. Macken unholstered his firearm and pursued Jordan\n   on foot, yelling at him to stop and identifying himself as police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As Jordan finished his route around the residence and returned to 113th Place, he ran northeasterly towards 189th Street, and then easterly along 189th Street. Somewhere along this path, Jordan turned and pointed a gun at Macken. Macken fired a shot at Jordon and missed. Jordan ran a few more steps, turned, fired a shot, and missed. Jordan then ran south between two residences and positioned himself along the east side of a wall separating the patio area of the duplex homes. Macken ran to the west side of the wall and leaned his back against it. Macken and Jordan exchanged demands that the other surrender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Macken reached around the wall with his right hand holding his gun. Jordan fired a sequence of shots along the wall, striking Macken in the face. Macken retreated northwest to the corner of the residence, away from the patios and the separating wall. A few minutes later, Jordan appeared from behind the wall and ran southeasterly. Jordan looked back and fired a sequence of shots at Macken, some of which struck Macken in the leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While Macken was pursuing and exchanging fire with Jordan, Gallagher and Guerrier were arresting and placing the two males into the Blazer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gallagher and Guerrier entered the vehicle, and Gallagher began driving easterly along SW 189th Terrace. Jordan suddenly emerged from between two houses. As the Blazer approached and passed by, Jordan raised the gun with one hand, pointing it at the vehicle and continuing to walk. Seeing the gun, Gallagher accelerated past and away from Jordan. As Gallagher watched Jordan in the side view mirror, Jordan raised his other hand to the gun and tracked the Blazer. Jordan eventually lowered his gun and walked off to the north.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Gallagher stopped the vehicle at the end of the block, instructed Guerrier to stay with the vehicle, and ran back to the location he last saw Jordan. Gallagher observed Jordan leaning up against the wall of a nearby home, fiddling with his gun (possibly reloading or clearing a jam). Jordan saw Gallagher running towards him and raised his gun with both hands. Gallagher fired four shots at Jordan, all missing. However, Jordan fell to the ground and slipped away back north towards 189th Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After a brief confrontation with Officer Tookes, who was protecting the injured Macken, Jordan fled east along 189th Street, then southeasterly towards 189th Terrace east of 113th Avenue. By this time, Guerrier was driving the vehicle with the two men held in the blazer. Jordan reappeared near Guerrier in the vehicle. As he ran past Guerrier in the vehicle, he pointed his gun at her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We therefore find that the record evidence presented at trial conclusively refutes Jordan's argument that each of the offenses for which Jordan was convicted were committed during a single criminal episode.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.
