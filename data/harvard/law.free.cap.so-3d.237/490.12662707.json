Deputy Depew asked the defendant to identify himself because he was investigating possible criminal activity. The defendant gave Deputy Depew his identification but the officer insisted that Ruff step over to his police car so that he could run his name in the database. At that point the defendant became agitated and angry, which Deputy Depew interpreted as threatening, and he wrestled the defendant to the ground and handcuffed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An arrest requires probable cause, while an investigatory stop requires only the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Terry v.
