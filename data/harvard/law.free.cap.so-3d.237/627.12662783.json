For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of April 28, 2016, amend in part the judgment of January 23, 2017, and affirm that judgment as amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nicole Maronge is the sole owner and manager of La Maison Renovations, LLC. On February 17, 2014, La Maison contracted with Truly Noble Services, Inc. to perform a renovation on a residential property in Napoleonville, Louisiana. Seeking laborers, on February 21, 2014, Ms. Maronge sent a text message to Dennis Ordo\u00f1ez, asking if he and his friend, Javier Ocampo, were interested in some painting work, explaining that she needed three laborers to paint at the Napoleonville property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Ordo\u00f1ez and Mr.\n   Ocampo had done work for Ms. Maronge in the past and agreed to do this job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs arrived to the jobsite on Tuesday, February 25, 2014, where Ms. Maronge informed them of their tasks and advised them that the job needed to be completed by Friday, February 28. At trial, however, both Mr. Ordo\u00f1ez and Mr. Ocampo testified that they were not informed of a deadline. A discussion was held later that day via text messages regarding plaintiffs' compensation. Ms. Maronge offered $15 per hour and plaintiffs countered with $17 per hour. Ms. Maronge agreed to pay for the cost of plaintiffs' gasoline, but there was no further discussion regarding the hourly rate. At trial, Ms. Maronge testified that she believed the agreement was $15 per hour plus the cost of gas, while plaintiffs explained they thought they would be paid $17 per hour plus the cost of gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Maronge supplied materials, including sheetrock, paint, primer, caulk, tape, spackling, and other similar items. Plaintiffs supplied their own tools, such as brushes, rollers, buckets, and drop cloths. Ms. Maronge provided a ladder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs explained the job was more than just painting. They ripped up a wood floor in the house on the first day and continued with demolition work in the garage on the second day. They did not start painting until Thursday. By the end of Friday, they were not finished and informed Ms. Maronge that they could finish by Sunday, March 2 if they brought in a third guy. She agreed. With this additional help, plaintiffs worked over the weekend, and when they left on Sunday, only the trim remained to be painted. They were on their way back to the job on Monday but did not make it because of car trouble. This forced Ms. Maronge to hire other laborers to finish the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On Tuesday, March 4, Mr. Ordo\u00f1ez sent Ms. Maronge a text message asking to be paid. In a message on Friday, March 7, she responded that she could not pay them until she was paid by Truly Noble.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After repeated failed attempts to get paid, on May 1, 2014, plaintiffs, with the assistance of the Loyola Law Clinic, sent a demand letter to Ms. Maronge, each seeking payment for 51 hours worked at $17 per hour. Still unable to resolve the dispute, on April 1, 2015, plaintiffs filed a \"Rule to Show Cause Why Wages Should be Paid\" in the 24th Judicial District Court pursuant to the Louisiana Wage Payment Act, La. R.S. 23:631,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In this pleading, plaintiffs alleged that each had worked a total of 62 hours and were entitled to $17 per hour. In addition to unpaid wages, they also sought penalties and attorneys' fees under the law. In Ms. Maronge's answer, she maintained that each plaintiff had worked a total of 45 hours at a rate of $15 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After discovery, on December 20, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a finding as a matter of law that plaintiffs were employees of Ms. Maronge, and not independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, on March 2, 2016, Ms. Maronge filed a \"Motion to Place Funds in the Registry of the Court,\" in which she asserted that she had finally received payment from Truly Noble in connection with the work performed at the Napoleonville property. She explained that she had attempted to pay each plaintiff $867, accounting for plaintiffs' claims of unpaid wages for 51 hours of work at $17 per hour. Plaintiffs rejected this offer and Ms. Maronge deposited $1,734 in the registry\n   of the court to be released upon final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a March 28, 2016 hearing on plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, the court issued its judgment on April 28, 2016 denying plaintiffs' motion. The matter proceeded to trial on January 4, 2017. The court issued its judgment on January 23, 2017, finding plaintiffs to be independent contractors and awarding them $1,734, plus interest from date of judicial demand, all costs of the proceedings, and attorneys' fees. The court's written reasons followed on February 10, 2017. Plaintiffs' appeal timely followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs assign four errors: (1) the district court erred in its March 28, 2016 denial of plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment; (2) the district court erred in its January 23, 2017 judgment by finding plaintiffs independent contractors; (3) the district court erred in addressing the issue of penalty wages; and (4) the district court erred in finding plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error One\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In plaintiffs' first assignment of error, they argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for partial summary judgment, in which they alleged there were no genuine issues of material fact as to their status as employees, rather than independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our standard of review for a judgment granting or denying a motion for summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boutin v.

In determining whether the relationship of principal and independent contractor exists, the following factors are to be considered: (1) there is a valid contract between the parties; (2) the work being done is of an independent nature such that the contractor may employ non-exclusive means in accomplishing it; (3) the contract calls for specific piecework as a unit to be done according to the independent contractor's own methods, without being subject to the control and direction of the principal, except as to the result of the services to be rendered; (4) there is a specific price for the overall undertaking agreed upon; and (5) the duration of the work is for a specific time and not subject to termination or discontinuance at the will of either side without a corresponding liability for its breach.\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767091\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/324/#p329\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767091\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/324/#p329\">\n    at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, where the essence of an independent contractor is freedom of action and choice, the essence of the employer-employee relationship, by contrast, is the employer's right to control the employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hillman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1162.

App. 4 Cir. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, to succeed on their motion for partial summary judgment, plaintiffs were required to prove there were no genuine issues of material fact on the crucial issue of the degree of Ms. Maronge's control over plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Maronge testified that plaintiffs set their own schedule each day and that she did not demand they work a certain number of hours per day. She informed them of the work that needed to be done, but did not direct them how to do it. Plaintiffs supplied their own tools and techniques in performing the work. Ms. Maronge was not present on the jobsite every day, but communicated with plaintiffs via cell phone. Some days they advised her when they arrived to the jobsite, when they left, and updated her with their progress. And on the days that she did visit the jobsite, she checked their progress and ensured their work was done in a professional manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In light of Ms. Maronge's testimony regarding the latitude she afforded plaintiffs in their day-to-day performance of their assigned tasks, we find there were genuine issues of material fact as to her degree of control over plaintiffs. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on their employee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error Two\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In plaintiffs' second assignment of error, they argue that the district court erred in its January 23, 2017 judgment that plaintiffs were independent contractors and not employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We review this factual finding under the manifest error-clearly wrong standard of review.

In making a credibility determination and resolving that conflicting testimony, the district court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in finding that an oral contract existed between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Non-Exclusive Means\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The evidence at trial established that besides being provided with materials (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , paint, sheetrock, etc.) and a ladder, plaintiffs supplied their own tools and employed their own techniques in performing the work. They were not directed to perform the work by any means exclusive to Ms. Maronge or La Maison. The district court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in finding that plaintiffs employed non-exclusive means in accomplishing the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    (3) Control\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As discussed above in the first assignment of error, the evidence at trial established that Ms. Maronge exercised minimal control over plaintiffs in the performance of their tasks. Ms. Maronge did not dictate their hours worked per day, nor did she control or direct plaintiffs in their method of performing the work. She merely advised them of the work that needed to be done and plaintiffs utilized their own discretion in completing the work. Accordingly, the district court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in finding that plaintiffs were not subject to a degree of control by Ms. Maronge sufficient to establish an employer-employee relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    (4) Price\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As mentioned above, there was conflicting testimony at trial as to price. The testimony established that Ms. Maronge offered $15 per hour and plaintiffs' countered with $17 per hour. Ms. Maronge agreed to pay for the cost of plaintiffs' gasoline, but there was no further discussion regarding the hourly rate. Ms. Maronge testified that she believed the agreement was $15 per hour plus the cost of gas, while plaintiffs testified they thought they would be paid $17 per hour plus the cost of gas. The district court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in resolving this conflicting testimony by finding that the parties agreed to $15 per hour plus the cost of gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    (5) Duration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In light of Ms. Maronge's testimony that she advised plaintiffs the work was subject to a deadline, the district court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in finding that the work was for a specific duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Upon consideration of the foregoing factors and the evidence adduced at trial, we find that the district court was not manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in classifying plaintiffs as independent contractors.
