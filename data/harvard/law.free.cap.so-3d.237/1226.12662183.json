Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief arguing one assignment of error. For the reasons that follow, defendant's convictions and habitual offender stipulation are affirmed, his original and enhanced sentences are vacated, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing. We further grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 5, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Jonas Kelly, with attempted carjacking in violation of La. R.S. 14:27 and La. R.S. 14:64.2 (count one) and possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967 A (count two). On August 18, 2014, defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Omnibus motions, which included motions to suppress evidence and statements, were filed by defendant. On July 6, 2015, the trial court denied the motions to suppress\n   evidence and statements. Subsequently, defense counsel filed a motion to rehear all previously denied motions, which was denied by the trial court on June 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 2, 2016, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and pled guilty as charged pursuant to\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v. Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970). The trial court sentenced defendant to two years in the Department of Corrections without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, a $500 fine and court costs on count one. The trial court also sentenced defendant to a term of fifteen years in the Department of Corrections, a $500 fine and court costs on count two. The trial court further ordered these sentences to run concurrently with one another and with any other time defendant was presently serving for a parole revocation and ordered credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the same date, the State filed a habitual offender bill of information charging defendant as a second felony offender on count two, to which defendant stipulated. The trial court then vacated defendant's original sentence on count two and resentenced him as a second felony offender to fifteen years in the Department of Corrections without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence and ordered court costs. Defendant's enhanced sentence was ordered to run concurrently with the sentence on count one and with the parole revocation defendant had either received or was \"facing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 27, 2016, defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for post-conviction relief. On November 2, 2016, the trial court dismissed defendant's application without prejudice and granted him an out-of-time appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because defendant entered guilty pleas, the underlying facts were not fully developed at trial. Nevertheless, the bill of information provides that on or about July 12, 2014, defendant \"violated La. R.S. 14:27:64.2 in that he did attempt to take a [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] unmarked Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Police Car from Detective Patrick Evans by use of force or intimidation,\" and on July 12, 2014, \"violated La. R.S. 40:967.A in that he did knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, to wit: Cocaine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the guilty plea proceeding, the State contended that if the matter proceeded to trial on count one, the State would have called witnesses and established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant attempted to take an unmarked Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office patrol car from an officer by use of force or intimidation in Jefferson Parish. As to count two, the State stated that it would have called witnesses and established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed cocaine in Jefferson Parish with the intent to distribute it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel contends that a review of the transcript and the waiver of rights forms show that defendant was advised and understood the rights he was waiving. She asserts that defendant was also advised of his rights when he stipulated to the habitual offender bill of information and defendant assured the trial court that he understood the rights he was waiving. Counsel contends that defendant was advised of the enhanced sentence he would receive, and defendant stated that he was not forced, threatened, or coerced into entering his pleas. She argues that the record lacks any indication that defendant did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily enter his pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Counsel states that although the factual basis presented by the State was \"meager,\" the evidence presented at the suppression hearing can be reviewed in establishing\n   the factual basis required for an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea. She also concludes that defendant did not preserve his right to appeal the trial court's ruling regarding the motion to suppress pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, this Court sent defendant a letter by certified mail informing him that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief had been filed and that he had until June 21, 2017 to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Our independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The bill of information properly charged defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the offenses charged. It also sufficiently identified defendant and the crimes charged. See La. C.Cr.P. arts. 462 - 466. Further, as reflected by the minute entries and the commitment, defendant and his counsel appeared at all crucial stages of the proceedings against him, including his arraignment, guilty pleas, habitual offender stipulation, and sentencing. Thus, there are no appealable issues regarding defendant's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, defendant pled guilty in this case. He also stipulated to being a second felony offender as alleged in the habitual offender bill. When a defendant pleads guilty, he waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading to the guilty plea and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v.

An unconditional plea, willingly and knowingly made, waives any and all non-jurisdictional defects and bars a defendant from later asserting on appeal that the State failed to produce sufficient proof at the habitual offender hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant inquired if he could have a hearing on the habitual offender bill, and the trial court responded that a hearing would be limited on whether defendant was the same person previously convicted in 2006. The trial court informed defendant that he would not \"go less\" than a fifteen-year sentence as part of the plea agreement, defendant stated there would be \"no sense to go to trial on that then,\" and stipulated to the habitual offender bill.

Defendant responded affirmatively to each question. Defendant denied that anyone had promised him anything or threatened him into pleading guilty. The trial court then accepted defendant's stipulation as a second felony offender pursuant to La. R.S. 15:529.1.

Moreover, defendant's sentences fall within the sentencing ranges prescribed by the statutes and defendant concedes that he received less than the maximum sentence for the offense to which he pled guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, defendant contends that his appellate counsel erroneously submitted an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record and that counsel's brief does not provide a full analysis of defendant's\n   conviction for which he \"received a 1 year sentence without the benefits of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.\" He complains that counsel's\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief fails to contain any analysis regarding his two applications for reduction of bail. He argues that since judges are to consider the seriousness of the offense charged in determining the amount of bond, appellate counsel's motion to withdraw should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Generally, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is most appropriately addressed through an application for post-conviction relief filed in the district court, where a full evidentiary hearing can be conducted, rather than by direct appeal.
