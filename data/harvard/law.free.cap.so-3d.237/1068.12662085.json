On appeal from a summary denial, this Court must reverse unless the postconviction record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(b)(2)(A), shows conclusively that the appellant is entitled to no relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R.

If the trial court again enters an order summarily denying the postconviction motion, the court shall attach record excerpts, including a sentencing transcript and plea colloquy, conclusively showing that the appellant is not entitled to jail credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
