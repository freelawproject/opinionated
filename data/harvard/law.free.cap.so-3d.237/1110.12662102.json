As the defendant did not file a motion to withdraw his plea in the lower tribunal, asserting that his plea was involuntary, we are without jurisdiction to entertain this issue on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(b)(2)(A)(ii)(c) (stating that a defendant who pleads nolo contendere may directly appeal based on the ground that his plea is involuntary if the ground of involuntary plea is preserved by a motion to withdraw plea). Accordingly, we dismiss the defendant's appeal but do so without prejudice to allow the defendant to raise this issue in a motion for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850(a)(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850(a)(5) (stating that a defendant who enters a plea of nolo contendere may file a motion for postconviction relief on the ground that the plea was involuntary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
