Bibbs asserts his counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately advise him of a lesser charge of simple robbery, for failing to investigate his mental history, and for failing to bring Bibbs's mental status to the attention of the court. To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, Bibbs must show: (1) his counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

A petitioner's bare assertions are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787100\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/938/#p941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. \"Where a defendant voluntarily pleads guilty to an offense, he waives all non-jurisdictional rights incident to trial[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034679\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/824/#p826\">\n    60 So.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 6). \"This 'waiver includes all claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, except insofar as the alleged ineffectiveness relates to the voluntariness of the giving of the guilty plea.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034679\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/824/#p826\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Bibbs voluntarily signed and accepted the terms of a guilty-plea deal. Bibbs now claims that, had he been properly informed of the lesser charge of simple battery, \"maybe\" the actual plea deal or its negotiation would have gone differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. The plea deal, which was read and signed by Bibbs and his attorney, advised that if he pled guilty, he could be sentenced to a minimum of three years and a maximum of \"almost life.\" The deal further advised that \"the sentence is up to the [c]ourt; that the [c]ourt is not required to carry out any understanding made by [Bibbs] and his attorney with the [d]istrict [a]ttorney; and further, that the [c]ourt is not required to follow the recommendation of the [d]istrict [a]ttorney, if any.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. During the plea hearing, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [COURT]: Are you under the influence of any alcohol or drugs this morning?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [BIBBS]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [COURT]: Have you had any physical or emotional problem that would prevent you from participating in this hearing or understanding what we're doing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [BIBBS]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [COURT]: It's your decision to enter into this petition based on your own free will?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [COURT]: Can you read and write?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [COURT]: Can you acknowledge that-do you acknowledge that you've read this petition and went over it with [your attorney]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [COURT]: Do you have any questions about it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [BIBBS]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [COURT]: Do you have a lot of confidence in [your attorney]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [COURT]: Do you believe he knows what he is doing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [COURT]: Have you told him everything he needs to know to represent you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [COURT]: Do you understand, Mr. Bibbs, that if you plead guilty that this court may sentence you to the minimum of three years but to the maximum of most of your natural life?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [COURT]: Has anybody put any pressure on you now to come up and change your plea and admit you're guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [BIBBS]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [COURT]: Anybody promised you anything like a certain amount of years sentence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [BIBBS]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [COURT]: You understand that I may sentence you anywhere in that range?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [BIBBS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [COURT]: Do you have any questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [BIBBS]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 10. The record shows that the voluntariness of the plea is not in dispute. Bibbs was advised and understood the nature of the charge against him, and what his options and consequences were as far as signing the petition or going to trial. A voluntary guilty plea waives a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel except insofar as the alleged ineffectiveness relates to the voluntariness of the giving of the guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Hill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034679\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/824/#p826\">\n    60 So.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 6). Bibbs does not adequately raise any issue regarding the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Accordingly, there is no merit to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 11. In direct contradiction to Bibbs's current claims, Bibbs's signed plea deal states that his lawyer \"counseled and advised [him] on the nature of each charge [and] on any and all lesser-included charges[.]\" He later confirmed this statement to the trial judge. Further, Bibbs does not explain how the inclusion of a simple battery charge is relevant to the present case, nor does he offer any specific facts or evidence as to how he may be eligible for the lesser charge of simple battery. Therefore, Bibbs failed to illustrate that the lesser charge not being included was prejudicial in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 12. Additionally, Bibbs claims his counsel was ineffective by not investigating his mental history, and for failing to bring Bibbs's mental status to the attention of the court. However, the record indicates no sign of incompetency, nor does Bibbs offer any additional evidence or affidavits to support his claim. \" '[T]he trial court may dismiss a motion for post-conviction relief if the petitioner fails to submit affidavits in support of his allegations' of ineffective assistance; the petitioner's bare assertions are insufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Berryhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787100\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/938/#p941\">\n    197 So.3d at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 10) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayhan v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7052179\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/26/1072/#p1076\">\n    26 So.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. Ct. App. 2009) ). His statements from his plea hearing concerning his physical and emotional fitness, as well as his acknowledgments to the judge of the choice he was making, are in direct contrast with his present claim of mental instability. Bibbs's\n   broad assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel are insufficient to support his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 13. Bibbs has failed to show that his counsel's performance was deficient, and that the alleged deficiency prejudiced his defense. Bibbs has failed to show that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Accordingly, Bibbs's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. We affirm the circuit court's dismissal of Bibbs's PCCR motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 14.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING, P.J., BARNES, CARLTON, FAIR, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
