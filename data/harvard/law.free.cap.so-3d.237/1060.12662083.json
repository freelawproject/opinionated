Notwithstanding Burk's sentence as a prison releasee reoffender under section 775.082(9)(a)(3)(a), Florida Statutes (2007), the trial court had a nondiscretionary duty to sentence Burks to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment under section 775.087(2)(a)(3), Florida Statutes (2007), and therefore, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 9, 2007, Burks was charged by information with aggravated assault with a firearm, attempted first degree murder with a firearm, and resisting an officer without violence. A jury found Burks guilty on all counts. The jury also made a specific finding that during the commission of the offense of attempted first degree murder with a firearm, Burks possessed a firearm, which he discharged causing great bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court sentenced Burks to a twenty-year minimum mandatory term on the charge of aggravated assault with a firearm, and to a term of 364 days, time served, on the charge of resisting an officer without violence. As to the charge of attempted first degree murder with a firearm, the trial court sentenced Burks to a term of natural life under the Prison Releasee Reoffender (\"PRR\") statute, specifically section 775.082(9)(a)(3)(a), Florida Statutes (2007). Of significance to this appeal, although the jury found that Burks discharged a firearm causing great bodily harm during the commission of the attempted first degree murder, the trial court did not sentence Burks under section 775.087(2)(a)(3), Florida Statutes (2007)-commonly known as the \"10/20/Life\" statute-which provides that a \"convicted person shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years and not more than a term of imprisonment of life in prison\" when a defendant discharges a firearm inflicting death or great bodily harm during the commission or attempted commission of enumerated felonies. With regard to its unwillingness to impose a mandatory minimum sentence under section 775.087(2)(a)(3), the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   He is serving life with no possibility of parole; so there is no reason at this point to impose that. For some reason it comes back on appeal as to P.R.R. ot [sic] being valid, then obviously, we will look at the 25 min. mand. to possibly life at 10, 20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court affirmed Burks's convictions and sentences on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Burks v.

That statute provides, in relevant part, that a prison releasee reoffender who commits a felony punishable by life \"is not eligible for sentencing under the sentencing guidelines and must be sentenced as follows: a. For a felony punishable by life, by a term of imprisonment for life.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022971\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/69/261/#p268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A defendant sentenced as a prison releasee reoffender also \"shall not be eligible for parole, control release, or any form of early release\" and \"must serve 100 percent of the court-imposed sentence.\" \u00a7 775.082(9)(b), Fla. Stat. (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Burks contends that the trial court erred in failing to sentence him under Florida's 10/20/Life statute, specifically section 775.087(2)(a)(3), and that the failure to do so rendered his sentence illegal. Section 775.087(2)(a)(3) provides for mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment where a defendant discharged a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony resulting in death or great bodily harm and states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2)(a) 1. Any person who is convicted of a felony or an attempt to commit a felony, regardless of whether the use of a weapon is an element of the felony, and the conviction was for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a. Murder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3. Any person who is convicted of a felony or an attempt to commit a felony listed in sub-subparagraphs (a)1.a.-q., regardless of whether the use of a weapon is an element of the felony, and during the course of the commission of the felony such person discharged a \"firearm\" or \"destructive device\" as defined in s. 790.001 and, as the result of the discharge, death or great bodily harm was inflicted upon any person, the convicted person\n   <em>\n    shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years and not more than a term of imprisonment of life in prison\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00a7 775.087(2)(a)(3), Fla. Stat. (2007) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Burks is correct that the trial court was required to sentence him under section 775.087(2)(a)(3), the relevant provision of the 10/20/Life statute. Section 775.087(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (2007), specifically states that \"[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that offenders who actually possess ... firearms ... be punished to the fullest extent of the law, and the\n   <em>\n    minimum terms of imprisonment imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be imposed for each qualifying felony count\n   </em>\n   for which the person is convicted.\" (emphasis added). A trial court, therefore, has no discretion in deciding whether to sentence a defendant under section 775.087(2) when a defendant possessed or discharged a firearm during the commission of an enumerated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunbar v.

The State's argument, however, is contrary to Florida Supreme Court precedent that the specific provisions of section 775.087(2) control over the general provisions of section 775.082 regarding statutory maximums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

The Florida Supreme Court agreed with the Fourth District that the language of section 775.087(2)(c)\"plainly requires that the mandatory minimum sentence be imposed concurrently with the minimum mandatory sentence of the PRR statute even though the 10-20-LIFE sentence is less than the PRR sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312771\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/957/605/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312771\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/957/605/#p607\">\n    at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
