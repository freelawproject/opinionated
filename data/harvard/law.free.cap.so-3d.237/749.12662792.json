Craig Sallie was charged with one count of aggravated assault for shooting Gregory Johnson in the back and one count of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. A Madison County jury found Sallie guilty of both counts, and the circuit court sentenced him to twenty years and ten years, respectively, with sentences to run concurrently in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). The circuit court also sentenced Sallie to an additional ten years pursuant to the firearm-enhancement statute under Mississippi Code Section 97-37-37 (Rev. 2014), with that sentence to run consecutively to the other sentences, for a total sentence of thirty years in the MDOC. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Sallie v.

On remand, the circuit court restructured Sallie's remaining sentences to run consecutively instead of concurrently, resulting in a thirty-year sentence without the enhanced penalty portion prescribed by Section 97-37-37.

Sallie petitions this Court for certiorari review, raising one issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Whether the trial court's decision to change the sentences to run [consecutively] on Count I and Count II was error because the Court of Appeals affirmed those convictions and sentences and the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded only the sentence pursuant to [ Section 97-37-37 ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5. On November 28, 2011, Johnson walked past Sallie's house en route to his own home. Sallie, who previously had accused Johnson of stealing a bottle of whisky from him, yelled at Johnson, demanding that Johnson come into his (Sallie's) yard. Johnson refused and told Sallie to come into the street so they could settle the dispute \"like men.\" Johnson called Sallie an expletive and then turned to walk away. Sallie pulled out a gun and started shooting. Sallie shot Johnson five times, with one bullet hitting Johnson in the spine, paralyzing him from the waist down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6. Sallie was charged with aggravated assault and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The jury found Sallie guilty of both counts. Afterward, the trial court scheduled a sentencing hearing and stated, \"I also wish to consider the firearm enhancement as provided by 97-37-37(2).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-37-37\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-37-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (\"any convicted felon who uses or displays a firearm during the commission of any felony shall ... be sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment ... of ten (10) years\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7. At the sentencing hearing, Sallie objected to application of Section 97-37-37 based on lack of notice from the State and based on the trial court raising the enhancement sua sponte. The trial court sentenced Sallie to twenty years for aggravated assault, ten years for felon in possession of a firearm; the court then enhanced the sentence by ten years under Section 97-37-37(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8. Sallie appealed, claiming the trial court erred by limiting Sallie's cross-examination\n   of Johnson at trial, and that the firearm enhancement to his sentence post-trial was illegal given that Sallie did not receive pretrial notice that he might be sentenced under that statute. The Court of Appeals found no merit in either assignment of error raised by Sallie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9. Addressing the latter issue, the Court of Appeals found the enhanced portion of Sallie's sentence did not run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and therefore was legal.\n   <em>\n    Sallie (I)\n   </em>\n   , 155 So.3d at 875. In analyzing\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , the court found that all the elements of the firearm enhancement had been submitted properly to the jury and had been found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that the indictment did not need to reference the enhancement statute; therefore, there was no unfair surprise regarding the firearm enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. This Court granted certiorari, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   We agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting Sallie's cross-examination of Johnson. Therefore, we limit our review to the question of whether Sallie received fair notice of the firearm enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guice v.

In analyzing the issue, this Court agreed with the Court of Appeals as to\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , that the jury had found the elements of the firearm enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 762-63. But the majority also found that Sallie did not receive fair notice that an enhanced punishment would be sought until after his conviction, which violated Sallie's right to due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 764.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12. The majority concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   We decline to find error that would reverse Sallie's convictions. Therefore, we affirm in part the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the trial court. However, we find that Sallie did not receive timely or sufficient notice that the State intended to enhance his sentence using the firearm enhancement. Using the firearm enhancement to increase Sallie's sentence resulted in unfair surprise. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the trial court, vacate Sallie's sentence, and remand the case to the Madison County Circuit Court for resentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13. On remand, the trial court held a sentencing hearing, after which the trial court stated for the record as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   All right. I'm going to impose the same sentence as to Count I: 20 years in the custody of the [MDOC.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The same sentence in Count II: 10 years in the custody of the of the [MDOC], but I'm going to order that those sentences run consecutively to each other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   When I imposed the original sentence and ordered that they run concurrently, I believe[d] that he was going to have another 10-year sentence that would be running consecutively to those sentences, and the [Supreme] Court has now found that that particular enhancement was improper, so that'll be the sentence of the [c]ourt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14. Sallie appealed, claiming the trial court was without authority to alter the sentences from running concurrently to running consecutively. The case was assigned to the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15. On appeal, Sallie relied primarily on two cases for his claim that the change to his original sentence was illegal:\n   <em>\n    Leonard v.

Finding both\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Eastman\n   </em>\n   inapplicable, the Court of Appeals reasoned that this Court had vacated Sallie's entire sentence in\n   <em>\n    Sallie\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   ) ; therefore, the trial court had the authority to impose upon Sallie a new sentence within the same thirty-year parameter structured by the trial court in its original sentencing order.\n   <em>\n    Sallie\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    III\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12662793\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/237/758/\">\n    237 So.3d at 761-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207636895\">\n    2016 WL 7636895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

The Seventh Circuit said, \"we are mindful of the Supreme Court's admonition in\n   <em>\n    DiFrancesco\n   </em>\n   that 'the Constitution does not require that sentencing should be a game in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550478\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1111/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550478\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1111/\">\n    at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    DiFrancesco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715584\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/117/#p132\">\n    449 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715584\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/117/#p132\">\n    101 S.Ct. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Seventh Circuit explained that \"[w]hen a defendant is convicted of more\n   than one count of a multicount indictment, the district court is likely to fashion a sentencing package in which sentences on individual counts are interdependent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715584\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/117/#p132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And \"[b]ecause the sentences are interdependent, reversal of convictions underlying some, but not all, of the sentences renders the sentencing package ineffective in carrying out the district court's sentencing intent as to any one of the sentences on the affirmed convictions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715584\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/117/#p132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 30.

The circuit judge then restructured Sallie's sentence to implement his original intention.

In Sallie's first appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, and this Court granted certiorari for the limited purpose of \"address[ing] the issue of whether Sallie was entitled to notice of the firearm enhancement to his sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Sallie v.

The only authority granted the circuit court by this Court was to remove the firearm enhancement from Sallie's sentence.
