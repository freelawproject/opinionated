Aaron Lyons was convicted of one count of manslaughter in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-25 (Rev. 2014) and one count of armed robbery in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-79 (Rev. 2014). Lyons appeals his conviction. This Court finds no error and affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Around 4:45 a.m. on January 16, 2004, a customer discovered the lifeless body of John Deere outside of the Pik &amp; Pak convenience store, which Deere owned, in Brookhaven, Mississippi. Deere was robbed at gunpoint and shot three times. Shortly after Deere's body was discovered, a volunteer firefighter from the Summit Fire Department responded to a small roadside grassfire. The fireman discovered various items alongside the road, including a small metal cash box where the fire originated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Lincoln County investigators soon arrived on the scene to inspect the area and seize evidence. Deere's widow later identified the cash box as belonging to her deceased husband. Investigators also collected DNA samples from the items found near the fire, but the DNA did not match any known person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In 2013, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department received a DNA sample belonging to Lyons. Lyons's DNA profile matched a sample recovered from a pair of black FUBU jeans discovered at the scene of the fire. Investigators then determined that Lyons lived in Brookhaven at the time of the crime with his then girlfriend, Lavatrus Harris. On September 3, 2014, Lyons was indicted in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County on charges of murder, armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. At trial, Sonya Ewell testified that at some point early in their relationship, Lyons told her of the robbery and murder that he and Harris committed together in Brookhaven in 2004. Ewell testified that on a trip in December 2011 from Humble, Texas, to Brookhaven to visit family, Lyons drove her and his cousin past the scene of the crime and gestured at the gas station and stated, \"that's where it happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Lyons sought to exclude Ewell's testimony by claiming Ewell was his common-law wife, and the spousal privilege precluded her testimony. Lyons also argued that Ewell was not a competent witness and was allowed to testify in violation of Mississippi Rule of Evidence 601. The trial\n   court ruled that Lyons's admission to Ewell occurred before they allegedly entered into a common-law marriage, which meant the privilege did not apply, and the presence of Lyons's cousin in the vehicle removed the conversation from privilege even if Lyons could invoke the spousal privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. After a jury trial from June 2 through June 4, 2015, a jury convicted Lyons of manslaughter and armed robbery. On June 11, 2015, Lyons filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial. On June 18, 2015, the trial court denied the motion. Lyons now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. Lyons argues on appeal, through his appellant's brief and supplemental brief, that: (1) the trial court erred in allowing Lyons's alleged former common-law wife to testify in violation of Mississippi Rules of Evidence 504 and 601(a) ; (2) the verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence; (3) the State violated Lyons's right to due process by not disclosing a copy of the official paperwork from the DNA test results on the purple cloth; (4) the State created a materially false impression of the evidence; (5) his right to a fair trial was violated when a State's witness used a cell phone while on the stand; (6) his right to a fair trial was violated when the trial court allowed a picture of the victim to remain displayed to the jury during closing arguments; (7) the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial; (8) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; (9) the trial court erred in denying jury instruction D-10; and (10) cumulative error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    I. The trial court did not err in allowing Lyons's alleged former common-law wife to testify.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. Lyons first argues that Ewell's testimony was inadmissible. Specifically, Lyons claims the court erred when it found the spousal privilege in Mississippi Rule of Evidence 504 did not preclude Ewell's testimony and that Ewell was a competent witness under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. \"The standard of review for either the admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v.

Lyons has the burden of demonstrating reversible error on the part of the trial court in allowing Ewell's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicolaou v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308189\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/612/1080/#p1084\">\n    612 So.2d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1084 (Miss. 1992) (disagreed with on other grounds).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. Mississippi law does not recognize a common-law marriage.\n   <em>\n    George v. George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9616654\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/389/1389/#p1390\">\n    389 So.2d 1389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1390 (Miss. 1980).

App. 2015). Therefore, Mississippi will still recognize common-law marriages that are valid in other states.\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9616654\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/389/1389/#p1390\">\n    389 So.2d at 1390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we must consider whether Lyons and Harris had a valid common-law marriage in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. Texas law dictates that \"an informal or common-law marriage exists in Texas if the parties (1) agreed to be married, (2) lived together in Texas as husband and wife after the agreement, and (3) there presented to others that they were married.\"\n   <em>\n    Small v. McMaster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316959\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/352/280/#p282\">\n    352 S.W.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (Tex. App. 2011). Prior to the alleged crime, Lyons lived in Humble, Texas. There, he started and maintained a\n   relationship with Ewell from November 2011 until February 2014. They did not marry. However, Ewell testified that sometimes she and Lyons referred to themselves as husband and wife. Ewell also testified that she and Lyons learned they could be considered common-law husband and wife around 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. Based on this testimony, the court could have found that Lyons and Ewell had met the first two requirements for a Texas common-law marriage. As to the third requirement, Ewell testified that she introduced Lyons to friends and family as her \"husband,\" her \"ex-boyfriend,\" and her \"ex-husband,\" independently and with great frequency. She testified that the nature of their relationship and the way it was labeled shifted constantly with changing circumstances in their lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. In a similar case in Texas where a common-law marriage was in dispute, the Texas Court of Appeals held that \"[w]hether the evidence is sufficient to establish that a couple held themselves out as husband and wife turns on whether the couple had a reputation in the community for being married.\"\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316959\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/352/280/#p282\">\n    352 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   285 (citing\n   <em>\n    Eris v. Phares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120969\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/39/708/#p715\">\n    39 S.W.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (Tex. App. 2001) ). Proving a reputation for being married requires evidence that the couple \"consistently conducted themselves as husband and wife in the public eye or that the community viewed them as married.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120969\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/39/708/#p715\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Further, the \"occasional introductions as husband and wife do not establish the element of\" common-law marriage of the man and woman holding themselves out as husband and wife.\n   <em>\n    Winfield v. Renfro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985185\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/821/640/#p651\">\n    821 S.W.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 651 (Tex. App. 1991) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. We find that there was evidence that Lyons and Ewell failed to consistently hold themselves out as husband and wife. Therefore, no common-law marriage existed under Texas law, and Ewell's testimony was outside the scope of Mississippi's spousal privilege. We find no error in the admission of Ewell's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. Further, Even if Lyons and Ewell proved a valid Texas common-law marriage, Lyons's statement to Ewell about the robbery and murder would not be protected by the Rule 504 privilege because the statement was made before the alleged \"marriage\" began. Ewell also testified that she and Lyon did not enter into a relationship until November 2011. Although she could not remember the exact date of Lyons's confession, she knew it was \"early on in the relationship\" and before their trip to Brookhaven in December of 2011. Ewell also testified that it was \"quite possible that [the confession] occurred even before [Lyons] moved in with [her].\" In fact, the trial court asked whether it was possible that the confession was made to her while they were not common-law husband and wife, Ewell replied, \"Correct, it's very possible.\" Therefore, Rule 504 did not protect the statement that occurred before the formation of the alleged common-law marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. Moreover, there was also evidence that Lyons's cousin was in the car while Lyons drove Ewell around Brookhaven. Rule 504 protects statements made by one spouse to another that are intended to remain confidential.\n   <em>\n    Martin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175058\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/773/415/#p417\">\n    773 So.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417 (\u00b6 5) (Miss. 2000). The presence of a third party negates the intent for the statement to remain confidential between husband and wife.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175058\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/773/415/#p417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the statement made by Lyons to Ewell in front of a third party was not confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7009421\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/290/#p294\">\n    102 So.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012) (spousal immunity does not apply to communications between spouses made in the presence of a third party).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18. For these reasons, we find no reversible error in Ewell's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    II. Whether the verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19. Lyons next challenges the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial. \"This Court reviews a trial court's denial of a motion for a new trial based on an abuse-of-discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchum v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6871209\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/477/#p482\">\n    164 So.3d 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482 (\u00b6 19) (Miss.

When we review \"a denial of a motion for a new trial based on an objection to the weight of the evidence, we will only disturb a verdict when it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

With this standard in mind, we must weigh the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9028388\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/895/836/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20. Lyons claims that the jury's verdicts were contrary to the fact that Harris and Ewell both had motives and colluded to frame him, another person admitted to committing the crimes, and the State never proved that he wore or owned the black FUBU jeans that were found at the scene of the roadside fire with the burning cash box belonging to Deere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21. Lyons argues that Harris and Ewell attempted to frame him for the crimes because of their mutual disdain for him. He contends they used information about the crimes that could have come from news reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22. In addition to Ewell's testimony discussed above, Harris testified that she was with Lyons on the day of the crime. After signing an immunity agreement, Harris testified that she helped Lyons scout out the location of the crime. She also helped obtain a stolen car and placed the car in position for Lyons to flee after executing the robbery. Harris also stated that on the day of the crime, shortly after Lyons left the stolen car and headed toward the Pik &amp; Pak, she heard three gunshots and saw Lyons running back to the car carrying a small box. Harris testified that after Lyons got back into the car, he was crying and demanded that Harris drive back to Lyons's truck so as not to \"get [him] caught.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 23. Harris testified that she returned the stolen car after Lyons wiped it down with a grey or purple fabric-similar to one of the items recovered at the scene of the fire-and got back into Lyons's eighteen-wheeler work truck. Allegedly, Lyons ordered Harris into the sleeping compartment of the truck and closed the curtain. Though Harris could not tell where Lyons drove, she testified that she thought it was the interstate, judging by the number of cars she heard passing the truck. Harris then testified that the truck stopped and Lyons got out of the truck and was gone for some time. Harris never saw the small cash box again. Lyons returned with threats to Harris while pointing a revolver at her head: \"[Y]ou ever tell on me, you know, I'll kill your mama, your daddy and your brother.\" Harris asked Lyons what he had done, to which he responded, \"I told the [expletive] to stop looking at me .... [H]e wouldn't stop looking at me .... I told him, 'don't turn around.' \" Lyons, however, disputes the accuracy of Harris's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 24. Jurors have the duty to resolve any conflicts in witness testimony.\n   <em>\n    Boone v.

Also, jurors are permitted to \"believe or disbelieve, accept or reject, the utterances of any witness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8302277\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/973/237/#p243\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"A reviewing court cannot and need not determine with exactitude\n   which witness or what testimony the jury believed or disbelieved in arriving at its verdict.

Lyons also argues that Lincoln County investigators initially arrested and indicted Kenneth Baggett for the crimes when a witness, Will Hutson, stated that he was with Baggett when he murdered Deere. However, Dewitt Bates, the district attorney at the time of the murder, testified that the case against Baggett was ultimately dismissed for a serious lack of physical evidence connecting him to the crime. Thus, there is insufficient evidence that Baggett, and not Lyons, committed the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 26. In addition, there was physical evidence that connected Lyons to the crime. Although the State never technically proved that the FUBU jeans belonged to Lyons or that he ever wore them, Lyons's DNA was found on the jeans that were found next to the stolen cash box that belonged to Deere. There was the cloth that Harris testified that Lyons used to wipe down the stolen car used for the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27. Because we find that the verdict is not so contrary to the weight of the evidence as to create an unconscionable injustice, this Court must affirm and uphold the jury's verdict. We find no merit to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    III. Whether Lyons's right to due process was violated by not disclosing a copy of the official paperwork from testing the purple cloth from the DNA lab.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 28. In his supplemental brief, Lyons argues the trial court committed error when it allowed the State to present DNA evidence from an untimely disclosed DNA report.

Lyons argues that Rodgers testified that the cloth did not contain any DNA evidence from Lyons, but did from Harris. The State asserted the presence of Harris's DNA corroborates her version of events. Lyons, however, contends that Harris testified she did not aid in the\n   crime, so the presence of her DNA on the cloth discredits rather than substantiates her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 31.

This Court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lyons's request for a mistrial. The trial court admonished and polled the jury to make assurances that they knew there was no evidence of these other crimes and that they should ignore the statement and not consider it whatsoever. Based on these actions, the trial court took appropriate measures to cure any potential prejudicial effect of the remark.
