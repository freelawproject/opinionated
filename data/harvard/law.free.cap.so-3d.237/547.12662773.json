Queen (hereinafter, \"Defendant\") was charged by grand jury indictment with one count of armed robbery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:64, one count of armed robbery with a firearm, a violation of La.R.S. 14:64.3, one count of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, a violation of La.R.S. 14:95.1, and one count of possession of a firearm in a firearm free zone, a\n   violation of La.R.S. 14:95.2. On January 16, 2009, Defendant pled not guilty to the charges. On August 20, 2009, Defendant filed several motions, including a Motion to Substitute Counsel. According to the minutes, the trial court granted Defendant's request to represent himself, in part, and appointed co-counsel. On September 22, 2009, the State severed the charges of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm in a firearm-free zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the September 22, 2009 hearing, Defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and tendered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. On November 4, 2009, the trial court appointed a sanity commission to determine Defendant's competency to proceed and stayed all proceedings. On April 14, 2010, the trial court found Defendant competent to proceed and relieved the Public Defender's Office from being co-counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 21, 2010, upon the State's motion, the trial court amended the indictment to include the names of the victims to counts one and two, to add predicate convictions on count three, and to correct a spelling error in count four. Defendant tendered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to the amended bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 17, 2016, the day before trial, the trial court heard a motion in which Defendant requested that he be represented by counsel in entirety. The trial court granted the motion after Defendant stated under oath that he wanted counsel to represent him. On October 18, 2016, the State reiterated its decision to sever certain charges from the bill and proceed to trial on armed robbery and armed robbery with a firearm. Upon the State's motion, the trial court ordered counts one and two of the bill amended as to the names of the victims. Defendant was re-arraigned on the amended bill and maintained his previous plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After a trial held October 18, 2016, and October 19, 2016, a unanimous jury found Defendant guilty as charged of armed robbery and armed robbery with a firearm. Subsequently, on December 14, 2016, the trial court denied Defendant's motion for new trial. After Defendant waived the twenty-four hour delay for sentencing, the trial court sentenced Defendant on the armed robbery conviction to seventy-five years in the Department of Corrections to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence and on the armed robbery with a firearm conviction to five years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The trial court ordered the armed robbery with a firearm sentence to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for armed robbery. The State also gave notice of its intent to file a habitual offender bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 3, 2017, Defendant filed a Motion and Order for Appeal, which was granted that same date. Defendant's is now before this court, in brief alleging three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 19, 2008, Defendant went into Thrifty Way Pharmacy in Lake Charles, Louisiana, armed with a firearm, and demanded the pharmacist give him certain pills. Defendant was apprehended shortly after the robbery and identified by the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find that there is one potential error patent regarding Defendant's waiver of his right to counsel and an error patent regarding\n   the advisement of the time period for filing post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The one possible error patent concerns Defendant's waiver of his right to counsel. The record contains multiple minute entries and hearings regarding Defendant's request to represent himself. At most proceedings, Defendant was assisted by co-counsel. Ultimately, Defendant was represented by counsel in full at trial and at sentencing. Because several hearings occurred with Defendant either representing himself or having the assistance of co-counsel, we will address Defendant's waiver of right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In conducting an error patent review of the waiver of the right to counsel, this court has examined the adequacy of the waiver.\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the trial court allows this kind of arrangement the defendant acts as his only legal representative. The legal counsel that is appointed does not represent the defendant; he only advises him. Because the court appointed attorney is only acting as an advisor, the accused is abandoning his right to be represented by counsel. At the same time he is exercising his right to self-representation. Therefore, when an attorney is appointed as an advisor the accused must knowingly abandon his right to be represented by counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, although co-counsel was appointed as an advisor to Dupre, counsel spent a significant portion of the trial representing Dupre. Taylor argued motions, made objections, examined witnesses and assisted in closing arguments. The fact that Taylor partially represented Dupre at trial raises the initial issue of whether Dupre was thereby afforded all the benefits of legal representation and whether this representation abrogated the need for an adequate waiver of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We hold that it did not. Even though he has an attorney partially representing him, when the accused assumes\n   functions that are at the core of the lawyer's traditional role, as Dupre did, he will often undermine his own defense. Because he has a constitutional right to have his lawyer perform core functions, he must knowingly and intelligently waive that right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

What is your full name.[sic]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A. Timothy Hugh Queen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. And your date of birth, Mr. Queen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. October 31st, 1966.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. October, 1966?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. So, you're 30-43 years old?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. 43 this year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. You're 42 now, will be 43 this year?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. Okay. What kind of education background do you have, Mr. Queen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. I completed my GED in high school. I've got approximately a year in college toward an associate applied science in paralegal study.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. Okay. And you've been in a criminal court setting before this time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. How many times?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. Several times in Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. Have you gone through trials before?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. Have you ever represented yourself?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. In what case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. A couple in Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. What were they?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. One was a felony possession case, and the other one was-it was felony theft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. Okay. What was the result of those verdicts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. The theft was dismissed, and the possession was dropped to a Class A misdemeanor, time served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. Did you go to trial on those cases?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. I went to trial on the theft case; and before we went in there to pick a jury, they dismissed it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. And you were representing yourself, you didn't have-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. Did you have court-appointed counsel who was assisting you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. Did you conduct any discovery in those proceedings?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. What kind of discovery did you conduct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. I just filed basic [sic] motion for discovery and-you know, typical in a criminal case; and they provided what evidence they had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. What did you do with that evidence or that information that you got?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Basically-well, I was originally able to get the theft case reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor; and then when we went to trial on the misdemeanor is when they finally dismissed it because of evidence that I had obtained, you know, concerning the value of the items they claimed were stolen. And there was also an issue pertaining to the manner that I came across the property and related to the theft charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Q. You've been incarcerated before?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. Have you had an opportunity to review the laws of the State of Louisiana?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. Are you familiar with the laws as it concerns armed robbery?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. In what respect? How are you familiar with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. As I understand, sir, the charge of armed robbery carries from 10 to 99 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. What are the requirements for the proof of the elements of the crime?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A. The elements would be that I had intention to deprive an owner of property through threats or with a weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. That's pretty close. Have you ever appeared in a court proceeding like you are doing today representing yourself?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. In what case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. I don't have the cause [sic] number off the top of my head, but there's the theft case. The possession-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. I thought you told me they dropped it before-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. -you began?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Did you have an opportunity the [sic] ask anybody any questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. Not in that case, no, sir; but I did represent myself-there's one case I did forget about. It was a civil matter, and it is a recorded decision where I represented myself in Texas and it was concerning the relinquishment of my parental rights in an adoption. And I did-I did question witnesses in that case. The matter, though, once the case was-proceeded to trial, I was actually represented by counsel from-what they call state counsel for the offenders over in Texas that's supplied by the prison system; and I participated as co-counsel there and questioned witnesses. And the case eventually went to the Ninth Circuit in Beaumont and I was granted full relief. The adoption was overturned and my parental rights restored.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q. Have you gotten from Mr. Alexander information about your arrest and how the incident was reported and those kinds of things?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A. He filed discovery motions, yes, sir; and we obtained discovery. And I don't think it's full discovery. I don't think the state has disclosed everything that they had; but, yes, we do-we've obtained evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q. You've looked at it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Q. Is everything that you're charged with come out of one event?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   I will note for the record that you have in the past written a couple of letters to the court concerning maybe a writ of habeas that you asked for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    DEFENDANT QUEEN:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Yes, sir. That wasn't really intended for this court; but this is where it ended up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   -and you also wrote another letter to me-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    DEFENDANT QUEEN:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   For the indictment and information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   -asking for copies of indictments or maybe the bill of information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    DEFENDANT QUEEN:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Yes, sir; and also, I believe, I wrote you earlier this year pertaining to not having seen any counsel for my first three or four months here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   You wrote to me March the 2nd of '09. It was filed in the record on March the 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   All right. I'm going to grant your request in part. I'm going to allow you to represent yourself, together with Mr. Alexander. He will serve as your cocounsel, and y'all can decide your trial strategies as you go along. You seem intelligent enough and able to make your point. So, I think you've had sufficient experience and are familiar, in some respects, but not totally familiar with all of the laws of State of the Louisiana [sic]; but you, I think, you can adequately represent yourself; so, I'm going to grant your wish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    DEFENDANT QUEEN:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   And appoint you as co-counsel with court-appointed counsel, the public defenders office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although the trial court did not specifically advise Defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding to trial without counsel, considering the record as a whole, as this court did in\n   <em>\n    Poche\n   </em>\n   , the trial court was aware that Defendant was \"literate, competent, and understood the charges against him and the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    Poche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8450704\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1225/#p1231\">\n    924 So.2d at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, Defendant was well aware of the judicial process and was assisted by co-counsel at numerous proceedings. Thus, the record as a whole supports a finding that Defendant adequately waived his right to counsel during pre-trial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   We note that after the August 20, 2009 waiver, the subject of Defendant's representation was revisited many times, most of which were brought about by Defendant's request to change his co-counsel and Defendant's request to have\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   hearings regarding the adequacy of funding available to the Public Defender's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   When Defendant was found competent to proceed on April 14, 2010, the trial court granted the Public Defender's Office's \"Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel of Record\" because Defendant had filed suit against the Public Defender's Office. Defendant asked the court to clarify that he was proceeding without the assistance of co-counsel. At the next hearing held May 21, 2010, Defendant did not have the assistance of co-counsel. At that proceeding, the trial court again dealt with the issue of Defendant's access to legal resources, which was reset for July 21, 2010. The trial court also denied Defendant's claim that his protection against double jeopardy was being violated by being charged with both armed robbery and armed robbery with a firearm. Additionally, the trial court denied\n   Defendant's motion to quash based on lack of discovery and denied a motion for preliminary examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   At the May 21, 2010 proceeding, Defendant also filed a motion concerning conflict of interest of co-counsel, which the trial court denied since Defendant was representing himself. Defendant argued that he had a right to build a record as to why he was representing himself, but the trial court denied Defendant's request. At that same proceeding, the State amended the bill to change the victims and to add a predicate offense to the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Defendant re-entered his same plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The cover page of a hearing held July 21, 2010, indicates Defendant again had co-counsel, but nothing in the transcript of the hearing indicates co-counsel participated. On August 25, 2010, the trial court heard Defendant's motion to vacate the order relieving the Public Defender's Office. The State informed the trial court that it believed Defendant needed to be represented and that an attorney not associated with the Public Defender's Office should be appointed to represent Defendant. Noting that Defendant was a named plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the Public Defender's Office, the trial court refused to vacate its earlier order relieving the Public Defender's Office from representing Defendant. Instead, the trial court appointed Eugene Bouquet, an independent contractor with the Public Defender's Office, to represent Defendant. When Defendant asked the trial court if Mr. Bouquet was representing him in full or as co-counsel, the trial court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   I'm going to leave you as co-counsel, if you want to be. If you don't want to be, then stop talking and stop filing papers. If you want to be co-counsel, then you can continue to do stuff. Okay? But it has to be signed by you and Mr. Bouquet, co-counsel-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendant informed the trial court that it was never his intention to represent himself and that he did so only because of the lack of competent counsel. The trial court proceeded with Defendant's Motion to Recuse the District Attorney, apparently without Mr. Bouquet. After Defendant questioned a witness, the trial court denied the motion to recuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   At a hearing held May 11, 2011, Defendant was assisted by co-counsel Eugene Bouquet. The trial court denied a motion to recuse the trial judge filed by Defendant. The trial court decided that after the doctors reported on Defendant's insanity at the time of the offense, it would decide whether Defendant should represent himself in the entirety or have co-counsel. At a hearing held August 17, 2011, the trial court heard a bond reduction hearing with the presence of cocounsel. A motion for the appointment of ad hoc counsel was denied because Defendant had been allowed to represent himself. At that same proceeding, the trial court heard a\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion filed by Defendant, which was held in abeyance until other witnesses could be called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   At a hearing held October 31, 2012, James Dixon of the Public Defender's Office summarized Defendant's attorney situation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   MR. DIXON: James Dixon, Your Honor, from the Public Defender's Office. Your Honor, I have been subpoenaed in the matter of State V. Timothy Queen, Case No. 6736-09.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Your Honor, I have requested-I submitted a handwritten motion to quash the subpoena. The basis for Mr. Queen's motion is essentially this: Initially, he was appointed Eugene Bouquet to represent\n   him from the Public Defender's Office. And as you recall, he filed various motions stating that Mr. Bouquet was overworked, had too many cases. He had about 150 cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   When we hired Donald Sauviac, we thought, \"Well, we can remedy that situation.\" We transferred the case to Mr. Sauviac, who had fewer than 50 cases. And when Mr. Sauviac left and his cases were transferred to Mike McHale, that case went to Mike McHale. Mr. McHale also has fewer than 50 cases. So Mr. Queen got exactly what he wanted for [sic], an attorney with fewer cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   He has now filed a motion asking that Mr. Bouquet be reappointed and has subpoenaed me to testify in that hearing. My point is this: At this point, it would seem that Mr. Bouquet-excuse me-Mr. Queen is simply abusing the process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The trial court denied Defendant's motion to have Mike McHale dismissed from the case and Eugene Bouquet reappointed. When Mr. McHale asked the trial judge to clarify his role in representing Defendant, the trial judge responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   THE COURT: You would be considered, I guess, lead counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   MR. MCHALE: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   THE COURT: I'm not sure how else to describe it. I have given Mr. Queen the opportunity to in part represent himself. And Mr. Kimball has explained to him that one of his defenses doesn't make a whole lot of sense, that he believes himself capable enough to represent himself, yet he wants to claim insanity at the time and the commission of the offense as a defense. And that probably is not going to bode well with the jury, but that's his business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   MR. MCHALE: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   THE COURT: Okay? So any motions that he files on his own, you may give him some advice, but he is on his own on those motions. Any motions that you file on your own-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   MR. MCHALE: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   THE COURT: -you control the motions that you file, and he controls the motions that he files. And he's not having very much luck with his motions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The next hearing transcript in the record, September 27, 2013, indicates Mr. King Alexander was back as counsel for Defendant. In the body of the transcript, however, it appears Mr. McHale terminated his contract with the Public Defender's Office; thus, all of his files were being assigned to Mr. Shelton. Mr. Shelton assisted Defendant at another proceeding held January 15, 2014, at which Defendant filed a motion to substitute counsel. According to the trial judge's summary of the motion, Defendant was seeking to substitute another counsel because Mr. Shelton had not helped him and had not prepared. The trial court denied the motion to substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Mr. Shelton assisted Defendant at a hearing on a motion to recuse the trial judge held June 27, 2014. At a subsequent proceeding held October 6, 2014, Defendant appeared without the assistance of co-counsel on a motion to declare La.Code Crim.P. art. 782(a) and La.Const. Article I, \u00a7 17 unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion. On November 25, 2014, Defendant appeared with Mr. Shelton, again filing a motion to substitute counsel. Defendant alleged that Mr. Shelton had a conflict of interest between some of his clients and Defendant. The trial court denied the motion to substitute counsel. The following colloquy took place as to Defendant's assistance from Mr. Shelton:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   MR. SHELTON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Mr. Queen actually desires to represent himself. I'm actually as counsel-\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   No, that isn't what I desire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   MR. SHELTON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Let me talk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   MR. SHELTON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   As counsel, I'm in a precarious situation. He doesn't take my advice. He does exactly what he wants to do. Now, we've exhausted just about all of his motions. We presently have-and I'm primarily concerned about the pending charges. We still haven't gotten to that. But we have it scheduled for February 23rd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   MR. SHELTON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   To me it's time to move on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   I'm not letting you move on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Your Honor, I'd like to clarify something pertaining to what Mr. Shelton said about the-he said-I've never waived my right to counsel in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   I understand. I'm letting you assist in representing yourself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   I've told you on numerous occasions that you have, I think, changed your plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   I'm merely concerned with getting adequate counsel, and I haven't been able to consult with Mr. Shelton. I haven't been able to consult with him prior to the hearing today. I'm on my own as far as Mr. Shelton hasn't done anything. I asked him to go inspect this evidence for DNA-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   At a hearing held April 29, 2015, a new judge on the case denied Defendant's motion to substitute counsel. Mr. Shelton was present at the proceeding. On June 10, 2015, Defendant appeared with Mr. Shelton for a hearing, at which Defendant stated he wanted Mr. Shelton off of his case. On August 5, 2015, Defendant appeared with Mr. Shelton regarding the motion to substitute Mr. Shelton. Defendant complained about Mr. Shelton's diligence. During the State's questioning of Defendant regarding the motion to substitute, the State played an audio recorded jail telephone conversation between Defendant and his dad on March 6, 2015. After the recording was played, the following colloquy took place between Defendant and the State:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   Okay, now that conversation was March 6, 2015. (To Mr. Queen) You remember that now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   I had-remember the conversation; yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   And you told your dad, and I wrote it down, I kind of changed language little bit: \"If you hire a lawyer it will mess up everything I am trying to do.\" Now do you remember making that statement to your dad, now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   Okay, now. Let's go back a little history of this case, here. You first had Mr. King Alexander, and back in August, 2009, we had a motion to substitute\n   counsel because you weren't happy with King Alexander's representation of you, is-You remember that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   You did the same with Eugene Bouquet. You did the same with Mike McHale. And now, you're doing it to Robert Shelton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   Okay, so you have not-These are four attorneys who are well respected in this community and do bang-up jobs for their clients; all of them except for you, Timothy Queen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   Uh-huh (affirmative).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   You're the only one that's dissatisfied with them. But, as we heard on that there, you have a plan, and that is part of your plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   Mr. Alexander had to get off your case because you filed a suit against the local public defender's office and the state public defender's office; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   No, sir. The suit had been filed for some years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   MR. KIMBALL:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Well, you don't know that. But that's the reason you had to get off. You had filed a substitute counsel on him, everybody there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   Your plan is: No matter who we get-If we got whomever from this state, one of the most well-recognized attorneys in-in the country here, you'd be filing a motion to substitute-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   MR. QUEEN:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   No, if he did his job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   MR.

The court also heard argument as to a\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion filed by Defendant. The State argued that a\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion was not appropriate in \"hybrid representation situation.\" After hearing testimony concerning the\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion, the trial court found that all\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   criteria had been met. The trial court also denied Defendant's motion to substitute counsel for Mr. Shelton. Mr. Shelton filed a motion for speedy trial on behalf of Defendant. Defendant objected to counsel's filing of the motion for speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   On September 9, 2016, a hearing was held as to several motions filed by Defendant-a motion to quash, a motion for expiration of the time period for bringing Defendant to trial, and a \"Motion for the Court to Rescind its Order of August 20, 2009.\" At the hearing, Defendant explained that the court of appeal issued a ruling stating that his co-counsel status prevented him from raising a\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Defendant asked the trial court to have his co-counsel status removed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   So, I'm asking the Court to rescind its order for me to be co-counsel on the case and just let Robert Shelton straight up represent me, and-then-that way I can come back with a Peart and-from-refile the Peart motion, and we can-There's no need to have another hearing, because we already got a transcript of that hearing, if the State will stipulate it, and I'll take it back up on a writ with that-without having to be a co-counsel on the case, and so-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   The State objected to Defendant's motion to rescind the trial court's prior order granting Defendant co-counsel status, arguing that Defendant was simply trying to delay the case and set up an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The trial court denied Defendant's request and ordered the trial to proceed consistent with the prior order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   At a hearing held October 17, 2016, Defendant reasserted that he wanted Mr. Shelton to represent him at trial. Defendant stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   MR. QUEEN: Yes, sir. The Court heard a request to rescind my status as cocounsel and decided that I should remain cocounsel on September 9th. If the prosecutor is asking the Court merely to clarify your ruling on that motion, then I have no problem. But if the prosecutor is urging the Court to change its ruling, then I think it raises an issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-265\">\n   On October 28th, 2015, the Court denied me the opportunity to present most of my witnesses I subpoenaed for a Peart motion, and I took up a writ on that matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   The Court of Appeals found my status as cocounsel presented an obstacle to me raising a Peart claim. In response to that judgment, I filed a motion to rescind the order designating me cocounsel so I could assert the Peart claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   On September 9th, the prosecutor opposed my motion to rescined, arguing I should remain on this case as cocounsel. And the Court argued-agreed and denied the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n   I gave notice of intent to seek writs on that, and the Court ordered the transcript to be delivered to me by October 10th, which was Columbus Day, and set a return date of October 11th. By letter of October 2nd, I wrote the Court to request a transcript by October 7th because of the holiday on October 10th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   Additionally, my father, the Sheriff's Office, and possibly even Mr. Shelton tried to reach the Court regarding the transcript, which was to no avail apparently because I still don't have the transcript which has prevented me from filing a writ in proper form on the [cocounsel] issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   It now appears the prosecutor wants to re-litigate the issue to assert a position opposite to the one asserted on September 9th. So other than an obstacle to a Peart claim, cocounsel presents no issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   I cannot be compelled to exercise my cocounsel status at trial and in fact will not participate at such trial. I'll leave that job to Mr. Shelton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   As I previously have expressed, my exercise of cocounsel has been to gain competent counsel by addressing systemic deficiencies in the Public Defender Office and the system in the pretrial stage. Trial is the domain of my cocounsel, Mr[.] Shelton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   Further, the doctrine of res judicata requires an issue decided between the parties by this Court cannot be re-litigated. If the State wishes to have the issue reviewed, it should join me in my request to be immediately provided the transcript of September 9th as well as this hearing and for the Court to set a new return date so we can address the cocounsel issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   I'm aware that most instances, matter involving the exercise of judicial discretion such as ruling on issues do not implicate the Court's impartiality. But if the Court were to entertain the State's request to re-litigate this issue on cocounsel and then rule in the State's favor, it would seriously undermine the Court's appearance of impartiality and give basis for a claim of judicial bias and show the Court is leaning in favor of the prosecution. And that's what I have, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   After the State responded that it needed clarification as to who he wanted to represent him at trial, the trial court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   THE COURT: Let the record reflect the same. Mr. Queen did answer the question on the record, under oath that Mr. Shelton would be representing him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   Issue No. 2, State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   MS. SIGLER: Just for final clarification, my understanding is that Mr. Queen has asked to be relieved from cocounsel status on the trial, and the State obviously has no issue with that. That is Mr. Queen's right to do if that is what-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n   THE COURT: That is implied in his response to the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   MS. SIGLER: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n   THE COURT: Next issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Before the start of trial the following day, October 18, 2016, the State notified the trial court that Defendant had filed another\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion. The State asserted that the filing of the motion was nothing more than a delay tactic and was \"purely manipulative in nature.\" Defendant's counsel had no objection to the motion being denied, and the trial court denied the motion. Defendant was represented by counsel at all subsequent proceedings, including voir dire, jury trial, a motion for new trial hearing, and sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   It is clear from the foregoing discussion that Defendant was well aware of the judicial process and that his decision to represent himself was part of a strategy. Thus, the record contains an adequate waiver of Defendant's right to counsel. We do note, however, the following error patent regarding the advisement of the time period for filing post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   The trial court advised Defendant that he has \"two years from the date of the signing of this judgment to-to perfect and/or explore post-conviction relief.\" Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.8 provides the defendant has two years\n   <em>\n    after the conviction and sentence become final\n   </em>\n   to seek post-conviction relief. Thus, the trial court incorrectly informed Defendant of the time period for filing post-conviction relief. Accordingly, the trial court is directed to inform the Defendant of the correct prescriptive period of article 930.8 by sending appropriate written notice to the Defendant within ten days of the rendition of this opinion and to file written proof that the Defendant received the notice in the record of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    State v.

During further questioning, Mr. Worthington said that other people assist him on Wednesday nights, and it would be possible for someone else to fill in. Although he said he has staff to handle things at the Trinity Center, he explained that when he is there, he is able to make sure nothing \"terrible\" is happening. Mr. Worthington was asked if during a two day trial he would be able to concentrate on what was being said from the witness stand and to reach a fair and impartial verdict, he replied, \"It'd be challenging.

Moreover, the ground stated by defense counsel for the challenge for cause, Mielke stated that she could not be impartial under any circumstances, was incorrect.

Intoxication is another condition, as defined under Code of Criminal Procedure Article 726, bearing on the issue of whether defendant had a mental state for of [sic] of the offense charged.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-357\">\n   It should be noticed that-that in that case, that the Supreme Court opined that without such notice the State had no way to prepare expert testimony to explain the blood alcohol levels and to put them into proper perspective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   The introduction of seemingly high blood alcohol levels by the defense experts, without an opportunity for rebuttal by the State, would needlessly confuse and possibly prejudice the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-359\">\n   With that, this Court finds proof sufficient that the relief as sought, which-the preparation or the assertion of that defense is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   The State clarified, and the trial court agreed, that La.Code Crim.P. art. 727 specifically stated that it did not limit the right of a defendant to testify on his own behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel noted an objection to the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   Defendant argues the State was not surprised by the intoxication defense and knew as early as January 18, 2014, that intoxication would be a defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-362\">\n   Timothy pled not guilty/not guilty by reason of insanity. The State was not surprised he was raising an issue related to mental capacity to commit the crime. The Trial Court on January 18, 2014, during hearings stated: \"You've tried to get people found through an investigator that may or may not have been with you on the day that you committed the crime to show that maybe you were intoxicated or you were maybe drugged up, or something along those lines\". This followed statements made during a hearing on May 13, 2011, that Timothy simply did not remember what happened and that he did not remember [sic] the inability to remember was the result of a drug-induced stupor. The prosecutor's reply was that he understood that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-363\">\n   During that same hearing, the prosecutor acknowledged there may be an issue of intoxication more so than sanity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   Thus, Defendant argues the record as a whole makes it clear the State knew intoxication was an issue. Additionally, Defendant contends the trial court had the discretion to allow the admission of the intoxication evidence, and its refusal to do so, prevented Defendant from presenting a defense without waiving his constitutional right to remain silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Contrary to Defendant's assertion that it had notice of the intoxication defense, the State asserts that it was never put on notice of such a defense because Defendant failed to follow the proper procedure. According to the State, the record references cited by Defendant as instances wherein the State should have been put on notice of the intoxication defense were vague and lacking the specificity needed for adequate notice. The State notes that Defendant offered no response to its discovery requests for any reports, mental exams, or scientific tests he proposed to use at trial and offered no response to its discovery requests for any evidence he expected to introduce concerning an alibi defense. The State disputes Defendant's assertion that his insanity defense should have put it on notice of the intoxication defense, noting that both doctors opined that Defendant's memory problems were self-serving and atypical. Finally, the State contends that it questioned several witnesses at trial about Defendant's condition on the date of the robbery, and each witness denied seeing any evidence of Defendant being intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 726 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-367\">\n   A.

The record contains no evidence defendant gave the required notice to the state under article 726. Without such notice, the state had no way to prepare expert testimony to explain the blood alcohol levels and put them into proper prospective. The introduction of seemingly high blood alcohol levels by the defense experts without an opportunity for rebuttal by the state would needlessly confuse and prejudice the jury.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We find defendant's rights in this regard were not impaired. A review of the record shows there was ample evidence supporting defendant's claim he had been drinking. Deputy Lincoln Spell, the first deputy to encounter defendant, testified he smelled of alcohol and slurred his words. Tracy Morgan testified defendant consumed two \"Fuzzy Navels\" (a drink consisting of peach schnapps and orange juice), four beers and four Jaegermeisters between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. Defendant testified he had been drinking since about 4:00 p.m. on the afternoon preceding the shooting. The defense extensively cross-examined the state's expert on his failure to take defendant's intoxication into account in his reconstruction of the crime. Finally, we note the defense counsel actually mentioned the blood alcohol levels of defendant and the victim during his cross examination of the state's serology expert. This line of questioning was not excluded by the trial court and was available for consideration by the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-373\">\n   Taking into account all the circumstances, we find the trial court properly excluded the blood alcohol tests. This specification lacks merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   By pointing to certain statements in the record, appellate counsel asserts the State was put on notice that Defendant intended to assert intoxication as a defense at trial. There is no indication, however, that written notice was given as required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 726.

Armed robbery and armed robbery with a firearm are both classified as crimes of violence under La.R.S. 14:2. At sentencing, the trial court specifically noted \"the lives that [Defendant] changed\" due to Defendant's actions. Defendant's conduct during the commission of these crimes manifested deliberate cruelty to the victims. The trial judge noted that Defendant's actions \"were life changing, and [the witnesses] readily admitted that their lives will never be the same as a result of the actions of [Defendant].\" Defendant knowingly created a risk of death or of great bodily harm to multiple persons, and he used a firearm while committing the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   Next, we examine Defendant's nature and background. The State presented testimony at the sentencing hearing that Defendant had \"a lengthy criminal history,\" and that Defendant \"threaten[ed] to kill these victims while putting [a] gun in their faces.\" At sentencing, Defendant denied that the prior felony convictions in Texas were his; however, the State asserted that they possessed certified copies of the convictions which contained Defendant's signature. Given Defendant's prior felony convictions, the likelihood of Defendant re-offending is high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   Finally, we look at the sentences imposed for similar crimes. Defendant received a seventy-five year sentence, where the maximum penalty for armed robbery is imprisonment at hard labor for not more\n   than ninety-nine years, and therefore represents roughly seventy-five percent of the maximum sentence he could have received. Additionally, Defendant received an additional five years, to be served consecutively to the seventy-five years, for committing armed robbery with a firearm. Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:64.3(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-394\">\n   [w]hen the dangerous weapon used in the commission of the crime of armed robbery is a firearm, the offender shall be imprisoned at hard labor for an additional period of five years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The additional penalty imposed pursuant to this Subsection shall be served consecutively to the sentence imposed under the provisions of R.S. 14:64.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   As noted by the State in its brief to this court, Louisiana courts have frequently affirmed sentences of seventy-five years or more for armed robbery convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court heard the testimony of one witness, Benjamin Cormier, an attorney on the Public Defender's conflict list. The trial court granted the State's objections to the testimony of numerous other attorneys subpoenaed by Defendant to testify; namely, James Dixon, Adam Johnson, Andrew Casanave, Mitch Bergeron, Harry Fontenot, Michael Ned, King Alexander, Eugene Bouquet, Michael McHale, and Robert Shelton, several of which were Defendant's present or former co-counsels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   The trial court issued the following ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-403\">\n   Let the record reflect the Court must consider the factors pursuant to State versus Peart, 621 Southern Second [780] 870.

Although Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   applies to his situation, Defendant cites no cases that apply\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   to a hybrid-representation situation. Defendant simply cites cases in support of his right to hybrid representation. Thus, Defendant fails to offer additional evidence and fails to prove this court's pre-trial ruling was patently erroneous or produced an unjust result. Accordingly, we will abide by our pre-trial decision and not reconsider whether the trial court erred in its October 28, 2015 denial of Defendant's first\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Second Peart Motion\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   In his pro se brief, Defendant argues the trial court erred in summarily denying a second motion for a\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   hearing filed by Defendant on October 17, 2016, the day before trial. Defendant set the groundwork for this second\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion after this court ruled that Defendant's hybrid representation prevented him from receiving any relief under\n   <em>\n    Peart.\n   </em>\n   On June 17, 2016, Defendant filed a pro se \"Motion for Court to Rescind its Order of August 20, 2009 Granting Hybrid Representation.\" At a hearing on the June 17, 2016 motion, Defendant requested that Mr. Shelton represent him in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-422\">\n   So, I'm asking the Court to rescind its order for me to be co-counsel on the case and just let Robert Shelton straight up represent me, and-then-that way I can come back with a Peart and-from-refile the Peart motion, and we can-There's no need to have another hearing, because we already got a transcript of that hearing, if the State will stipulate it, and I'll take it back up on a writ with that-without having to be a co-counsel on the case, and so-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   The trial court initially denied Defendant's request to have Mr. Shelton represent him in full, but reconsidered and granted the request on October 17, 2016, the day before trial. Before the start of trial the following day, October 18, 2016, the State notified the trial court that Defendant had filed the second\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion. In the motion, Defendant again asserted that his public defender was burdened by an excessive caseload and/or inadequate resources. Defendant asserted that Mr. Shelton's caseload was almost more than double the state caseload standards:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-424\">\n   According to data in public records obtained from the CPDO, Mr. Shelton's contemporaneous cases being handled have, at almost all times, exceeded almost twice the numerical limit annually of the state caseload standards for the types of cases he handles. Additionally, Mr. Shelton carries an unknown number of cases for solvent clients. Moreover, his annual caseload count must be presumed to be significantly greater than the sum of his indigent and solvent clients' cases he contemporaneously handles, considering the fact that he disposes of and gains cases over the course of a year. In addition to the strain of an excessive caseload, Mr. Shelton's ability to diligently represent\n   clients is further exacerbated by inadequate support services to maintain his workload. He employs only a secretary; he does not employ a paralegal or an in-house investigator, relying instead on funds granted at the discretion of the District Defender or court upon application, on a case-by-case basis, to acquire expert services for clients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   As he did in the first\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion, Defendant revealed that the maximum number of cases recommended by the Department of Justice National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals Task Force on the Courts was 150 felonies, 400 misdemeanors, 200 juvenile cases, 200 mental health cases, and twenty-five appeals. In conclusion, Defendant asked for the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-426\">\n   WHEREFORE, premises considered, defendant prays this Honorable Court set this matter for a contradictory hearing and, after taking evidence, order such relief as necessary to reduce his public defender's caseload, to provide for adequate resources, and fashion other relief to assure an effective appointment of counsel for defendant, or otherwise order a stay of defendant's prosecution until he is provided with counsel likely to provide reasonably effective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   In response to Defendant's second\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion, the State asserted that the filing of the motion was nothing more than a delay tactic and was \"purely manipulative in nature.\" Defendant's counsel had no objection to the motion being denied, and the trial court denied the motion without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   In his pro se brief, Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in summarily denying his second\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion.

As stated previously, the trial court denied the second\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion without a hearing. Since a hearing was held for Defendant's first\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion, we reviewed the evidence introduced by Defendant at the first\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   hearing to fully evaluate the pre-trial record as it existed when the trial court denied Defendant's second\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion. At the hearing on the first\n   <em>\n    Peart\n   </em>\n   motion, the trial court allowed the testimony of one witness, Benjamin Cormier, an attorney on the Public Defender's conflict list.

Nor would Ware's caseload exceed the standards enunciated in the ethics opinion on which the defense relied.

Ware was assisted by two other attorneys in this matter. He was provided with transcripts of the first trial, attorney notes on evidence and strategy by Reeves' counsel in the first trial, and access to those attorneys should questions arise.

The public defender in\n   <em>\n    Peart,\n   </em>\n   Rick Teissier, presented evidence that, at the time of his appointment, he was personally handling 70 active felony cases. His clients were routinely incarcerated 30 to 70 days before he was able to meet with them. In a seven month period, Teissier represented 418 defendants. Of these, he entered 130 guilty pleas at arraignment. Teissier had at least one serious case, defined as an offense necessarily punishable by a jail term which may not be suspended (including first degree murder, second degree murder, aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, armed robbery and possession of heroin), set for trial for every trial date during that seven month period. Teissier's public defender's office only had enough funds to hire three investigators to assist in the investigation of 7000 cases annually in ten sections of court. Teissier presented evidence that in a routine case, he received no investigative support at all.
