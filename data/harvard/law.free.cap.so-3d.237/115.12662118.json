The Board of Supervisors of Tunica County, Mississippi (the Board), ordered an\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   tax levy for fiscal year 2014-15 and increased the millage rate from the previous year. After entering the order, the Board advertised a public hearing of the proposed\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   tax levy in the Tunica\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   . The hearing took place and various taxpayers appeared to voice objections and concerns. Aggrieved by the actions of the Board, one such taxpayer, HWCC-Tunica, LLC (HWCC), which owns and operates Hollywood Casino-Tunica, filed a bill of exceptions in the Circuit Court of Tunica County and paid the taxes under protest. The trial court, finding that the failure of the Board to comply with statutory notice and public hearing requirements rendered the tax levy unlawful, ordered a refund. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On August 14, 2014, the Board of Supervisors of Tunica County, Mississippi (the Board), determined that the county's Tax Assessor Norma Anderson had \"completed and filed the 2014 real and personal assessment rolls of Tunica County, Mississippi ....\" Before the Board at that time was a document entitled \"August Recaps 2014,\" which showed that the assessed value of property in Tunica County had decreased in the amount of $4,678,672, a 1.87% decrease from the 2013 assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On August 25, 2014, County Administrator of Tunica County Michael Thompson gave a presentation to the Tunica County Board of Supervisors regarding the county budget for the 2015 fiscal year. His presentation informed that the county's existing millage rates were \"[i]nadequate and unsustainable.\" He cited \"[d]ecreasing assessed property values,\" long-term debt figures, \"[i]nadequate or nonexistent fees for essential services,\" and a dependency on tax revenue from a declining gaming industry. An advertisement was published in the Tunica\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   on August 22, 2014, according to a proof of publication. This advertisement stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Tunica County Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing on its proposed budget and proposed tax levies for the fiscal year 2014-2015 on Thursday, August 28, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. at the Tunica County Courthouse located at 1300 School Street, in Tunica.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tunica County Board of Supervisors is now operating with projected total budget revenue of $45,368,673.

Of that amount, eight (8) percent or $3,100,000 is proposed to be financed through a total ad valorem tax levy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   For the next fiscal year, the Tunica County Board of Supervisors plans to increase your ad valorem tax millage rate by 5.00 mills, due to the decrease in assessed property values.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Any citizen of Tunica County is invited to attend this public hearing on the proposed\n   budget and tax levy, and will be allowed to speak for a reasonable amount of time and offer tangible evidence before any vote is taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The advertised meeting occurred on August 28, 2014, and a report was introduced from Barbara Tuchel of Tunicians for Transparency in Government, who made various suggestions for budget reductions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 4. The minutes also include a document, dated August 28, 2014, and entitled \"RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF TUNICA COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI AUTHORIZING AND APPROVING THE HOLDING OF A PUBLIC HEARING ... RELATING TO GIVING THE PUBLIC NOTICE OF A HEARING TO BE HELD ON THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND PROPOSED TAX LEVIES FOR TUNICA COUNTY ....\" This resolution purported to fix a public hearing on August 28, \"relating to the proposed budget and proposed tax levies for Tunica County, Mississippi, all relating to fiscal year 2014-2015 ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The resolution also said that \"notice shall be given as required by law that the Board of Supervisors will consider and adopt a resolution adopting the final budget and tax levy resolution contemplated thereby at the Board of Supervisors' meeting to be held on Tuesday, September 2, 2014 beginning at 5:00 p.m. ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board then recessed the August 28 meeting and indicated in its minutes that it would continue the meeting to September 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 5. The next meeting of the Board took place, according to the minutes, on September 2, 2014. The minutes of the September 2 meeting do not reflect that the Board took up or considered the matter of the millage rate increase. The Board then recessed the September 2 meeting and indicated in its minutes that it would continue the meeting to September 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6. The minutes show that the Board did meet on September 4, 2014. The only budget-related item of business considered by the Board at that time was a request from Michael Thompson, County Administrator, that a \"Work Session for the 2015 Budget Year\" be scheduled for September 11, 2014. The Board approved the request. The Board then recessed the September 4 meeting and indicated in its minutes that it would continue the meeting to September 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7. The Board next convened on September 15, 2014, according to the minutes. At its September 15 meeting, the Board approved the fiscal year 2015 budget for the county, which included an\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   tax levy. The \"General County\" millage rate increased from the 9.14 mills figure from the fiscal year 2013 levy to 15 mills, an increase of 5.86 mills. The \"County Road Construction and Maintenance\" millage rate was levied at 9 mills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District\" millage rate increased from 0.71 mills in the fiscal year 2013 levy to 0.75 mills, an increase of 0.04 mills. The \"G.O. Bonds Sinking Fund\" levy increased from 15.77 mills in the fiscal year 2013 levy to 17 mills, an increase of 1.23 mills. The Tunica County School District \"School\n   Shortfall Notes\" millage rate decreased from 1.32 mills in the fiscal year 2013 levy to .32 mills, a decrease of 1 mill. In total, according to the fiscal year 2015 levy order, the change in the millage rate from the fiscal year 2013 levy was 15.13 mills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8. Also at the September 15 meeting, the Board adopted a \"RESOLUTION MEMORIALIZING DISCUSSION RELATING TO THE BUDGET FOR TUNICA COUNTY AND ADOPTING A BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2014.\" This resolution claimed that \"notice of today's budget discussion and potential action relating to the budget and the tax levy had been advertised as required by law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the resolution, \"[a] copy of the Proof of Publication relating thereto was received and directed to be attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit 'A.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9. The page immediately preceding the resolution (Book 166, Page 251) in the Board minutes (Book 166, Page 250, 414) is entitled \"NOTICE OF A TAX INCREASE AND PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND PROPOSED TAX LEVIES FOR TUNICA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS,\" and states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Board of Supervisors of Tunica County, Mississippi will hold a public hearing on a proposed ad valorem tax revenue increase for fiscal year 2014-15 and on its proposed budget and proposed tax levies for fiscal year 2014-2015 on (September 30, 2014 at 5:00 p.m.) at the (Tunica County Courthouse located at 1300 School Street, Tunica County Mississippi).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Tunica County, Mississippi is now operating with projected total budget revenue of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     $45,368,673\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in which (4.5 percent) or\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     $2,043,000\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of such revenue is obtained through ad valorem taxes.

The next meeting of the Board occurred on September 30, 2014. In accordance with the above notice, a public hearing took place. Various citizens, including Joe Jackson, Bobby Papasan, Brook Taylor, Barbara Tuchel, Dollie Hudson, Kathlene Gann, and Supervisor Henry Nickson, Jr., appeared before the Board to express \"[b]udget [c]oncerns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 11. On October 10, 2014, Hollywood Casino-Tunica, or HWCC-Tunica, LLC (HWCC), filed a Bill of Exceptions/Notice of Appeal in the Circuit Court of Tunica County, Mississippi. HWCC argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that, because notice requirements of the Mississippi Code had not been complied with in levying\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   taxes for fiscal year 2014-15, the tax levy was \"illegal and void.\" The Board filed its answer on November 3, 2014. Both parties filed briefs in the Circuit Court of Tunica County. A hearing on the HWCC's Bill of Exceptions was held on June 5, 2015. At the hearing, the Board moved\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   to dismiss, arguing that the bill of exceptions had not been timely filed and had not been signed by the president of the Tunica County Board of Supervisors and that such procedural failings deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 12. The trial court entered an order on October 13, 2015. It held that, because the Board failed to comply with the advertising requirements contained in Mississippi Code \"Section 27-39-203(2)(a),\" which it found were mandatory, \"HWCC was overcharged for those ad valorem taxes it paid for the 2014-2015 fiscal year.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13. Aggrieved, the Board filed a notice of appeal on October 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the tax levy appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14. The Board argues that the Circuit Court of Tunica County lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because HWCC had failed to challenge the tax levy under Mississippi Code Section 11-51-77 (Rev. 2012) and to comply with the procedural requirements thereof, which the Board asserts constitute the exclusive method by which tax assessments may be challenged. The Board argues that HWCC's filing of a bill of exceptions pursuant to Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 (Rev. 2012) was erroneous. The Board continues that, even if filing a bill of exceptions was proper, HWCC's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 deprived the trial court of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15. Mississippi Code Section 11-51-77 provides a procedure for challenging a decision of boards of supervisors \"as to the assessment of taxes\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Any person aggrieved by a decision of the board of supervisors or the municipal authorities of a city, town or village, as to the assessment of taxes, may, within ten days after the adjournment of the\n   meeting at which such decision is made, appeal to the circuit court of the county, upon giving bond, with sufficient sureties, in double the amount of the matter in dispute, but never less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), payable to the state, and conditioned to perform the judgment of the circuit court, and to be approved by the clerk of such board, who, upon the filing of such bond, shall make a true copy of any papers on file relating to such controversy, and file such copy certified by him, with said bond, in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, on or before its next term. The controversy shall be tried anew in the circuit court at the first term, and be a preference case, and, if the matter be decided against the person who appealed, judgment shall be rendered on the appeal bond for damages at the rate of ten percent (10%) on the amount in controversy and all costs. If the matter be decided in favor of the person who appealed, judgment in his favor shall be certified to the board of supervisors, or the municipal authorities, as the case may be, which shall conform thereto, and shall pay the costs. The county attorney, the district attorney, or the Attorney General, if the state, county or municipality be aggrieved by a decision of the board of supervisors or the municipal authorities of a city, town, or village as to the assessment of taxes, may, within twenty days after the adjournment of the meeting at which such decision is made, or within twenty days after the adjournment of the meeting at which the assessment rolls are corrected in accordance with the instructions of the state tax commission, or within twenty days after the adjournment of the meeting of the board of supervisors at which the approval of the roll by the state tax commission is entered, appeal to the circuit court of the county in like manner as in the case of any person aggrieved as hereinbefore provided, except no bond shall be required, and such appeal may be otherwise governed by the provisions of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-51-77\">\n    Miss.

The trial court stated that, were it to determine that HWCC had filed a bill of exceptions, it \"would most likely have to find it lacked jurisdiction to entertain this matter.\" The trial court held, however, that it was not \"bound by the captions of the pleadings\" and found that Section 11-51-77 governed, \"[b]ecause the decision being appealed derives from a decision involving a\n   <em>\n    tax matter\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis in original.) The trial court denied the Board's\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   motion to dismiss, finding that the Board was estopped from complaining that the bill of exceptions was filed untimely and that it lacked the Board president's signature in light of the Board's failure to comply with the mandatory statutory advertising requirements. The trial court found that the bond requirement of Section 11-51-77 was unnecessary because \"the court understands that the tax heretofore imposed upon the plaintiff has been paid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 17.

Here, the bill of exceptions filed by HWCC challenged the Board's compliance with the mandatory statutory notice requirements set forth in then- Mississippi Code Section 27-39-203(2) (2012). According to the bill of exceptions, \"[f]ailure to comply renders the budget and tax levy illegal and void.\" The bill of exceptions takes issue with the procedures the Board employed in levying the tax. Therefore, the Board's proceedings are in issue and, under the language in\n   <em>\n    Lenoir\n   </em>\n   , require a bill of exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Lenoir\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468197\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/641/1124/\">\n    641 So.2d at 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tunica County Circuit Court was obliged to determine whether the Board had \"acted properly with reference to what was before it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468197\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/641/1124/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 25. Moreover, Section 11-51-77, by its plain language, applies to \"a decision of the board of supervisors ... as to the\n   <em>\n    assessment\n   </em>\n   of taxes ....\" (Emphasis added.) Mississippi Code Section 27-39-317 (Rev. 2010) rightly contemplates that a levy and\n   an assessment are different. According to Section 27-39-317 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The board of supervisors of each county shall ... levy the county ad valorem taxes for the fiscal year, and shall, by order, fix the tax rate, or levy, for the county, for the road districts, if any, and for the school districts, if any, and for any other taxing districts; and the rates, or levies, for the county and for any district shall be expressed in mills or a decimal fraction of a mill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-39-317\">\n    Miss.

Thus, according to Mississippi Code Section 27-39-317, the levy is a rate by which the tax assessor ascertains the amount of\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   taxes to be assessed, then collected by the tax collector. The formula applies to all nonexempt landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 26. Before this Court for decision are both the assessment of taxes to the county's taxpayers and the levy of taxes, applicable to all of the county's nonexempt landowners. The Board\n   <em>\n    levied\n   </em>\n   a tax, after which HWCC filed a Bill of Exceptions in which it argued that the levy was void. HWCC, after the tax had been\n   <em>\n    assessed\n   </em>\n   and had been paid under protest, supplemented the Bill of Exceptions with an additional request for relief: that the taxes which it had paid under protest be refunded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 27. Because the trial court ultimately made its decision after the taxes had been assessed and paid under protest, we find no error in the trial court's treatment of HWCC's bill of exceptions as a Section 11-51-77 appeal from a tax assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 28. We find that the trial court should not be held in error in its determination that payment of the tax under protest was sufficient to waive the bond requirement. This Court has held that payment of an assessment pursuant to Section 11-51-77, then Section 62 of the Mississippi Code of 1930, \"under protest does not prevent the appellant from prosecuting his appeal from an erroneous assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    Grenada Bank v.

The Attorney General's opinion and the cases upon which the Board relies are exclusively election contest cases and they are inapplicable here. The remedy of Mississippi Code Section 27-39-203(9) requires strict compliance with advertisement\n   and public hearing requirements. It is true that Section 27-39-203(9) prohibits expenditure of funds until strict compliance has been observed, but Section 27-39-203(2) sets forth specific requirements for advertisement of public hearings prior to the adoption of the final budget, and, in the event of a millage increase, an explanation is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 44.

A board of supervisors meeting did take place on August 28, 2014, but no hearing on the proposed tax levies occurred. On September 15, 2014, no hearing having taken place, the Board ordered the tax levies and increased the millage rates. On September 19, 2014, a public hearing on \"proposed ad valorem tax revenue increase for fiscal year 2014-15\" was advertised in the Tunica\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   and was to take place on September 30, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such hearing did occur on September 30, 2014, and taxpayers attended to voice concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 45.

Only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Board had increased the millage rate, was Section 27-39-203(2) -in part-complied with, because a hearing was advertised to take place on September 30, 2014.

The record reflects that the Board already has conducted such hearing on September 30, 2014, which was followed by the present bill of exceptions. Any attempt at this late time to remediate the Board's omissions and salvage its failed tax levy would be highly impractical and would require the judicial crafting of procedures not contemplated by established law. This Court declines to engage in such an enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 47. The trial court noted the Board's differentiation of general tax levies and tax levies for road and construction: \"[t]he county's argument is that because the road and bridge construction tax levies in Tunica County had been eliminated for over ten (10) years prior, the levying of such taxes in the 2014-2015 budget should be viewed as 'new' taxes, rather than an increase in taxes.\" The County changed the millage rate for \"County Road Construction and Maintenance\" from 0 mills to 9 mills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 48.

In 1999, the statute changed as follows: \"All taxing entities ... shall hold a public hearing at which the budget for the following fiscal year will be considered, regardless of whether that budget will be increased or decreased from the current budget ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-39-203\">\n    Miss.

Furthermore, Section 21-33-45 (Rev. 2015) applies to \"[t]he governing authorities of each municipality.\" If \"the rates or levies for the municipality ... are an increase from the previous fiscal year,\" then Section 27-39-203 applies.

More fundamentally, no evidence is found in the record to the effect that the increase of 0 mills to 9 mills for \"County Road Construction and Maintenance\" was a new levy or one that the Board revived for fiscal year 2014-15.

I write separately to address the issue raised in our earlier order for additional briefing,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the requirement found in Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 that the president of the board from which an appeal is sought must sign a bill of exceptions is a jurisdictional prerequisite that must be met before the circuit court can hear such an appeal. Because the statute in question neither mandates nor forbids that the courts do anything whatsoever, I fail to see how they can infringe on the court's procedural prerogative in violation of the Mississippi Constitution's separation of powers mandate. Indeed, the signature as a jurisdictional requirement is not a function of the statutory language at all; it results from the Courts' own confusing precedent. Accordingly, I would hold that the signature requirement of Section 11-51-75 is not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 55. Furthermore, I would take the present opportunity to clarify our precedent as to bills of exceptions as more fully set forth below, which should simplify the process for citizens and their attorneys by returning to the procedure as it was historically. The bill of exceptions is a vehicle for appeals that existed at the time Mississippi became a state. It was the means for appealing lower court decisions for well over half of Mississippi's two-hundred year history. However, if in its bill-of-exceptions jurisprudence of the last fifty years, the Mississippi Supreme Court has not made a mess of the bill of exceptions, what we have done will do until the mess gets here. It is time to revisit some of the decisions that have obscured what was once an oft-used and well-understood vehicle for appeals and give clarity to those whose practice of law and work on the bench requires them to work with the bill of exceptions. I propose doing so by the straightforward expedient of returning to the process as it was for much of our history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Three primary legal principles govern the instant case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 56. As will be discussed below, our pronouncements on the use of the bill of exceptions over the last few decades have been confusing and, to be frank, outright inconsistent. Accordingly, in order to seek jurisprudential clarity, three primary legal principles must be remembered and emphasized throughout any analysis of the signature requirement. First, the Constitution of 1890 gives the Legislature authority to set the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Second, the question before the Court in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   is one of interpreting legislative intent. Third, before declaring a statute unconstitutional, we must be satisfied that it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   A. The Constitution of 1890 gives the Legislature power to assign appellate jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 57. Article 6, Section 156 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 establishes jurisdiction in the circuit courts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   The circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal in this state not vested by this Constitution in some other court, and\n   <em>\n    such appellate jurisdiction as shall be prescribed by law.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The last nine words of Section 156 authorize the Legislature to grant and define appellate jurisdiction to the circuit courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The question before the Court in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   is one of legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 58. Because the Legislature establishes circuit court appellate jurisdiction, and does so in Section 11-51-75 by authorizing appeal from a county or municipal board decision via a bill of exceptions, the question of whether the signature requirement is jurisdictional is one of statutory interpretation. Of course, our goal when interpreting statutes is to divine the \"true meaning of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Scaggs v. GPCH-GP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8423271\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/931/1274/#p1276\">\n    931 So.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stockstill v.

The first two of the three primary principles that should guide the Court's holdings today lend themselves to a simple conclusion. Before we can declare the signature requirement found in Section 11-51-75 to be unconstitutional as a jurisdictional prerequisite, we must first determine whether the Legislature intended it to be a jurisdictional prerequisite at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   C. Before declaring the signature requirement unconstitutional, we must be satisfied that it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 60.

As more fully discussed below, a bill of exceptions is, in and of itself, a jurisdictional requirement should an aggrieved party wish to appeal a decision of a county or municipal board. However, the long history of our opinions in bill of exceptions cases convinces me that a perfect bill of exceptions is not a jurisdictional requirement and, more narrowly and pertinent to today's case, the signature of the president of the board is not a jurisdictional requirement. Given that we must resolve doubts in favor of constitutionality, I would hold that Section 11-51-75 does not establish the signature requirement as a jurisdictional prerequisite; accordingly, as it does not exist in the statute, it cannot be an unconstitutional infringement upon the procedural prerogative of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Legislature expanded the bill of exceptions to provide for appeals from the decisions of boards governing county and city governments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 66. When the Mississippi Legislature adopted the bill of exceptions as a vehicle for appealing the decisions of county and municipal boards, the procedure for its use was clear because it long had been used to appeal lower court decisions, as discussed above. Of course, using the bill of exceptions to appeal a decision of a governing body changed the dynamic in that, rather than being an appeal between two adversaries as to which a neutral judge would verify the record, the governing board was opposed to the party seeking the appeal. Despite standing in opposition to the appealing party, the president of the board must still sign the bill of exceptions, thereby verifying the accuracy of the record. The resulting tension leads us to where we are today, with presidents of boards of supervisors and mayors of towns refusing, often on the advice of counsel, to sign the bill of exceptions. Nevertheless, the bill of exceptions was a workable, and really quite simple, mechanism for appeal-even in the county or municipal board context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The first expansion of the bill of exceptions beyond courtroom appeals occurred when the Mississippi Legislature passed a statute that provided that \"it shall and may be lawful for all persons who feel themselves aggrieved by the judgment of the board of police of the county, to appeal by bills of exception or\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to the Circuit Court of his county.\"\n   <em>\n    Yalobusha Cty. v.

In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , in\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   , the Court reversed the circuit court's decision and held that enough information existed elsewhere within the bill of exceptions to determine the content of the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9744435\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/739/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9744435\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/739/\">\n    at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once again, the Court utilized the term \"jurisdiction\" in its reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   We feel that the actual decision of the City Council was correctly and truthfully stated and embodied in the bill of exceptions. The highest officer of the City of Jackson approved the statement of the decision contained in the bill of exceptions. The bill of exceptions was sufficient to confer\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   on the\n   circuit court to hear and consider the appeal as an appellate court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9744435\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/739/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 79. There is a dissonant ring to the Court's use of the word jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   . Appellate jurisdiction in the circuit court is, by operation of the Mississippi Constitution, a matter of legislative prerogative. Miss. Const. art. 6, \u00a7 156. While Section 11-51-75 by its plain language requires that an appeal from a county or municipal board be accomplished via a bill of exceptions and that the appeal be made within ten days, it contains very little else that sets forth jurisdictional requirements. Notably absent from the statute-unlike the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   upon which the\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   Court in part relied-are specific content requirements. Jurisdiction is defined as a \"court's power to decide a case or issue a decree.\"\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). When the\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   Courts write in terms of jurisdiction, they misuse the term. It is clear that failing to embody a sufficient record in the bill of exceptions can be fatal to the attempted appeal-as shown above, such has been the case since the first days of our State. Yet, in other cases, we have allowed appeals made via the bill of exceptions to proceed despite flaws.\n   <em>\n    Yellow Cab Company of Biloxi v. City of Biloxi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9639659,9639749,9639558\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/372/1274/\">\n    372 So.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1979). However, we should today clarify\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   and make it clear that, fatal or not, an insufficient record does not rob the circuit court of jurisdiction as the term is properly understood. Such clarification would harmonize our bill of exceptions jurisprudence of the second half of the twentieth century and today with that of Mississippi's first one hundred and thirty-three years. Further, it would allow flexibility to the circuit courts to consider whether, imperfections aside, the record presented by the bill of exceptions does provide sufficient information for review, as happened in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   and the possibility of which was recognized in\n   <em>\n    Yellow Cab\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. No good reason exists to believe the Legislature intended the signature of the president of the county or municipal board to confer jurisdiction on the circuit court.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 80. Moreover, the same conclusion applies to the signature requirement. As discussed above in the first part of the instant opinion, nothing in the wording of the statute applies the signature requirement to the courts. By its plain language and as recognized in early caselaw, it sets a ministerial duty of the president of the underlying board. As demonstrated in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   , the court did not consider the absence of a signature to be a jurisdictional bar. Later, in\n   <em>\n    Gill v. Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9772545\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/912/\">\n    226 So.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1969), the Court once again held that the circuit court must consider a bill of exceptions unsigned by the president of the Marshall County Board of Supervisors. More strikingly than in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   , where the board agreed that the bill of exceptions was accurate, the\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   Court reversed the circuit court's dismissal of an unsigned bill of exceptions where the record failed to show that the board or its president objected to the form and content of the bill of exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 226 So.2d at 915.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 81. It is one thing to conclude that a matter presented to a court is fatally defective, such as when a complaint fails to state a viable claim for relief and is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure or, more aptly, when an appellate court refuses to consider an assignment of error because the appellant fails to present a sufficient record. It is quite another to conclude that a court has no power, or jurisdiction, to entertain a matter before it. In light of the foregoing authorities setting\n   forth the history of the uses of the bill of exceptions as a vehicle for appeals, first from trial courts and later, by legislative expansion, from county and municipal boards, I would hold that the failure to present a bill of exceptions signed by the president of the board falls into the former category rather than the latter. If the absence of the signature were an absolute procedural bar, then the\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   Court would not have allowed the matter before it to proceed in the absence of the signature and the\n   <em>\n    Tillery\n   </em>\n   Court would not have bothered pointing out the disagreement of the board with Tillery regarding the accuracy of the bill of exceptions at issue there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 82. Because I am convinced the Legislature never intended the signature requirement to be a jurisdictional prerequisite and, given the three operating principles set forth at the beginning of the instant opinion, I would hold that the signature requirement found in Section 11-51-75 is constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Court should take the present opportunity to realign bill of exceptions practice with the language of the statute and the correct, historical practice of appeals from county and municipal boards.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6 83. Finally, to restore fairness and sensibility to the bill of exceptions process, I would hold that, going forward, the ten-day deadline contained in the statute applies to the filing of the bill of exceptions with the clerk of the county or municipal board. In\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors of Marshall County v. Stephenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1841756\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/160/372/\">\n    160 Miss. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1841756\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/160/372/\">\n    134 So. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1930), the Court held that the aggrieved party had perfected an appeal from a decision of the board of supervisors on the day the bill of exceptions was filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-144. The Court continued, writing that once filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors, the bill of exceptions \"should have been filed at once [in circuit court] by the clerk of the board of supervisors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id. See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shannon Chair Co. v. City of Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9646585\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/295/753/#p755\">\n    295 So.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755 (Miss. 1974) (holding that a bill of exceptions not presented to the mayor within ten days of adjournment of the pertinent meeting was untimely and must be dismissed);\n   <em>\n    Faison v. City of Indianola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/156/872/\">\n    156 Miss. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"348\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/156/872/\">\n    127 So. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (1930) (bill of exceptions considered timely when presented to the board). Accordingly, as long as the bill is filed for consideration with the board within ten days, I would recommend the courts consider it to be timely. As was the practice when bills of exception were more commonly used, nothing would be filed with the circuit court until the clerk of the board fulfilled the duty of submitting the signed bill of exceptions to the circuit court. Although in our later cases, such as\n   <em>\n    Lowndes County v. McClanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6883099\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/161/1052/#p1055\">\n    161 So.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2015), we wrote in passing that a bill of exceptions is filed in the circuit court, I have been unable to find a case in which we considered the issue and overruled the established practice of filing the bill with the clerk of the board first, with the clerk to follow the statutory directive of being the person responsible for filing the bill with the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 84. If the aggrieved party and the board dispute the accuracy of the record and for that reason or any other the president of the board refuses to sign the bill of exceptions as required by the statute, then the aggrieved party can, as was the practice, file a petition for mandamus with the circuit court. The circuit court is best equipped to decide and create a record of such disputes. The circuit court likewise is equipped to consider whether other imperfections in the bill of exceptions render the record before it insufficient to consider the matters excepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   However, if we are to return to the historical practice surrounding the bill of exceptions outlined above, some work must be done. In\n   <em>\n    Bowen v. DeSoto County Board of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n    852 So.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2003), the person aggrieved by the DeSoto County Board of Supervisors' decision did not, in fact, file a proposed bill of exceptions with the board within ten days, as was the historical practice. Rather, the aggrieved party, John Bowen, filed a notice of appeal with the circuit court within the first ten days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 1). The circuit court dismissed the notice of appeal because Bowen never filed a bill of exceptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bo wen\n   </em>\n   Cour t hel d that the bill of exceptions merely functioned as a vehicle for establishing the record on appeal and was not a requirement for the circuit court to hear Bowen's appeal from the board of supervisors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). The Court wrote, \"In the case sub judice, Bowen properly and timely filed a notice of appeal. We find that sufficient to vest jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Bo wen\n   </em>\n   Cour t's j udgment cannot coexist with Section 156 of the Constitution, which mandates that circuit court appellate jurisdiction must be \"prescribed by law,\" considering that the law which prescribes circuit court jurisdiction in appeals from county and municipal boards mandates-and for decades has been held to mandate-the use of bills of exceptions to do so. Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   Cour t rea ched its holding without overruling or discussing the myriad earlier cases that recognized the mandatory nature of the bill of exceptions-including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Varia\n   </em>\n   . Ind eed ( and confusingly), after the Court handed down\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , the bill of exceptions was affirmed as a jurisdictional requirement in the later case of\n   <em>\n    McIntosh v. Amacker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959433\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/592/525/#p528\">\n    592 So.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (Miss. 1991).\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   resu lted in the convoluted practice-foreign to the long, pre-\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   hist ory o f the bill of exceptions-of aggrieved parties filing both a bill of exceptions with the clerk of the board and a notice of appeal in the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball v. Mayor and Bd. of Aldermen of City of Natchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8216152\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/983/295/#p302\">\n    983 So.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302 (\u00b6 23) (Miss. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Grist v.

Today we should take advantage of the opportunity to overrule\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , whi ch wo uld allow clarification and simplification of the bill of exceptions process by returning to that which the statute actually provides, which is the filing of a bill of exceptions with the clerk of the appropriate county or municipal board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 86. Resolving doubts in favor of the constitutionality of Section 11-51-75 leads to the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend the signature requirement to be a constitutional prerequisite. Therefore, it cannot be unconstitutional as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 87. Further, I would clarify that, although the bill of exceptions itself is a jurisdictional requirement for the circuit court to hear an appeal via Section 11-51-75, imperfections in it go to the adequacy of the record rather than the authority of the court to hear the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6 88. Finally, I would overrule the\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   Court's holding that the bill of exceptions is nothing more than an optional vehicle for transmitting the record to the circuit court and that some other filing, such as a notice of appeal, can suffice to confer jurisdiction there. In doing so, I would take the opportunity to clarify bill of exceptions practice as outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 89. In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the Hollywood Casino did not follow the statutory mechanism. Rather than filing its bill of exceptions with the Tunica County Board of Supervisors, it filed the bill of exceptions and a notice of appeal directly in the circuit court. Going forward and in light of the language of Section 11-51-75 and the\n   clarifications I propose above, Hollywood's bill of exceptions well may be untimely for failure to submit it timely to the Tunica County Board of Supervisors. However, given the confusion engendered by\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , I would be loathe to hold so in today's case. In fact, as Tunica does not appear to attack the completeness of the record contained in the bill of exceptions, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Gill v. Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9772545\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/912/\">\n    226 So.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1969), I would hold that the trial court committed no error in preceding. In short, I, too, would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   WALLER, C.J., RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., AND MAXWELL, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.
