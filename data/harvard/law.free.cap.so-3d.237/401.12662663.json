Appellant responded with an answer and eleven affirmative defenses, two of which were later stricken. The bank moved for summary judgment, addressing appellant's remaining affirmative defenses only by generally claiming they lacked factual and legal support and were not pled with specificity. The trial court granted the bank's motion. The bank has confessed error, stipulating that final summary judgment should be reversed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seale v.
