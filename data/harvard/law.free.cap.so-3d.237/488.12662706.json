In\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , the majority held that \"the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply\" when law enforcement is \"not relying on the type of longstanding, thirty-year appellate precedent\" such as that at issue in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928256,12450488\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/229/\">\n    564 U.S. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450488,5928256\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2419/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450488,5928256\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2419/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/228/535/\">\n    228 So.3d at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon consideration of\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , the good-faith exception as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable in the instant case. Therefore, Burton's motion to suppress evidence taken from the warrantless search of his cell phone incident to his arrest should have been granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/228/535/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PALMER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BERGER, J., concurs specially, with opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BERGER, J., concurring specially\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While I continue to believe the police acted in good faith when they searched Burton's cell phone without a warrant, I am constrained to concur based on the\n   Florida Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.
