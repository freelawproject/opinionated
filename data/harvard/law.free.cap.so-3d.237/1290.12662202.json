Henry Hinton is an inmate in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), confined at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP). Hinton was found guilty of two rule violations for verbally engaging in bribery with a correction officer and pursuing a relationship with that correction officer. As punishment, Hinton lost privileges for one month. Hinton appealed the decision with MDOC's administrative-remedy program (ARP). Warden Brian Ladner affirmed Hinton's rule violations. Hinton then appealed to the Rankin County Circuit Court, which affirmed MDOC's decision. Hinton now appeals, and finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In 2015, Hinton was convicted in Pike County of three counts of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute and one count of attempting to obtain a controlled substance. He was sentenced to serve three five-year terms and one three-year term, with the sentences running concurrently, in the custody of the MDOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. While an inmate at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, Hinton was issued two separate rule-violation reports (RVR) on February 27, 2016. In RVR No. 01553562, he was accused of verbally bribing a correction officer to obtain a slice of pizza from her. The officer stated that Hinton put a note in a box asking her to put any leftover pizza she had in the trash, and he \"would be happy to dispose of it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He asked her to flash his cell lights, and he would come get the pizza. At his hearing, Hinton admitted that he put the note in the box, but he claimed he did not ask for or give her anything. In RVR No. 01553563, Hinton was accused of pursuing a relationship with the same correction officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At a disciplinary hearing, Hinton was found guilty of both rule violations and lost all privileges for one month. Hinton claimed that as an added punishment he was placed in a much more restrictive area the following day-a claim MDOC denies. In March 2016, Hinton filed grievances for both RVRs with MDOC's ARP, claiming the statements in the note were taken out of context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In April 2016, Hinton received and acknowledged MDOC's decision. Hinton appealed MDOC's ARP decision to the Rankin County Circuit Court. MDOC responded to Hinton's appeal, stating there was substantial evidence to support the RVRs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In June 2016, Hinton amended his complaint, claiming his due-process right to notice was violated because he could not read his copies of the RVRs before his hearing. The MDOC filed an answer to his amended complaint denying Hinton's assertions. The MDOC denied that Hinton was transferred to a more restrictive holding area due to the RVRs, that he was punished in retaliation for \"getting in [the captain's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] business,\" that he was given illegible copies of the RVRs, or that his note was taken out of context. In October 2016, the circuit court affirmed MDOC's decision. Hinton timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. This Court will not disturb the decision of an administrative agency, such as the MDOC, unless the decision was \"unsupported by substantial evidence, arbitrary or capricious, beyond the agency's scope or powers, or violative of the constitutional or statutory rights of the aggrieved party.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

MDOC's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8. Hinton argues there was not substantial evidence to support MDOC's decision that he violated MDOC rules against bribery and pursuing a relationship. We review MDOC's decision under the substantial-evidence standard.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Wesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891771\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/157/860/#p861\">\n    157 So.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861 (\u00b6 8) (Miss.

Miss. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7422273\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/682/367/#p370\">\n    682 So.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370 (Miss. 1996) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9. We find that Hinton failed to prove MDOC's decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Hinton claims his note was taken out of context, and he did not bribe anyone for anything, but merely offered to dispose of the pizza in the trash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   He also denies attempting to pursue a relationship with the female officer, arguing that the note was written to apply to anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10. We are not persuaded by these arguments. Hinton admitted to writing the note to the female officer in the tower, which is inappropriate communication. A copy of the note was admitted into evidence, in which Hinton was offering something of value-to take out the officer's trash for her to obtain the pizza. He admitted in the hearing that his motive was to sneak back and retrieve the pizza from the trash. These actions also establish an inappropriate relationship with an officer that compromises the security of MDOC's facility. Accordingly, MDOC's decision was supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Constitutional Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11. Hinton raises several constitutional issues, such as due process and free speech. First, Hinton argues his due-process right to notice was violated because his copies of the RVRs were illegible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, he states he did not know the charges against him at the hearing. Additionally, Hinton argues his due-process right to be heard was violated because he was not allowed to make statements in his own defense during the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12. Although Hinton argues his due-process rights were violated in numerous ways, as he also notes, not all administrative disciplinary actions are subject to due-process analysis. It is well established that punishment of temporary loss of privileges is not generally considered a constitutionally protected liberty interest.\n   <em>\n    Mixon v. Enlers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021483\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/90/635/#p637\">\n    90 So.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 637 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012) (citing\n   <em>\n    Madison v. Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637487\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/765/#p768\">\n    104 F.3d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 768 (5th Cir. 1997) ). Accordingly, Hinton has no liberty interest that could give rise to a legitimate due-process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13. To circumvent this bar, Hinton contends that his prison transfer immediately after his disciplinary hearing was part of his punishment for his RVRs, which violated his due-process rights. MDOC denies this allegation, and Hinton provides no proof in support. Additionally, Hinton's due-process arguments are without merit. Even though the copies of Hinton's two RVRs in the record are of poor quality, Hinton complained of it over a month after the disciplinary hearing and receipt of MDOC's decision against him-not when the RVRs were first issued. Further, Hinton did not request any evidence be introduced at the hearing to refute the RVRs or request any witnesses. Therefore, we cannot say that Hinton was denied due process, as he was provided and attended a fair and impartial disciplinary hearing where he was made aware of the nature of the charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14. Finally, Hinton claims prison officials retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment right to free speech in prison by writing the note. He argues the note did not violate any specific MDOC rules or policies and was not directed at anyone in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15. Again, we are not persuaded by this argument. There was substantial evidence to support MDOC's decision upholding\n   Hinton's RVRs, which cite specific MDOC rule violations. Additionally, Hinton admitted to writing the note, even if he refuted any violative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's judgment affirming MDOC's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING AND GRIFFIS, P.JJ., CARLTON, FAIR, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The note's complete text stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    Secrets to increase your karma! *Help the needie.* MDOC policy allows you to bring food into the facility.
