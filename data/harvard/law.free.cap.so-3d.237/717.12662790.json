In 2011, Robert Patrick Terrell-through his middleman Archie Nicholson-recruited Ricardo L. Hawthorne to record forged property deeds purporting to convey John McLendon's property to Hawthorne. Terrell and his coconspirators then used the forged deeds to fraudulently induce a timber company to buy the timber rights for $20,300 and, unbeknownst to McLendon, harvest his timber. A jury found Terrell guilty of timber theft, conspiracy\n   to commit timber theft, false pretenses, and conspiracy to commit false pretenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Because the evidence was sufficient to convict Terrell of both timber theft and false pretenses, we affirm those convictions and sentences. However, we agree with Terrell that the evidence supported only one conspiracy between Terrell, Nicholson, and Hawthorne, not two. We therefore vacate his two conspiracy sentences and remand the two conspiracy convictions to the trial court with instructions to dismiss-at the State's election-one of the conspiracy counts and resentence Terrell on the remaining conspiracy count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. In March 2013, a grand jury returned a twenty-count indictment against Terrell, Nicholson, and Hawthorne. The charges stemmed from their scheme to \"sell\" the timber on McClendon's property to Brushy Creek Timber Company. The State charged that Terrell, who worked in the timber industry and was familiar with property deeds, with Nicholson as the go-between, recruited Hawthorne to record forged warranty deeds purporting to convey McLendon's family property to Hawthorne. Hawthorne then sold these fraudulently obtained timber rights to the property to Brushy Creek for $20,300. Brushy Creek, which had no idea the timber deed was forged, then harvested and sold McLendon's timber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4. Only Terrell was tried. At the beginning of trial, the State dismissed sixteen counts and proceeded to trial on the remaining four counts-(1) timber theft, (2) conspiracy to commit timber theft, (3) false pretenses, and (4) conspiracy to commit false pretenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The State's Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1. Investigators\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5. The State's first witness was State Trooper Demetrius Hawthorne (no relation to Ricardo Hawthorne). In 2011, Hawthorne was a deputy sheriff in Jefferson Davis County. On May 28, 2011, McLendon reported to the sheriff's office that someone had been harvesting timber on his family's property. After visiting McLendon's property himself and seeing the large equipment and cut timber, Deputy Hawthorne contacted the Department of Agriculture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6. Chris Newman, an investigator with the Department of Agriculture, also testified. Newman's investigation revealed two recorded deeds-one from John McLendon and one from Clarence McLendon-both conveying property to Ricardo Hawthorne. Newman also found a third warranty timber deed conveying Hawthorne's timber rights to Brushy Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7. Newman showed the deeds to John McLendon, who maintained he never signed them. With the recorded deeds were two affidavits of heirship. One affidavit was from someone named John Smith, who claimed to have known A.C. McLendon. According to Smith, A.C. had died and left as his sole heirs John McLendon and Clarence McLendon. The other affidavit was from someone named Ray Rodgers. Rodgers's affidavit claimed he had known Ellawese McLendon and that she had died, leaving as her sole heirs John McLendon and Clarence McLendon. But Newman's investigation revealed this claim was false. In truth, Ellawese was still alive. In fact, Newman had talked to her the morning of trial. Newman also discovered that Clarence McLendon did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8. Newman ultimately approached Ricardo Hawthorne about the bogus documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   And Hawthorne confessed to forging them. Hawthorne explained that Terrell and Nicholson were also part of the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    2. Victims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9. McLendon's testimony corroborated Newman's. He clarified that Ellawese was his wife of fifty years, not his mother, and that she was still alive and quite spry for her age. And he had never heard of Ray Rodgers, John Smith, or his purported brother, Clarence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   John McLendon never signed the warranty deed claiming to transfer his property to Hawthorne, which did not even list his correct phone number. In fact, the first time he ever met Hawthorne was in the sheriff's office, after the investigation started.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10. But McLendon did know Terrell. Terrell had approached McLendon in 2007 about buying some timber. McLendon said he had agreed to help Terrell out by selling below \"cruise\" price. After Terrell drafted a contract, a man who McLendon assumed was Terrell's business partner, Isaac Haynes, wrote McLendon a check for $20,000. The check bounced. And the deal fell through. After that, McLendon refused to have any further dealings with Terrell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11. The State also called representatives of Brushy Creek. In April 2011, forester Robert Newsome worked for Brushy Creek. Part of his job was to locate property owners willing to sell timber. If he found an interested owner, Newsome would \"cruise\" the owner's property to evaluate the timber for purchasing. Newsome testified he had talked to Terrell several times about the Hawthorne deal. \"[Terrell] would call me to know what the hold up was on the money issue and stuff like that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12. Randy Davis owned Brushy Creek. He testified someone had called Brushy Creek's office about some prospective timber property. Davis had Newsome follow up with the lead. Newsome met someone at the land located between Joe Griffith Road and Hammond Road-where McLendon's property is located. Newsome told Davis the timber looked good. So Davis went out there and met with Hawthorne and another unidentified man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13. Hawthorne told Davis he had inherited the land \"from his grandfather or something.\" Davis \"cruised\" the timber and offered $20,300. Hawthorne accepted. Hawthorne then hired an attorney to issue a title opinion. Based on this opinion, which relied on the forged deeds, Brushy Creek wrote Hawthorne a $20,300 check. Then, based on its contract with Hawthorne, Brushy Creek harvested the timber. Davis testified Brushy Creek sold the timber for a profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    3. Coconspirators\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14. Terrell's coconspirators were also called. Nicholson testified that he had worked for Terrell since 2005, taking down trees after Hurricane Katrina. At first, Nicholson said Hawthorne had approached him about needing some work, so Nicholson introduced Hawthorne to Terrell. But then the State confronted him with his prior statement he had given to Newman. At that point, Nicholson admitted that it was Terrell who had asked him if he knew anyone who would be willing to sign some deeds. So Nicholson called Hawthorne, who agreed to forge and record the bogus deeds for Terrell. Nicholson also took Hawthorne to McLendon's land to meet\n   the men from Brushy Creek. Nicholson testified he was supposed to receive $5,000 from the purchase-price money but never did. On cross-examination, Nicholson testified the State agreed to let him out of jail, where he remained on bond, and drop the charges if he testified against Terrell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15. Hawthorne testified he had been offered $2,000-$1,000 upfront and $1,000 after the deal closed-to record the false deeds. Hawthorne said he did not draft the deeds, nor had he ever met the person who notarized them. At first, he said only Nicholson put him up to it. However, the State impeached him with a prior statement he had given, in which he implicated Terrell as the person who had organized the scheme. Hawthorne insisted he had given the statement to try and \"put it off on Pat Terrell.\" Hawthorne also claimed that, after he received the $20,3000 check from Brushy Creek, he tried to give Terrell his cut of the money through a third person, but Terrell refused. When asked pointedly if someone had paid him not to testify against Terrell, Hawthorne admitted Terrell had paid him several hundred dollars not to testify against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    4. Civil Judgments Against Terrell\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16. As its final witness, the State called Clint Langley of the Jefferson Davis County Circuit Clerk's office. Langley sponsored the admission of several civil judgments against Terrell related to forged deeds and his wrongful taking of timber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17. The State tried to call Langley earlier in the trial. But Terrell objected, arguing Langley had not been disclosed as a potential witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   URCCC 9.04(I).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the State, Terrell could not claim any unfair surprise. The prosecutor explained he had just learned about the judgments the morning of trial. But Terrell's trial attorney had personally represented Terrell in these civil matters and was well aware of them. The State offered the judgments under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 404(b). The trial judge agreed they qualified as Rule 404(b) evidence but noted he would have to balance the judgments' admissibility with the potential prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.E. 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18. Terrell did not dispute the judgments' admissibility under Rule 404(b). Rather, his objection was based solely on Rule 9.04. His attorney insisted the judgments had to be disclosed during discovery to avoid trial by ambush. The trial judge reasoned, \"You're not surprised ... if you were his lawyer.\" Still, the judge acknowledged Terrell's counsel needed time to further review the documents, citing\n   <em>\n    Box v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7616921\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/437/19/\">\n    437 So.2d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1983). The judge ruled the State could not call Langley at that point in the trial but possibly could call Langley later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19. At the close of its case-in-chief, the State recalled Langley. And this time, the judge permitted Langley to testify. Terrell's lawyer requested a mistrial under Rule 9.04, claiming he had insufficient time to defend against the judgments. Alternatively, he requested-in the event his motion was denied and the judgments admitted-a limiting instruction to prevent undue prejudice under Rule 403. The court denied his request for a mistrial. The judge found there was no unfair surprise, as Terrell's counsel had represented Terrell on two of the civil matters. Also, the judge had given Terrell's lawyer time to review the civil judgments\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   interview Langley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   URCCC 9.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20. After the judge decided the evidence passed Rule 403 muster, the court admitted two judgments into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   One was a 2012 order granting summary judgment to several plaintiffs who had sued Terrell and his timber company for forging deeds with their signatures and causing them more than $10,000 in damages. The other was a 2009 judgment ordering Terrell to pay $40,000 for wrongfully cutting timber from one hundred acres of land in Jefferson County belonging to someone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21. At the end of trial, the judge gave a limiting instruction. He specifically instructed the jury it could consider the judgment as evidence of Terrell's knowledge and intent but not as \"proof of guilt of the charges for which he is presently on trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Defense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22. At the close of the State's case, Terrell moved for a directed verdict, which was denied. Terrell rested without calling any witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conviction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23. The jury found Terrell guilty on all four counts. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for timber theft and five years for conspiracy to commit timber theft. He was also sentenced to ten years for false pretenses and five years for conspiracy to commit false pretenses. The court ordered all sentences to run consecutively. In addition to imposing $25,000 in fines,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court also ordered Terrell to pay McLendon $97,921.64 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24. The trial judge denied his post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, alternatively, a new trial. Terrell now appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion for Directed Verdict and JNOV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 25. On appeal, Terrell argues the trial court wrongly denied his motions for directed verdict and JNOV. Both motions challenged the sufficiency of the State's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 26. When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. And we ask whether \"any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Bush v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9028388\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/895/836/#p843\">\n    895 So.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843 (Miss. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Accomplice Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27. Terrell casts the testimony of his coconspirators Nicholson and Hawthorne, not in a light most favorable to the State, but in an\n   <em>\n    unfavorable\n   </em>\n   light. He suggests their testimony was \"uncorroborated, unreasonable, self-contradictory and substantially impeached.\" Thus, he argues, it was insufficient as a matter of law to convict him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28. Usually, uncorroborated testimony may sustain a conviction. But we have held this general notion inapplicable when \"testimony is unreasonable, self contradictory or substantially impeached.\"\n   <em>\n    Osborne v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038420\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/54/841/#p846\">\n    54 So.3d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846 (Miss. 2011) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ballenger v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7456511\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/667/1242/#p1253\">\n    667 So.2d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (Miss. 1995) ). Terrell's problem is that he fails to show Nicholson's and Hawthorne's testimonies were uncorroborated-let alone so unreasonable, self-contradictory, or substantially impeached that they were insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 29. Hawthorne's testimony corroborated Nicholson's and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 847 (requiring \"[o]nly slight corroboration of an accomplice's testimony\"). Yet\n   Terrell contends one accomplice's testimony cannot corroborate another's. As support, he cites\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045273\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/486/\">\n    32 So.3d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2010). But this is not what\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   says. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   explained \"that testifying accomplices cannot corroborate each other sufficiently\n   <em>\n    to obviate the necessity of a cautionary jury instruction.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045273\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/486/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045273\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/486/\">\n    at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And here, the trial court gave a cautionary instruction on accomplice testimony. So\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   does not apply. Further, both Nicholson's and Hawthorne's testimony was corroborated in part by Newsome, who testified he spoke several times with Terrell about the Hawthorne/Brushy Creek deal. He too connected Terrell to this venture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osborne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038420\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/54/841/#p846\">\n    54 So.3d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State also presented other circumstantial evidence-namely, McLendon's 2007 dealing with Terrell and the civil judgments-that supported both accomplices' implicating Terrell as the mastermind behind the scheme to use forged deeds to steal timber.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30. As to Terrell's claims that Nicholson's and Hawthorne's testimony was contradictory and substantially impeached, this goes to the weight and credibility-not the legal sufficiency-of Nicholson's and Hawthorne's testimony. And it is the jury's job to make weight and credibility determinations.\n   <em>\n    Osborne\n   </em>\n   , 54 So.2d at 846. \"[W]here the evidence justifies a verdict,\" we must accept this evidence \"as having been found worthy of belief.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillett v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034612\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/469/#p505\">\n    56 So.3d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (Miss. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Timber Theft\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 31. Next, Terrell specifically challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for timber theft. Under Mississippi Code Section 97-17-59(2) (Rev. 2014):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Any person who shall knowingly, willfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away from the lands of another any merchantable timber on the property of another, of the value of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) or more, whether such timber is growing, standing, or lying on the lands, shall be guilty of a felony[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 32. Timber theft is a form of larceny.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pollard v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414381\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/932/82/\">\n    932 So.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2006). And essential to any larceny is \"asportation\"-the carrying away or removal of the property with the felonious \"intent to deprive the owner of his property permanently, and to convert it to the use of the taker or of some person other than the owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Mapp v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1900812\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/248/898/#p904\">\n    248 Miss. 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1900812\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/248/898/#p904\">\n    162 So.2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645 (1964). Terrell argues the State failed to prove this element because it was not Terrell or someone in on the scam who carried away McLendon's timber. Instead, the timber was harvested by one of Terrell's victims, Brushy Creek. But we fail to see how Brushy Creek's innocence in the matter absolves Terrell of criminal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McAlevy v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433013\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/318/\">\n    44 Va.App. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433013\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/318/\">\n    605 S.E.2d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286 (2004) (refusing to allow larceny convict to \"escape criminal responsibility for a crime which he arranges to have committed by an unwitting agent\");\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

There, the defendant misrepresented he owned some farm equipment and \"sold\" it to an innocent purchaser. At the defendant's go-ahead, the purchaser took the equipment away from the farm. On appeal of his larceny conviction, the defendant made the same argument as Terrell does-that the innocent purchaser's removal of the equipment could not be attributed to him to satisfy the asportation element of larceny. The Court rejected that argument. Instead, it held that \"[u]sing an innocent purchaser of property to take and carry away property not belonging to the seller is no different legally than if [the defendant] first removed it from the farm and then sold it to the innocent purchaser.\"\n   <em>\n    McAlevy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433013\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/318/\">\n    605 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   286 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987505\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/527/#p536\">\n    256 P.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an innocent purchaser's removal of a the victim's car was attributable to the defendant who \"sold\" it to him and thus satisfied the asportation element of larceny).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 35. The same is true here. The evidence showed Terrell used not only Hawthorne and Nicholson but also the unwitting Brushy Creek to steal McLendon's timber. The evidence showed Brushy Creek harvested the timber only after Terrell's coconspirators Hawthorne and Nicholson showed agents from Brushy Creek McLendon's land, falsely represented Hawthorne owned the land-by recording the fake deeds-and then accepted $20,300 in exchange for the right to harvest the timber. Thus, even though Terrell did not physically carry away McLendon's timber, he \"was just as much guilty of the asportation as if he had taken the [timber] with his own hands.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1951357\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fla/138/568/\">\n    189 So. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"[i]t was not necessary for [the defendant] to take physical possession of the hogs\" but instead was enough that the defendant \"sold\" the hogs, which were not his, to an innocent purchaser who hauled them off in his presence);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20S.E.%201093\">\n    74 S.E. at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the asportation element of larceny was proved by evidence the defendant pointed out a cow as his, received payment for the cow, and directed the purchaser to drive the cow away).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 36. The dissent disagrees with our application of the innocent-purchaser doctrine, not based on the law, but based on a strained literal reading of the indictment. According to the dissent, the State's theory left no room for an innocent purchaser to accomplish the asportation. Instead, it insists the State had to prove the \"mere conveyance\" to Brushy Creek of the timber rights via false documents \"actually move[d] the timber.\" But contrary to the dissent's stance, Terrell's asporation\n   though an innocent purchaser is\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   what the indictment meant when it alleged that Terrell and his coconspirators, \"[b]y use of the artifice and false documents, ... did take, steal and carry away the merchantable timber[.]\" We can all agree that the act of executing inanimate documents cannot physically move timber. And the indictment never alleged that is what happened. Instead, the indictment clearly charged that Terrell accomplished the timber larceny through an innocent purchaser, asserting Terrell, Hawthorne, and Nicholson \"did by the use and employment of false documents, ... convey[ ] the timber located and growing on said real property in exchange for United States currency to a timber company, namely Brushy Creek Timber Company,\n   <em>\n    causing said timber to be harvested\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 37. Terrell pushes this same asportation argument in his attack on the jury instructions. As the dissent points out, the timber-theft instruction tracked the language of the indictment. So for the same reason we reject his no-evidence-of-asportation claim, we find no merit in his argument that the timber-theft instruction given did not properly instruct the jury on the asportation element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 38. We also find the judge properly refused to instruct the jury that Terrell had to personally carry away the timber to be guilty of timber theft. Again, this is not the law. Instead, we find the judge was right to instruct that Terrell was guilty of timber theft, if the jury found \"[b]y use of the artifice and false documents, ... Terrell did take, steal and carry away the merchantable timber[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 39.

False Pretenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 40. Terrell next attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support his false-pretenses conviction. Under Mississippi Code Section 97-19-39(2) (Rev. 2014):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Every person, who with intent to cheat or defraud another, shall designedly, by color of any false token or writing, or by another false pretense, obtain the signature of any person to any written instrument, or obtain from any person any money, personal property, or valuable thing, with a value of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or more, upon conviction thereof shall be guilty of a felony[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   There are three necessary elements to this count: (1) \"the pretenses were false,\" (2) Terrell \"knew them to be false,\" and (3) \"the pretenses were the moving cause by which the money was obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Allred v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7484687\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/605/758/#p761\">\n    605 So.2d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (Miss. 1992) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 41. On appeal, Terrell does not suggest the State failed to prove any one of these three elements. Instead, he relies on what\n   <em>\n    Allred\n   </em>\n   further requires the State to prove in a false-pretenses case-that \"the property or money obtained under false pretenses must have been 'to the\n   detriment or injury of the person from whom he obtains the same.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7484687\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/605/758/#p761\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Terrell argues the State failed to show his intended false-pretenses victim, Brushy Creek,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   suffered an injury or detriment. As support, Terrell latches on to Davis's testimony that it sold McLendon's timber for a $6,000 profit. In other words, Terrell argues Brushy Creek suffered no injury or detriment because it lost no money on the deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 42. But the State did not have to show Brushy Creek suffered a\n   <em>\n    monetary loss\n   </em>\n   to prove it had been injured. Nor was it required to prove it wrote the $20,300 check to its detriment. Instead, the alleged detriment was that Brushy Creek did not lawfully obtain title to the timber, because Hawthorne forged the deeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11573667\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/738/253/#p257\">\n    738 So.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998) (noting that a bona fide purchaser of stolen property acquires no title or interest in the property). The title still belongs to McLendon. Thus, as the indictment pled, Brushy Creek is indebted to McLendon for the fraudulently obtained timber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 43. Because the evidence showed Brushy Creek paid $20,300 for timber to which it never acquired title or interest, just as in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he jury was entitled to draw a reasonable deduction ... that [Brushy Creek] suffered an injury as a result of [Terrell's] fraudulent conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11573667\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/738/253/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11573667\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/738/253/#p257\">\n    at 257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 44. We therefore find no error in the judge's refusal to give Terrell's proposed jury instruction, D-4, which erroneously would have required the State to prove Brushy Creek suffered a \"monetary loss\" to find Terrell guilty of false pretenses. Nor can we find reversible error in the trial court's choosing to give Jury Instruction Number 9 as the instruction on false pretenses, instead of Terrell's proposed instruction, D-6. While D-6 succinctly listed the essential elements of false pretenses, Instruction Number 9 correctly states the law, was tailored to the facts of the case, and included all essential elements of false pretenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 45. So the evidence was sufficient and the jury was properly instructed on the false-pretenses count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Two Conspiracies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 46. While the evidence supports both the false-pretenses and timber-theft convictions, we agree with Terrell that it supports only\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   conspiracy conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 47. Terrell was convicted of both conspiracy to commit timber theft and conspiracy to commit false pretenses. He received separate, consecutive, five-year sentences on each count. But \"[a] single agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And, here, the evidence shows there were not two separate conspiracies but rather one conspiracy with two illegal objects-to steal McLendon's timber and to obtain $20,300 from Brushy Creek through false pretenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 48. Thus, Terrell's two, five-year sentences for conspiracy to commit false pretenses and conspiracy to commit timber theft punish him twice for the same illegal agreement, violating the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend V (applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 49. To remedy this double punishment, we vacate both sentences and remand the two conspiracy convictions to the trial court with instructions to dismiss-at the State's election-one of the conspiracy counts and resentence Terrell on the remaining conspiracy count.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In reviewing what transpired at trial, we find the trial judge properly followed the\n   <em>\n    Box\n   </em>\n   protocol. When the State first tried to call Langley to introduce the civil judgments, the judge did not allow this. He told the State he would consider this later in the trial. This gave Terrell's counsel additional time to review the documents. And when the State later recalled Langley, the court recessed trial to give Terrell's attorney an opportunity to interview Langley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   URCCC 9.04. After doing so, the trial judge determined a mistrial was not warranted, because the existence of the publicly recorded judgments could hardly have come as an \"unfair surprise\" to Terrell or his attorney, who also represented Terrell in these civil matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 53.

Of course if the defendant had been caught with the gun three hours after the shooting, that evidence would be more powerful.

Here, the timing of the entry of the civil judgments went to the weight, not the relevance-and thus the admissibility-of this evidence. The civil judgments clearly were relevant to show Terrell's knowledge and his intent to use forged deeds to steal McLendon's timber by illegally \"selling\" it to Brushy Creek. Thus, under Rule 404(b), this evidence was admissible. And given the relevance of this evidence under Rule 404(b), we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion under Rule 403 when it found the probative value of this evidence outweighed the danger of any unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pollard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414381\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/932/82/\">\n    932 So.2d at 87-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 64. At the close of trial, as requested by Terrell, the trial court gave a limiting instruction, specifically admonishing the jury it \"must not consider this testimony as proof of guilt of the charges for which he is presently on trial.\" And our law requires we presume the jury followed this instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batiste v.

According to Terrell, the way the State discussed the two civil judgments invited the jury to consider this evidence as proof of his bad character, not just his intent and knowledge, in violation of Rule 404(b). Terrell also asserts the State made an impermissible \"send a message\" argument. But as Terrell concedes, he made no contemporaneous objection to the alleged improper statements. And as we have said, \"[t]he failure to object acts as a waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Moreover, even if this issue was not procedurally barred, Terrell cannot show prejudice. The trial court clearly instructed the jury on the limited admissibility of the Rule 404(b) evidence. And, again, we must presume jurors followed the court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p834\">\n    121 So.3d at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 67. Terrell also contends the State made a \"send a message\" argument that was so inflammatory and prejudicial that the trial court should have objected\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v.

Again, Terrell did not object at trial. And after review, we do not find the State's comments so inflamed the jury that the trial court erred by not intervening on its own. A \"send the message\" argument is one that encourages \"juries to use their verdict to 'send-a-message' to the public or to other potential criminals,\" instead of \"render[ing] a verdict based solely on the evidence introduced at the trial of that case.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

On the second day of trial, the State attempted to call as a witness Clint Langley, the circuit clerk, to place into evidence two civil judgments against Terrell. Because Langley was not on the witness list, Terrell claimed unfair surprise, citing Rule 9.04. The State maintained that the civil judgments were against Terrell for the wrongful cutting of timber and it moved to place them into evidence under Mississippi Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b) as evidence of motive, intent, plan, and identification. The prosecutor stated that \"As to the heart of the case, they're denying that Terrell had anything to do with it, and we're showing that he did the same exact thing in three different counties in recent years.\" The court decided that Langley would not testify at that moment, and gave Terrell time to review the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 77. Later that day, the court determined that it had given Terrell sufficient time to review the evidence and noted that the judgments were matters of public record. The court allowed Terrell an hour and a half to interview Langley. Terrell again objected based on unfair surprise. The State noted that \"We're not getting into collections, Your Honor. We're here to indicate to the jury that's what this man does, is steal people's timber, and that we got two ...\" (the court cut off the prosecutor at this point). Terrell also objected that the judgments were more prejudicial than probative and that the judgments were being introduced as evidence of prior bad acts to show Terrell's bad character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 78. The majority inexplicably claims that Terrell did not object based upon Rule 404(b) and only requested a limiting instruction. On page 323 of the transcript, Terrell's counsel specifically objected that \"my understanding of the rule with respect to prior bad acts would be that this evidence will not be probative of the defendant's guilt on these two charges simply to show his bad character.\" Counsel then argued in the alternative, that if the trial court did allow the evidence in over his objection, that the court should give a limiting instruction, stating that he wanted a limiting instruction \"if the Court sees fit[ ] to allow this testimony to come in[.]\" The majority conflates these and blatantly punishes defense counsel for being thorough. It also appears to make new law that, if counsel objects, but then makes an argument in the alternative, counsel somehow has waived the original objection. This has never been the law in Mississippi, nor should it be. The majority's warping of the record to find waiver is inexcusable and will suppress zealous advocacy. Moreover, the trial court specifically addressed Rule 404(b) on page 324 of the transcript. The purpose of the contemporaneous objection rule is to allow the trial court to address and/or correct any issues.\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

The trial\n   court addressed Rule 404(b), because it was raised by both parties; thus this is not a situation in which this Court would be finding the trial court in error for an issue it did not have the opportunity to address. Additionally, Terrell specifically raised Rule 404(b) in his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, motion for a new trial, with the specific objection found on page 195 of the record in this case. Even more telling is that the State does\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   argue that Terrell waived this issue; indeed, it argues the merits of the Rule 404(b) issue because the record makes clear that Terrell sufficiently objected based on Rule 404(b).

Langley testified and the judgments were entered into evidence. The first document was a three page order from 2012 granting summary judgment against Terrell and awarding the plaintiffs monetary damages. It did not recite the facts of the case, nor did it state that the case was about timber. Indeed, timber is not even mentioned in the order. It awarded monetary damages to two plaintiffs, and also found that a warranty deed executed by one of the plaintiffs was a forgery, ordering the deed to be struck and confirming the original parties' interest in the land. It made no findings regarding who forged the deed or how it was forged. The second document consisted of a two-page default judgment against Terrell issued in 2009. The default judgment found that Terrell \"wrongfully cut and removed timber from\" the plaintiff's land, and awarded her a monetary judgment.

To show intent, motive, or plan to commit timber theft, the State ostensibly introduced the default judgment for wrongful timber removal. However, a civil default judgment for wrongful timber removal could be related to something as simple as mistaken property lines. Further, because it is a default judgment, the facts of the alleged act committed by Terrell were not proven to any reasonable degree of certainty.

A factually sparse default judgment and a factually sparse order granting summary judgment have minuscule probative value. The danger of unfair prejudice vastly outweighed any probative value, as the introduction of the civil judgements could \"render [Terrell] in the eyes of jurors liable, not because of what he did or did not do in the instant case, but because of what he has done or failed to do in the past.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Terrell argues that \"carry away\" requires that he physically \"carry away\" the timber, and no evidence was adduced that he committed the element of carrying away. Indeed, it is clear that Brushy Creek physically carried away the timber. The State does not argue that Terrell physically carried away the timber. Indeed, the indictment claims that \"[b]y use of the artifice and false documents described herein, the Defendant did take, steal and carry away the merchantable timber.\" The language in the timber theft \"elements\" instruction was identical to that in the indictment. The trial court also rejected a \"theory of the defense\" instruction offered by Terrell that stated that the State had to prove that Terrell \"both captured or took the physical possession of the subject merchantable timber and that he asported or carried away the subject merchantable timber by cutting or moving the same if only for a short distance.\" Thus, the question is whether a defendant can constructively \"carry away\" via false documents, or, phrased differently, whether Terrell accomplished the \"carrying away\" by conveying the timber to Brushy Creek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has found that \"carrying away\" requires an asportation, no matter how small.\n   <em>\n    Harbin v.

While the conveyance of the timber in this case certainly eventually led to the timber's removal, the\n   <em>\n    mere conveyance\n   </em>\n   did not actually move the timber. The plain language of the \"carry away\" element in the statute clearly contemplates some physical movement of the property by the defendant or someone for whom he is criminally liable, and this is not how the indictment alleges the asportation was accomplished.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414381\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/932/82/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the conveyance and the false documents did not create any movement of the timber whatsoever; that movement occurred later, via Brushy Creek.

The majority cites several cases regarding the \"innocent agent doctrine,\" which essentially stands for the notion that a defendant who effectuates an element of the crime through an innocent agent may be held liable for that innocent agent's actions. Yet, that is not the issue here. Indeed, because it is not the issue at hand, the State does not raise or make any sort of innocent purchaser argument in its brief; rather, the majority attempts to create this argument out of whole cloth on behalf of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue is whether Terrell can \"carry away\" using false documents,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether an innocent agent can accomplish the asportation. Whether documents can accomplish asportation is the issue in this case because the State specifically alleged in its indictment, and the court specifically instructed the jury in its instructions, that Terrell accomplished the carrying away \"[b]y use of the artifice and false documents described herein.\" While such detail in the indictment may have been found to be surplusage, the State did not move to amend the indictment, took the case to trial, and had the court instruct the jury that Terrell accomplished the asportation by the use of false documents. Nothing in the indictment or jury instructions allowed for an innocent agent to accomplish asportation. \"[T]he State handicapped itself through this indictment\" by\n   adding these details, which it must then prove.\n   <em>\n    Richmond v.

The State imposed on itself, perhaps unnecessarily, the obligation to prove that Terrell accomplished the asportation solely with the use of false documents, and it must be held to this.

So based on the jury instructions, Terrell cannot be liable for Brushy Creek's action. Which brings this back to the State's sole argument, that Terrell accomplished the \"carrying away\" via false documents.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    This article points out that many states have eliminated the \"carry away\" requirement and created theft charges that merely require exercising control over the property, in contrast to the statute at hand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The State noted that Terrell's proposed jury instruction on the issue defined caption and asportation, and argued in its brief that this proposed instruction\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    did not track the language of Terrell's indictment and failed to address the fact that Terrell fraudulently obtained John McLendon's land and sold it to the Brushy Creek Timber Company. Instruction D-8 seems to imply that Terrell could not be convicted for timber theft because he never physically moved the timber on John's land. Therefore, the\n    <em>\n     most serious problem\n    </em>\n    with D-8 is that it overlooks the fact that Terrell\n    <em>\n     took the land through false pretenses and then conveyed\n    </em>\n    John's timber to the Brushy Creek Timber Company. The elements of timber theft were more thoroughly and more accurately explained to the jury in Instruction Number 7, which explained in part, \"(2) By use of the artifice and false documents described herein, Robert Patrick Terrell did take, steal, and carry away the merchantable timber on the property described in said false documents, which were owned by John McClendon, said timber, having a market value at that time of more than twenty thousand three hundred dollars ($20,300.00).\" When D-8 is compared with Instruction Number D-7, it is clear that Number 7 sufficiently addressed the elements of timber theft and tracked the indictment, while D-8 failed to do so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    (Emphasis added) (citations to record omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    I agree with the majority that Terrell may only be convicted of one conspiracy charge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
