The tenant and the landlord filed cross-motions for summary judgment concerning interpretation of the \"Additional Rent\" provision in the lease between them. The trial court denied the tenant's motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the landlord, dismissing the tenant's claims against it. The tenant appeals, and for the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff, Specialty Retailers, Inc. (SRI or the tenant), entered into a ten-year Lease Contract (the lease) with Weingarten Realty Investors (WRI) in February 2003, regarding\n   a portion of a retail shopping center in Lafayette, Louisiana. Thereafter, SRI began operating a Stage department store in the leased premises. In May 2005, WRI transferred its interest in the shopping center to RB River IV LLC, RB River V LLC, and RB River VI LLC (collectively RBR or landlord). The lease called for SRI to pay three types of rent: Minimum Rent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Percentage Rent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Additional Rent. In simple terms, the Additional Rent portion of the lease required SRI to make monthly payments to cover its proportionate share of the costs and expenses paid by the landlord. The lease provided for a year-end reconciliation of the monthly amounts paid by SRI against the actual amount that the landlord incurred in costs and expenses during that calendar year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SRI hired third-party auditor Green Back Cost Recovery (Green Back) in 2014 to review the lease. Green Back concluded that SRI had been paying more than it owed in Additional Rent based upon its interpretation of a cap provision found in the lease. Thereafter, SRI sent several demand letters in accordance with the Louisiana Open Account Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Stirling Properties, L.L.C. (Stirling), property manager of the shopping center, seeking a refund of the amounts it had allegedly overpaid. When its demands went unanswered, SRI filed suit against RBR and Stirling (hereafter collectively referred to as Defendants), alleging that they were guilty of breach of contract and/or that they were liable to it on open account and seeking damages of $213,529.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Defendants answered the suit, SRI filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking to have the trial court declare as a matter of law that Section 22.01(E) of the lease capped the \"actual CATI\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   payments\" owed by it to RBR. In response, RBR filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that the lease obligated SRI to \"pay its proportionate share of all Common Area Operating Costs, Taxes and Insurance Premiums incurred on an annual basis and that Section 22.01(E) simply limit[ed] the monthly payment obligations against those annual costs.\" Stirling filed a memorandum in support of RBR's motion and against that filed by SRI. Following a hearing, the trial court denied SRI's motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of RBR, dismissing SRI's claims against it. SRI timely appealed the ensuing judgment and is now before this court assigning these errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. In deciding that the annual cap on Tenant's Share of CATI only applied to\n   <em>\n    estimated\n   </em>\n   monthly payments, the district court erroneously interpreted the clear and unambiguous language of Section 22.01(E) of the Lease Contract, which expressly provides that Tenant's Share of\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   CATI may not increase by more than four percent (4%) each year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. The district court's erroneous interpretation of the Lease Contract renders Section 22.01(E) meaningless because, without an annual cap on Tenant's share of\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   CATI, the\n   additional rent would be unpredictable and the reconciliation process found in Section 22.02 would be unnecessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. To the extent the district court found the Lease Contract to be ambiguous, the district court erroneously failed to consider that the undisputed facts establish the intent of the original parties to the Lease Contract to provide for an annual cap on\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   CATI (as evidenced by similar contracts between SRI and WRI).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Standard of Review\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Appellate review of the granting of a motion for summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the identical criteria that govern the trial court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Smitko v.

It claims that the \"clear and unambiguous language\" of that particular provision placed a cap on the \"actual CATI\" that it owed per year and that any other interpretation would render Section 22.01(E) meaningless. RBR counters that SRI's argument\n   is flawed because it fails to consider the lease as written and in its entirety. RBR submits that Section 22.01(E) caps SRI's monthly CATI payments which can \"only be estimated because they are paid monthly in advance.\" RBR contends that its interpretation of Section 22.01(E), which the trial court accepted, is correct given the yearly reconciliation provision found in Section 22.02 of the lease which compares SRI's actual share of CATI to the monthly payments that SRI previously paid and which does not reference a cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Additional Rent provision is found in Article XXII of the lease, which begins as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 22.01. Commencing on the first day of the Lease Term and continuing for the balance of the Lease Term, in addition to and separate from the Minimum Rent and Percentage Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent the Tenant's Share of Common Area Operating Costs, Taxes and Insurance Premiums (as such terms are hereinafter defined).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The lease then provides (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. The phrase \"\n   <strong>\n    Common Area Operating Costs\n   </strong>\n   \" shall mean, for each calendar year (or portion thereof) during the term of this Lease, the aggregate of all costs, expenses and liabilities of every kind or nature paid or incurred by the Landlord (to the extent that Landlord, in its good faith judgment, regards it as appropriate to provide ... [ ).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   D. The phrase \"\n   <strong>\n    Tenant's Share\n   </strong>\n   \" as applied to Common Area Operating Costs, Taxes and Insurance Premiums shall refer to a sum calculated by multiplying the Common Area Operating Costs, Taxes and Insurance Premiums (as the case may be) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the floor area (in square feet) of the Leased Premises, ... and the denominator of which is the aggregate leasable floor area (in square feet) of all buildings in the Shopping Center. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   E. Tenant shall pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of Tenant's Share of Common Area Operating Costs, Taxes and Insurance Premiums (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"\n   <strong>\n    CATI\n   </strong>\n   \"), monthly in advance, for each and every month during the term of this Lease every month during the term of this Lease.... Notwithstanding the foregoing, in calendar years 2003 and 2004, respectively Tenant's Share of CATI shall not exceed $5,416.67 per month (the \"\n   <strong>\n    CATI Payment\n   </strong>\n   \").... After the expiration of calendar year 2004, the CATI Payment may increase by no more than four percent (4%) per calendar year (compounded annually); provided however, that the CATI Payment may never exceed one-twelfth (1/12) of Tenant's Share of CATI during the applicable calendar year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After explaining the meaning of the terms used therein, the lease gives the Landlord the right to \"to estimate Tenant's Share of CATI,\" subject to a year-end reconciliation whereby the \"the\n   <strong>\n    actual amount\n   </strong>\n   of Tenant's Share of CATI\" is compared to \"the aggregate amount previously paid by Tenant\" that year (emphasis added). Thereafter, SRI would owe any shortfall to RBR within twenty days. On the other hand, any overpayment made by SRI would be either credited to its \"next ensuing installment of CATI due\" or refunded by RBR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We conclude that the language of the lease at issue herein clearly and unambiguously requires SRI to pay to RBR, on a yearly basis, its actual share of the Common Area Operating Costs incurred by RBR, without reference to any cap. SRI's arguments to the contrary are flawed. The result sought by SRI confuses the terms CATI and Tenant's Share, and it fails to consider and give meaning to the entire Additional Rent section of the contract. Moreover, SRI's fear that the Additional Rent provision of the lease could serve as a \"potential profit center\" for RBR is unjustified given the lease's inclusion of a mechanism to substantiate the amount of Additional Rent that RBR seeks to collect from it. SRI's first and second assignments of error lack merit. Because we have found no ambiguity in the lease between SRI and RBR, we do not reach SRI's third assigned error.
