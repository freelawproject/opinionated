The Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) appeals the judgment of the circuit court, which found that the MDOC violated an inmate's due-process rights when it failed to give timely notice of a disciplinary hearing. Upon review, we find the MDOC's actions were not arbitrary or capricious and did not violate the inmate's constitutional or statutory due-process rights. We therefore reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Roy Stafford is an inmate in the custody of the MDOC. In 1988, Stafford was convicted of murder and aggravated assault and sentenced to life and ten years,\n   respectively. He is currently housed at Parchman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On September 23, 2015, rule violation report (RVR) No. 01293491 was issued against Stafford. The RVR alleged that Stafford made a threatening statement to another inmate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 28, 2015, Stafford received notice that a disciplinary hearing would be held September 29, 2015. However, due to \"case overload,\" Stafford's disciplinary hearing was not held until November 21, 2015. No further notice of the hearing was provided to Stafford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At the disciplinary hearing, Stafford admitted the allegation and rule violation and was found guilty by the hearing officer. Stafford received a thirty-day loss of visitation, phone, and canteen privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Stafford appealed the hearing officer's decision through the MDOC's administrative-remedy program. Stafford claimed a violation of due process as a result of the MDOC's failure to provide him at least twenty-four hours' notice of the November disciplinary hearing. The MDOC found Stafford received proper notice and denied his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Stafford subsequently filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sunflower County pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 47-5-807 (Rev. 2015). In his petition, Stafford claimed the MDOC violated its disciplinary procedures by failing to provide him timely notice of the hearing, and thereby denied him due process. Stafford asked the circuit court to: (1) order the MDOC to expunge the RVR from his record, (2) issue a declaratory judgment finding certain MDOC officials individually liable because they acted outside of their job descriptions, (3) order the MDOC to pay all filing fees and court costs, and (4) order the MDOC not to retaliate against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. By order entered July 29, 2016, the circuit court found Stafford's requests for a declaratory judgment and payment of court costs and fees were meritless and noted that prison officials by law cannot retaliate against or harass prisoners for exercising their constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. With regard to Stafford's due-process claim, the circuit court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   that MDOC violated Petitioner Stafford's statutory due[-]process rights by failing to adhere to its policies and procedures when it held the disciplinary hearing approximately two (2) months after it was scheduled without giving [Stafford] [twenty-four] hours['] notice of [the] hearing. As such, [MDOC's] decision in RVR 01293491 [wa]s arbitrary and capricious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The circuit court reversed the MDOC's decision and ordered that RVR No. 01293491 be expunged from Stafford's prison record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. The MDOC now appeals and argues its decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record; was not arbitrary or capricious, or beyond the agency's powers; and did not violate Stafford's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. \"In reviewing the decision of a circuit court concerning an agency action, this Court applies the same standard of review that court is bound to follow.\"\n   <em>\n    Pub.

An agency's conclusions should not be disturbed\n   unless the agency's order: \"(1) is not supported by substantial evidence; (2) is arbitrary and capricious; (3) is beyond the scope or power granted to the agency; or (4) violates one's constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9334415\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/834/50/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its own judgment for that of the agency [that] rendered the decision nor reweigh the facts of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9334415\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/834/50/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11.

Automatic reversal is not required where the appellee fails to file a brief. However, the appellant's argument should at least create enough doubt in the judiciousness of the [circuit] court's judgment that this Court cannot say with confidence that the case should be affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Rogillio v.

In his petition for judicial review, Stafford alleged a violation of his constitutional due-process rights as a result of the MDOC's failure to provide timely notice of his disciplinary hearing. Additionally, the circuit court found that Stafford's statutory due-process rights had been violated due to the MDOC's failure to follow its administrative procedures. We address both the constitutional and the statutory due-process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    I. Constitutional Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13. \"A due[-]process violation occurs where a party is not allowed a full and complete hearing before being deprived of life, liberty [,] or property.\"\n   <em>\n    Leavitt v.
