This appeal arises from a January 2016 order by the Lincoln County Chancery Court adjudicating Kevin Earl Moore, a minor, the heir of Travis Lynn Weems, who died in an automobile accident in July 2014. Dauwanna Mitchell, Weems's mother, appeals from that judgment, claiming it is invalid because Weems was never adjudicated to be Moore's natural father due to a paternity action filed in 2007 that was dismissed and, as Mitchell claims, never reinstated. Mitchell also claims a final judgment entered in February 2011 terminating Weems's parental rights was improperly revised by the chancery court in October 2015 under Rule 60 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. Consolidated with this appeal (2015-CA-01651) is another appeal by Mitchell (2016-CA-00177) concerning the chancery court's 2014 judgment granting letters of administration based on an administrative-letters petition filed by Tilmon Bishop, Chancery Clerk of Lincoln County. Summons thereafter were issued to unknown heirs at law and wrongful-death beneficiaries of Weems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Both appeals submit the same claims of error, that the chancery court's order adjudicating heirship is invalid because paternity never was adjudicated, and the chancery court erred in revising the February 2011 termination judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. Finding no merit in Mitchell's assignments of error, we affirm the chancery court's judgment adjudicating Kevin Moore the heir of Travis Weems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Paternity Adjudication and Child-Support Action Against Travis Weems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5. On August 7, 2007, the Mississippi Department of Human Services (\"DHS\") filed a complaint in the Lincoln County Chancery Court against Travis Weems. The complaint sought to determine paternity of a minor child named Kevin Earl Weems, born out of wedlock to Tabitha Moore. The chancery court dismissed the\n   complaint without prejudice on October 14, 2008, due to nonservice of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6. DHS filed a new complaint on November 6, 2008, again alleging that Travis was Kevin's father. This complaint was filed under the same cause number as the previously dismissed complaint. Travis was served with process on December 7, 2008, and he appeared before the court and signed an agreed order for genetic paternity testing to be performed on in February 2009 to determine paternity. But Travis never submitted to any paternity test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7. On May 19, 2009, the chancery court entered a judgment for support and other relief, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Travis] is the parent of [Kevin] and is therefore under a legal duty to provide for [his] support.... The defendant[, Travis] refused to submit to genetic testing in this action. Paternity was previously established pursuant to voluntary acknowledgment of [Kevin].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Termination of Parental Rights Action Against Travis Weems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8. On September 3, 2010, Tabitha Moore filed a petition in the chancery court seeking termination of Travis's parental rights. Travis was served with process and appeared before the court on February 10, 2011, at which time a final hearing was held in the termination matter. The court entered its final judgment on February 25, 2011, terminating Travis's parental rights to Kevin, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   that the parental rights of Travis Lynn Weems of and to Kevin Earl Weems are hereby terminated,\n   <em>\n    including the rights of inheritance of and from the child\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 9. On May 29, 2015, Tillmon Bishop (Kevin's state-appointed guardian) filed a motion to revise the chancery court's February 2011 final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) and/or (6) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion claimed that no relief affecting Kevin's inheritance rights was prayed for, and there was no mention of such rights during the February 2011 termination proceedings. The motion submitted that the February 2011 judgment should be rendered \"void as to the child's rights of inheritance as equity demands those rights to remain intact for the benefit of this child unless specifically and intentionally eliminated by the [c]ourt.\" The motion further submitted that the \"finality of the language erroneously included in the Final Judgment is greatly outweighed by the inequality manifested upon the minor child by the [c]ourt, unintentionally terminating the rights of inheritance of the minor child from his natural father.\" On July 15, 2015, Mitchell filed a response in opposition to the motion filed by Bishop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10. The chancery court held a hearing on the matter on August 27, 2015. On October 22, 2015, the chancery court entered an order revising the February 2011 final judgment, finding that the language was included based on a clerical mistake, arising from an oversight in the chancery court's original decision. Therefore, it should be struck from the February 2011 final judgment. The chancery court described the change as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The change is not made to reflect any change in mind by this Judge, based upon the fact that no relief affecting rights of inheritance was prayed for by the Petitioner or\n   <em>\n    Guardian Ad Litem\n   </em>\n   , or included in the Bench Ruling made at the conclusion of the trial. This correction is made solely to correct an Order that failed to accurately reflect this Judge's original decision as manifested by the Transcript of the Bench Ruling, and pursuant to Rule 60(a) of the\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Administration Action in the Matter of the Estate of Travis Weems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11. Travis Weems died on July 12, 2014, from injuries he sustained when he was a guest passenger in an automobile during an accident. The Lincoln County Chancery Clerk filed a petition for Letters of Administration on November 3, 2014. On November 4, 2014, the chancery court entered a judgment granting the petition, and said letters were issued on November 17, 2014. Summons were then issued to Unknown Heirs at Law and Wrongful Death Beneficiaries of Travis in the time and manner required by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12. On January 5, 2016, an heirship proceeding was held in the chancery court. Tabitha Moore was the only person who appeared before the court, and she provided sworn testimony supporting Kevin's heirship to Travis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13. The chancery court thereafter adjudicated Kevin to be the heir of Travis. The court based its determination on the May 2009 paternity judgment, in which the court found Travis to be Kevin's natural father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14. Mitchell appeals, claiming the January 2016 order is invalid because Travis was never adjudicated Kevin's natural father because the 2007 paternity action was dismissed and never reinstated. Mitchell also claims the chancery court improperly revised, under Rule 60, the court's February 2011 judgment, which had terminated Travis's parental rights and Kevin's right to inherit from Travis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15. This court will not disturb a chancery court's decision unless the chancery court's findings are manifestly wrong; not supported by substantial, credible evidence; or the chancery court has applied an erroneous legal standard.\n   <em>\n    Norton v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651444\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/742/126/#p128\">\n    742 So.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128-29 (Miss. 1999). Questions of law are reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Dorsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7495732\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/599/529/#p533\">\n    599 So.2d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533 (Miss. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the 2009 paternity action, adjudicating Travis to be Kevin's father, is valid.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16. Mitchell contends that, because the first paternity complaint was dismissed, the second complaint was void for lack of jurisdiction. Mitchell's argument is predicated on the belief the two complaints are actually the same single action, as evinced by the fact the same cause number was used for each action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17. The chancery court found no merit in this claim, explaining that it constituted nothing but \"form over substance\" and noting that Mitchell's counsel even agreed that if these two actions had used separate cause numbers, there would be \"zero merit\" to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18. We agree. The fact the same cause number was used in both the first and second complaints is of no matter in this case. The record clearly shows that the first paternity complaint was dismissed without prejudice due to insufficient service of process, and a new complaint thereafter properly was instituted by DHS. The dismissal of the first action without prejudice was not a jurisdictional bar to the second action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19. Secondly, as to the chancery court's finding(s) and ruling(s) in the second paternity action, Mississippi Code Section 93-9-21(1)(b) instructs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If the putative father does not submit to genetic testing, the court shall, without further notice, on the date and time previously set through the notice for hearing, review the documentation of the refusal to submit to genetic testing and make a determination as to whether the complaint to establish paternity\n   should be granted. The refusal to submit to such testing shall create a rebuttable presumption of an admission to paternity by the putative father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-9-21\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 93-9-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b) (Rev. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 20. The record illustrates that Travis agreed to undergo genetic testing to determine paternity, but he ultimately did not submit to testing. Later, during the proceedings pertaining to the termination of Travis's parental rights, Travis told the chancery court the reason he did not submit to testing was because he could not afford it, and he never actually believed he was not Kevin's father. Travis stated to the record: \"I thought it would be best just to make sure he was mine, just to be straight up and honest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 21. The chancery court also found that Weems voluntarily had acknowledged his paternity, as evidenced by his having signed Kevin's birth certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22. These factors, according to the chancery court, constituted a presumption of admission by Travis that he was Kevin's father. This presumption was never rebutted by Travis and was actually reaffirmed by Travis at the February 2011 parental-rights termination proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23. For these reasons, we find the chancery court did not err in adjudicating Travis to be the natural father of Kevin. This issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the Order Terminating Parental Rights was improperly revised.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 24. The chancery court found the language \"including the rights of inheritance of and from the child\" contained in the February 2011 judgment terminating Travis's parental rights constituted a clerical mistake. The court ordered the language struck from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25. Mitchell argues this was error because the purpose of Rule 60(a) is to correct insubstantial clerical errors. She contends that relief from more substantial errors requires use of Rule 60(b). Specifically, Mitchell points to Rule 60(b)(2), which affords relief based on an accident or mistake, but requires such relief be sought within six months after entry of the judgment. M.R.C.P. 60(b)(2). Mitchell also points to\n   <em>\n    Stringfellow v. Stringfellow\n   </em>\n   , where this Court, in speaking to Rule 60(b)(2), said \"neither ignorance nor carelessness on the part of an attorney will provide grounds for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Stringfellow v. Stringfellow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7612018\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/451/219/#p221\">\n    451 So.2d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (Miss. 1984) (citing\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

Motions for relief under Rule 60 in general are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and appellate review is limited to whether that discretion has been abused.\n   <em>\n    R.K. v. J.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343915\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/946/764/#p776\">\n    946 So.2d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 (Miss. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27. Rule 60(a) allows the court to correct \"clerical mistakes\" arising from oversight or omission for the goal of \"mak[ing] the judgment or other document speak the truth.\" M.R.C.P. 60(a) cmt. Rule 60(a) reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Clerical Mistakes\n   </strong>\n   . Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or on the motion of any party\n   and after such notice, if any, as the court orders up until the time the record is transmitted by the clerk of the trial court to the appellate court and the action remains pending therein. Thereafter, such mistakes may be so corrected only with leave of the appellate court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   M.R.C.P. 60(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28. This Court has explained \" Rule 60(a) prescribes an efficient method for correcting clerical errors appearing in judgments, orders, or other parts of a trial record; errors of a more substantial nature must be corrected in accordance with MRCP 59(e) or 60(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Townsend v. Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051585\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/370/#p375\">\n    859 So.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375 (Miss. 2003) (quoting former comment to Rule 60(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29. Rule 60(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Mistakes; Inadvertence; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc\n   </strong>\n   . On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (1) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (2) accident or mistake;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (3) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (4) the judgment is void;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (6) any other reason justifying relief from the judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2) and (3) not more than six months after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   M.R.C.P 60(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 30. Here, the chancery court found the language contained in the judgment did not reflect the court's original decision, as manifested by the transcript of the bench ruling. The court noted that no request affecting Kevin's inheritance rights was prayed for by Tabitha or the guardian ad litem in the petition to terminate Travis's parental rights. Nor were inheritance rights ever mentioned in the bench ruling stated into the record by the chancery court at the conclusion of the termination proceeding. The court concluded that correcting the February 2011 termination judgment was proper pursuant to Rule 60(a), to accurately reflect the court's original decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 31. At the outset, we point out that Section 93-15-109 was repealed by the Legislature when it revised the termination-of-parental-rights chapter in 2016. The disinheritance language found in former Section 93-15-109 was not carried forward into any of the new provisions under the new chapter. The amendments, however, do not have retroactive effect in this case, and former Section 93-15-109 applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Miss. Laws, ch. 431, \u00a7 24 (H.B. 1240)(2016) (\"This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage [ (approved April 18, 2016) ].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 32. That said, we agree with Mitchell that the change made here was substantial, and generally, \"errors of a more substantial nature are to be corrected in accordance with Rule 60(b),\" not Rule 60(a).\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051585\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/370/#p375\">\n    859 So.2d at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we also find that the record pertaining to the February 2011 judgment more than substantially supports the chancery court's finding that it did not intend to terminate Kevin's inheritance rights from Travis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 33. The question we must answer is: did the chancery court have the authority in this instance to correct what the chancery court found was a mistake on its part? To help us fully consider the matter, we asked the parties for additional briefing to address whether the chancery court should have considered the motion to revise under Rule 60(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 34. Having received the additional briefing from the parties, which has been very helpful in our resolution of the issue, we find that the chancery court did not abuse its discretion in revising the February 2011 judgment to remove the so-called disinheritance language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 35. According to the record, counsel for Tabitha drafted the language contained in the February 2011 terminating Travis's parental rights. The May 2015 motion filed by Bishop to correct the judgment contains an affidavit from Tabitha's counsel stating that \"the language of said Order was in no way intended to prevent [Kevin] from inheriting from the estate of [Weems].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 36. In considering the motion to revise the February 2011 judgment, the chancery court did not speak to counsel's affidavit. Rather, the court, as mentioned, essentially found that inclusion of this language in the final judgment was an oversight by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 37. Review of the February 2011 termination proceedings suggests that, while not prayed for in the termination petition, there were hopes of an adoption proceeding for Tabitha's new husband at some point in the future. But the chancery court was not agreeable to any such prospect at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 38. At the conclusion of the February 2011 termination proceeding, after going through the factors justifying the termination of Travis's parental rights, the chancery court stated for the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The court wants to [state for] the record that in the event that this child is adopted, this court will not allow the adoption of the child without a guardian ad litem's report, will not allow the adoption of the child without a complete home study having been done by the Department of Human Services, and the Department of Human Services and the guardian ad litem, if it's not Mr. Norton, being provided with a complete copy of the guardian ad litem's report and the supplement to that report that he's going to file that shows the change in his recommendations and opinions today after the conclusion of the testimony in this case has transpired. In other words, I'm not going to accept a consent adoption on this child because I'm not any too impressed with your husband and the current living arrangements that I've seen and heard in the testimony[. S]o you'll have to convince me that any adoption is in the best interest of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 39. As mentioned, at the time relevant to this appeal, Mississippi Code Sections 93-15-101 to 111 governed a termination-of-parental-rights proceeding. Former Section 93-15-109 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   After hearing all the evidence in regard to such petition, if the chancellor, family court judge or county court judge is satisfied by clear and convincing proof that the parent or parents are within the grounds requiring termination of parental rights as set forth in this chapter, then\n   <em>\n    the court may terminate all the parental rights of the parent or parents regarding the child, and terminate the right of the child to inherit from such parent or parents.\n   </em>\n   The termination of the parental rights of one (1) parent may be made without the parental rights of\n   the other parent, should circumstances and evidence ever so warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2093-15-109\">\n    Miss.

While there is very little Mississippi caselaw regarding the disinheritance language found in former Section 93-15-109, the apparent purpose behind it was to provide courts the authority necessary to terminate such rights where the circumstances of a particular case might warrant it.

Former Section 93-15-109 also must be read in conjunction with Mississippi Code Section 93-17-13, which this Court consistently has construed as allowing an adoptive child to inherit from both natural and adoptive parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warren v.

Thus, the public policy in Mississippi remains that adopted children are allowed to inherit from their natural parent(s) in the absence of a court decree to the contrary.

Here, there was no legitimate basis or reason whatsoever for terminating Kevin's inheritance rights at the time the February 2011 judgment was entered. Nor, as the chancery court later explained, was such termination requested in the petition for termination of parental rights, or discussed during those proceedings. The chancery court simply failed to catch the language allowing for it in the termination-of-parental-rights order drafted by Tabitha's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 46. Though understandable, we think the chancery court's decision to proceed under Rule 60(a) to correct its own error was outside the scope of what Rule 60(a) permits. While arising from an oversight by the chancery court, it was nonetheless a substantial and substantive change, which we think falls under Rule 60(b)'s provisions. Further, it was contended in the May 2015 motion to revise the February 2011 judgment that the chancery court should proceed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) and/or (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 47. Mitchell agrees on appeal that the chancery court should have proceeded under Rule 60(b), but she maintains the court was limited by Rule 60(b)(2), along with its six-month time limit, because that provision governs \"accident(s) or mistake(s).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 48. We agree with Mitchell that what occurred here was essentially a legal error. And legal errors typically fall in the category of \"mistake\" under Rule 60(b)(2). But a \"mistake\" also may constitute such a fundamental error that it may be used as the basis of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion, even though it also may fall under Rule 60(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 49. Here, the only person truly affected by the chancery court's error with the February 2011 judgment was Kevin. Mitchell was not a party to those proceedings or that judgment. Kevin was a young minor at the time of the February 2011 termination proceedings, and was still a young minor at the time the May 2015 motion to revise the February 2011 judgment was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 50. We are reminded what this Court expressed in\n   <em>\n    Alack\n   </em>\n   , when explaining why children adopted by others could inherit from a natural parent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   We have a maxim of equity that also enters the picture[.] When parties are disabled[,] equity will act for them.... Children are under the disability of minority and cannot act for themselves[; thus] the equity court will protect their rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Alack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742702\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/230/789/#p793\">\n    230 So.2d at 792-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (inner quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 51. Though Rule 60 was not at issue in\n   <em>\n    Alack\n   </em>\n   , the principle iterated there is similar to what Rule 60(b)(6) provides. As this Court has held, Rule 60(b)(6)\"is reserved for extraordinary and compelling circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Briney v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

The rule contains a \"catch-all\" provision, which has been referred to as a \"grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case when relief is not warranted by the preceding clauses [of Rule 60 ], or when it is uncertain that one or more of the preceding clauses afford relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant, Inc. v.

The dissent would reverse the chancery court's decision to revise the 2011 judgment and would render judgment denying the motion to amend because moving to amend the judgment more than four years later does not constitute a reasonable time.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 53. The dissent, of course, is correct that the finality of judgments is one of the\n   central pillars of our legal system, and that motions under Rule 60(b)(6) must be \"made within a reasonable time.\" As the dissent points out, this Court has said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   What constitutes a reasonable time must of necessity depend upon the facts in each individual case.

But for reasons explained in\n   <em>\n    Alack\n   </em>\n   , this does not change our view of the case. Because children are under the disability of minority and cannot act for themselves, our chancery courts will act for them to protect their rights.

Here, Kevin was adjudicated Travis's natural son before Travis's death. The chancery court unintentionally terminated Kevin's rights of inheritance from his natural father in a 2011 termination order. Upon discovering the 2011 judgment, counsel for Mitchell filed a supplemental motion seeking a declaratory judgment that Kevin is not Travis's heir based on the\n   chancery court's 2011 judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Lincoln County Chancery Clerk and court-appointed guardian Bishop (through counsel) petitioned the chancery court on May 29, 2015, to revise the 2011 judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) and/or (6), claiming the court had unintentionally terminated Kevin's rights of inheritance from his natural father. The motion cited\n   <em>\n    Alack.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742702\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/230/789/#p793\">\n    230 So.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 76. Again, no cause of action for an heirship determination existed until after Travis's death, at which point Mississippi's general statute of limitations period (which is now three years instead of six) began to accrue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-49\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). Within a year after Travis's death, the chancery court corrected its previous, 2011 judgment (terminating Travis's parental rights), finding that it had terminated Travis's rights of inheritance unintentionally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 77. Under the circumstances of this case, we fail to see how the chancery court's decision unfairly prejudices Mitchell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 78. At the outset, while not asserted in this case, we acknowledge that a plausible contention could be made that, by modifying its 2011 judgment to remove the disinheritance language after Travis's death, the chancery court may have frustrated Travis's wishes. In other words, if the erroneous 2011 judgment had been brought to the chancery court's attention sooner, prior to Travis's death, then Travis conceivably might have elected to dispose of his property by will or deed to exclude Kevin. This is somewhat similar to what had concerned this Court in\n   <em>\n    Knight.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9538449,9538514,9538590\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/396/31/\">\n    396 So.2d at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Katie Ruth Moore, well aware of all the facts and circumstances on which she now relies, waited, not until the actual death of Walter Knight, but for eighteen years after attaining her majority and until he was mentally dead, utterly incapable of defending himself and unable to dispose of his property by will or deed.\"). But when fully considered, such reasoning or concern ultimately shows itself to be specious in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 79. First, we point out that, had the putative daughter in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   brought her claim after the putative father's death, and had she done so after the 1981 remedial amendments to Section 91-1-15, it would have been a different case. Under that scenario, the reasoning expressed in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   would not have been contemplated. Indeed, very likely the same type of concerns expressed in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   were voiced to the Legislature following the 1981 remedial amendments, but were rejected as evinced by the 1983 preamble to this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 80. Second, no contention is made that the chancery court did not intend to terminate Kevin's inheritance rights, or that the 2011 judgment terminating Kevin's rights was not erroneous. Rather, it is contended simply that bringing the error to the chancery court's attention more than four years later does not constitute a reasonable time for purposes of Rule 60(b)(6), and this unfairly prejudices Mitchell. But how so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 81. What if Travis had passed away immediately after the 2011 judgment was entered, and the chancery court had been petitioned under Rule 60(b)(2), within six months, to correct its judgment based on \"accident or mistake.\" Were that the case, Mitchell would still stand in the same posture\n   as she does here now, which is the posture of every other intestate family member upon under the changes made to Mississippi's descent law among illegitimates under Section 91-1-15 in 1981.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6 82. Since this state's inception, children's inheritance rights have dominated those of an intestate's parents. And the Legislature fully recognized those rights in 1981 for illegitimate children, creating a cause of action for them under certain conditions that \"at the same time\" accomplish legitimate state interests.\n   <em>\n    Kimble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7647274\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/447/1278/#p1280\">\n    447 So.2d at 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 83. The disinheritance language contained in the 2011 judgment should have given pause to any reasonable person who paid attention to it, based on Mississippi law (from longstanding precedent to contemporary statutes). And any such person would have had a duty to remedy that uncertainty, which could have been done here in a number of ways. But that duty cannot be put upon Kevin in this instance, who was a young minor in 2011 and in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Alack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742702\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/230/789/#p793\">\n    230 So.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9515292\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/44/571/\">\n    44 Miss. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 84.

On February 25, 2011, the Chancery Court of Lincoln County terminated the parental rights of Travis Weems as to Kevin Moore. The order also terminated \"the rights of inheritance of and from the child.\" Four years and three months later, Tillmon Bishop moved to amend the order by striking the phrase terminating the inheritance rights. According to Bishop, Tabitha Moore never sought any relief affecting the inheritance rights of Kevin, so the phrase mistakenly was added to the order. On October 25, 2015, the chancery court granted Bishop's motion under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), which allows a trial court to correct \"clerical mistakes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss.

As to the reason for the moving party's delay, Tabitha Moore and Tillmon Bishop argue only that the motion was \"diligently and promptly\" filed once Mitchell sought to challenge the heirship proceedings in 2015. The problem, though, is that Moore's attorney prepared the 2011 order, and the guardian ad litem for Kevin reviewed and approved the order.
