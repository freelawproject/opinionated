It is not material that the County Clerk refused to deliver the weights, etc. to plaintiff on his demand; if he was entitled to their possession by virtue of his appointment, he should have taken proper steps to enforce this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
