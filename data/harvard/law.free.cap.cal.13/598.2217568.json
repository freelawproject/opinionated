Defendant appealed to the County Court, where plaintiff had verdict and judgment for the whole note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-15\">Defendant asked the Court to instruct the jury \u201c as in case of nonsuit,\u201d because plaintiff had failed to make profert of his letters of administration. The Court refused, and defendant excepted. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-16\"><em>L.

R. 483.) Nor will it interfere with a verdict on conflicting testimony.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b599-5\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AOq\">Terry, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The points of Appellant are not well taken. Pleadings in Justices\u2019 Courts are not held to much strictness. The complaint is substantially good. The plaintiff alleges that he is administrator in fact of the intestate. This is not denied in the answer. The failure to make the proof of the plaintiff\u2019s title to sue, therefore, was no ground for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">There was no consideration for the alleged agreement of extension ; paying a part of a note was not enough when all was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The only matter in controversy really was as to the credit of thirty-five dollars claimed by defendant, as to which the proof was somewhat conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">We do not see that any statement appears so authenticated as to enable us to review the testimony; for there was no motion for a new trial; but we ghotild not, under the circumstances, be disposed to interfere if a motion had been made for a new trial, and a proper statement settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
