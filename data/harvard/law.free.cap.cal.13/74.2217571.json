The balance of the averment may be rejected as surplusage. (17 Pick. 87; 14 Pick. 87; 14 Pick. 156; 12 Mass. 434.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-21\">Demurrer was not the remedy. A motion to render the corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>plaint more certain, or a plea in abatement would have been proper. (Barnes <em>v. </em>Perine, 9 Barb. 202.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-5\">A mistake in the name of plaintiff is not ground of nonsuit. (Brashear <em>v. </em>Stothard, 4 Bibb. 265; 1 Monroe, 175; Bacon Ab. Title <em>\u201c </em>Misnomer.\u201d)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-6\">P. <em>L. Edwards, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-7\">1. The demurrer of the Respondent was rightfully sustained. Plaintiffs are bound to know their own names, and to sue by them. (See Revis <em>v. </em>Lamme &amp; Brother, 2 Mo. 168.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-8\">2. The Appellants having refused to amend, and rested on their complaint and the demurrer, cannot now complain that the Court rendered final judgment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-9\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">Terry, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We do not think it was a good ground of demurrer that the Christian name of one of the plaintiffs does not appear in the record. We cannot judicially know that one of the plaintiffs had either a Christian or heathen name, or that it is necessarily untrue that he has forgotten it if he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
