About eight o\u2019clock on the morning of December 5th, 1856, plaintiff made her declaration of intention to carry on business as a sole trader. This declaration, acknowledged before a Justice of the Peace, was filed in the Becorder\u2019s office, December 29tb, 1856, and published January 18th, 1857. At nine o\u2019clock in the morning of December 5th, 1856, J. B. Wilson executed and delivered to plaintiff a bill of sale of the furniture, fixtures, liquors, etc. of a restaurant owned by him, and delivered possession of the same, which possession was retained by plaintiff until noon of that day, when defendant, Bugby, as Constable, seized them under a writ of attachment in the suit of Greenbaum &amp; Bucki <em>v. </em>Wilson. Plaintiff,' however, carried on the restaurant for about two weeks, when the property was sold by Bugby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-15\">On the trial plaintiff offered in evidence her declaration as sole trader, with the Becorder\u2019s certificate of filing, etc. indorsed; to the admission of which, defendant\u2019s counsel objected, on the ground that said declaration was recorded too late. The Court overruled the objection, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-16\"><em>W. S.

Under the Act (Wood\u2019s Dig. 489, 490, Sections 2, 3,) plaintiff did not become a sole trader until the 18th January, 1857, and hence was incapable of contracting with Wilson on December 5th, 1856, for the goods in the restaurant, and they still remained liable to execution at the suit of any creditor of Wilson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-5\">Winans, for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">The record discloses no error, nor could the defendant avail himself of it, if error there were, because he took no material exceptions, nor did he state the grounds of his motions for non-suit and new trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b44-7\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"A0XI\">Field, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">We are not satisfied, from the examination of this record, that there is any substantial error to the prejudice of the Appellant. But we cannot consider the errors assigned, except that as to the admission of the declaration of plaintiff as sole trader, which is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">1.
