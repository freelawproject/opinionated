By this affidavit he brought himself within the words of the Act of April 29th, 1857, (Acts, 317,) the second section of which provides, that \u201c duly certified copies of deeds regularly recorded upon the acknowledgment or proof of execution by the party or parties thereto, subject, however, to all legal exceptions that might be taken to the original if produced, shall be received in evidence in all the Courts of the State, without further or other proof of the execution thereof, in the same manner and with like effect, as if the originals were produced and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>proven; <em>provided, </em>it be shown that the said originals are not under the control of the party offering the said copies, or are lost,\u201d and this showing is properly made by the affidavit of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
