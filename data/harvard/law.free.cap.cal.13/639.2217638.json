J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">The plaintiff, at the time of filing his complaint, obtained from the Judge of the County Court an order of injunction to restrain the defendants from working the premises in dispute, and requiring them to appear before him at chambers, to show cause why the injunction should not be made \u201cperpetual pending the action.\u201d The County Judge dissolved the injunction, but appointed a Receiver; to which the defendant excepted, and now, by <em>certiorari, </em>brings the case here on appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">By Section 9 of Article 6 of the Constitution, it is provided that \u201c the County Courts shall have such jurisdiction in cases arising in Justices\u2019 Courts, and in special cases, as the Legislature may prescribe, but shall have no original civil jurisdiction except in such special cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">The Legislature has given (Wood\u2019s Digest, 181,) to the County Judge power to grant an injunction; but it seems that no power is given him to appoint a Receiver; certainly not as a distinct proceeding from the injunction. This would be an order, like any other in the course of a cause which the District Court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Judge might make. The statute (Wood\u2019s Digest, 185,) provides <em>\u201c </em>that a Receiver may be appointed by the Court in which the action is pending, or by a Judge thereof.\u201d We do not see where the authority for this power in the County Judge is to be found j nor that he could make an order of this sort any more than any other order, in a cause pending in the District Court, deemed necessary to the progress of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
