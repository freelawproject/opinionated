Defendant demurred: 1. That the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 2. That several causes of action were improperly united, without being separately stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-10\">Demurrer overruled, with leave to answer on payment of costs. Defendant excepted, failed to pay the costs, and final judgment was entered for plaintiffs. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-11\"><em>Stanly &amp; Kayes, </em>for Appellant, cited 1 Chitty, 337, 397; 4 Cal. 294; Archibald\u2019s Civil Pleading, 294; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>8 Cal. 619; 13 Johns. 485; 1 Greenleaf Ev. Sec. 126; 3 Meeson &amp; Wels. 606; 7 Barn. &amp; Cress, 103, to the points that the complaint contained two counts, neither of which was sufficient in itself; and that this being so, the pleader could not correct them so as to make one aid the other. To the point, that the Court could not impose costs, as a condition of answering, counsel cited Pratice Act, Sec. 67; Section 28 of an Act concerning Courts of Justice, Comp. Laws, 742.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-12\"><em>S. M.

The demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It clearly appears, from the record, that the appeal is without merit. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed, with fifteen per cent, damages and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
