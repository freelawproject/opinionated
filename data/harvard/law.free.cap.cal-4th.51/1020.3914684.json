At a combined adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile court determined that V.V. and J.H. had committed arson. The court found that, although they did not intend to set the hillside on fire, the evidence satisfied the mental state required for arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">In V.V.\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s order, finding that the evidence sufficiently established the requisite mental state of malice because V.V. deliberately and intentionally set off a firecracker on a brush-covered hill. In J.H.\u2019s case, a different division of the Court of Appeal found that the intentional act of setting off a firecracker on a brush-covered hill without intent to do harm is insufficient to establish the element of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">We conclude that under the circumstances of this case, V.V.\u2019s and J.H.\u2019s acts of intentionally igniting and throwing a firecracker amid dry brush on a hillside, although done without intent to cause a fire or other harm, were sufficient to establish the requisite malice for arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">On the afternoon of July 18, 2008, V.V. and J.H. (both 17 year olds) joined a friend to climb a steep hill located behind a residential street in Pasadena. V.V. lit a large firecracker, which J.H. threw onto the brush-covered hillside. The firecracker exploded and caused a five-acre brush fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">Abel Ramirez, a Pasadena resident, heard a \u201cvery loud explosion\u201d from his backyard patio. He immediately saw smoke rising from the hillside and saw flames several minutes later. Shortly thereafter, Ramirez saw three young men running down the hill from the fire\u2019s point of origin. The fire was rapidly spreading, coming within 60 to 75 feet of a residence. Ramirez called 911 to report the fire and described the three young men. At a field showup that day and at the adjudicatory hearing, Ramirez identified V.V. and J.H. as two of the three young men running down the hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">Ara Moujoukian, Ramirez\u2019s neighbor, heard kids laughing, yelling, and \u201chaving a good time\u201d outside his house. He heard them exclaiming \u201cWow,\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d \u201cDid you see that,\u201d and \u201cFire.\u201d Moujoukian went outside and saw three boys laughing and \u201chigh-fiving\u201d each other. When Moujoukian asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d they immediately ran away. One of the three boys \u201csmacked\u201d Moujoukian\u2019s car as he ran off. Moujoukian turned around and saw a fire on the hill behind his house. He called 911 to report the fire and gave descriptions of the three boys. At a field showup that day and at the adjudicatory hearing, Moujoukian identified V.V. and J.H. as two of the three boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Pasadena police officers responded to the 911 calls. About one-quarter mile from the scene of the fire, they saw three people matching the description of the suspects and detained them. Officer Brian Bozarth patted down V.V. and found a lighter and \u201ca large firecracker that would be described as a cherry bomb,\u201d which was about the size of a golf ball and had a fuse coming out of the top. When Officer Bozarth discovered the firecracker, V.V. declared, \u201cThat\u2019s what caused the fire.\u201d V.V. admitted that he had caused the brush fire by setting off a firecracker on the hillside. Officer Bozarth saw a gray substance on J.H.\u2019s fingers that appeared to be gunpowder from fireworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">Firetrucks arrived and climbed three-fourths of the way up the hill. The fire burned five acres of brush-covered hillside behind a housing development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">At the police station, Detective Jesse Carrillo read V.V. and J.H. their <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602]) and interviewed them separately. During the interviews, V.V. and J.H. admitted that they had been playing with firecrackers and had set the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>hillside on fire. They stated they had gone to the hill with the intention of climbing it. J.H. admitted that he had brought six firecrackers \u201cbecause we wanted to blow them up.\u201d V.V. and the third minor knew J.H. had the firecrackers with him. But the third minor did not want to participate in lighting the firecrackers because he feared that someone might get injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">V.V. acknowledged that, although J.H. brought the firecrackers to the hill, they both had the idea of lighting one. The minors stated that J.H. held the firecracker, V.V. lit it with J.H.\u2019s lighter, and J.H. threw it. V.V. stated that they tried to throw the firecracker onto a green area on the hillside. On the other hand, J. H. said he told V.V. he was going to throw the firecracker onto a concrete area. V.V. claimed that he lit the firecracker \u201c[j]ust to make a lot of noise,\u201d and that he did not think the green areas on the hillside would ignite. After the fire started, they \u201cgot kind of scared\u201d because the fire could have reached them. They then discarded the other fireworks into a sewer. The three minors ran down the hill without stopping to report the fire to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Detective Carrillo testified that the brush fire\u2019s point of origin was below the minors\u2019 position on the hillside. He stated that the concrete area J. H. said he was aiming for was even further down the hillside, about 150 yards from the fire\u2019s point of origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">The Los Angeles County District Attorney filed petitions under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 alleging that V.V. and J.H. committed the crimes of arson of a forest land (Pen. Code, \u00a7 451, subd. (c))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and recklessly causing a fire (\u00a7 452, subd. (c)). The juvenile court found that V.V. and J.H. understood what they were doing and that they knew \u201cthe natural consequence could be setting the hill on fire because they\u2019re trying to throw the thing into a patch of green or into a cement area. So they\u2019re trying to avoid setting the hill on fire.\u201d The court further found that V.V. and J.H. did not intend to set the hill on fire, but concluded that because they intentionally ignited and threw the firecracker that caused the fire, the requisite mental state for arson was met, as construed in <em>People v. Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660] <em>(Atkins). </em>The court found the arson allegation to be true, dismissed the lesser offense of unlawfully causing a fire, declared V.V. and J.H. wards of the state, and placed them on home probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">In affirming V.V.\u2019s wardship order, Division One of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, in an unpublished opinion, concluded that arson\u2019s malice requirement was met under <em>Atkins. </em>The court reasoned that \u201c[undisputed evidence established that V.V. intentionally ignited the firecracker with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>the knowledge and intent that his companion would throw the firecracker onto the hillside and it would explode amidst dry brush. This was not an accidental ignition, but a deliberate and intentional act of igniting and exploding, the firecracker \u2018under such circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of\u2019 dry brush on the hill when the firecracker exploded. <em>(People v. Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 89.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">In setting aside the arson finding in J.H.\u2019s case, Division Eight of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, in a published opinion, concluded that, under <em>Atkins, </em>the act of lighting and throwing a firecracker without the intent to do harm was not malicious conduct because it was not done with \u201can intent to do a wrongful act.\u201d The court struck the arson finding as to J.H. and modified the judgment to reflect a finding that J.H. committed the lesser offense of recklessly causing a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">We granted review in both cases to determine the correct application of <em>Atkins.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">V.V. and J.H. argue that there is insufficient evidence of malice, as defined in the arson statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 450, 451), because they lit and threw the firecracker without intent to cause a fire or any other harm. As explained below, the evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s finding that V.V. and J.H. acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">Our review of the minors\u2019 substantial evidence claim is governed by the same standard applicable to adult criminal cases. <em>(In re Muhammed C. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1325, 1328 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 21].) \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 509 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].) \u201c \u2018[O]ur role on appeal is a limited one.\u2019 [Citation.] Under the substantial evidence rule, we must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably have deduced from the evidence. [Citation.] Thus, if the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant reversal of the judgment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 913, 925, fn. 2 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 202, 209 P.3d 105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>\u201cA person is guilty of arson when he or she willfully and maliciously sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned or who aids, counsels, or procures the burning of, any structure, forest land, or property.\u201d (\u00a7 451.) \u201cWillfully\u201d is defined not in the arson chapter, but in section 7, item 1: \u201cThe word \u2018willfully,\u2019 when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted, implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act, or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d The arson chapter defines \u201cmaliciously\u201d as involving \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e).) This is the same definition as found in section 7, item 4, except for the inclusion of \u201cdefraud\u201d in section 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">In <em>Atkins, </em>we held that arson requires only a general criminal intent and that the specific intent to set fire to, bum, or cause to be burned the relevant structure or forest land is not an element of arson. In reaching that conclusion, we examined the statutory terms \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cmaliciously,\u201d and explained: \u201c \u2018[T]he terms \u201cwillM\u201d or \u201cwillfully,\u201d when applied in a penal statute, require only that the illegal act or omission occur \u201cintentionally,\u201d without regard to motive or ignorance of the act\u2019s prohibited character.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Willfully implies no evil intent; \u201c \u2018it implies that the person knows what he is doing, intends to do what he is doing and is a free agent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] The use of the word \u2018willfully\u2019 in a penal statute usually defines a general criminal intent, absent other statutory language that requires \u2018an intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 85.) Similarly, the statutory definition of \u201cmaliciously,\u201d in the context of arson, requires no specific intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 85-86.) Other language in the arson statute \u201cdoes not require an additional specific intent to bum a \u2018structure, forest land, or property\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">In <em>Atkins, </em>the defendant admitted that he poured a mixture of oil and gasoline on a pile of weeds and lit the weeds with a disposable lighter in a cleared area in a canyon that had heavy bmsh, trees, and grass. He claimed that he had been drinking most of that day. Although the prosecution presented evidence that he had previously threatened to bum down a nearby house, the defendant asserted that he meant no harm and that the resultant bmsh fire was an accident. <em>(Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 79-80.) We held that because arson is a general intent crime, evidence of voluntary intoxication was not admissible on the issue of whether the defendant formed the required mental state for arson. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 79, 84.) We stated that the arson statute does not require the intent to cause the resulting harm, but \u201crather requires only [a general] intent to do the act that causes the harm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>Here, the evidence shows that V.V. and J.H. willfully and intentionally ignited and threw a large firecracker onto the brush-covered hillside, that the firecracker exploded in the dry brush, and that the explosion caused a brush fire. Thus, the actus reus element of section 451 was met because V.V. and J.H. willfully and intentionally committed the act that \u201ccause[d] to be burned . . . forest land.\u201d (\u00a7 451.) However, V.V. and J.H. argue that their acts were not malicious. They agree that an intent to commit the resulting harm is not an element of arson, but argue there must be evidence they intended to cause a fire or some other harm or \u201cevil result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">The statutory definition of arson is derived from the common law crime of arson as a willful and malicious burning. <em>(Atkins, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 86-87.) Although \u201c[m]alice as universally understood by the popular mind has its foundation in ill-will\u201d <em>(Davis v. Hearst </em>(1911) 160 Cal. 143, 157 [116 P. 530]), it need not take the form of malevolence or ill will (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Elements, \u00a7 11, p. 213; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) Offenses Against Habitation and Occupancy, \u00a7 2, p. 275; see also <em>People v. Ah Toon </em>(1886) 68 Cal. 362, 363 [9 P. 311] [\u201c \u2018malice, in common acceptance], means ill-will against a person, but in its legal sense it means a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse\u2019 \u201d]). Malice in fact\u2014defined as \u201ca wish to vex, annoy, or injure\u201d (\u00a7 7, item 4)\u2014consists of actual ill will or intent to injure. (See <em>Davis v. Hearst, supra, </em>160 Cal. at pp. 157-158; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Elements, \u00a7 11, p. 213.) However, \u201c \u2018[t]here is still another malice, the presumption of the existence of which is raised by the law in certain cases upon certain proofs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Davis v. Hearst, supra, </em>160 Cal. at p. 158.) This type of malice\u2014malice in law\u2014is defined in section 7, item 4 as \u201can intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d (See <em>Davis v. Hearst, supra, </em>160 Cal. at p. 158; see also \u00a7 450, subd. (e).) Malice in law may be \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cimplied\u201d from the intentional doing of the act without justification or excuse or mitigating circumstances. (See <em>Davis v. Hearst, supra, </em>160 Cal. at p. 158; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Elements, \u00a7 11, p. 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">In determining whether the second type of malice (\u201cintent to do a wrongful act\u201d) is established for arson, malice will be presumed or implied from the deliberate and intentional ignition or act of setting a fire without a legal justification, excuse, or claim of right. <em>(Atkins, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 88-89; accord, <em>U.S. v. Doe </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 136 F.3d 631, 635 [common law arson]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 796, 803, fn. 3 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 884] [malice will be presumed from types of injuries (maiming) resulting from intentional acts]; <em>People v. Nunes </em>(1920) 47 Cal.App. 346, 349 [190 R 486] [same].) \u201c \u2018An intentional act creating an <em>obvious fire hazard . . . </em>done without justification . . . would certainly be malicious ....\u2019\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d at p. 635, fn. 4, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>As we stated in <em>Atkins, </em>arson\u2019s \u201cwillful and malice requirement ensures that the setting of the fire must be a deliberate and intentional act, as distinguished from an accidental or unintentional ignition or act of setting a fire; \u2018 \u201cin short, a fire of incendiary origin.\u201d \u2019 <em>(People v. Green </em>[(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 369,] 379 [194 Cal.Rptr. 128]; <em>People v.

Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d at p. 635.) \u2018Because the offensive or dangerous character of the defendant\u2019s conduct, by virtue of its nature, contemplates such injury, a general criminal intent to commit the act suffices to establish the requisite mental state.\u2019 (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Colantuono </em>[(1994) 7 Cal.4th 206,] 215 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704] [assault].) Thus, there must be a general intent to willfully commit the act of setting on fire under such circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of the relevant structure or property. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fry </em>[(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1334,] 1339 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 43]; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) Offenses Against Habitation and Occupancy, \u00a7 2, pp. 276-277; cf. <em>People v.

And, I guess, I think it does.\u201d Thus, the juvenile court found that arson\u2019s malice requirement was established in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s finding of malice. V.V. and J.H. were equal participants. Although J.H. brought large \u201ccherry bombs\u201d to the hill, both J.H. and V.V. had the idea of lighting one. J.H. held the firecracker while V.V. lit it with J.H.\u2019s lighter. J.H. then threw the ignited firecracker into dry brush on the hillside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>The juvenile court further found that, despite their intentional acts, V.V. and J.H. did not intend to set the hillside on fire and tried to avoid such a consequence. Nevertheless, the court correctly recognized \u201cthat\u2019s not the issue.\u201d V.V. and J.H. were not required to know or be subjectively aware that the fire would be the probable consequence of their acts. (See <em>U.S. v. Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d at p. 635 [common law arson does not require proof of intent to bum down building, or of knowledge this would be the probable consequence of defendant\u2019s act]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wyatt </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 776, 781 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 259, 229 P.3d 156] [defendant need not know or be subjectively aware his assaultive act is capable of causing great bodily injury]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 803, fn. 3 [\u201c[t]he second definition\u2014intent to do a <em>wrongful </em>act\u2014has never been constmed, so far as we can determine, to require knowledge by the defendant that his or her conduct violated social norms\u201d].) A defendant may be guilty of arson if he or she acts with awareness of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequence of igniting and throwing a firecracker into dry brash would be the burning of the hillside. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wyatt, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 781.) Here, V.V. and J.H. were aware of such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Although V.V. and J.H. did not intend to set the hillside on fire, they knew that their intentional acts created a fire hazard. J.H. told the police he attempted to throw the firecracker onto a concrete area on the hillside, while V.V. said they wanted to throw the firecracker onto a green area on the hillside. The juvenile court reasonably inferred that because V.V. and J.H. tried to avoid the dry brush, they knew a fire could result from setting off the large \u201ccherry bomb\u201d on the brush-covered hillside. V.V. and J.H. also told the police that the third minor did not want to participate in lighting the firecrackers because he feared that someone might get injured. Thus, the third minor alerted V.V. and J.H. beforehand to the dangers of playing with firecrackers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the concrete area was about 150 yards from the fire\u2019s point of origin and more than 150 yards away from V.V. and J.H.. A reasonable person would not have objectively believed that a firecracker thrown from V.V. and J.H.\u2019s position would reach the concrete area. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Thus, V.V. and J.H. were aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequence of throwing a lit \u201ccherry bomb\u201d from their location would be its landing in the dry brush short of the concrete area and causing a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Indeed, the record supports an inference that V.V. and J.H. were not surprised or upset that the firecracker exploded in dry brush and caused a fire. Ara Moujoukian testified that V.V. and J.H. were yelling, laughing, \u201chigh-flying,\u201d and seemingly having a good time moments after they realized the hillside was on fire.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Moujoukian asked what they were doing, V.V. and J.H. ran away and did not notify the authorities about the brush fire. These facts suggest that V.V. and J.H. did not realistically expect that the thrown \u201ccherry bomb\u201d would reach the concrete area. From the above evidence, the juvenile court reasonably inferred that V.V. and J.H. acted with malice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">V.V. and J.H. claim that the evidence supports a finding only that they had committed the offense of unlawfully causing a fire (\u00a7 452) because their conduct was reckless and resulted in an accidental fire. \u201c[T]he offense of unlawfully causing a fire covers reckless accidents or unintentional fires, which, by definition, is committed by a person who is \u2018aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>will set fire to, bum, or cause to bum a structure, forest land, or property.\u2019 (\u00a7\u00a7 450, subd.

A similar situation occurred in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d 631, which we cited with approval in <em>Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at page 88. There, a juvenile intentionally set fire to paper towels in a dispenser in the girls\u2019 bathroom of a school. With a lighter, the juvenile lit one comer of a paper towel from the dispenser, let the towel bum for a few seconds, blew out the flame, and put the burned towel in the sink. She then lit the left comer of a paper towel protrading from the dispenser, let the flame burn for a second, and blew it out. She lit the right comer of the same towel in the dispenser, blew it out, and left the bathroom. The building caught fire. An investigation revealed that the fire originated in the girls\u2019 bathroom. <em>(U.S. v. Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d at pp. 633-634, 636.) In affirming the juvenile\u2019s arson conviction, the court did not base its decision on whose paper towels were set on fire and left smoldering in the bathroom. (See dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1034.) Instead, in construing the common law definition of arson, the court reasoned that the \u201celements of willfulness and maliciousness are established by proof that the defendant set the fire intentionally and without justification or lawful excuse\u201d with \u201cno suggestion that the fire started as a result of accident or negligence.\u201d <em>(U.S. v.

In making these assertions, the dissent never recognizes that, in upholding the juvenile court\u2019s malice finding, we have applied the standard of malice as stated in <em>Atkins.

There, we stated \u201c[T]here must be a general intent to willfully commit the act of setting on fire <em>under such circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of the relevant structure or property\u201d (Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 89, italics added.)

The italicized language describes arson\u2019s malice requirement, i.e., that the willful and intentional act is committed under circumstances that create an obvious fire hazard. Thus, a willful act that causes a fire without further evidence of the underlying circumstances would be insufficient to establish malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1070-7\"> In <em>Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4tfh 76, 89, we observed that \u201creckless accidents or unintentional fires may include. those caused by a person who recklessly lights a match near highly combustible materials.\u201d Defendants argue that their conduct was more akin to this type of reckless conduct. The Attorney General responds that the affirmative acts of lighting <em>and </em>throwing a firecracker into dry brush is qualitatively different from merely lighting a match near combustible materials. She counters that more apt examples of reckless behavior would be an instance of a person who carves open a firecracker to check for gunpowder, next to a lit cigarette\u2014and it explodes in a location of obvious fire danger; or a person who lights a firecracker, but instead of throwing it, fumbles with it, and it falls on dry brush; or a farmer who bums crops on a very windy and dry day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d 631, the court compared the facts of that case to other types of conduct, such as the burning of a building caused by a smoldering cigarette butt tossed into a trash can or caused by lighted candles placed too close to drapes. The court distinguished those hypotheticals, commenting that \u201cthe present case ... is more analogous to intentionally setting fire to the drapes and then walking away in the (erroneous) belief that the fire had been blown out.

As Justice Werdegar\u2019s dissent (which I have signed) persuasively explains, the evidence is insufficient to show that V.V. and J.H. acted with malice, a necessary element of the crime of arson. Instead, they were guilty only of reckless fire setting (\u00a7 452), which is a serious crime but not so serious as arson. I write to comment on the majority\u2019s erroneous assertion that the fire started by V.V. and J.H. was not accidentally set.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">As this court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76.[104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660], California\u2019s arson statute applies only to fires that are set deliberately, not to those set <em>accidentally. </em>The statutory requirement that the defendant act willfully and with malice, we said, \u201censures that the setting of the fire must be a deliberate and intentional act, as distinguished from an accidental or unintentional ignition or act of setting a fire.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88.) By contrast, we said, the crime of reckless fire setting (\u00a7 452) \u201ccovers reckless accidents or unintentional fires [caused by] a person who is \u2018aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her act will set fire to, bum, or cause to bum a structure, forest land, or property.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Atkins, </em>at p. 89, quoting \u00a7\u00a7 450, subd. (f), 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Here, the court commissioner hearing the matter expressly found that V.V. and J.H. did <em>not </em>intend to set the fire that resulted when the cherry bomb exploded on the hillside. Nevertheless, the majority concludes: \u201cThis was not an accidental or unintentional ignition.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1032.) The majority\u2019s only explanation for that bald assertion is to say that the facts here are comparable to those of <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 136 F.3d 631 <em>(Doe), </em>a case cited with approval in <em>People v. Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at page 88. In <em>Doe, </em>a juvenile intentionally set fire to several paper towels from a dispenser in a school restroom. Although she blew out the flame, sparks remained, which eventually set the building on fire. The federal court of appeals upheld the juvenile\u2019s arson conviction, reasoning that she had acted maliciously because she \u201cset the fire intentionally and without justification or lawful excuse.\u201d <em>(Doe, supra, </em>at p. 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">But the facts here are <em>not </em>comparable to those of <em>Doe, supra, </em>136 F.3d 631. The minor in <em>Doe intentionally and illegally set fire to the school\u2019s property </em>(the paper towels) and the fire thereafter spread. Intentionally setting that fire was the illegal act that furnished the requisite malice to support the arson conviction in that case. Here, by contrast, V.V. and J.H. did not intentionally set a fire; they exploded a cherry bomb. That act, under the circumstances in which they did it, was criminally reckless, and it therefore violated section 452 (reckless fire setting). But because the fire that resulted from the explosion was accidental, they were not guilty of arson of forest land, the offense the court commissioner found them to have committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">In short, V.V. and J.H. performed three intentional acts which, in combination, resulted in the hillside being set ablaze: (1) they lit a lighter; (2) they used the lighter to light the fuse to a cherry bomb; and (3) they flung the cherry bomb down the hillside just before it exploded. The first and second of these acts were innocuous and entirely proper, assuming it was legally permissible to use fireworks in the area where they were standing (an assumption unrebutted by the record in this case); the third act was criminally reckless. But by committing the third act, V.V. and J.H. did not deliberately set a fire. Although a fire resulted from that act, that fire was an accident: As V.V. told the police officer that questioned him, they set off the cherry bomb \u201c\u25a1just to make a lot of noise.\u201d They therefore did not act maliciously, and thus were not guilty of violating section 451\u2019s subdivision (c) (arson of forest land).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1071-13\"> All statutory citations are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1072-8\">WERDEGAR, J., Dissenting.\u2014The</author>\n<p id=\"AqF\">majority opinion, in my view, comports with neither the facts nor the law. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>The minors in this case played with fireworks on the edge of the Angeles National Forest shortly after July 4th, when fireworks were plentiful and the brush was dry. Their reckless conduct would, if committed by adults, have constituted the felony of unlawfully causing a fire. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 452.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority, however, I conclude the minors\u2019 conduct did not amount to arson. (\u00a7 451.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">A person is guilty of arson when he or she \u201cwillfully and maliciously sets fire to . . . forest land . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 451.) \u201cWillfully,\u201d for all practical purposes, means nothing more than that the prohibited act was intentionally done. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76, 85 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660] <em>(Atkins).) </em>The term \u201cimplies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act ... . It does not require any intent to violate law, or to injure another . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7, par. 1.) There is no dispute that the minors \u201cwillfully\u201d\u2014 that is intentionally\u2014lit the firecracker that started the fire. In contrast, the term \u201cmaliciously\u201d imports an additional element, namely, \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The court commissioner who conducted the juvenile hearing in this case expressly found the minors did not intend to set the hillside on fire. He believed the dispositive question was simply whether \u201cthe natural and probable consequence or highly probable consequence of lighting a firecracker on a hillside and throwing it some distance away trying to hit a patch of green or a patch of cement\u201d satisfied the statutory definition of arson. (\u00a7 451.) Certainly the minors lit the firecracker \u201cwillfully\u201d the act was clearly volitional. But nothing in the record justifies the majority\u2019s conclusion the minors also lit the firecracker \u201cmaliciously.\u201d No evidence was introduced to show the minors had \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a <em>wrongful </em>act . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e), italics added.) The only evidence concerning the minors\u2019 purpose in lighting fireworks comes from their statements to police and reflects nothing more than a common youthful enthusiasm for loud noises.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had the minors lit fireworks in violation of an ordinance prohibiting them, their conduct would certainly have been \u201cwrongful,\u201d and thus malicious (\u00a7 450, subd. (e)), but the People do not claim the minors violated any such ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">The majority offers various analytical paths to the conclusion that the minors acted with malice. I find all of them unsupportable. At one point, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>majority seems to presume malice <em>\u2018from the deliberate and intentional ignition or act of setting a fire </em>without a legal justification, excuse, or claim of right.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1028, italics added.) This approach has two problems. First, the minors did not intend to set a fire at all, as the commissioner expressly held, let alone maliciously. What they intended was to explode a firecracker. The majority does not argue the minors committed arson by setting fire to <em>the firecracker, </em>as that view of the facts would implicate not the general prohibition of arson (\u00a7 451), but a different provision punishing those who set fire to their own property and thereby cause injury to forest land (\u00a7 451, subd. (d)). Second, the authority the majority offers as support <em>(Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 76, 88-89) for presuming malice under these circumstances provides no support. What we actually stated in <em>Atkins </em>is that \u201c[a]rson\u2019s malice requirement ensures that the act is \u2018done with a design to do an intentional <em>wrongful </em>act. . . without any legal justification, excuse or claim of right.\u2019 \u201d (Id., at p. 88, quoting 5 Am.Jur.2d (1995) Arson and Related Offenses, \u00a7 7, p. 786, italics added.) Malice thus requires, in addition to an intentional (i.e., volitional, willful) act, a <em>wrongful </em>one. Or, to quote the relevant California statute, \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e).) Today, the majority ignores the requirement of wrongfulness and presumes malice simply from the commission of the volitional act that causes a fire to start, thus eviscerating the statutory requirement of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Later in its opinion, trying another approach, the majority asserts the commissioner found the minors acted with malice. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1029.) Had he done so, he would on this record have erred. But in fact, the commissioner made no such finding; like the majority, he <em>presumed </em>malice simply from the lighting and throwing of the firecracker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record discloses the only aspect of the mental state required for arson to which the commissioner directed his attention was the holding of <em>Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 76, 84, that arson does not require \u201cthe specific intent to set fire to or bum or cause to be burned the relevant structure or forest land . . . .\u201d He made no effort to determine whether the minors had acted, in the words of the statute, with \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The commissioner may have proceeded as he did from a misreading of <em>Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 76, where the defendant deliberately ignited a fire in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>weeds near the house of a man he had declared he hated, resulting in the burning of an entire canyon. Rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that arson requires the specific intent to bum the relevant stmcture or forest land, thus allowing a defense of voluntary intoxication, we concluded that \u201carson requires only a general criminal intent and that the specific intent to set fire to or bum or cause to be burned the relevant stmcture or forest land is not an element of arson.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 84.) In this context of the defendant\u2019s deliberate setting of fire to weeds, which in turn ignited a canyon, we explained that \u201cthere must be a general intent to willfully commit the act of setting on fire <em>under such circumstances that the direct, natural, and highly probable consequences would be the burning of the relevant structure or </em>property.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 89, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Now embracing the commissioner\u2019s misreading of <em>Atkins, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 76, the majority describes the italicized language quoted above as \u201cdescrib[ing] arson\u2019s malice requirement . . . .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1029.) To the contrary, <em>Atkins </em>repeatedly describes the element of malice as requiring something <em>in addition </em>to the intent to commit the volitional act that starts a fire, namely, \u201c \u2018a wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Atkins, </em>at p. 85, quoting \u00a7 450, subd. (e); see also <em>Atkins, </em>at p. 88.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This additional element was present in <em>Atkins', </em>it is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The majority\u2019s effort to demonstrate the evidence in this case would have supported a finding of malice is unconvincing. First, relying on the testimony of one of the two homeowners who reported the fire, the majority states the minors \u201cwere yelling, laughing, \u2018high-fiving,\u2019 and seemingly having a good time moments after they realized the hillside was on fire.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1031.) What the majority overlooks is that the commissioner did not rely on this testimony, after the parties stipulated and the commissioner acknowledged the witness had mentioned no such behavior when interviewed by police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead of relying on disputed circumstantial evidence of the minors\u2019 mental state, the commissioner, as noted, simply presumed malice from the fact they had lit and thrown a firecracker. Second, the majority states that a third minor, who did not want to participate in lighting fireworks, had \u201cfeared that someone might get injured\u201d and thus \u201calerted V.V. and J.H. beforehand to the dangers of playing with firecrackers.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1030.) While J.H. did tell police the third minor feared someone might get hurt, the third minor mentioned injury due to <em>fire </em>only after the fire started, as part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>the minors\u2019 discussion about whether they should turn themselves in to the authorities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, the majority asserts the minors \u201cran away and did not notify the authorities about the brush fire.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1031.) This statement, too, mischaracterizes the record. The minors, who had no cell phone and no prior involvement with the criminal justice system, ran down the hill and immediately volunteered to the first officer they encountered their role in starting the fire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">In short, I find no substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of malice the arson statute requires but the commissioner failed to make. Nor, absent such evidence, can I agree with the majority that malice may be presumed simply from the doing of a volitional act that is not inherently or necessarily \u201cwrongful\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (e)) or done with \u201ca wish to vex, defraud, annoy, or injure another person . . .\u201d <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">The majority\u2019s determination the minors committed arson is particularly inappropriate in light of section 452, which the Legislature enacted in 1979 specifically to punish reckless behavior that sets fire to forest lands. Under section 452, \u201c[a] person is guilty of unlawfully causing a fire when he recklessly sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned, any stmcture, forest land or property.\u201d The term \u201crecklessly,\u201d in this context, \u201cmeans a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his or her act will set fire to, bum, or cause to bum a stmcture, forest land, or property. The risk shall be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (f).) The enrolled bill report on the legislation that became section 452 cited carelessness with fireworks as a paradigmatic example of conduct the Legislature intended to reach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See generally <em>Conservatorship of Whitley </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>1218, fn. 3 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 342, 241 R3d 840] [enrolled bill reports properly considered as evidence of legislative intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">To presume malice from nothing more than the volitional act that causes a fire to start could render every unlawful fire under section 452 also an arson under section 451. The Legislature, which we assume does not perform idle acts or enact superfluous legislation (e.g., <em>Imperial Merchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 390 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 464, 212 P.3d 736]), could not have intended this result. Evidently anxious to avoid any such logical, albeit extreme, extension of its holding, the majority offers hypothetical fire-starting scenarios to demonstrate that not all recklessly started fires will qualify as arson. I find the scenarios either contrived and implausible, as that of \u201ca person who carves open a firecracker to check for gunpowder, next to a lit cigarette\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1032, fn. 7), or practically indistinguishable from the case before us, as that of \u201ca person who lights a firecracker, but instead of throwing it, fumbles with it, and it falls on dry brush\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>To attribute special significance to the fact a firecracker is thrown, as the majority does, seems odd, because one does not ordinarily continue to hold a firecracker that is about to explode. Had the minors deliberately thrown the firecracker into dry brush, the throwing might have had special significance. But the commissioner expressly found the minors had not intended to set a fire and expressly based his ruling on the assumption they were \u201ctrying to hit a patch of green or a patch of cement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">In summary, I find the majority\u2019s reasoning and conclusion unsupportable. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-8\"> All further citations to statutes are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1073-9\"> V.V. told police that he and J.H. had lit the firecracker \u201cjust to make a lot of noise.\u201d J.H. explained he had gotten the fireworks on \u201cJuly, 4th of July.
