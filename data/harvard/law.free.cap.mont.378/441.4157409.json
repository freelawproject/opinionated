Did the District Court err by ordering Barrick pay restitution for a victim\u2019s medical bills?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">\u00b65 <em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Barrick\u2019s motion to produce records ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">\u00b66 On September 20, 2013, a jury convicted Barrick of Criminal Mischief and Cruelty to Animals for fatally shooting the family dog of Brett Tuss, Ann Tuss, and Anika Tuss (collectively, the Tuss Family). Although Barrick and the Tuss Family disagreed as to the circumstances surrounding the animal\u2019s death, Barrick acknowledges that he fatally shot the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">\u00b67 During the sentencing phase, the Tuss Family requested restitution in the amount $9,357.14 arising from the loss of the animal and attendant criminal proceedings. Their claim included the replacement cost of the dog, medical bills for Brett Tuss, lost wages for time spent by the Tuss Family cooperating in the prosecution of the offenses, and their travelling expenses associated with the prosecution of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">\u00b68 In response to the Tuss Family\u2019s restitution claim, Barrick filed a motion to produce records, seeking production of all the medical records of Brett Tuss for the last five years; federal income tax returns for Brett and Ann Tuss for the last two years; pay stubs from Ann and Anika Tuss from October 15, 2012; and a release of information to authorize Barrick to obtain Ann and Anika Tuss\u2019 employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>information. The District Court ultimately denied Barrick\u2019s motion to produce records.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b69 The District Court conducted a restitution hearing at which members of the Tuss Family testified. Brett Tuss testified to the replacement value of the dog, the loss of time he sustained by participating in the prosecution, medical bills he sustained due to the stress of losing the family dog, and traveling expenses incurred in participating in the prosecution. Ann and Anika Tuss similarly testified that they lost wages as a result of leaving work to cooperate in the prosecution of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b610 The District Court determined that Brett Tuss\u2019 medical expenses were reasonably related to the offenses committed by Barrick, and that the Tuss Family was entitled to lost wages \u201cfor time invested in participating in the prosecution.\u201d The District Court ordered that Barrick pay the entire $9,357.14 claimed in restitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding restitution to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v.

Did the District Court err by ordering Barrick pay restitution to the victims for lost wages ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b615 A sentencing court must \u201crequire an offender to make full restitution\u201d for \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d sustained by the victim. Section 46-18-241(1), MCA. Pecuniary loss is defined in \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA. Two subsections of this provision are relevant here, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(1) \u201cPecuniary loss\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(a) all special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities, including without limitation out-of-pocket losses, such as medical expenses, loss of income ... , expenses reasonably incurred in attending court proceedings related to the commission of the offense ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(d) reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the victim in filing charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Section 46-18-243(l)(a), (d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">\u00b616 Barrick contends neither subsection of \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA, allows the Tuss Family to be compensated for lost wages. Regarding subsection (d), Barrick argues that this provision, by its plain language, does not authorize restitution for <em>lost wages </em>incurred in filing charges or cooperating in the investigation or prosecution of an offense. Rather, Barrick contends that \u201c[o]ut-of-pocket expenses are just that \u2014 actual expenditures by the victim. The Tuss family had no financial expenditure when meeting with the County Attorney except a small amount of gas expense.\u201d He asserts the Tuss Family\u2019s lost wages or income are not recoverable because they are not an \u201cout-of-pocket expense.\u201d The State answers that lost wages fall \u201cwithin the ambit of compensable restitutionary losses\u201d permitted by the statute and case law, citing <em>State v. Good, </em>2004 MT 296, 323 Mont. 378, 100 P.3d 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">\u00b617 We interpret a statute by first looking to its plain language. <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003. \u201cWe will not interpret the statute further if the language is clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 11. An \u201cout-of-pocket expense\u201d is \u201c[a]n expense paid from one\u2019s own funds.\u201d <em>Bloch\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>659 (9th ed. 2009); <em>see also Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>881 (11th ed. 2012) (defining \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201crequiring an outlay of cash.\u201d); <em>SecurityComm Group, Inc. v. Brocail, </em>2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 10190,13 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. 2010) (\u201cOut-of-pocket is commonly defined as calling for the spending of cash, or consisting of or requiring an actual cash outlay.\u201d); <em>Stockton v. Oldenburg, </em>305 Ill. App. 3d 897, 903, 713 N.E.2d 259, 264 (Ill. App. Ct. 4th Dist. 1999) (Out-of-pocket expenses \u201crequire[s] an outlay of cash.\u201d). In providing restitution for \u201cout-of-pocket expenses,\u201d the Legislature authorized reimbursement of victim expenses that actually required a cash payment or outlay. The State cites our holding in <em>State v. Good </em>affirming an order of restitution for the victim\u2019s purchase of video surveillance equipment made at the urging of law enforcement, but that holding involved precisely such an out-of-pocket expense. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 18. Similarly, in <em>State v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 131, 321 Mont. 332, 91 P.3d 12, we held that the victim\u2019s rekeying of the building because of the defendant\u2019s access to the premises was an \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d loss that was compensable as restitution. <em>Thompson, </em>\u00b6 16 (overruled on other grounds, <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12 n.1, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978). These cases further illustrate the clear and unambiguous meaning of the statute\u2019s wording, which provides for recovery of victim expenses involving a cash payment or outlay. In contrast, the record here demonstrates that the lost wages at issue was income that the Tuss Family claimed it was prevented from earning, not an out-of-pocket expense. Thus, subsection (d) does not provide a basis for the recovery of the claimed wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b618 Turning to subsection (a) of \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA, the parties initially dispute how this provision \u2014 an operative definition of \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as \u201cspecial damages ... that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts\u201d of the crime, followed by a fist of examples that are \u201cinclude[ed] without limitation\u201d \u2014 is intended to be applied. Barrick argues that restitution is permissible for only those \u201ccosts a person could receive in a civil action,\u201d and that reference must be made to a civil action to determine appropriate damages or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b619 The State argues that \u201c[t]he analogy Barrick attempts to make comparing the Tusses to civil litigants pursuing civil litigation is ... flawed in its basic premise\u201d and that Barrick\u2019s assertion that \u201csubstantive civil law principles control the outcome\u201d misconstrues subsection (a). Rather, the \u201cstatute speaks to the type of damages recoverable in a criminal sentencing hearing and does not mandate tort and contract law principles\u201d be dispositive in determining what constitutes a loss. The State argues that Barrick \u201chas read the words \u2018civil action\u2019 to mean the full incorporation of civil law defenses into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>[subsection (a)].\u201d However, on this last point, the restitution statutes permit exactly that: in a proceeding to determine restitution, \u201cthe offender may assert any defense that the offender could raise in a civil action for the loss for which the victim seeks compensation.\u201d Section 46-18-244(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b620 We recently analyzed the proper application of a similar statutory structure, involving an \u201coperative definition [of\u2018enclosed public place\u2019] followed by a list of items that me intended to be included within that definition.\u201d <em>MC, Inc. v. City-County Bd. of Health, </em>2015 MT 52, \u00b6 17, 378 Mont. 267, 343 P.3d 1208. We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">The \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d language in \u00a7 50-40-103(3), MCA, incorporates other places into the statute if they, although not mentioned on the fist, also satisfy the operative definition. The expressly listed places must likewise satisfy the operative definitions in \u00a7\u00a7 50-40-103(1) and -103(3), MCA, and these provisions must be read together and interpreted accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj3\"><em>MC, Inc., </em>\u00b6 17. Likewise, the operative definition here of \u201call special damages ... that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities,\u201d must inform and be read together with the items of damage provided in the \u201cincluding without limitation\u201d fist that follows. Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b621 Our case law firmly supports this reading of the statute, as we have looked to substantive civil law to determine whether restitution awards under \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, were appropriate. Noting that the \u201cstatutes requiring restitution in a criminal sentencing are based upon damages available in a \u2018civil action,\u2019 \u201d we considered \u201cour precedent in the fields of tort and contract law\u201d to determine whether the restitution award was appropriate in <em>State v. Kalal, </em>2009 MT 103, \u00b6 9, 350 Mont. 128, 204 P.3d 1240. In <em>State v. Good, </em>we upheld an award of mortgage payments because the victim \u201ccould recover them in a civil action\u201d for assault. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 15. Likewise, in <em>State v. Essig, </em>2009 MT 340, \u00b6 21, 353 Mont. 99, 218 P.3d 838, we upheld the restitution award because the \u201cexpenses could be recovered in a civil action by the [victim] against [the defendant] and thus ... they [were] legally imposed as restitution.\u201d Conversely, in <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 20, 302 Mont. 1, 11 P.3d 539, we reversed a district court\u2019s restitution award because the victim could not recover the damages claimed in an \u201cappropriate civil action\u201d for conversion under \u00a7 27-1-320(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b622  Thus, under both the plain language of the statute and this Court\u2019s precedent, the ability of a victim to recover criminal restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>damages under \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, including items on the \u201cincluding without limitation\u201d list, such as \u201closs of income\u201d or \u201cexpenses reasonably incurred in attending court proceedings related to the commission of the oifense,\u201d is clearly contingent upon the victim being able to recover the claimed damages in a civil action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Tuss Family cannot be awarded restitution for lost wages or income unless it is demonstrated they could recover such damages in \u201ca civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting [Barrick\u2019s] criminal activities.\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b623 Given its incorrect understanding of the statute, the State oifers no authority that the Tuss Family\u2019s lost wages for attending court proceedings could be recovered in a civil action arising out of Barrick\u2019s shooting of the Tuss Family\u2019s dog. Only Barrick addresses the issue, and he offers that the appropriate civil action arising out of his shooting of the dog would be an action for conversion. He cites \u00a7 27-1-320, MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he detriment caused by the wrongful conversion of personal property is presumed to be: (a) the value of the property at the time of its conversion... and (b) a fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property.\u201d Barrick argues that this provision does not compensate for \u201cgeneral time\u201d taken by the Tuss Family to participate in the criminal litigation. Rather, the \u201ctime and money\u201d that may be compensated is only that which, as the statute states, is \u201cexpended in pursuit of the property.\u201d He cites authority for the proposition that \u201ccourts have distinguished between time spent in pursuit of converted property,\u201d which is generally compensable, \u201cand time spent in litigation,\u201d which is generally not compensable. <em>See Harwood State Bank v. Charon, </em>466 N.W. 2d 601, 605-06 (N.D. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b624 While our Opinion here may not be the last word on the subject, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>we conclude on this record that Barrick\u2019s defense to the wage claim based upon the plain wording of the statute and the authority cited regarding conversion claims, in light of the absence of cited authority to the contrary, has defeated the Tuss Family\u2019s claim for wages and income lost in attending or assisting the criminal proceedings. Therefore, we reverse the amounts awarded for their lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b625 <em>2. Did the District Court err by ordering Barrick pay restitution for a victim\u2019s medical bills?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b626 Barrick very briefly argues the District Court erred by ordering him to pay restitution for Brett Tuss\u2019 medical bills. Other than a conclusory statement that \u201c[tjhere was no causal relationship between [Brett Tuss\u2019 medical bills] and the death of the Tuss dog,\u201d Barrick offers only that no \u201cmedical issue [was] found to exist.\u201d Barrick appears to contend, not that medical expenses are unrecoverable in a civil action, but that Brett\u2019s medical bills did not \u201carisfe] out of the facts\u201d of Barrick\u2019s criminal activities under \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b627 The District Court accorded Brett\u2019s testimony great weight. Brett testified that he experienced stress related symptoms on account of the dog\u2019s death, including loss of sleep and stomach aches, Brett Tuss further testified that the stomach aches prompted him to seek treatment with a doctor and eventually undergo a colonoscopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b628  In light of Brett\u2019s testimony and the lack of contradictory evidence, we conclude that the District Court did not err by determining that Brett Tuss\u2019 medical bills arose out of Barrick\u2019s criminal conduct, and affirm the restitution ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b629 <em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Barrick\u2019s motion to produce records ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u00b630 Section 46-15-322(5), MCA, provides that upon a showing \u201cthat the defendant has substantial need in the preparation of the case for additional material or information... the court, in its discretion, may order any person to make it available to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">\u00b631 Our conclusion under Issue 1 significantly narrows this issue. A primary purpose of Barrick\u2019s request for production of documents was to allow him to effectively prepare for and cross-examine the Tuss Family regarding their claim for wages lost to attend the proceedings. Because we have reversed this award, any potential prejudice Barrick might have suffered with respect to the wage claim is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"AuM\">\u00b632 Barrick argues had he \u201cbeen allowed to obtain [Brett Tuss\u2019 medical records] he would have been able to cross-examine Brett properly and the Court would have been better informed to determine if these damages related to the death of the dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">\u00b633  Barrick\u2019s proposed discovery included very broad requests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the Tuss Family\u2019s financial and medical information. We conclude that Barrick failed to demonstrate a substantial need for such broad discovery in light of the issues raised, and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for entry of an amended judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-5\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\"> Brett Tuss was awarded lost wages or income in the amount of $2,300 and Anika Tuss was awarded $368.06. Ann Tuss was awarded $1,925, about which the District Court stated \u201cAnn\u2019s claim includes loss of income due to her participation in the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> Other state courts have interpreted substantially similar language in their respective restitution statutes to limit damages to those available in a civil action. <em>See Hampton v. State, </em>2006 WY103, \u00b6 10, 141 P.3d 101 (Wyo. 2006) (\u201cWe have previously discussed the importance on appeal of identifying a civil action under which a victim could recover based on the facts admitted by the defendant or determined by the fact-finder at trial.\u201d); <em>State v. Depaoli, </em>835 P.2d 162, 163-64 (Utah 1992) (similarly explaining statutory authority to order restitution limited to amount recoverable by victim in civil action against defendant); <em>State v. Hagen, </em>840 N.W.2d 140, 149 (Iowa 2013) (The definition of pecuniary loss \u201cindicate[s] a legislative intent that restitution to a victim dependfs] on what the victim could obtain in a civil action against the defendant.\u201d); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>193 Ore. App. 506, 511, 92 P.3d 729, 731 (Or. Ct. App. 2004) (\u201cBecause the expenses at issue are not recoverable under any theory of civil liability, the trial court lacked authority to impose restitution.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b475-6\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"AJO\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b635 I concur in the result reached by the Court, which I think is correct under the statute as presently written. However, as demonstrated by the differing interpretations that the State and the defendant apply to the language contained in \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a) and (d), MCA (hereinafter Sections 1(a) and 1(d)), the statute in its present form is hardly a model of clarity. I write separately to identify some internal inconsistencies in the statute and to suggest that it is in need of redrafting.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b636 As the Court correctly notes in \u00b6 17, an \u201cout-of-pocket expense\u201d is one in which there is an outlay of cash or funds. Section 1(d) allows recovery of \u201creasonable out-of-pocket expenses\u201d incurred in the filing of charges or in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution of the offense. I concur with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the victim must expend funds in cooperating in the investigation and prosecution before he or she may make a recovery under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u00b637 Gleaning the intent of the legislature becomes complicated, however, given its use of the alternative term \u201cout-of-pocket losses\u201d in Section 1(a). As the Court notes, this term is followed by a list of examples that are intended to be applied. Opinion, \u00b6 18. The problem is that the Section 1(a) list of examples of such \u201closses\u201d is, with one exception, a list of various cash expenditures, not \u201closses.\u201d The only exception is the inclusion of\u2018loss of income\u201d in the fist. Seemingly, an out-of-pocket loss of income, such as that specifically awarded by the District Court but rejected by the Court here, would be recoverable under this provision, as it is a \u201closs\u201d rather than an expenditure. However, as the Court observes, that recovery is defeated by the fact that such a loss would not be recoverable in a civil action arising out of the events constituting Barrick\u2019s particular criminal activity here.</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">\u00b638 By using the similar yet differently defined terms \u201cout-of-pocket losses\u201d and \u201cout-of-pocket expenses\u201d within the statute, and then following those terms with inconsistent examples, the legislature has unduly confused the question of what should and should not be recoverable by a victim under the statute. The statute has been amended on numerous occasions since 1983, with additional language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>and examples having been added, no doubt contributing to the present confusion. The legislature could rectify this uncertainty by amending the statute to appropriately distinguish between the \u2018losses\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d that are recoverable followed by appropriate examples, and by clearly delineating which items of loss are tethered to what the victim could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the events constituting the criminal activities, and which items are not. Because the statute as presently written is internally contradictory in this regard, revision is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b639 With these caveats, I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
