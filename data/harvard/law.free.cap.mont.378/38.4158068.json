We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b62 The issue presented for review is whether the Montana State Hospital had a statutory duty to warn Catherine Woods of the risk of violent behavior by her former boyfriend, Justin Schiller.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">\u00b63 On June 13, 2008, Schiller was involuntarily committed to the Montana State Hospital (MSH). Schiller had been found unresponsive in his home the previous day after drinking heavily and ingesting the pain medication Percocet, which he had been prescribed for a lower-back injury. Schiller also expressed to his girlfriend, Catherine, a desire to kill himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Schiller had a long history of depression and had previously experienced anxiety, panic, and incidents of self-harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u00b64 Schiller was released from MSH 12 days later, on June 25,2008. On July 23,2008, Schiller purchased a handgun. His relationship with Catherine ended sometime after his release from MSH. On November 21, 2008, Schiller saw Catherine at the Golden Spur Sports Bar &amp; Casino in Miles City with a male acquaintance. Schiller was consuming alcohol at the time. When Catherine and her companion left the bar, Schiller followed them. He assaulted Catherine\u2019s companion and fired multiple shots at Catherine\u2019s vehicle as she attempted to drive away. One of the shots struck Catherine in the neck, killing her. Schiller later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b65 Catherine\u2019s parents, Sonja and William Woods, filed a complaint alleging that MSH had a statutory duty, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA, to warn Catherine of the risk of violent behavior by Schiller. On November 9,2011, the State moved for summary judgment, claiming that Schiller never communicated any specific threat of violence against Catherine during his commitment, and therefore, MSH had no duty to warn Catherine or take precautions for her protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b66 The evidence before the District Court at the summary judgment stage indicates that Dr. Daniel Nauts evaluated Schiller upon his admission to MSH. During that evaluation, Schiller admitted to Dr. Nauts that his alcohol use was \u201ca serious problem.\u201d Schiller acknowledged that while drinking, he sometimes became aggressive toward Catherine. In a subsequent deposition, Dr. Nauts stated that he believed Schiller was referring to verbal, rather than physical, aggression. Schiller also acknowledged \u201cproblems with his temper and anger control\u201d that were exacerbated by drinking. Dr. Nauts concluded that Schiller presented a \u201c[h]igh risk of lethality with acute alcohol intoxication,\u201d and that his personality changed under the influence of alcohol, resulting in aggressive behavior. Dr. Nauts further stated that loss of Schiller\u2019s relationship with Catherine could lead to \u201chigh-risk behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b67 Schiller was also interviewed by Jody Parrott five days after his admission to MSH. During that interview, Schiller acknowledged that his alcohol use was a problem, but he appeared \u201cambivalent or reticent to let go of it.\u201d Schiller again admitted being aggressive toward Catherine when intoxicated. Parrott noted Schiller\u2019s \u201chistory of violence towards others and himself (suicidal gestures and attempts) during periods of intoxication.\u201d Parrott also noted that loss of Schiller\u2019s relationship with Catherine \u201ccould result in continued high-risk behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b68 In Schiller\u2019s MSH discharge summary, Dr. Nauts observed that although Schiller was initially \u201creticent\u201d to address his alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>dependence, he had \u201crealized the incredible lethality of intoxication for him\u201d and was planning to follow through on outpatient treatment. Dr. Nauts concluded that \u201cFrom a motivational standpoint this patient clearly gained from his brief stay.\u201d His final diagnosis included the notation, \u201cAlcohol Induced Mood Disorder with intoxication with suicidal behavior, resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b69 In his deposition, Dr. Nauts acknowledged that Schiller had a history of violent behavior, and that his violence was directly related to his substance use. At the time of Schiller\u2019s discharge, Dr. Nauts believed Schiller was sincere in his intention to abstain from alcohol and continue in outpatient treatment. Dr. Nauts also stated that during the course of treatment at MSH, it is common for a social worker to contact family members of the patient. Dr. Nauts said he had never spoken with Catherine, but he believed Schiller\u2019s social worker, Ben Bornerman, had. In his deposition, Bornerman said he had contacted Schiller\u2019s father to corroborate background information, but had never contacted Catherine. Bornerman also said he was on vacation the day Schiller was discharged from MSH.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b610 The Woodses retained an expert witness, Kathleen Cullen, who intended to testify that MSH should have warned Catherine of the threat posed by Schiller because he admitted past aggression toward Catherine, was low-functioning upon release, and had an inadequate plan to refrain from high-risk behavior. Cullen concluded that \u201ca reasonable and prudent mental health care provider\u201d would have determined that \u201can actual threat of physical harm to [Catherine] existed in the event their relationship ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b611 The Woodses also relied on two additional evaluation forms, neither of which clearly identifies the date of preparation or the person or organization responsible. On one form, titled \u201cReadiness to Change,\u201d Schiller listed his relationship and \u201cfear of losing girlfriend\u201d as one of the five most significant things he would like to address while in treatment. Based upon representations by the parties, the District Court concluded this form was completed while Schiller was at MSH. The other form, which the District Court concluded was prepared by Dr. Susan Mattocks at Holy Rosary Healthcare in Miles City prior to Schiller\u2019s commitment and was never provided to MSH, notes \u201cescalating violence (physical x2)\u201d under the heading \u201cRecent changes in current relationship status.\u201d Dr. Mattocks is not associated with MSH and there is no evidence that MSH personnel were aware of this document. The form was apparently provided to the Woodses by Dr. Mattocks, who was previously dismissed from this lawsuit, during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u00b612 Based upon this record and following a summary judgment hearing, the District Court concluded that the Woodses had failed to establish a prima facie case against MSH for breach of its duty to warn, because \u201cno threat was made to any MSH staff member of future physical violence nor was a specific means of violence relayed.\u201d The District Court concluded, \u201cAbsent a communication relating to future violence there can be no duty imposed under the statute.\u201d The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and MSH. The Woodses appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court. <em>Gudmundsen v. State, </em>2009 MT 56, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 297, 203 P.3d 813. Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56; <em>Gudmundsen, </em>\u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Gudmundsen, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the Montana State Hospital had a statutory duty to warn Catherine of the risk of violent behavior by Schiller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b615 Section27-l-1102,MCA,states:\u201cAmentalhealthprofessionalhas a duty to warn of or take reasonable precautions to provide protection from violent behavior only if the patient has communicated to the mental health professional an actual threat of physical violence by specific means against a clearly identified or reasonably identifiable victim.\u201d The Woodses claim MSH had a duty under \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA, to warn Catherine that Schiller could behave violently if their relationship ended and if Schiller was drinking alcohol. They argue that a mental health professional is required to exercise his or her specialized knowledge and skills in determining when communications by the patient may indicate that he or she poses a threat to another individual. The Woodses claim Schiller\u2019s admitted past aggression against Catherine and the possibility of continued high-risk behavior was sufficient to put a reasonably skillful mental health professional on notice of the danger Schiller presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">\u00b616 The State responds that the plain language of \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA, establishes a narrow duty, requiring communication of an actual threat of physical violence by specific means. The State argues the Woodses\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>interpretation disregards this plain language, and instead imposes a \u201creasonably prudent\u201d standard not contemplated by the statute. The State claims there is nothing in the record demonstrating that Schiller communicated to MSH personnel an actual threat of physical violence by specific means against Catherine.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b617 Section 27-1-1102, MCA, was enacted in 1987 in response to legal developments occurring in other jurisdictions, notably the decision of the California Supreme Court in <em>Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, </em>551 P.2d 334 (Cal. 1976). <em>Gudmundsen, </em>\u00b6 18. In <em>Tarasoff, </em>the California Supreme Court held, \u201conce a therapist does in fact determine, or under applicable professional standards reasonably should have determined, that a patient poses a serious danger of violence to others, he bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim of that danger.\u201d 551 P.3d at 345. <em>Tarasoff </em>was later narrowed by <em>Thompson v. County of Alameda, </em>614 P.2d 728, 738 (Cal. 1980), which held that the duty to warn was established only where a threat existed against \u201ca named or readily identifiable victim or group of victims who can be effectively warned of the danger ... .\u201d Statutes passed in response, like Montana\u2019s, may be narrower yet, requiring communication of an actual threat of physical violence against a named or reasonably identifiable victim. <em>See, e.g., Gudmundsen, </em>\u00b6 21 <em>;DeVasier v. James, </em>278 S.W.3d 625, 632 (Ky. 2009); <em>Robinson v. Mount Logan Clinic, </em>182 P.3d 333, 335 (Utah 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b618  In <em>Gudmundsen, </em>\u00b6 31, we held that the duty established by \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA, is \u201cextremely narrow.\u201d The duty to warn exists only where, according to the plain language of the statute, there exists proof of (1) an actual threat of physical violence, (2) by specific means, (3) against a clearly identified or reasonably identifiable victim. <em>Gudmundsen, </em>\u00b6 31. Thus, in In <em>re Mental Health of M.C.D., </em>2010 MT 15, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 97, 225 P.3d 1214, we considered a man\u2019s statement that he would kill his wife with his bare hands if she ever called the police to constitute an actual threat of physical violence by specific means against an identified victim. Our analysis in <em>Gudmundsen </em>and <em>M.C.D. </em>is consistent with statements of the Kentucky Supreme Court, construing similar statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-z\">[W]e believe the legislature intended to require a current, active expression, by words or gestures, verbal or non-verbal, to the professional; a threat capable of avoidance, not a mere passive presence from which the professional must attempt to discern if a patient poses a threat of harm. ... Simply <em>being </em>a threat of physical violence does not constitute communicating a threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>physical violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><em>DeVasier, </em>278 S.W.3d at 632 (emphasis in original). We agree that \u201cbeing\u201d a threat generally of committing physical violence does not satisfy the statutory criteria of communicating an actual threat of physical violence by specific means. Absent a specific expression or gesture against a reasonably identifiable victim, the duty to warn is not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b619  The District Court correctly concluded that nothing in the record establishes that Schiller communicated to personnel at MSH an actual threat of physical violence by specific means against Catherine. The fact that he may have presented a potential danger to Catherine under certain circumstances, including his continued alcohol abuse and the end of their intimate relationship, is not sufficient to trigger the statutory duty to warn. Section 27-1-1102, MCA, does not impose upon mental health professionals a broad duty to infer, investigate, or otherwise deduce whether their patients may pose a potential threat to other individuals. Although the Woodses urge this Court to apply general common law principles of foreseeability, similar to those recognized by the California Supreme Court in <em>Tarasoff, </em>the Legislature rejected this approach when it adopted \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA. \u201cIn this state there is no common law in any case where the law is declared by statute.\u201d Section 1-1-108, MCA. The law applicable in this case is plainly declared by \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA. The Woodses have failed to present evidence establishing the requirements of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b620  A mental health professional has a duty to warn only where the narrow requirements of \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA, are satisfied because the patient has communicated an actual threat of physical harm by specific means against a clearly identified or reasonably identifiable victim. The record contains no evidence that an actual, specific threat was communicated in this case. The State is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the District Court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of the State and MSH.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-12\"> There are differing accounts of the nature and extent of Schiller\u2019s relationship with Catherine. While Schiller reported to persons at MSH that he had been in a supportive relationship with Catherine for eight months, the Woodses allege that Schiller was merely \u201cinappropriately infatuated\u201d with Catherine, and that she tried to put an end to the relationship early on.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
