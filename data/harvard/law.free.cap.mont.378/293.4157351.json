We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>1. Whether Citizens was denied its right under Montana\u2019s open meeting laws to participate in an executive session held by the City Commission.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by declining to void the City\u2019s decision to present an offer letter to a candidate for city manager.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court improperly determined facts in a summary judgment proceeding without an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the case.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">\u00b63 In the spring of 2013, the City began the process of hiring a new city manager. Between April and September 2013, the City Commission held several public meetings during which it discussed the search for a city manager and gave the public opportunities to comment. The Commission narrowed down the applicants for city manager to five finalists.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">\u00b64 In August 2013, the City announced that there would be a community \u201cmeet and greet\u201d on September 11, during which the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>would have the opportunity to speak to the five finalists and fill out comment cards. The comment cards would be given to the search committee, a body of non-commissioners selected by the Commission at a public meeting in April. The mayor encouraged the public to attend the event. The City also published a press release, providing information about the meet and greet and a link to the city website containing biographical information for the five finalists. The press release was picked up by several local news sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u00b65 On September 12, the Commission held a public interview with the candidates. Commissioners asked each candidate several questions, after which the public had an opportunity to comment. On the same day, the search committee and an employee interview panel conducted two interviews that were not open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b66 The Commission\u2019s September 12 public meeting agenda listed a closed executive session with the description, \u201cPERSONNEL-MEET WITH INTERVIEW PANELS AND DELIBERATE ON SELECTION OFCITYMANAGER.\u201d At least three persons associated with Citizens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> objected to the executive session because they felt it violated Montana open meeting laws. The Commission proceeded with the executive session over Citizens\u2019 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b67 On September 13, the mayor and city manager candidate Mark Shrives signed an offer letter for the position of city manager. At a public meeting on September 16, the Commission voted to authorize the mayor to negotiate and conclude a final bargain with Shrives within the parameters of the offer letter, subject to the Commission\u2019s final approval of an employment contract. The mayor stated that all three interview panels had come back with the same top candidates. During public comment, a member of Citizens asked whether the public would have the opportunity to review a contract or offer input on it before finalization. The mayor responded that the contract would be attached to the meeting agenda when it was brought to the Commission for a vote. Another member of Citizens indicated displeasure that the September 12 executive session was closed to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b68 At a public meeting on September 20, the Commission unanimously voted to approve the city manager employment contract negotiated by the mayor. At the beginning of the meeting, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>commissioners provided copies of a contract signed by Shrives to attending members of the public. The mayor also explained changes to a draft that previously was distributed and posted on the city website. Members of Citizens inquired about the changes and asked for clarifications, after which the Commission voted to approve the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b69 Citizens brought suit on October 15, 2013, contending that the September 12 executive session violated Citizens\u2019 right to participate under the Montana Constitution and Montana statutory law. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. By order entered July 31, 2014, the District Court rejected the City\u2019s argument that Citizens lacked standing to file its complaint. The court denied Citizens\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment and ruled in favor of the City on the merits of Citizens\u2019 claims, declining to void the Commission\u2019s decision to present Shrives with an offer letter. Citizens appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Bailey v. St. Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Smith v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>City of Missoula v. Iosefo, </em>2014 MT 209, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 161, 330 P.3d 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b611 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s determination whether to void a decision made in violation of Montana\u2019s open meeting laws. <em>Motta v. Philipsburg Sch. Bd. of Trs., </em>2004 MT 256, \u00b6 21, 323 Mont. 72, 98 P.3d 673; <em>Common Cause v. Statutory Comm\u2019n to Nominate Candidates for Comm\u2019r of Political Practices, </em>263 Mont. 324, 334, 868 P.2d 604, 610 (1994). A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 421, 133 P.3d 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u00b612 Citizens challenges the Commission\u2019s closure of its September 12 executive session, during which the Commission discussed the five finalists for city manager. The District Court determined, without deciding, that, even if the executive session violated open meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>laws, any violation did not justify voiding the contract. The court emphasized that the decision to hire Shrives was subject to final approval by the Commission, and that the Commission held two subsequent public meetings during which it voted to authorize the mayor to negotiate with Shrives and voted to approve the final contract. The court noted that public comments were taken during both of those meetings, and that the public had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to participate leading up to the final hiring decision. Ultimately, the court concluded that \u201c[vloiding the decision to offer a contract to Shrives would, at this point, serve no substantial public purpose\u201d and declined to exercise its discretion to void the hiring decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b613 Citizens argues that the District Court abused its discretion by not voiding the Commission\u2019s decision to hire a new city manager after the public was denied the right to observe and participate in the Commission\u2019s deliberations and decision. Citizens also argues that the District Court erred in determining facts without an evidentiary hearing and in basing its decision in favor of the City on those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"Ady\">\u00b614 <em>1. Whether the public had the right to participate in the Commission\u2019s September 12 executive session under Montana\u2019s open meeting laws.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b615 A government agency must afford citizens a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to participate before the agency makes a final decision. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 8. The public has the right to observe deliberations of public bodies \u201cexcept in cases in which the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 9. Montana\u2019s open meeting statutes, codified at \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-201 through -221, MCA, implement these rights. <em>Common Cause, </em>263 Mont. at 329, 868 P.2d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b616 The law requires all meetings of public or governmental bodies to be open to the public. Section 2-3-203(1), MCA. A meeting is \u201cthe convening of a quorum of the constituent membership of a public agency or association ... , to hear, discuss, or act upon a matter over which the agency has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power.\u201d Section 2-3-202, MCA. The statute provides exceptions for discussions relating to a matter of individual privacy, discussions of litigation strategy, and judicial deliberations. Sections 2-3-203(3) through (5), MCA. Unless the individual about whom the discussion pertains waives his or her privacy right, the meeting may be closed \u201cif and only if the presiding officer determines that the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Section 2-3-203(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b617  There is no question that the above statutes apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Commission and to its September 12 executive session. <em>See Bd. of Trs. v. Bd. of Cnty. Commr\u2019s, </em>186 Mont. 148, 155, 606 P.2d 1069, 1072 (1980) (applying Montana\u2019s open meeting laws to a closed meeting of county commissioners). Although the city manager candidates acknowledged that they would be interviewed in an open public session, they did not waive their privacy interest for any other purpose. Neither party submitted evidence that the presiding officer determined \u201cthat the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d The Commission should have made that determination before closing the executive session to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by declining to void the Commission\u2019s decision to present an offer letter to Shrives.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8b\">\u00b619 A district court has discretion to void a decision made in violation of Montana open meeting laws. Section 2-3-213, MCA (\u201cAny decision made in violation of 2-3-203 <em>may </em>be declared void by a district court having jurisdiction.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Motta, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b620 Although \u201cvoiding a decision by a public entity for failure to comply with open meeting laws may sometimes be an appropriate remedy,\u201d <em>Allen v. Lakeside Neighborhood Planning Comm., </em>2013 MT 237, \u00b6 24, 371 Mont. 310, 308 P.3d 956 (distinguishing <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone Cnty. Elementary Sch. Dist. No. </em>2, 2002 MT 264, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381), we have held that a district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to void action taken at a closed meeting when the governing body allowed subsequent opportunities for public comment on the decision, <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Zunski v. Frenchtown Rural Fire Dep\u2019t Bd. of Trs., </em>2013 MT 258, \u00b6 17, 371 Mont. 552, 309 P.3d 21, or when the decision made during the executive session was subject to further review before becoming final, <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Common Cause, </em>263 Mont. at 333, 868 P.2d at 610. The District Court, citing these authorities, concluded that both circumstances were present here.</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">\u00b621 In <em>Allen, </em>we upheld a district court\u2019s discretionary determination that voiding a neighborhood plan, adopted by a planning committee, was not an appropriate remedy for the committee\u2019s failure to hold public meetings for several months at the beginning of its planning process. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 32. In reaching our decision, we reasoned that the public had ample opportunity to participate in subsequent meetings, after the committee realized it was subject to Montana\u2019s open meeting laws and before the final plan was adopted. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b622 Similarly, in <em>Zunski, </em>we held that the Frenchtown Rural Fire Department Board of Trustees\u2019 decision to create an interim fire chief position and hire a specific person for that position, made during a closed meeting, was cured when the Board readopted the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>action in a meeting that \u201ccomplied with the open meeting and right to participate laws.\u201d <em>Zunski, </em>\u00b6 17. We therefore concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to void the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Zunski, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b623 The District Court in this case found that, during the September 12 executive session, the Commission decided to present an offer letter to Shrives. Before any contract was finalized, however, the public had the opportunity to comment on the Commission\u2019s decision on two separate occasions \u2014 the September 16 meeting during which the Commission authorized the mayor to negotiate and conclude a final bargain with Shrives, and the September 20 meeting during which the public was invited to read and comment on the contract signed by Shrives.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b624  Furthermore, the offer letter presented to Shrives explicitly stated that any contract he signed would be subject to final approval by the Commission. That approval came at the September 20 open meeting, following an opportunity for public comment. We adhere to our reasoning in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Common Cause </em>\u2014 in both cases, a district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to void a decision that violated Montana\u2019s open meeting laws but was subject to final review and consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b625 We emphasized in <em>Allen </em>that the public had opportunities to comment after the committee had met privately to discuss initial drafts of a neighborhood plan. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 25. We also noted that the neighborhood planning board\u2019s recommendation to adopt the plan was subject to review by the county commissioners, who were not bound to accept the recommendation. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 28. Because the commissioners could have rejected the board\u2019s recommendation, we agreed with the district court that voiding the commissioners\u2019 adoption of the neighborhood plan was not an appropriate remedy. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 30. We cited <em>Common Cause, </em>in which we held that a district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to void a legislative committee\u2019s decision to compile a list of candidates for the position of Commissioner of Political Practices, despite the committee\u2019s violation of Montana\u2019s open meeting laws. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-29 (citing <em>Common Cause, </em>263 Mont. at 330-33, 868 P.2d at 607-09). We reached our conclusion in <em>Common Cause </em>based on the fact that the committee\u2019s list of candidates was subject to review by the governor, who was not bound by the list in making his final decision. <em>Common Cause, </em>263 Mont. at 332, 868 P.2d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b626  The Commission did not hire Shrives as the new city manager until it adopted his employment contract following two additional open, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>public meetings after the September 12 executive session. At the time of the District Court\u2019s ruling, Shrives had been the city manager for nearly a year. The offer letter indicates that the contract is for a two-year term, which expires in September 2015. Presumably, there will be a new opportunity for public input at that time. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to void the Commission\u2019s decision to present an offer letter for the position of city manager to Shrives, even though the Commission did not make a privacy determination before closing its executive session.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b627 <em>3. Whether the District Court improperly determined facts in a summary judgment proceeding without an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b628 In Montana, \u201c[t]he right to a hearing is waived unless a party requests a hearing within 14 days after the time for filing a reply brief has expired.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Citizens contends that the District Court impermissibly relied on facts without holding an evidentiary hearing and based its finding that the public had ample opportunities to participate on incorrect facts. However, Citizens waived any right to an evidentiary hearing by not requesting one under Rule 56(c)(2). Moreover, the record reveals no genuine dispute of material fact on this point. Minutes from public Commission meetings indicate that the public did in fact have two opportunities to comment on the decision to hire Shrives as city manager before the Commission voted unanimously to approve the employment contract: at the end of the September 16 public meeting and before the Commission\u2019s vote on September 20. Whether members of the public actually used those opportunities to discuss the candidates does not call into question the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b629  The City of Poison took considerable steps to conduct its hiring process in an open and transparent maimer. The Commission did not comply with the open meeting laws, however, when it closed its executive session without first determining that the demands of individual privacy clearly exceeded the merits of public disclosure. Because the Commission did not finalize its hiring decision until it held two additional open, public meetings, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to void the Commission\u2019s decision to present an offer letter for the position of city manager to Shrives.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b630 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-9\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> Citizens describes associated persons as either \u201cmembers\u201d or \u201cassociates,\u201d but does not clearly distinguish the two terms.
