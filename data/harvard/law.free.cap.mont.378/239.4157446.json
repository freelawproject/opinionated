Her parental rights to J.T., A.T., and R.T. were terminated on February 25, 2013. I.T. was bom soon thereafter, in May 2013. Mother admitted to using opiates, benzodiazepam, and marijuana during her pregnancy with I.T. and to using marijuana a short time following I.T.\u2019s birth. Shortly after birth, I.T. was placed in a neonatal intensive care unit at Kalispell Regional Medical Center for drug withdrawal treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b64 On June 5, 2013, while I.T. was in the hospital, Mother was arrested for a probation violation. Mother was subsequently sentenced to the Department of Corrections for five years. She was placed at the Elkhorn Treatment Center and remained there through the District Court proceedings in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\u00b65 On June 11, 2013, while I.T. remained in the hospital, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (the Department) petitioned for emergency protective services. This petition was granted on June 17, 2013. On October 22, 2013, following an investigation by the Department and a hearing, the District Court determined that I.T. was a Youth in Need of Care. The court temporarily transferred legal custody of I.T. to the Department, and I.T. was placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">\u00b66 On January 30, 2014, following a motion by the Department and a hearing, the District Court ordered that the Department did not need to provide preservation or reunification services for Mother. It found that Mother\u2019s parental rights to I.T.\u2019s siblings were involuntarily terminated and that the conditions rendering Mother unfit in that termination proceeding were unlikely to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u00b67 On May 27,2014, after several subsequent hearings, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to I.T. It reasoned that \u201cthe circumstances related to the [previous] termination of parental rights [we]re relevant to [Mother\u2019s ability to adequately care for I.T.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u00b68 Mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for abuse of discretion. <em>In re L.N., </em>2014 MT 187, \u00b6 12, 375 Mont. 480, 329 P.3d 598. To satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>terminating parental rights, a district court must make specific factual findings. <em>In re T.S.B., </em>2008 MT 23, \u00b6 18, 341 Mont. 204, 177 P.3d 429. We review findings of fact for clear error. <em>L.N., </em>\u00b6 12; <em>T.S.B., </em>\u00b6 18. We review conclusions of law for correctness. <em>L.N., </em>\u00b6 12; <em>T.S.B., </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated the parental rights of Mother?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b611 If a court determines that a child is abused or neglected, it may terminate the parental rights of the child\u2019s parents. Section 41-3-602, MCA; <em>In re J.W., </em>2013 MT 201, \u00b6 26, 371 Mont. 98, 307 P.3d 274; <em>see T.S.B., </em>\u00b6 43. Sections 41-3-601 through -612, MCA, provide the \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d by which such termination may be made. Section 41-3-602, MCA; <em>J.W., </em>\u00b6 26. According to these statutes, parental rights can be terminated if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the parent previously had her parental rights to other children involuntarily terminated under circumstances relevant to her ability to adequately care for the child in question. Sections 41-3-423(2)(e) and -609(l)(d), MCA; <em>L.N., </em>\u00b6 23; <em>T.S.B., </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b612 In this case, while Mother does not contest the District Court\u2019s findings that I.T. was abused and neglected or that her parental rights to her other children had been involuntarily terminated, she contends that there was not substantial evidence for the District Court to find that the circumstances of the past terminations were relevant to her ability to care for I.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b613 We have determined that \u201c[cjircumstances surrounding previous involuntary terminations remain \u2018relevant,\u2019 \u2018unless the circumstances have changed.\u2019 <em>\u201dJ.W., </em>\u00b6 39 (quoting <em>In re A.P., </em>2007 MT 297, \u00b6 30, 340 Mont. 39, 172 P.3d 105; <em>In re K.J.B., </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 36, 339 Mont. 28, 168 P.3d 629). We reasoned that \u201ca parent is not to be afforded multiple chances to remedy the same problems at the expense of an abused or neglected child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>J. W., </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b614 Here, the District Court\u2019s finding that Mother\u2019s previous unfit behavior had not changed was not clearly erroneous. It was supported by substantial evidence contained in the record. The previous termination was based primarily on Mother\u2019s chemical dependency. During the hearing in the present case, the District Court heard evidence that Mother had not fully addressed these issues. Mother admitted to using various drugs while pregnant with I.T. and to smoking marijuana shortly after I.T.\u2019s birth. Additionally, while there was evidence that Mother had taken steps to address these issues while incarcerated, Mother testified that she had \u201cprobably not\u201d addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>her issues sufficiently to overcome the risks of abuse and neglect if I.T. was returned to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b615  Given such evidence, the District Court\u2019s determination that Mother\u2019s previous terminations were relevant to the present case was supported by substantial evidence. It was, therefore, not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when, relying on the previous terminations, it terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to I.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b616 Mother also argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe conduct or condition of [Mother] is unlikely to change within a reasonable time\u201d was not supported by substantial evidence. This finding of fact, while relevant to terminating parental rights under the authority of \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, was not necessary to terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights under \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and -423(2)(e), MCA. <em>See L.N., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-25; <em>T.S.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-48. As our decision regarding the District Court\u2019s termination using the latter set of statutes is dispositive, we do not consider this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b617 <em>2. Did the District Court err by considering hearsay evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b618 Mother contends that the District Court should not have considered hearsay evidence indicating that she tested positive for cocaine shortly before giving birth. In particular, she argues that her medical records and the testimony concerning the drug test should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b619 Assuming arguendo that this argument was properly preserved for appeal and that neither item of evidence was admissible, we are not persuaded that such an error requires reversal of the District Court\u2019s order. Instead, even if we disregard the District Court\u2019s finding that Mother \u201ctested positive for cocaine,\u201d the District Court\u2019s finding that the previous termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights was relevant to the present case was still supported by substantial evidence. The evidence that Mother used various drugs while pregnant with I.T. and smoked marijuana following I.T.\u2019s birth, and Mother\u2019s admission that her improvement was \u201cprobably not\u201d enough would still be admissible and, as discussed above, provide substantial evidence for the District Court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination. Any error was harmless and the District Court\u2019s order should not be disturbed on this ground. <em>See In re </em>M.W., 2004 MT 301, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 323 Mont. 433, 102 P.3d 6 (disregarding findings of fact supported by inadmissible evidence and concluding that substantial evidence remained to support the district court\u2019s decision to terminate the appellant\u2019s parental rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\u00b620 <em>3. Are there equitable grounds upon which relief from the District Court\u2019s order should be granted?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u00b621 Mother argues that the Department should have been required to provide her with a treatment plan. The reasoning she provides is vague and incoherent, but based on some notion of \u201cequitable estoppel.\u201d As an initial matter, we note that there is no absolute right to a treatment plan. The Legislature has specified that a treatment plan need not be provided if, for example, the parent has \u201chad parental rights to the child\u2019s sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to the parent\u2019s ability to adequately care for the child at issue.\u201d Sections 41-3-423(2)(e), -609(l)(d), -609(4)(a), MCA; sec <em>In re E.Z.C., </em>2013 MT 123, \u00b6 21, 370 Mont. 116, 300 P.3d 1174 (holding that, consistent with \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(a), MCA, a treatment plan need not be provided if the parent has subjected a child to one of the circumstances in \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a) through (2)(e), MCA). Here, as discussed above, the District Court found that the past termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights was relevant to her ability to care for I.T. By the terms of the statute, therefore, a treatment plan was not required. Mother provides no reason why equity demands an exception to the statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">\u00b622 Mother makes several other statements that the State should have been equitably estopped from making certain arguments. Beyond conclusory statements, however, Mother provides no reasoning for why such relief should be granted. We are not required to perform legal research or make arguments on a party\u2019s behalf. E.g., <em>State v. Redlich, </em>2014 MT 55, \u00b6 22, 374 Mont. 135, 321 P.3d 82. Moreover, there is no indication that Mother was wrongfully prejudiced by any of the Department\u2019s actions. There is also no indication that Mother was otherwise treated unfairly. For these reasons, we will not disturb the District Court\u2019s decision on equitable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b623 The District Court did not abuse its discretion by terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights to I.T. Mother\u2019s parental rights to I.T.\u2019s siblings had previously been terminated, and the District Court found that this termination was relevant to Mother\u2019s ability to care for I.T. This finding was supported by substantial evidence, even if the evidence Mother claims was improperly admitted is disregarded. Mother\u2019s arguments for relief from the District Court\u2019s decision on equitable grounds are not persuasive.
