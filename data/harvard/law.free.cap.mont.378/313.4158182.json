We restate the issue on appeal as whether Missoula County Sheriffs Department (MCSD) deputies violated Urziceanu\u2019s constitutional rights by entering his property to assist with a civil standby . We conclude that they did not, and we affirm Urziceanu\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b62 On December 19, 2012, MCSD deputies accompanied Christine Robutka to a rural property located on Ellis Creek Road. Robutka had contacted MCSD and requested a civil standby while she removed her belongings from the property. A civil standby is an operation that MCSD routinely conducts as a service to the public; it entails deputies briefly accompanying the requesting party and keeping the peace should a dispute arise. Explaining her request, Robutka said that she had been sharing a residence on the property with two men \u2014 one of whom is Urziceanu \u2014 and that she was worried that the men might cause trouble when she tried to move out.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b63 Before following Robutka to the property, deputies met with her at a nearby eatery. Sergeant David Ball, who later testified at Urziceanu\u2019s suppression hearing, spoke with Robutka. Robutka told Ball \u201cstories about living with the males, her possessions being at the residence... and that she had been living with the two males for some time and had a right to be back there retrieving her property.\u201d Sergeant Ball was satisfied that Robutka was telling the truth about her connection to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b64 Robutka led MCSD deputies up Ellis Creek Road to a property that is fenced and marked with no trespassing signs. The property includes fifteen acres and a house that is located at the end of a 100-foot private driveway and is not visible from the road. Trailing Robutka, Sergeant Ball and other deputies in two MCSD vehicles drove halfway up the driveway and parked. Sergeant Ball testified that, upon stepping out of his vehicle, he saw a \u201cglassed-in area, like a porch or a remodeled porch.\u201d Despite drapes hanging over some of the glass, Sergeant Ball saw \u201cseveral marijuana plants in there in pots.\u201d Robutka walked up to the house, opened the front door, and entered, leaving the door open behind her. Through the open door, Sergeant Ball saw more marijuana plants. He took out his camera and took a picture. The record is not clear whether Robutka retrieved any items, but she came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>out of the house and she and the deputies left without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b65 Two days later, MCSD Detective Scott Newell \u2014 who also testified at Urziceanu\u2019s suppression hearing \u2014 interviewed Robutka. Robutka told Detective Newell that Urziceanu was growing marijuana at the Ellis Creek property.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b66 Detective Newell sought a warrant to search the Ellis Creek property for marijuana. To establish probable cause, the warrant affidavit recounted Detective Newell\u2019s interview with Robutka, Sergeant Ball\u2019s observations during the civil standby, and Detective Newell\u2019s familiarity with Urziceanu\u2019s terms of release for another conviction for growing marijuana. A magistrate issued the warrant, and MCSD deputies executed the search on January 2, 2014. They seized multiple adult marijuana plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b67 The State charged Urziceanu with violating \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA, which criminalizes the cultivation of marijuana. Urziceanu moved to suppress the evidence gathered from the December 19 civil standby and the January 2 search on the ground that, in each instance, the State violated his right to privacy and right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The District Court held a hearing on the motion in which Sergeant Ball, Detective Newell, and Urziceanu testified. Urziceanu testified that Robutka had lived in the house for two weeks in September 2012 and had lived in a vehicle on the property for two weeks after that, but then had left. Urziceanu further testified that Robutka did not depart on good terms and did not have permission to be in the house or on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b68 A day after the hearing, the District Court issued an order that deified the motion to suppress. Urziceanu eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence, to run consecutively to a sentence that Urziceanu had received in another case. Urziceanu appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u00b69 When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress based on its refusal to excise information from a warrant application, we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State v. Deshaw, </em>2012 MT 284, \u00b6 13, 367 Mont. 218, 291 P.3d 561. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if the finding is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if we are convinced after reviewing the record that the district court has made a mistake. <em>State v. </em>Phillips, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>2013 MT 317, \u00b6 15, 372 Mont. 317, 312 P.3d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b610 When an application for a warrant contains only legally obtained evidence, we review a magistrate\u2019s issuance of a warrant to determine whether the application provided a substantial evidentiary basis for a determination of probable cause. <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 18, 291 Mont. 474, 970 P.2d 556. When an application for a warrant contains illegally obtained evidence, we conduct de novo review to determine whether probable cause existed to issue the warrant. <em>Kuneff, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b611 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guarantee the individual right to be secure from unreasonable, warrantless searches and seizures. U.S. Const, amend. IV; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 11. The Montana Constitution further provides that the individual right to privacy \u201cshall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 10. We interpret Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution to provide greater protection to individual rights than does the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>Deshaw, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b612 Acknowledging that MCSD searched his residence and seized marijuana plants only after obtaining a warrant, Urziceanu challenges the inclusion of several pieces of evidence in the warrant application. He suggests that a magistrate could not properly consider these pieces of evidence in determining probable cause, thus rendering the issuance of the warrant improper. The first piece of evidence Urziceanu challenges is the observation of marijuana plants during the December 19 civil standby.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u00b613 The plain view doctrine holds that an officer who is in a place where she has a right to be need not divert her gaze from incriminating evidence. <em>See State v. Doyle, </em>1998 MT 195, \u00b6 11, 290 Mont. 287, 963 P.2d 1255. During the civil standby, the deputies saw the marijuana plants from halfway up Urziceanu\u2019s driveway. Urziceanu contends that the deputies had no right to be there because Urziceanu had an actual, reasonable expectation of privacy in the property, on which the deputies could not intrude without his permission or a lawfully obtained warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u00b614 The government does not infringe on a person\u2019s constitutional right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures if the government receives valid consent. <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 165-66, 94 S. Ct. 988, 990 (\u201c[T]he search of property, without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>warrant and without probable cause, but with proper consent voluntarily given, is valid under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d). In <em>State v. Bullock, </em>272 Mont. 361, 901 P.2d 61 (1995), we explained that, when a person takes steps to indicate \u201cunmistakably that entry [onto the person\u2019s property] is not permitted, ... entry by law enforcement officers requires permission or a warrant.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 284, 901 P.2d at 75-76 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b615 Given the posting and fencing of the Ellis Creek property, the State does not contend that Urziceanu consented to the public or the government driving up his driveway. Instead, the State argues that Robutka was a third party with authority to consent and that she did consent by requesting officers to accompany her to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b616 A third party with authority validly may consent to an intrusion upon a defendant\u2019s property. <em>State v. Sorenson, </em>180 Mont. 269, 275, 590 P.2d 136, 140 (1979). Adequate authority to consent rests on common authority over the property, defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"><em>State v. McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, \u00b6 13, 298 Mont. 15, 994 P.2d 683 (quoting <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S. Ct. at 993 n. 7). The Montana Constitution requires that a court reviewing an issue of third party consent determine \u2014 without deference to the officer at the scene \u2014 whether the third party had common authority. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 32 (distinguishing the United States Constitution, which, under <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 188-89, 110 S. Ct. 2793, 2801 (1990), requires that an officer have only a reasonable belief about a third party\u2019s common authority). The focus of this analysis is on what facts the officer was operating under at the time of the purported search or seizure. <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>2004 MT 363, \u00b6 22, 324 Mont. 488, 104 P.3d 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b617 In <em>McLees, </em>we determined that the defendant\u2019s grandfather did not have common authority over the defendant\u2019s apartment. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 32. This conclusion relied in part on the fact that, when the searching officer and the grandfather approached the apartment\u2019s front door, they found the door locked. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 5. The grandfather, lacking a key, had to lead the officer through the adjoining shop to gain access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>to the apartment. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 5. By contrast, we determined in <em>Gilmore </em>that, based on what the officers knew at the time, a homeowner had common authority over a room in her house where the defendant slept. <em>Gilmore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. This conclusion relied on the fact that, before the entry into the room, the homeowner told the officers that her boyfriend\u2019s belongings were stored in the room and that the defendant was not welcome in her house. <em>Gilmore, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b618 At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Ball recounted the facts that were available to him to determine Robutka\u2019s authority. Sergeant Ball testified that Robutka told him about living on the Ellis Creek property with Urziceanu and another man, and said that she had items on the property and had a right to go back and retrieve them. Unlike in <em>McLees, </em>where the officer saw that the third party lacked a key, <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 5, there was no objective indication in this case that Robutka lacked access to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b619 Although the District Court did not specifically find that Robutka had access or control over the property for the limited purpose for which she requested the officers to enter, we apply the doctrine of implied findings. <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, 42 P.3d 753. The finding that Robutka had access or control is implicit in the District Court\u2019s ruling that the officers saw the marijuana plants \u201cin plain view.\u201d Based on the substantial evidence in the record, such a finding is not clearly erroneous. Because a person with joint access permitted the officers to enter the driveway while she retrieved her belongings, the District Court properly concluded that the deputies lawfully saw the marijuana plants in plain view. To the extent that Urziceanu\u2019s later testimony \u2014 even if believed \u2014 suggests that Robtuka did not have common authority, that testimony was not reasonably available to the officers when they responded to Robutka\u2019s request for assistance. <em>See Gilmore, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b620  We hold that the deputies did not violate Urziceanu\u2019s constitutional rights when they entered the driveway to conduct the civil standby. Sergeant Ball had Robutka\u2019s permission to be halfway up the driveway, and that is the vantage from which he saw the marijuana plants. No basis exists for striking Sergeant Ball\u2019s observation from the warrant affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b621 Urziceanu also argues that Robutka\u2019s statement to Detective Newell confirming the existence of the marijuana plants does not meet the standard for informant tips under <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, 301 Mont. 408, 10 P.3d 83. He thus urges that the Court excise Robutka\u2019s statement from the warrant application. But, with or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>without Robutka\u2019s statement, the plain view observation of marijuana plants by MCSD deputies provided probable cause, and the warrant for the January 2 search therefore was proper. <em>See </em>Deshaw, \u00b6 21 (explaining that an officer who had \u201cpersonally viewed [the] illegal marijuana grow operation\u201d had \u201call of the probable cause he needed\u201d to obtain a search warrant). We decline to reach Urziceanu\u2019s argument that Robutka was not a reliable informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b622 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Urziceanu\u2019s motion to suppress and his resulting conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
