We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\"><em>1. Did the District Court err when it determined that Audrey Stoican lacked standing to contest Dennis\u2019 </em>will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-15\"><em>2. Did the District Court err when it determined that Audrey Stoican lacked standing to petition for the removal of the personal representative for </em>cause?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">\u00b63 Dennis Lawlor executed a will (\u201cthe Will\u201d) on December 6, 2012. He died the following day, leaving no issue. Dennis was survived by three of his siblings, Antoinette Wagner, Mary McPherson, and John Lawlor. Joan Voise, an additional sibling, predeceased Dennis. However, Dennis was survived by Joan\u2019s daughter, Audrey Stoican, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>and Joan\u2019s grandson, John Stoican. The only other family members of relevance to this appeal that survived Dennis are Antoinette\u2019s children, Mark and John Wagner (\u201cthe Wagners\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b64 The Will devised all of Dennis\u2019 estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d) to his living sisters, Antoinette and Mary. It did not mention his deceased sister, Joan, and it \u201cspecifically and intentionally and entirely exclude[d]\u201d his brother, John Lawlor. The Will also appointed Mark to be the personal representative of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b65 On December 11, 2012, Mark submitted the Will to the District Court, asking for informal probate and his appointment as personal representative of the Estate. The clerk of court granted these requests. The Will was admitted to informal probate and Mark was appointed personal representative of the Estate. Letters were issued and filed, and notice was given to Dennis\u2019 heirs, the devisees of the Will, and the creditors of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b66 On May 16, 2013, Audrey filed a petition asking the court to convert informal probate to formal probate. In support of this request, she filed a brief questioning the competence of Dennis at the time he executed the Will and claiming that the Will was invalid. Mark, in his capacity as personal representative, consented to conversion from informal to formal probate. The motion was granted on January 3, 2014, and formal probate began.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b67 On October 18,2013, Audrey and John Stoican filed a complaint contesting the Will. They claimed that Dennis lacked testamentary capacity at the time the Will was executed; that he was subject to undue influence from the Wagners, among others; that the Wagners, among others, tortiously interfered with a contractual and business relationship made between Dennis and John Stoican; and that the Wagners breached fiduciary duties they had owed to Dennis. The complaint asked that the Will be set aside, that probate be conducted in intestacy, and that damages and fees be awarded to Audrey and John Stoican. The complaint did not ask for removal of Mark as personal representative. The Wagners opposed the complaint, moving to dismiss the will contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\u00b68 On October 21, 2013, Audrey and John Stoican filed a motion asking the court to remove Mark as personal representative and John Wagner as the Estate\u2019s attorney. Citing \u00a7 72-3-526, MCA, the sole grounds upon which they based this motion were conflicts of interest the Wagners allegedly had with the Estate. They did not ask for removal based on any change of testacy status that might result from the resolution of the will contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\u00b69 On February 11, 2014, following a motion for leave to do so, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>District Court allowed an amended will contest complaint to be filed. The amended complaint was entered on March 3,2014. It added John Lawlor as a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b610 On March 11, 2014, John Wagner moved the District Court to determine whether Audrey, John Stoican, and John Lawlor (\u201cthe Plaintiffs\u201d) had standing to bring their motion to remove the personal representative and the Estate\u2019s attorney. The motion alleged that under \u00a7 72-3-526, MCA, only \u201cperson[s] interested in the estate\u201d have standing to move for removal of the personal representative for cause, and that each of the Plaintiffs lacked standing because they were not \u201cperson[s] interested in the estate.\u201d The Plaintiffs opposed this motion. Mark joined the motion on March 13, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b611 On April 28, 2014, the District Court entered an order on the motion to determine standing. It decided that Audrey and John Stoican lacked standing to contest the will or to petition for the removal of the personal representative or the Estate\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b612 The Plaintiffs appealed the order to this Court, contending that the District Court erred when it determined that Audrey did not have standing to contest the Will or seek the removal of the personal representative.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u00b613 The conclusion that a party lacks standing to bring a claim is a conclusion of law. <em>In re Charles M. Bair Family Trust, </em>2008 MT 144, \u00b6 86, 343 Mont. 138, 183 P.3d 61. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>In re Estate of Glennie, </em>2011 MT 291, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 508, 265 P.3d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err when it determined that Audrey Stoican lacked standing to contest Dennis\u2019 will?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\u00b615  Both parties agree that the District Court erred when it determined that Audrey would not be a successor to the Estate if it passed in intestacy, and, accordingly, that it erred when it determined that Audrey was not an \u201cinterested person\u201d with standing to contest the Will. We agree with the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u00b616 To have standing to contest a will, a party must be an \u201cinterested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>person\u201d as defined by the Montana Uniform Probate Code. Section 72-3-302, MCA; <em>Glennie, </em>\u00b6 13. We have determined that a party may be an \u201cinterested person\u201d for the purposes of contesting a will if he or she has a pecuniary interest in setting aside that will. That is, a party has standing to contest a will if he or she stands to gain from a successful contest. <em>Glennie, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b617 Here, Audrey is not a devisee under the Will, but she is an heir that would take if the will contest was successful and the Estate passed by intestacy. In Montana, if a decedent leaves no issue and is predeceased by his parents, then his parents\u2019 descendants take by representation. Section 72-2-113(l)(c), MCA. This means that the estate is divided based on the composition of the generation containing at least one surviving descendant that is nearest to the generation of the decedent\u2019s deceased parents. Section 72-2-116(3)(a), MCA. In this case, that is the generation of Dennis and his siblings, since three siblings survived Dennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b618 At this generation, the estate is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving generation-members and deceased generation-members that left surviving descendants. Section 72-2-116(3)(a), MCA. In this case, there are three surviving siblings \u2014 John Lawlor, Mary, and Antoinette \u2014 and one deceased sibling that left surviving descendants \u2014 Joan. Thus, if it was to pass by intestacy, the Estate would be divided into four shares. Joan\u2019s share would pass to her heir, Audrey. Section 72-2-116(3)(b), MCA. Thus, Audrey would stand to gain from invalidation of the Will and probate in intestacy. For this reason, she is an interested person with standing to contest the Will. <em>Glennie, </em>\u00b6 13. The District Court erred when it determined otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"AH6\">\u00b619 <em>2. Did the District Court err when it determined that Audrey Stoican lacked standing to petition for the removal of the personal representative for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b620  The Plaintiffs argue that because Audrey has standing to contest the Will, she also has standing to petition for removal of the personal representative for cause. We do not agree. The will contest and the petition for removal in this case are two separate actions. That a party has standing to bring one does not necessarily mean that the party has standing to bring the other. Standing for each action is controlled by separate statutory provisions and must be analyzed separately and independently from the other in light of the statute controlling the action. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-3-302 and -526, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b621 As an initial matter, it is important to note that Audrey\u2019s petition for removal of the personal representative was a petition for removal for cause. Audrey alleged that removal was appropriate based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>conflict of interest and specifically cited \u00a7 72-3-526, MCA. Importantly, she did not allege that removal was appropriate, for example, based on any change of testacy that might result from the will contest. The code makes specific provision for bringing such a petition at the same time as a will contest. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-3-302(4), -313(2), -319, and -523, MCA. No similar provision is made for bringing a petition for removal for cause concurrently with a will contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b622 Section 72-3-526(1), MCA, controls who may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause. For this reason it controls our decision here. That statute reads, in part: <em>\u201cA </em>person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at any time.\u201d Section 72-3-526(1), MCA. Thus, the question of whether Audrey has standing to petition for the removal of the personal representative for cause turns on whether she is a \u201cperson interested in the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b623 We have not yet had the opportunity to consider the meaning of \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d as it is used in the Montana Uniform Probate Code. However, several courts in other states that have also adopted the Uniform Probate Code have considered the meaning of the term as used in their versions of \u00a7 72-3-526, MCA. In doing so, they have treated the term \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d as synonymous with \u201cinterested person.\u201d <em>Valer v. Bartelson (In re Estate of Bartelson), </em>833 N.W.2d 522, 526 (N.D. 2013); <em>see Flamme v. Flamme (In re Estate of Dickie), </em>623 N.W.2d 666, 671 (Neb. 2001). The Montana Uniform Probate Code also treats the terms synonymously. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-3-105 and -514, MCA. The plain meaning of the terms also indicates that they are synonymous. The plain meaning of the term \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d is, after all, an \u201cinterested person\u201d whose interest is in an estate. For these reasons, we will treat \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d synonymously with \u201cinterested person\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 72-3-526, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b624 While we have determined that Audrey is an interested person for the purposes of a will contest, as discussed above, this does not mean she is also an interested person for the purposes of a petition for removal for cause. As \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, states: \u201cThe meaning [of interested person] as it relates to particular persons may vary from time to time and must be determined according to the <em>particular purposes of and matter involved </em>in any proceeding.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AqGC\">\u00b625  To be an \u201cinterested person,\u201d a person must have \u201ca property right in or claim against\u201d the estate. Section 72-1-103(25), MCA; <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of Anderson, </em>2009 MT 344, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 353 Mont. 139, 218 P.3d 1220 (rejecting an argument that \u201cdevisees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>children, spouses, creditors, and beneficiaries\u201d can be interested persons without having a property right in or claim against the estate); <em>Estate of Miles v. Miles, </em>2000 MT 41, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46, 298 Mont. 312, 994 P.2d 1139. The term also includes \u201cpersons having priority for appointment as personal representative.\u201d Section 72-1-103(25), MCA. Audrey, however, does not have a claim against or property interest in the Estate, she does not have priority for appointment as personal representative, and she has no other interest in the outcome of the petition for removal for cause. Thus, Audrey does not have standing to petition for removal for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b626 Audrey does not have a claim against the Estate. The Montana Uniform Probate Code defines \u201cclaims\u201d as including \u201cliabilities of the decedent ... whether arising in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and liabilities of the estate that arise at or after the death of the decedent or after the appointment of a conservator, including funeral expenses and expenses of administration.\u201d Section 72-l-103(6)(a), MCA. Audrey does not contend that she is a creditor of the Estate or that she is otherwise entitled to property based upon a liability of the Estate. For this reason, she does not have a claim against the Estate upon which standing can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b627 Audrey also does not have a property right in the Estate. When the Will was admitted to informal probate, a presumption of testacy arose. Section 72-3-215(2), MCA. Under this presumption, the Estate will pass according to the terms of the Will, leaving Audrey without any property interest in the Estate. The <em>pending </em>will contest does not change this presumption of testacy, \u00a7 72-3-215(2), MCA, and does not otherwise create a property right upon which standing can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">\u00b628 Indeed, we have already recognized in at least one instance that standing to bring a separate action cannot be predicated upon the successful outcome of a pending will contest. <em>See Glennie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-26. In <em>Glennie, </em>a petitioner contested the validity of a will and simultaneously petitioned to set aside contracts entered into by the decedent before his death. The will contest was made following a motion to admit the will to informal probate and before the will was actually admitted. <em>Glennie, </em>\u00b6 7. We determined that the petitioner had standing to contest the validity of the will since he would be a successor to the estate if the will was invalidated. However, we determined that the petitioner had only \u201cconditional\u201d standing to petition to set aside the contracts. We reasoned that the petitioner would only have an interest in the outcome of the contract challenge if he had an interest in the estate. Thus, we determined that the petitioner would not have standing unless the will contest was successful and the petitioner proved himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>to be a successor to the estate. <em>Glennie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b629 Similarly, Audrey only has a property interest in the Estate if the will contest is successful. Like the petitioner in <em>Glennie, </em>any property interest Audrey might have is contingent upon the outcome of the will contest. As that contest is pending, Audrey has not yet proven that she has a property interest in the Estate. She, therefore, does not have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b630 \u201cConditional\u201d standing is not appropriate in Audrey\u2019s case, because unlike in <em>Glennie, </em>the Will was admitted to informal probate before Audrey petitioned to set aside the Will. As such, the presumption of testacy arose before Audrey brought her will contest, and we must presume that Audrey is not a successor to the Estate. \u201cConditional\u201d standing was only appropriate in <em>Glennie </em>because no such presumption arose, and it was unclear which parties had property rights in the estate while the will contest was pending. <em>See Glennie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 24-26. For these reasons, Audrey does not have a property interest in the Estate sufficient for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b631 Audrey also does not have priority for appointment as personal representative. Section 72-3-502, MCA, states that priority is first given to persons nominated by a probated will. Priority is next given to spouses, custodial parents, and devisees of the decedent. Sections 72-3-502(1) through -502(4), MCA. Audrey is none of these. Mark was the personal representative nominated in the Will, and the Will specified that Antoinette should be made personal representative if Mark was unwilling or unable to do so. As a devisee under the Will, Mary would have priority for appointment as a personal representative following Mark and Antoinette. Because these parties have priority and because Audrey was neither nominated by nor a devisee of the Will, Audrey does not have priority for appointment as personal representative upon which standing can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b632 In addition to not having a claim against the Estate, a property interest in the Estate, or priority for appointment as a personal representative, Audrey has no interest in the outcome of the petition for removal for cause. According to Section 72-3-526(2), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">(2) Cause for removal exists:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(a) when removal would be in the best interests of the estate; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">(b) if it is shown that a personal representative or the person seeking the personal representative\u2019s appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts in the proceedings leading to the appointment or that the personal representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>duties of the office, or has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Thus, removal for cause is appropriate primarily where the estate has been harmed or where the personal representative has not fulfilled his obligations as a fiduciary. <em>E.g., In re Estate of Hannum, </em>2012 MT 171, \u00b6 27, 366 Mont. 1, 285 P.3d 463; <em>In re Estate of Anderson-Feeley, </em>2007 MT 354, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 340 Mont. 352, 174 P.3d 512; <em>Hanson v. Estate of Bjerke, </em>2004 MT 200, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 322 Mont. 280, 95 P.3d 704. Because Audrey is not a successor to the Estate, the personal representative owes Audrey no fiduciary duties. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-3-610, MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 72-1-103(48) (defining \u201csuccessors\u201d to the estate). Nor is Audrey, without a property interest in the Estate, interested in the Estate\u2019s management. For these reasons and based upon the causes for removal, there is no \u201cparticular purpose\u201d for a petition for removal for cause that would grant Audrey standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b633 For these reasons, Audrey lacked standing to petition for removal for cause. Although the District Court\u2019s reasoning was incorrect, it reached this conclusion. As such, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order insofar as it decided that Audrey did not have standing to bring a petition for removal of the personal representative for cause. <em>Dewey v. Stringer, </em>2014 MT 136, \u00b6 16, 375 Mont. 176, 325 P.3d 1236 (stating that we \u201cwill not reverse a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reached that result for the wrong reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b634 The District Court erred when it determined that Audrey would not succeed to the Estate if the Estate passed by intestacy. For this reason, it erred when it determined that Audrey lacked standing to contest the Will. The District Court also decided that Audrey was not a \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d with standing to petition for removal of a personal representative for cause. Although its reasoning was incorrect, this was the correct conclusion. For these reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\"> The Plaintiffs do not appeal the District Court\u2019s decision that John Stoican also did not have standing to pursue these claims.

Further, the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue Two is inconsistent with its resolution of Issue One. I fail to understand how an \u201cinterested person\u201d with standing to contest a will does not similarly have standing to petition for removal of a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>representative so designated because of provisions of that contested will. The Court\u2019s analysis is flawed: first, in its failure to correctly apply statutory distinctions between informal and formal probate; and second, in its attempt to distinguish \u201cinterested person\u201d for purposes of a will contest from \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d under the removal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b636 These proceedings began on December 11, 2012 as an informal probate when Mark Wagner submitted a will to the Clerk of the District Court requesting that the Clerk issue a statement of informal probate, \u00a7 72-3-215, MCA, and that the Clerk informally appoint him as personal representative pursuant to the provisions of the will, \u00a7\u00a772-3-221 through -225, MCA. After reviewing the will, finding that the application was complete, and determining that Mark Wagner was nominated as personal representative in the will, the Clerk granted both requests. As a result, the \u201c[i]nformal probate [was] conclusive as to all persons <em>until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding.\u201d </em>Section 72-3-215(2), MCA. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b637 On May 16,2013, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 72-3-301, MCA, allowing for formal testacy, Appellants filed a petition to convert the informal probate to a formal probate and requested that \u201cthe Court restrain the personal representative\u2019s further administration of this estate in accordance with Mont. Code Ann. 72-3-304.\u201d Appellants\u2019 petition for formal probate requested relief pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-301(l)(a), MCA: that the court issue <em>an </em>\u201corder as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular instrument... and determin[e] the heirs.\u201d As a basis for their petition, Appellants stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">Petitioner requests to convert it to formal and set aside the informal probate proceedings for the reason that she questions the validity of the Last Will and Testament of Dennis Lawlor as it was executed less than thirty-six (36) hours before his passing. The Will was executed on December 6, 2012 and Dennis Lawlor died on December 7, 2012. In addition, Dennis was under the supervision of co-guardians and co-conservators, one of which drafted the Will and one of which is a witness to the Will as well as named Personal Representative. Petitioner does not believe that the decedent was competent at the time of executing said Will as the decedent suffered from, amongst other things, dementia, delirium and delusions, as set forth in the Petition for the Appointment of Guardianship and Conservatorship filed by John Wagner and Mark Wagner on June 14th, 2011 in Flathead County District Court and as further set forth in a letter from Dr. Michael R. Butz, licensed Psychologist, dated June 15,2012. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Petition and letter are attached hereto as Exhibit A and B to this Brief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The petition for formal probate, which may only be filed by an \u201cinterested person,\u201d was uncontested. Appellants specifically requested relief pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-304, MCA. On October 21,2013, Appellants filed their motion to remove Mark Wagner as personal representative of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b638 Section 72-3-302, MCA, explains that \u201c[a] formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will.\u201d As a result of an order granting formal probate, an informally probated will no longer \u201cis conclusive as to all persons,\u201d \u00a7 72-3-215(2), MCA, and a \u201cpreviously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, shall refrain from exercising the personal representative\u2019s power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 72-3-304, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b639 On January 3,2014, the District Court, after noting there was no objection from the personal representative or other devisees, issued an order converting the proceeding from an informal probate to formal probate. The court also restrained the personal representative from exercising his power to make further distributions pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-304, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b640 With these statutory provisions in mind, we must consider whether Appellants had standing to contest the will and standing to request removal of the Mark Wagner as the personal representative. The Court correctly applies rules of intestacy to conclude that Audrey is an heir of the Estate if the will is invalidated. As the Court observes, \u201cAudrey would stand to gain from invalidation of the Will and probate in intestacy... [therefore] she is an interested person with standing to contest the Will.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b641 However, the Court\u2019s reasoning that follows is flawed, and its subsequent conclusion that Appellants may not petition for removal is incorrect. Despite the Court having found that Audrey \u201cwould stand to gain\u201d as an heir, Opinion, \u00b6 20, the Court finds that she \u201cdoes not have a ... property interest in the Estate,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 25. The Court concludes, in violation of the above statutory provisions, that \u201c[t]he <em>pending </em>will contest does not change this presumption of testacy, \u00a7 72-3-215(2), MCA, and does not otherwise create a property right upon which standing can be based.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 27. Not only does this misconstrue statutory provisions as explained above, but it is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Audrey has standing to contest the will. The Court states that \u201cAudrey has no interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>outcome of the petition for removal for cause,\u201d and that she has stated \u201cno \u2018particular purpose\u2019 for a petition for removal for cause that would grant Audrey standing.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32. However, Audrey has alleged causes of action against the Wagners that include tortious interference with a business relationship and constructive fraud, that the Wagners exercised undue influence over the decedent in the Will\u2019s execution, that the Wagners gave themselves $180,000 of the estate prior to the decedent\u2019s death, and that the Wagners deeded half the estate\u2019s real and personal property to themselves. The Appellants assert that Mark Wagner cannot investigate the claims against himself and will not investigate the claims against his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b642 Cause for removal pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-526(2), MCA, exists when, among other things, the personal representative has a conflict of interest with the Estate. <em>In re Estate of Peterson, </em>265 Mont. 104, 108-09, 874 P.2d 1230, 1232-33 (1994); <em>In re Estate of Jones, </em>93 P.3d 147, 156 (Wash. 2004) (citing <em>In re Estate of Rohrback, </em>952 P.2d 87, 89 (Or. Ct. App. 1998) and <em>Genins v. Boyd, </em>305 S.E.2d 391, 392 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983)). Appellants have presented prima facie evidence in support of their removal request. As they have an interest in preserving the Estate as disinherited heirs in a will contest proceeding, they have standing to request removal of the personal representative. <em>In re Estate of Hitchcock, </em>167 P.3d 1180, 1183 (Wash. Ct. App. 2007) (under Washington statute, heir has standing to petition for removal of personal representative). Appellants seek to protect their interests in the event the Will is invalidated. In light of the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cinterested person\u201d and \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d are synonymous, a determination that Appellants lack standing to pursue removal of the personal representative is nonsensical.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b643 Where, as here, a disinherited heir contests the validity of a will and argues for removal of the personal representative, presenting prima facie evidence of both, the disinherited heir is a person interested in the estate and has standing to contest the validity of the will and to request removal of the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b644 I would reverse the District Court on both issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
