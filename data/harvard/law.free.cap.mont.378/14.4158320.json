On September 12,2012, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to her children finding that Mother had executed a knowing and voluntary relinquishment of her rights after receiving counseling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mother appealed and raised the following issues: (1) Did the District Court err in denying Mother\u2019s request to discharge her court-appointed counsel; (2) Did the District Court err in accepting Mother\u2019s relinquishment; and (3) Did the District Court err in denying Mother\u2019s request to modify the treatment plan and stay the termination hearing. <em>In re B.J.T.H., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-5. This Court affirmed on issues one and three, <em>B.J.T.H., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 22, but remanded the matter to the District Court for a determination of whether Mother had received the required relinquishment counseling or whether good cause existed to waive the requirement, <em>B.J.T.H., </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b64 On January 22,2014, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the counseling received by Mother satisfied the provisions of \u00a7 42-2-409(1) and (2), MCA. The State presented the testimony of Christy Ruckwardt, a permanency specialist with DPHHS, who provided counseling to Mother. Ruckwardt explained that relinquishment counseling is referred to as options counseling because she reviews with the birth parent the different options available regarding his or her child. Ruckwardt goes over how the parent is doing in his or her treatment plan, necessary services that must be in place before reunification, and long-term placement options, such as guardianship and adoption, if reunification is not an option. It is Ruckwardt\u2019s practice to provide the parent with a packet of documents that help explain the parent\u2019s options. Ruckwardt goes through these documents with the parent and has the parent initial a checklist indicating he or she has received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>information and has been offered discussion with the counselor on each topic. The packet contains a sample affidavit in the event the parent chooses the relinquishment option, as well as other individualized exercises such as the \u201cEcomap,\u201d which the parent completes in order to identify persons who will provide support during the grieving process.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b65 Mother\u2019s counseling with Ruckwardt occurred on July 16, 2012, two months before she signed an affidavit of relinquishment on September 5, 2012, The District Court determined that Ruckwardt \u201cbegan the rehnquishment counseling session with [Mother] at 10:00 a.m. and concluded the session four hours later at 2:00 p.m.\u201d The District Court observed that during this time, Ruckwardt allowed Mother \u201cto take short breaks ... to have a cigarette and to use the restroom.\u201d These breaks \u201clasted 10 to 15 minutes, combined.\u201d Additionally, the District Court found that Mother \u201ctook a 45 minute break from her relinquishment counseling at 11:30 a.m. to attend a Foster Care Review being conducted down the hallway from the room in which she was receiving counseling.\u201d Mother resumed counseling at 12:15 p.m. The District Court concluded that Mother had received between three hours and three hours and fifteen minutes of counseling and that the three-hour minimum time requirement had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b66 Ruckwardt testified that during options counseling with Mother, she used a document entitled \u201cChecklist for Counseling Requirement for Relinquishment of Parental Rights.\u201d This document contains every topic required to be discussed as set forth in \u00a7 42-2-409(3)(a) through (j), MCA. Thus, in compliance with the counseling statute, Ruckwardt testified she offered Mother an explanation and opportunity to discuss the following topics set forth in \u00a7 42-2-409(3)(a) through (j), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">(a) adoption procedures and options that are available to a parent through the department or licensed child-placing agencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">(b) adoption procedures and options that are available to a parent through direct parental placement adoptions, including the right to an attorney and that legal expenses are an allowable expense that may be paid by a prospective adoptive parent as provided in 42-7-101 and 42-7-102;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">(c) the alternative of parenting rather than relinquishing the child for adoption;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">(d) the resources that are available to provide assistance or support for the parent and the child if the parent chooses not to relinquish the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">(e) the legal and personal effect and impact of terminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>parental rights and of adoption;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">(f) the options for contact and communication between the birth family and the adoptive family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(g) postadoptive issues, including grief and loss, and the existence of a postadoptive counseling and support program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">(h) the reasons for and importance of providing accurate medical and social history information under 42-3-101;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">(i) the operation of the confidential intermediary program; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">(j) the fact that the adoptee may be provided with a copy of the original birth certificate upon request after reaching 18 years of age, unless the birth parent has specifically requested in writing that the vital statistics bureau withhold release of the original birth certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b67 Mother indicated she had received the required counseling regarding these topics by placing her initials next to each topic on the \u201cChecklist for Counseling Requirement for Relinquishment of Parental Rights.\u201d On a separate document entitled \u201cBirth Mother\u2019s Statement of Counseling Received,\u201d Mother again acknowledged having been offered information and discussion on each topic by signing and dating her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u00b68 Mother also completed her own \u201cEcomap\u201d in which she included the names of persons who could support her if she decided to relinquish her children. Ruckwardt discussed with Mother her relationship with each person and whether she could rely upon them for support. Finally, Ruckwardt had Mother write down the reasons why she might choose to relinquish and then placed these written statements in Mother\u2019s DPHHS file. Ruckwardt explained that by including these responses in a parent\u2019s file, she can assist the parent later if they choose to write a letter to the child which may then be placed in the adoption file.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">\u00b69 Ruckwardt did not prepare anything in addition to the above-referenced documents until she was asked by counsel for DPHHS, following this Court\u2019s remand, to provide documentation of the counseling she provided Mother. The packet of documents that Ruckwardt used during her counseling session with Mother, together with a cover letter describing her counseling session with Mother, was forwarded to DPHHS in December of 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact in a parental termination case to determine whether the findings in question are clearly erroneous. <em>B.J.T.H., </em>\u00b6 14. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>B.J.T.H., </em>\u00b6 14. A court\u2019s conclusions of law in such a case are reviewed for correctness, and its decision to terminate parental rights is a discretionary ruling reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>B.J.T.H., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b611 <em>1. </em>Was <em>there substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding </em>that, <em>prior to signing an affidavit relinquishing her parental rights, Mother received counseling required by \u00a7 42-2-409(1) and (2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b612 A parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child represents a fundamental liberty interest, and consequently, the state must provide fundamentally fair procedures at all stages in the proceedings to terminate parental rights. <em>In re A.N.W., </em>2006 MT 42, \u00b6 34, 331 Mont. 208, 130 P.3d 619. Proceedings involving the termination of the parent-child relationship must meet due process requirements guaranteed by the Montana and United States Constitutions. <em>In re </em>A.S., 2004 MT 62, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 268, 87 P.3d 408. Fundamental fairness and due process require that a parent not be placed at an unfair disadvantage during termination proceedings. <em>A.S., </em>\u00b6 12; <em>In re A.R., </em>2004 MT 22, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 340, 83 P.3d 1287; <em>In re A.S.A., </em>258 Mont. 194, 198, 852 P.2d 127, 129-30 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b613 When the State seeks to terminate a parent\u2019s rights through a voluntary relinquishment, the parent\u2019s rights are protected, in part, through the statutory provisions contained in \u00a7 42-2-409, MCA. Counseling of the birth mother is required and counseling of \u201cany other parent... involved in an adoptive placement... is encouraged.\u201d Section 42-2-409(1), MCA. Unless counseling is waived for good cause by a court, a minimmn of three hours of counseling must be completed prior to execution of a relinquishment, or the relinquishment and consent to adopt is void. Section 42-2-409(2), MCA. The statute mandates that ten specific topics be \u201cexplained\u201d to the birth mother, \u00a7 42-2-409(3), MCA, and that the counselor prepare a written report containing a description of the topics covered and the number of hours of counseling completed, \u00a7 42-2-409(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b614 Mother asserts that her testimony and her calendar, which was introduced into evidence, reflect that she left counseling at 12:10 p.m. after the foster care review. Mother also testified that the counseling did not begin at 10:00 a.m., as Ruckwardt represented. Mother claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that she only spent five to ten minutes total with Ruckwardt in counseling and spoke of nothing substantive. For these reasons, Mother maintains that the District Court erred when it concluded that Mother had received three hours of counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b615 The State maintains the District Court\u2019s finding that Mother received at least three hours of counseling is supported by substantial evidence. Ruckwardt testified, and the District Court found, that the counseling session began at 10 a.m. on July 16,2012, and lasted until 2 p.m, Ruckwardt\u2019s notations made on the various documents contained within the packet reflect this as well. Ruckwardt acknowledged that there were breaks taken within the counseling session, but that the overall length of the session nevertheless comprised, at a minimum, a three-hour timeframe.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b616 We review the record with an appreciation that the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are determined by the trier of fact \u2014 in this case the trial judge. <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 17, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841 (quoting <em>State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 297 Mont. 23, 989 P.2d 866). We have long observed that the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses and their testimony. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Langford v. State, </em>2013 MT 265, \u00b6 17, 372 Mont. 14, 309 P.3d 993). Here, the District Court specifically found that Ruckwardt\u2019s testimony that she provided at least three hours of counseling was more credible than Mother\u2019s testimony that she did not receive the required counseling. The documentary evidence further suggests that a significantly greater amount of time than five to ten minutes, as Mother contends was provided, would be required to discuss the ten topics which Mother has acknowledged she addressed with Ruckwardt. The District Court\u2019s finding that three horns of counseling was provided was supported by substantial evidence, and its credibility determinations will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b617  The District Court further observed that, although the evidence indicated Mother received three hours of counseling, Ruckwardt offered to do additional counseling at a later date, which Mother refused. The District Court thus found, in the alternative, that good cause existed to waive the three-hour requirement. We conclude, however, that there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Mother received the requisite three hours of counseling and we therefore do not address the District Court\u2019s alternative finding that good cause existed to waive this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"A5G\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the counselor produce a written report in compliance with the provisions of\u00a7 42-2-409(4), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u00b619 Section 42-2-409(4), MCA, requires that the counselor prepare a written report that meets the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">The counselor shall prepare a written report containing a description of the topics covered and the number of hours of counseling. The report must specifically include the counselor\u2019s opinion of whether or not the parent understood all of the issues and was capable of informed consent. The report must, on request, be released to the person counseled, to the department, to an agency, or with the consent of the person counseled, to an attorney for the prospective adoptive parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Mother argues that the written report was never prepared. She maintains that a letter drafted in generic and formulaic terms eighteen months after Mother challenged the State\u2019s satisfaction of the counseling requirement is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b620 The packet of documents used by Ruckwardt during the counseling session is clearly a method by which DPHHS and its counselors ensure that each topic required to be discussed pursuant to \u00a7 42-2-409(3), MCA, is specifically addressed in counseling. Mother and Ruckwardt each made notations on the documents and Mother placed her initials next to each topic indicating she had discussed the topic in counseling. Mother also acknowledged, in a separate statement, that she had received the counseling in the specific topic areas. Ruckwardt kept these documents in her file until counsel requested that they be released. When Ruckwardt was asked to provide documentation, presumably in preparation for the evidentiary hearing on January 22, 2014, she forwarded the documents to counsel with a cover letter which more completely organized and described her counseling session with Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b621  We agree with Mother that Ruckwardt\u2019s cover letter, composed 18 months after the fact, did not adequately comply with the provisions of \u00a7 42-2-409(4), MCA, regarding preparation of a written report. Although a letter containing a summary description may suffice as a \u201cwritten report\u201d under the statute, even when all the documents are construed together, Ruckwardt did not include the required statement of the \u201ccounselor\u2019s opinion of whether or not the parent understood all of the issues and was capable of informed consent.\u201d However, while we do not condone the procedure utilized by DPHHS in these proceedings, it is a deficiency that should not override the best interests of the children \u2014 particularly the children\u2019s interest in permanency. DPHHS was granted temporary legal custody over three years ago when the twins were less than two years old. The State represents that the children have been waiting for their adoption to be finalized for over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>two years. If there were any evidence which would suggest that Mother\u2019s relinquishment was not knowingly and voluntarily made, although undeniably painful, then we may be compelled to consider this reporting deficiency in a different light. However, the evidence presented at the hearing established that Mother received the required amount of counseling regarding all of the necessary topics and that she was capable of making a knowing relinquishment of her parental rights. A deficiency in a reporting requirement regarding these observations and findings should not serve as a basis to set aside an otherwise valid relinquishment. As we have previously stated, \u201c[i]n matters involving abused and neglected children we have consistently held that a district court may protect the children\u2019s best interest despite procedural error.\u201d <em>In re F.H., </em>266 Mont. 36, 39, 878 P.2d 890, 892 (1994); <em>see also In re Adoption </em>of S.R.T., 2011 MT 219, \u00b6 28, 362 Mont. 39, 260 P.3d 177; <em>In re J.C., </em>2008 MT 127, \u00b6 43, 343 Mont. 30, 183 P.3d 22. In applying harmless error to dependency proceedings, we have recognized the \u201cwell established [principle]... that \u2018no civil case shall be reversed by reason of error which would have no significant impact upon the result; if there is no showing of substantial injustice, the error is harmless.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 39, 298 Mont. 237, 995 P.2d 427 (quoting <em>Newbauer v. Hinebauch, </em>1998 MT 115, \u00b6 20, 288 Mont. 482, 958 P.2d 705). We therefore conclude that the deficiency in the reporting requirement is harmless in light of the evidence produced at the hearing demonstrating Mother received the required counseling on each topic and that her relinquishment was knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b622 The Judgment of the District Court terminating the parent-child relationship between Mother and B.J.T.H. and B.H.T.H. is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\"> Father relinquished his parental rights on March 16,2012.
