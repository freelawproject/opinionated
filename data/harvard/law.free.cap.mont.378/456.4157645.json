We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b62 Schwarzmeier raises numerous issues on appeal. We rephrase the dispositive issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Schwarzmeier\u2019s motion to exclude the crime lab report.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it concluded that the crime lab report was supported by proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u00b65 On July 17, 2013, Schwarzmeier crashed his motorcycle in Park County and Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Erick Fetterhoff responded to the scene. Schwarzmeier was transported to Livingston Memorial Hospital, where Trooper Fetterhoff performed nystagmus tests on Schwarzmeier, which indicated a high level of intoxication. Schwarzmeier then consented to a blood draw. The sample was sent to the Montana State Crime Lab; testing established that Schwarzmeier\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.193. Trooper Fetterhoff cited Schwarzmeier for violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, \u201cDriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">\u00b66 On July 29, 2013, Schwarzmeier entered a not guilty plea in Justice Court. Shortly afterwards, he filed a <em>motion in limine </em>to exclude any reports from the Montana Crime Lab. Schwarzmeier argued that the State did not provide written notice of its intention to offer the report into evidence, as required by M. R. Evid. 803(6),</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">\u00b67 On June 10, 2014, Justice of the Peace Budeski, operating as a cotut of record, conducted a bench trial. After the trial began, but before the Court denied Schwarzmeier\u2019s motion, the State amended the charge to one count in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, \u201cOperation of noncommercial vehicle by person with alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.\u201d The crime lab report was admitted over Schwarzmeier\u2019s hearsay objections and State Crime Lab Toxicologist Lynn Kurtz testified regarding Schwarzmeier\u2019s blood alcohol content. The Justice Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>found Schwarzmeier guilty. He appealed to the District Court, challenging the admission of the crime lab evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b68 The District Court affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s decision. The District Court concluded that Schwarzmeier \u201ccannot reasonably claim that he was unaware of the fact that Kurtz would be coming to court to testify regarding Defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level, as this was the subject matter of the report he signed.\u201d The District Court noted that the State disclosed the report in discovery and listed Kurtz as an expert witness. Schwarzmeier now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b69 This Court reviews appeals from the justice court, acting as a cotut of record, as if the appeal was originally filed in this Court. <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643. We examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision, reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26 (citations omitted.) Ultimately, we must decide, \u201cwhether the district court, in its review of the trial court\u2019s decision, reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s ruling on a <em>motion in limine </em>is an evidentiary ruling. <em>State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, \u00b6 6, 297 Mont. 263, 991 P.2d 461 (citations omitted). \u201cThe determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 6 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">\u00b611 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Schwarzmeier\u2019s motion to exclude the crime lab report.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">\u00b612 Schwarzmeier argues that the crime lab report was inadmissible hearsay. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls within an exception. M, R. Evid. 802; <em>State v. Baze, </em>2011 MT 52, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 411, 251 P.3d 122. \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d M. R. Evid. 801(c). M. R Evid. 803 details twenty-three specific hearsay exceptions applicable regardless of the declarant\u2019s availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">\u00b613 One such exception is the business record exception, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>provides special rules for the admission of crime lab reports. M. R. Evid. 803(6). The rule specifically states, \u201cwritten reports from the Montana state crime laboratory are within this exception to the hearsay rule when the state has notified the court and opposing parties in writing of its intention to offer such report or reports in evidence at trial.\u201d M. R. Evid. 803(6). The rule explains that written notice is necessary to provide opposing counsel the opportunity to depose the report\u2019s author or subpoena the author for trial. M. R. Evid. 803(6). Under the current rule, the report may be admitted without the testimony of the author. Here, however, the State called the author and obtained direct testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b614 The United States Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004), addressed the tension between the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause and hearsay exceptions. The Court drew a distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial hearsay. If a statement is testimonial, the defendant must have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S. Ct. at 1374. If the statement is non-testimonial, States are afforded \u201cflexibility in the development of their hearsay law.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S. Ct. at 1374; <em>State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, \u00b6 25, 326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b615 In Montana, we have differentiated between cases that involve substantive evidence used to prove the offense charged and cases where the evidence is foundational, rather than accusatory. In <em>State v. Clark, </em>we held that the State violated a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights when it introduced a chemical analysis of drugs without calling the author of the analysis. 1998 MT 221, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 706. The <em>Clark </em>decision, however, focused on a separate hearsay exception, M. R. Evid. 803(8). After that decision, the Montana Commission on Rules of Evidence petitioned to amend the rule and this Court issued an order removing the notice language in Rule 803(8). Rule 803(6), which also contains notice language, was not amended.</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">\u00b616 Recent cases have addressed evidence admitted under M. R. Evid. 803(6). In <em>Delaney </em>and <em>Carter, </em>the Court concluded that some evidence is only foundational and does not implicate constitutional concerns, holding that annual certification reports for breath analysis devices do not bear the same accusatory features as chemical tests of substances. <em>Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Carter, </em>\u00b6 32. Because we conclude that Schwarzmeier\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights were protected when the report\u2019s author testified and was subject to cross examination, we decline to address whether the crime lab report, introduced under M. R. Evid. 803(6), constitutes substantive evidence or is simply foundational at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u00b617 What distinguishes the above cases from the present one is that here the author of the report, Lynn Kurtz, was present at trial, testified, and was subject to cross-examination. The dangers of hearsay that the Confrontation Clause is designed to protect against are not present in this case. Schwarzmeier was afforded the opportunity to question Kurtz and assess the methodology and veracity of the test results through the cross-examination process. The hearsay rules, designed to protect against injustice such as prosecution by ex parte testimony, were not violated by the admission of the crime lab report.</p>\n<p id=\"AN8\">\u00b618  Schwarzmeier argues that the State never notified him, in writing, of its intention to offer the crime lab report at trial. The District Court concluded, and we agree, that Schwarzmeier had notice of the State\u2019s intention to introduce the report. During discovery, Schwarzmeier received the document titled \u201cAlcohol Report,\u201d which was signed by Kurtz. The State listed Kurtz as a witness and designated Kurtz as an expert witness, a designation that Schwarzmeier was certainly aware of as he challenged it and lost. It is difficult to imagine how Schwarzmeier could be surprised by the admission of the crime lab report when he received the report in discovery, received notice of Kurtz as a witness, and Kurtz signed the disclosed report.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b619 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it concluded that the crime lab report was supported by proper foundation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b620 Schwarzmeier further argues that even if the State satisfied the notice requirement, the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the crime lab report when the State did not establish a proper chain of custody for the blood sample. Schwarzmeier asserts that had the State complied with the notice requirement of Rule 803(6), he would have had the opportunity to depose the crime lab employees handling his blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b621 The State argues that Schwarzmeier failed to object and raises this issue for the first time on appeal. Schwarzmeier maintains that he properly raised the issue by objecting to the State\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 803(6). Through discovery disclosures, Schwarzmeier knew of the State\u2019s intention to offer the report and could have deposed Kurtz or inquired deeper into the issue when he testified to the chain of custody at trial. Instead, he did not object during testimony on crime lab procedures. The State established foundation through Kurtz\u2019 testimony. We ordinarily will not address an argument not made in the district court and raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Homer, </em>2014 MT 57, \u00b6 12, 374 Mont. 157, 321 P.3d 77; <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>83, \u00b6 22, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164; <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, \u00b6 11, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966. We decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b622 We have affirmed the decision to admit the report from the crime lab and therefore, it is unnecessary to address the other issues raised in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
