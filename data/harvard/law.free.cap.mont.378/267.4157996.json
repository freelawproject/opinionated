The first order granted summary judgment and declaratory relief to MC, Inc., Players, Inc., Douglas J. Palagi, and K.C. Palagi (collectively, Casino Owners). The District Court determined that two smoking structures owned by the Casino Owners were in compliance with the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act (MCIAA). The second order awarded the Casino Owners attorney fees that were incurred in the preliminary injunction proceeding. We reverse both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b62 2. <em>Did the District Court err by granting the Casino Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to the Casino Owners for the preliminary injunction proceeding?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">\u00b64 The Casino Owners own and operate Golds Casino and Players Casino in Great Falls. In 2011, the Casino Owners constructed smoking structures or shelters that were attached to the casinos. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>structures have four walls, including a common wall with the casinos with multiple large glass windows, inside entrances, a roof, carpeting, heating, air conditioning, electricity, and gaming machines. The structures also have several small openings near the top of the exterior walls that are several inches high and several feet wide. The openings run parallel to the ceiling, are not obstructed from the inside of the structure, have a cover on the outside, and have no mechanism for closure. Except for the openings, the structures have all the appearances of being an enclosed structure. The Casino Owners require adults who enter the structures to join a \u201cSmokers\u2019 Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b65 After construction, Casino Owners sought approval from the City Building Department, Fire Department, and the Board for the structures. Jim Page, a license architect retained by the Casino Owners, submitted the smoking structures\u2019 blue prints to the three respective agencies and the agencies subsequently approved them. On August22,2011, after inspecting the structure located at Golds Casino, Bruce Treis, the Registered Sanitarian and Environmental Health Specialist for the Board, approved the structure, indicating it met all of the Department of Health standards. On September 2, 2011, Treis likewise approved the structure attached to Players Casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b66 On November 7,2011, Teddy Nault, Health Educator and Tobacco Prevention Specialist for the Board, received a purported anonymous complaint concerning smoking in the smoking structures; Nault later admitted to filing the complaint himself. Nault\u2019s complaint prompted the Board to commence enforcement steps under the MCIAA. The Board issued a letter of education, written warnings, and a reprimand letter serving as \u201cfinal notice prior to legal action taking place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b67 In January 2012, the Casino Owners initiated an action against the Board seeking a declaration that the structures were in compliance with the MCIAA. The parties stipulated to a stay of the proceedings. On February 5,2013, the District Court vacated the stay. On February 6, 2013, the Board moved for a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the Casino Owners from allowing smoking in the structures. The District Court denied the Board\u2019s request. The court found it significant that several other casinos in Cascade County had constructed roofed smoking structures similar to the Casino Owners\u2019 structures; the Board had not initiated action against the several other casino owners; the Board refused to adopt an articulable standard for determining whether structures fell under the MCIAA; the Board delayed filing its motion for a over a year after litigation commenced; and ultimately the Board appeared to be punishing the Casino Owners for seeking a legal declaration. The Board did not appeal the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>its motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b68 The Casino Owners moved for summary judgment. The Board filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. During discovery, the Board admitted that the small openings made the structures \u201cpartially open to the outside air.\u201d The District Court did not interpret any of the MCIAA\u2019s provisions, but reasoned that \u201cthe Board\u2019s admissions establish the MCIAA is inapplicable to [Casino Owners\u2019] shelters.\u201d The Court granted summary judgment to Casino Owners, noting that, had the Board \u201cnot made those admissions, the case may have resulted in a different analysis of the MCIAA and its application here.\u201d Thereafter, the District Court awarded attorney fees to the Casino Owners for the costs associated with the Board\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"AAx\">\u00b69 The Board appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment order de novo, based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Cnty v. Hampton, </em>2014 MT 207, \u00b6 22, 376 Mont. 137, 333 P.3d 205. We determine whether the district court applied the law correctly. <em>Hardy v. Vision Service Plan, </em>2005 MT 232, \u00b6 10, 328 Mont. 385, 120 P.3d 402. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and construction of a statute de novo. <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s determination of whether a statement constitutes a judicial admission for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bilesky v. Shopko Stores Operating Co., </em>2014 MT 300, \u00b6 10, 377 Mont. 58, 338 P.3d 76. \u201cWhether a statement is one of fact or law, for the purpose of determining if the statement should be considered a judicial admission, is a question of law we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Bilesky, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err by granting the Casino Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u00b613 The Board argues that the District Court erred in what should be \u201ca simple case of statutory interpretation.\u201d It argues that \u201cbars,\u201d which the MCIAA defines as including \u201ccasinos,\u201d are clearly delineated on the statute\u2019s list of public places wherein smoking is prohibited, and that the court erred by improperly applying discovery admissions that were immaterial to the interpretation of the statute. The Casino Owners respond with three arguments in support of their contention that the District Court did not err. First, they argue the structures are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>subject to the smoking prohibition of the MCIAA. Second, they argue the admission made by the Board in discovery constitutes a judicial admission and precludes the Board from contending the structures are not subject to the MCIAA. Lastly, they argue the Board should be equitably estopped from enforcing the MCIAA. We address these arguments in turn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\n<em>Applicability of the MCIAA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b614 We construe a statute by \u201creading and interpreting the statute as a whole, \u2018without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature/ \u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 <em>(quoting Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003). \u201cStatutory construction is a holistic endeavor and must account for the statute\u2019s text, language, structure and object.\u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 (internal quotations omitted). We must also \u201cread and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AMq\">\u00b615 The MCIAA provides that \u201csmoking in an <em>enclosed public place </em>is prohibited.\u201d Section 50-40-104(1), MCA (emphasis added). The MCIAA defines \u201cenclosed public place\u201d as \u201can indoor area, room, or vehicle that the general public is allowed to enter or that serves as a place of work, including but not limited to the following: (a) restaurants; (b) stores;... (h) bars....\u201d Section 50-40-103(3), MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cBar\u201d is further defined as an \u201can establishment with a license issued pursuant to Title 16, chapter 4, that is devoted to serving alcoholic beverages for consumption by guests or patrons on the premises and in which the serving of food is only incidental to the service of alcoholic beverages or gambling operations. The term includes but is not limited to taverns, night clubs, cocktail lounges, and casinos.\u201d Section 50-40-103(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b616 The parties initially dispute how this statutory structure \u2014 an operative definition of \u201cenclosed public place\u201d followed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>delineation of 11 named categories of places \u2014 is intended to be applied. Casino Owners argue their smoking structures must satisfy the definition of \u201cenclosed public place\u201d in order for smoking to be prohibited, but that the structures fail to do so because they are neither open to the \u201cgeneral public\u201d nor serve as a \u201cplace of work.\u201d The Board argues it is unnecessary to analyze whether the smoking structures satisfy the operative definition of \u201cenclosed public place,\u201d because \u201cbars,\u201d which in turn is defined to include \u201ccasinos,\u201d are delineated on the fist of places following the definition. Citing a dictionary definition, the Board offers that \u201ccasino\u201d is defined as \u201ca building or room used for social amusements; specifically: one used for gambling.\u201d The Board reasons that because the \u201csmoking rooms contain gambling machines, and are therefore casinos (and are therefore bars),\u201d the smoking structures are enclosed public places and thus subject to the MCIAA\u2019s prohibition on smoking. The Casino Owners respond that the Board\u2019s argument ignores the operative statutory definitions of \u201cenclosed public place\u201d and \u201cbar,\u201d and argue that \u201c[w]here a statute specifically includes a preceding definition to a fist of examples, a court cannot ignore\u201d that definition in applying the listed examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b617 As noted above, we must consider the statute as a whole, its plain language, its structure and object, and, if possible, \u201cgive effect to all\u201d of its provisions. Section 1-2-101, MCA. The structure of \u00a7\u00a7 50-40-103(1) and -103(3), MCA, utilizes an operative definition followed by a fist of items that are intended to be included within that definition. The \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d language in \u00a7 50-40-103(3), MCA, incorporates other places into the statute if they, although not mentioned on the list, also satisfy the operative definition. The expressly listed places must likewise satisfy the operative definitions in \u00a7\u00a7 50-40-103(1) and -103(3), MCA, and these provisions must be read together and interpreted accordingly. The proper working of these provisions is demonstrated by a simple illustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b618 Suppose a mother tells her child to go to the market and purchase fresh organic vegetables, including but not limited to, carrots, collard greens, and cabbage. Clearly, the child would violate the instruction if she returned with a rotten, non-organic cabbage \u2014 despite the fact that cabbage was expressly included on the list of items to be purchased. The operative language of \u201cfresh organic vegetable\u201d informed the fisted item of cabbage. The same is true here: \u201cenclosed public place,\u201d as that term is defined, informs the fisted item of \u201cbars\u201d and other places, whether or not named on the fist.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b619 The Board\u2019s analysis of the statute would render meaningless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>operative language within \u00a7\u00a7 50-40-103(1) and -103(5), MCA, and substitute dictionary definitions for these statutory definitions. Although the Board offers that, under its dictionary definition, \u201ccasinos\u201d are necessarily included within the term \u201cbar,\u201d the Board\u2019s dictionary definition of casino is not consistent with the statutory definitions the Legislature has provided for \u201cbar.\u201d \u201cBar\u201d is defined in \u00a7 50-40-103(1), MCA, as \u201can establishment... in which the serving of food is only incidental to the service of alcoholic beverages or gambling operations. The term includes but is not limited to taverns, night clubs, cocktail lounges, and casinos.\u201d The term, \u201cincidental to the service of alcoholic beverages or gambling operations,\u201d is further defined as meaning that \u201cat least 60% of the of the business\u2019s annual gross income comes from the sale of alcoholic beverages or gambling receipts, or both.\u201d Section 50-40-103(5), MCA. These criteria, apart from a dictionary definition, must be satisfied to come under the MCIAA\u2019s smoking prohibition. Smoking is prohibited in a casino that is included within the operative statutory definition of \u201cbar,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 50-40-103(1) and -103(5), MCA, and which in turn is included within the operative statutory definition of \u201cenclosed public place.\u201d Section 50-40-103(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b620 That is not to say that a dictionary definition of a place listed within \u00a7 50-40-103(3), MCA, cannot be useful in determining whether it is an \u201cenclosed public place.\u201d The Legislature provided the list of places to aid in understanding and applying its prohibition of smoking within enclosed public places, and not all places listed are separately statutorily defined, as the term \u201cbar\u201d is. However, a dictionary definition cannot contravene or render useless a statutory definition or the statutory structure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b621 The parties do not dispute that the casinos at issue here satisfy the statutory definition of \u201cbar.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we turn to the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>whether the attached smoking structures are enclosed public places by virtue of being \u201can indoor area [or] room ... that the general public is allowed to enter or that serves as a place of work.\u201d Section 50-40-103(3), MCA. Our analysis addresses the alternative of serving \u201cas a place of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b622 For purposes of defining \u201cenclosed public place,\u201d in which smoking is prohibited, the MCIAA further defines \u201cplace of work\u201d as \u201can enclosed room where one or more individuals work.\u201d Section 50-40-103(7), MCA. Although the Casino Owners broadly argue that the structures are not a \u201cplace of work\u201d based on the Board\u2019s discovery admission, they do not contest factually that \u201cone or more individuals work\u201d within the structures. Thus, the specific issue here is whether the structures constitute an \u201cenclosed room\u201d for purposes of the definition of \u201cplace of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b623 The Department of Public Health and Human Services has promulgated Admin. R. M. 37.113.101(2), which provides a definition of \u201cenclosed room\u201d for purposes of the statutory definition of \u201cplace of work\u201d within \u00a7 50-40-103(7), MCA. The regulation defines \u201cenclosed room\u201d as \u201can area with a wall on all sides reaching from floor to ceiling, exclusive of windows and doors, and does not include an area completely or partially open to the outside air such as a roofed shelter,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Casino Owners focus on the term \u201cpartially open to the outside air,\u201d and argue that the small vents on the exterior walls of the structures bring them within the exception to \u201cenclosed room.\u201d The Casino Owners offer that this \u201cfalls within the range of reasonable interpretation. \u2018Open\u2019 and \u2018enclosed\u2019 are antonyms. It is reasonable to determine that two words with opposite meanings encompass different states of being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b624 The Board disputes the Casino Owners\u2019 argument but, given its admission in discovery that the structures are partially open to outside air as a factual matter, have also fallen back on the ironic position that the Department\u2019s regulation is inconsistent with the statute. Typically, it is the regulator that argues that a regulation is valid, while the \u201cregulatee\u201d argues the opposite. An administrative rule cannot \u201cengraft an additional requirement onto the statute.\u201d <em>Giacomelli v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 24, 354 Mont. 15, 221 P.3d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b625 Whether or not the regulation is consistent with the statute, we disagree that the Casino Owners\u2019 position \u201cfalls within the range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>reasonable interpretation\u201d of either one. The four walls of the structures, including a common wall with the casinos, inside entrances, a roof, with electricity, carpeting, heating and air conditioning, clearly demonstrate that these are \u201cenclosed rooms,\u201d as stated in \u00a7 50-40-103(7), MCA, and are not \u201cpartially open to the outside air such as a roofed shelter,\u201d as stated in Admin. R. M. 37.113.101(2). The structures are much more than, and do not function solely as, a \u201croofed shelter.\u201d The small horizontal vents in the walls are the functional equivalent of \u201ccracking a window\u201d in a room to let in air, or of basement and attic venting of a house that does the same. Such venting does not turn the house or building into a partially open structure. We are convinced from a review of the statutory structure that the Legislature did not intend the statute to be applied in such a narrow and restrictive sense.</p>\n<p id=\"At4\">\u00b626  We conclude the Casino Owners\u2019 argument is without merit and the smoking structures are \u201cplaces of work\u201d within the meaning of the MCIAA. Given this conclusion, the structures are \u201cenclosed public places\u201d that are subject to the smoking prohibition of the MCIAA, and we need not consider whether the structures are open to the \u201cgeneral public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">\n<em>Judicial Admissions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b627 The Casino Owners argue the Board made a judicial admission in discovery that precludes the Board from contending on appeal that the smoking structures are a \u201cplace of work.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 The admission in question was made in response to the Casino Owners\u2019 Request for Admission No. 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Request for Admission No. 3: \u201cPlease admit that the smoking areas at Gold\u2019s Casino and/or Players Casino are partially open to the outside air.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">The Board\u2019s response: \u201cAdmit that they are partially open to the outside air, but not sufficiently for these areas to qualify as smoking shelters. In areas, they have permanently installed walls on all sides which extend from floor to ceiling. For future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>reference, the Defendant does not concede that smoking is legal or permissible in what Plaintiffs refer to as \u2018smoking areas\u2019 at these two casinos.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b628 A judicial admission is an express waiver conceding the truth of an alleged fact. <em>Bilesky, </em>\u00b6 12 (quotations omitted). A judicial admission \u201chas a conclusive effect upon the party who makes it, and prevents that party from introducing further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact.\u201d <em>In re Raymond W. George Trust, </em>1999 MT 223, \u00b6 36, 296 Mont. 56, 986 P.2d 427 (internal quotations omitted). In order for a statement to constitute a judicial admission, the statement must satisfy criteria, including, among other things, that the statement \u201cbe a statement of fact, and not a statement of opinion or law.\u201d <em>Bilesky, </em>\u00b6 13. The definition of a term in a statute is a statement of law. <em>State v. Dasen, </em>2007 MT 87, \u00b6 68, 337 Mont. 74, 155 P.3d 1282 (\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A4m\">\u00b629 Request for Admission No. 3 is linked to the language of Admin. R. M. 37.113.101(2), which excludes from the statutory definition of \u201cenclosed room\u201d an area that is \u201cpartially open to the outside air... .\u201d While we agree that the Board\u2019s admission to this Request can be characterized as factual, the Casino Owners attempt to bootstrap this admission into a concession by the Board that the smoking structures are not a place of work, and, therefore, not an enclosed public place. However, even though the Board admitted that the structures were partially open in a factual sense, that admission did not equate to the legal determination that the structures did not constitute an enclosed room or enclosed public place, as we have above determined to the contrary. Given our rejection of the Casino Owners\u2019 interpretation of the statute, the Board\u2019s factual admission is immaterial to the legal interpretation of the MCIAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b630 We conclude the Board is not precluded from contending on appeal that the smoking structures are places of work. As stated above, the smoking structures are, as a matter of law, enclosed public places and subject to the MCIAA\u2019s prohibition on smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Equitable Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b631 The Casino Owners argue the Board should be equitably estopped from enforcing the MCIAA because of the representations made by the Board\u2019s employees that the smoking structures were in compliance with the MCIAA. Equitable estoppel is common law doctrine based on the principle that \u201ca party cannot, through his intentional conduct, actions, language, or silence, induce another party to unknowingly and detrimentally alter his position and then subsequently deny the just and legal consequences of his intentional acts.\u201d <em>Stanley L. &amp; Carolyn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>M.

Troy Town Pump, </em>2001 MT 58, \u00b6 15, 304 Mont. 346, 21 P.3d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b633 The Casino Owners claim, with regard to the first element, that the Board\u2019s agents made representations of a material fact that the smoking structures were in compliance with the MCIAA. Because we conclude that the representations made by the Board\u2019s employees were misrepresentations of law and not fact, we address only the first element of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b634 In <em>City of Whitefish, </em>we addressed an analogous situation. <em>City of Whitefish, </em>2001 MT 58, 304 Mont. 346, 21 P.3d 1026. In that case, Town Pump decided to attach an awning to its facilities. However, the City of Whitefish had adopted strict ordinances for commercial signs. <em>City of Whitefish, </em>\u00b6 6. The Whitefish City Manager reviewed and approved blueprints for the awning before it was installed, and the Whitefish Building Inspector issued a building permit; both the City Manager and Building Inspector mistakenly believed the awning did not fall under the definition of \u201csign\u201d for purposes of the City\u2019s sign ordinance. After Town Pump installed the new awning, the Whitefish City Council concluded the awning constituted a \u201csign\u201d within the meaning of the City ordinance and that the sign violated the ordinance because it was too big. <em>City of Whitefish, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Town Pump argued the City should be estopped from enforcing the ordinance because of the representations made by the City\u2019s employees. This Court nonetheless affirmed the district court\u2019s decision that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply because the representations made by the employees were misrepresentations of law, not fact. <em>City of Whitefish, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b635  Our analysis in <em>City of Whitefish </em>is dispositive. As in <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Whitefish, </em>here the Board\u2019s employees reviewed and approved blue prints, issued a building permit, inspected the smoking structures, and made representations to the Casino Owners that the structures were in compliance with the law. The Board\u2019s employees, like the City of Whitefish\u2019s employees, were also ultimately mistaken with regard to the application of the law. If there is any factual distinction between <em>City of Whitefish </em>and the case at hand, it is that, unlike the Casino Owners, Town Pump actually received approval of the design prior to construction. Therefore, if anything, the Casino Owners have less of a claim in equity than did Town Pump. We conclude that, because any representations made by the Board were misrepresentations of law, the Casino Owners have failed to establish the first element of equitable estoppel and their claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b636 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to the Casino Owners for the preliminary injunction </em>proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"AC0_\">\u00b637 Pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, a court may award reasonable attorney fees against a government entity if: (1) the <em>\u201copposing party prevails </em>against the state, political subdivision, or agency; and (2) the \u201ccourt finds that the claim or defense of the state, political subdivision, or agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or <em>pursued in bad faith.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b638 The Board contends the District Court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to the Casino Owners for costs associated with the prehminary injunction proceeding, despite the fact it did not appeal the denial of the prehminary injunction. The Board offers that \u201c[b]ecause the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for [Casino Owners], having misconstrued the [MCIAA],\u201d the Casino Owners cannot be considered \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d for purposes of an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b639 The Casino Owners respond by focusing on the District Court\u2019s finding of bad faith on the part of the Board under the second prong of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA. The Casino Owners note the Board\u2019s \u201cever-changing legal position and interpretation of the [MCIAA], the fact that its agents and employees filed false complaints against Owners, that it singled out Owners, and that it was motivated to seek the prehminary injunction by an improper purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b640 Even if the District Court correctly concluded that the Board initiated the request for a prehminary injunction in bad faith, the Casino Owners must also demonstrate, apart from the Board\u2019s motives, that they are the prevailing party in the litigation in order to recover attorney fees. The second prong of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, does not subsume the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00b641 The term \u201cprevailing party\u201d is \u201ca legal term of art.\u201d <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 603, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 1839, 149 L. Ed. 2d 855, 862 (2001). As a general rule, the \u201cprevailing party is the one who has an affirmative judgment rendered in his favor at the conclusion of the entire case.\u201d <em>Avanta Fed. Credit Union v. Shupak, </em>2009 MT 458, \u00b6 49, 354 Mont. 372, 223 P.3d 863 (citations omitted). Though we have approved an award of attorney fees to a party who did not obtain an affirmative judgment on the merits, the party nonetheless obtained the \u201c \u2018very relief it sought to procure through litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens for Balanced Use v. Mont. Fish, </em>2014 MT 214, \u00b6 15, 376 Mont. 202, 331 P.3d 844 (quoting <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 44, 333 Mont. 331,142 P.3d 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b642 The Casino Owners sought to prevent the Board from prohibiting smoking in the smoking structures. The Casino Owners have neither obtained a final determination of the underlying controversy in their favor, nor a material alteration in the parties\u2019 legal relationship that provided them the relief they sought to procure through litigation. The Casino Owners\u2019 initial success regarding the preliminary injunction was short-lived, and when the matter proceeded to a final determination, they were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b643 Although the Casino Owners did succeed in the preliminary injunction proceeding, we explained in <em>Dreyer v. Bd. of Trs., </em>193 Mont. 95, 630 P.2d 226 (1981), that success at the preliminary injunction stage is not necessarily dispositive in determining the prevailing party. In <em>Dreyer, </em>members of the Mid-Rivers Telephone Co-op sought an injunction against the Board of Trustees of the Co-op to prevent them from holding a special meeting and election. The district court issued the injunction prohibiting the Board of Trustees from proceeding and the Board did not appeal the decision. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont. at 96, 630 P.2d at 227. The plaintiff members sought an award of attorney fees, which the court granted. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont. at 96-97, 630 P.2d at 227. This Court reversed and determined the court erred by awarding attorney fees to the plaintiff members based upon the injunction proceeding. We reasoned that \u201cto equate the \u201clikelihood of success\u2019 that justifies a preliminary injunction with \u2018success\u2019 in the underlying litigation ignores significant procedural differences between preliminary and permanent injunctions.\u201dDreyer, 193 Mont. at 101, 630 P.2d at 229. We concluded that the \u201cplaintiffs have not yet prevailed in the action\u201d and remanded the case to the district court to \u201cdetermine the ultimate rights of the parties,\u201d prior to taking up the question of attorney fees. <em>Dreyer, </em>193 Mont. at 100-101, 630 P.2d at 229. As noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>above, cases since <em>Dreyer </em>have demonstrated that obtaining an injunction may be sufficient to support an award of attorney fees if it constitutes the very relief sought in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b644  Here, while the Casino Owners prevailed on the preliminary injunction, the ultimate rights of the parties have now been determined and the Casino Owners have failed on the merits. The Casino Owners are not the prevailing party under \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, and do not qualify for an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b645 Our law is consistent with that applied by the federal courts, which have held that, in the absence of a final judgment in the case, such as when a settlement is reached or the case is rendered moot, \u201cthere may be circumstances in which a preliminary injunction results in sufficiently enduring change to warrant an award of <em>fees[.] Higher Taste, Inc. v. City of Tacoma, </em>717 F.3d 712, 717 (9th Cir. 2013). Those circumstances do not exist when a party \u201csucceeds at the preliminary injunction stage but loses on the merits after the case is litigated to final judgment\u201d because in that instance the party \u201csecures only an \u2018ephemeral\u2019 victory and gains no \u2018enduring\u2019 change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Higher Taste, </em>717 F.3d at 717 (citing <em>Sole v. Wyner, </em>551 U.S. 74, 86, 127 S. Ct. 2188, 2196, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1069, 1079 (2007)). As the United States Supreme Court concluded in <em>Sole v. Wyner, </em>a party \u201cwho secures a preliminary injunction, then loses on the merits as the case plays out and judgment is entered against her, has won a battle but lost the war.\u201d <em>Sole v. Wyner, </em>551 U.S. at 86, 127 S. Ct. at 2196, 167 L. Ed. 2d at 1079 (quotations and brackets omitted). Accordingly, the award of attorney fees must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b646 We reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and award of attorney fees.

Because they make this argument for the first time on appeal, we will not address it. <em>See Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s Fresh Foods, Inc. v.

The Casino Owners\u2019 position is that, because the shelters have a roof that is lower than the casinos\u2019 main roof, they are not \u201cunder one roof\u2019 and therefore are not part of the \u201cestablishment.\u201d However, the statute does not require that an establishment\u2019s roof be a solitary unit at a single height. The smoking structures are physically attached to the facility and roofed, thus satisfying that part of the definition of \u201cestablishment,\u201d but more importantly, they are part of the sole \u201centerprise ... for which a single person, agency, corporation, or legal entity is responsible.\u201d Section 50-40-103(4), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\"> The District Court mistakenly attributed this language to the statute, instead of the regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"> The Casino Owners also contend the Board made a separate judicial admission that precludes the Board from arguing that the smoking structures are open to the \u201cgeneral public.\u201d The admission was made in response to Request for Admission No. 6, which reads: \u201cPlease admit that if the Plaintiffs, by rule, policy, or procedure, limit access to the smoking areas at Gold\u2019s Casino and/or Players Casino to a group of individuals that is less than every member of the general public, then the general public would not be allowed to enter such smoking areas.\u201d As we do not address the question of whether the structures are open to the general public, we need not address the arguments made regarding this admission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
