They have one minor child, B.W., who is autistic. Initially, the parties agreed that Crissy would be the primary residential parent and B.W. would visit Jim on an alternating, two-week basis. In October 2010, Crissy notified Jim of her intention to move to Bellingham, Washington. The parties participated in two mediation sessions, with two different mediators, during this time. In July 2011, Doctor Jennifer Simon-Thomas evaluated B.W. and made several written recommendations, including increases in speech and language therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b64 On August 16,2011, the District Court held a hearing on the issue of Criss/s relocation to Washington. The Court concluded that Crissy could move and that it was in B.W.\u2019s best interest to continue living with Crissy. Crissy relocated to Washington and has remained there since. The parties then entered into a stipulation setting forth a new visitation schedule, whereby Jim would travel to Washington once a month and Crissy would bring B.W. to Montana once a month. The parties later informally changed this plan, as the travel put strain on B.W. The stipulation also required Crissy to follow Dr. Simon-Thomas\u2019 recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u00b65 On September 26,2012, Jim filed a motion for modification of the parenting plan requesting that the District Court grant him primary residential custody of B.W. Jim claimed that Crissy had failed to follow the recommendations of Dr. Simon-Thomas. In response, Crissy filed a brief in opposition to Jim\u2019s motion, requesting that the court implement her proposed amended parenting plan formalizing the parties\u2019 informal visitation plan and that Jim pay her attorney\u2019s fees. Included in the proposed parenting plan was a provision to transfer jurisdiction to Washington State.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b66 On April 26,2013, the District Court held a contested hearing on Jim\u2019s motion. At the hearing, Jim partially rescinded his request to be the primary custodial parent on the condition that B.W. receive additional speech therapy. Due to timing issues at the District Court, a second day of hearing was scheduled. On the second day, Jim\u2019s lawyer clarified that Jim no longer sought the change in residential custody, but still requested the increase in out-of-school speech therapy. After it became clear that Jim had not conferred with Crissy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>about his proposal, the judge suggested the parties recess to discuss the issues. The parties were able to reach an agreement on a number of items, but remained divided on four issues \u2014 jurisdiction, canceled visitation, additional speech therapy, and attorney\u2019s fees. The District Court ruled that the jurisdiction issue was not ripe, that Crissy must arrange make-up visits, and denied the request for additional speech therapy. Additionally, the District Court ordered Jim to pay Criss/s attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against his motion to amend the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b67 On May 29, 2014, the District Court conducted a hearing on the reasonableness of the fees and ordered Jim to pay $10,359. At the hearing, Crissy presented testimony from family-law attorney Mary Obermiller, who testified that the fees were reasonable given the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the matter. The District Court stated its basis for the award, noting that \u201cafter the hearing it became clear to me that the evaluation had been done by the school, Ms. Impero [Crissy] was abiding by that, and it was in the best interest everything that was being done.\u201d Additionally, the judge indicated that she awarded the fees because Jim did not prevail on his motion. Jim appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b68 We review a district corut\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in a dissolution action for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>2006 MT 56, \u00b6 23, 331 Mont. 315, 132 P.3d 535. \u201cA district court has abused its discretion if substantial evidence does not support its award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Marriage of Dennison, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u00b69 <em>Issue: Whether the District Court erred when it ordered Jim to pay Crissy\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u00b610 District courts have the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees. <em>In re Marriage of Brownell, </em>263 Mont. 78, 85, 865 P.2d 307, 311 (1993). Pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA, a district court \u201cmay order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the costs to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding raider chapters 1 and 4,\u201d An award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 40-4-110 must be reasonable, based on necessity, and rooted in competent evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Barnard, </em>241 Mont. 147, 154, 785 P.2d 1387, 1391 (1990). This Court will not disturb an award of fees if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Barnard, </em>241 Mont. at 154, 785 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>1392 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b611 Jim argues that \u00a7 40-4-110 does not apply to this case because the statute is directed at marital financial resources. Additionally, he argues that the District Court did not make any specific findings as to the statute, nor did it consider the parties\u2019 financial resources. Contrary to Jim\u2019s arguments, \u00a7 40-4-110 does apply to this case. The statue permits a district court to award attorney\u2019s fees incurred defending or maintaining actions under various chapters of Title 40, MCA, including Chapter 4 \u201cTermination of Marriage, Child Custody, Support.\u201d Moreover, the Commissioners\u2019 Notes specifically note that the authority to award fees and costs extends to \u201cdifferent stages of the proceedings\u201d and the statute expressly allows \u201csums for legal and professional services rendered... <em>after entry of judgment.\u201d </em>Section 40-4-110, MCA (emphasis added). This action was brought under Chapter 4 of Title 40, MCA, as Jim initially moved the District Court to alter the custodial arrangement, and \u00a7 40-4-110 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b612 Jim also argues that both parties prevailed on different issues and thus attorney\u2019s fees were inappropriate. Jim asserts that he abandoned his request to serve as the primary custodian after he decided B.W. would do best with Crissy, and that the sole issue was whether B.W. should receive additional speech therapy sessions. He maintains that although the District Court denied his request for additional speech therapy, Crissy lost on the issue of jurisdiction and makeup visitation. He cites <em>In re Marriage of Winters, </em>2004 MT 82, 320 Mont. 459, 87 P.3d 1005 and In <em>re Marriage of Pfennigs, </em>1999 MT 250, 296 Mont. 242, 989 P.2d 327, for the premise that attorney\u2019s fees are not appropriate when both parties prevail. <em>Winters </em>and <em>Pfennigs </em>are distinguishable from the facts in this case. The district courts in those cases relied on the parties\u2019 dissolution agreements, which provided for fees to the prevailing party. In <em>Winters, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to deny fees, and cited <em>Pfennigs </em>for the rule that \u201ca contractual provision awarding attorney fees to the prevailing party in a divorce action was not effective when each party prevailed on different issues.\u201d <em>Winters, </em>\u00b6 59 (citing <em>Pfennigs, </em>\u00b6 42). Here, the District Court did not base its award on the parties\u2019 contract and thus <em>Winters </em>and <em>Pfennigs </em>are factually distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b613  It is also important to note that \u00a7 40-4-110 does not require a party to prevail to receive attorney\u2019s fees. Under \u00a7 40-4-110, \u201cattorney fees are based on the respective financial resources of the parties and not based on which party prevailed.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Brownell, </em>263 Mont. at 85, 865 P.2d at 311. Instead, the district court judge examines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>what is reasonable in light of each party\u2019s circumstances. Awarding Crissy attorney\u2019s fees was not unreasonable when Jim changed his position on his motibn after eight months and caused the parties to expend considerable expenses to resolve an issue that may have been resolved through direct discussion or mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b614 Jim also argues that the District Court did not state a basis for the award. Although the judge did not make a specific reference to \u00a7 40-4-110, she did state the grounds on which she awarded the fees. On June 10, 2013, when ruling on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, the judge stated that the \u201chearing has changed substantially from what \u2014 what the Court was presented\u201d and the \u201cmotion could have been prevented if the parties had talked to one another prior to getting the Court involved.\u201d Additionally, at the hearing on reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees, the judge found that Jim presented no medical or professional basis for his request and B.W. was receiving proper therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b615 Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s order. First, as the District Court noted, the hearing could have been avoided had the parties discussed Jim\u2019s concerns. Nothing prevented Jim from speaking with Crissy directly; indeed the parties had utilized mediation multiple times in the past. However, the parties did not discuss Jim\u2019s concern until the hearing and only after the judge suggested the parties discuss the speech therapy off the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b616 Second, evidence at the hearing established that B.W. was receiving appropriate speech therapy services. Jim was unable to substantiate his claims that Crissy failed to follow the medical recommendations for B.W. For example, he testified that Dr. Simon-Thomas recommended speech therapy two or three times weekly, but then was unable to corroborate this statement with the doctor\u2019s report, which simply recommended \u201cincrease in speech and language therapy.... School-based service should continue, as well as outpatient adjunct therapy.\u201d Additionally, on cross-examination, Jim admitted to lying in his affidavit when he stated that Crissy had not placed B.W. in any speech therapy programs. At the hearing, he conceded to knowing that his daughter actually went to speech therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b617 Third, Crissy prevailed in establishing that B.W. received adequate speech therapy services. Although insurance and waiting lists initially prevented B.W. from receiving additional speech therapy services, she received in-school therapy weekly from the outset. At the time of the hearing, B.W. received one hour of out-of-school therapy, in addition to the school-based services and equine therapy, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>registered to participate in a summer program for autistic children. Jim testified that he was happy with B.W.\u2019s school and pleased with her participation in the equine and summer programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b618  Finally, Jim\u2019s decision to change his mind at the last minute resulted in unnecessary legal costs to Crissy that may have been avoidable. The District Court heard testimony from Crissy that she had to sell a car, take out a loan, and max out her credit cards to hire an attorney to defend against Jim\u2019s motion. Under these facts, the District Court had discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b619 Crissy has requested this Court to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal. We decline to award Crissy fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
