We reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b62 The plaintiffs in this case filed suit in the District Court, challenging the constitutionality of two laws: (1) a 2011 law requiring parental notification before a minor may obtain an abortion, and (2) a 2013 law requiring parental consent before a minor may obtain an abortion. The plaintiffs argue that a 1999 district court ruling which held unconstitutional a similar, 1995 law requiring parental notification before a minor may obtain an abortion now prevents litigation of the issues raised in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b63 This appeal involves only the narrow procedural question of whether the 1999 District Court order prevents the State from defending the constitutionality of the current parental notification and parental consent laws on grounds of issue preclusion. The rule of issue preclusion prevents the same parties from relitigating an issue already decided in another case. For the rule to apply in this case, the issues in the current case must be identical to the issues in the 1999 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b64 The issues decided in the 1999 case were constitutional questions specific to the 1995 parental notification law that was challenged in that case. Specifically, the constitutional questions decided were: whether the 1995 law infringed upon the fundamental rights of minors; whether the State could assert a sufficiently compelling interest to justify the 1995 law\u2019s infringement on the fundamental rights of minors; and whether the 1995 law complied with the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Constitution\u2019s restriction against infringement upon minors\u2019 rights unless doing so enhances the protection of minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">\u00b65 Although the laws that are the subject of the current challenge are similar to the 1995 law, they differ in substantive respects. Therefore, the issues to be decided in this case, while similar, are not identical to the previous case. Thus, as discussed below, issue preclusion does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b66 In 1995, the Montana Legislature enacted a law prohibiting physicians from providing an abortion to a minor under the age of 18 without first giving notice to the minor\u2019s parents or legal guardian. <em>See </em>Parental Notice of Abortion Act, \u00a7\u00a7 50-20-201 to 50-20-215, MCA (1995) (repealed 2011) (\u201c1995 Parental Notification Act\u201d). Planned Parenthood filed suit in the First Judicial District Court, challenging the 1995 Parental Notification Act\u2019s constitutionality. The District Court ruled the law was unconstitutional. <em>Wicklund v. State, </em>1999 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 1116 (1st Jud. Dist. Feb. 11, 1999) (ADV 97-671). The State did not appeal that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b67 In 2011, the Legislature drafted legislative referendum LR-120, the Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 2011, to be placed on the 2012 ballot (\u201c2011 Parental Notification Act\u201d). <em>See </em>2011 Mont. Laws 307. The referendum was passed by voters. LR-120 prohibited physicians from performing an abortion on a minor under 16 years of age without first giving notice to the minor\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b68 In 2013, the Legislature enacted the Parental Consent for Abortion Act of 2013 (\u201c2013 Parental Consent Act\u201d). <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 50-20-501 to 50-20-511, MCA. The 2013 Parental Consent Act requires a physician to obtain a signed consent form from a parent or guardian before performing an abortion on a minor under 18 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b69 On May 30, 2013, the plaintiffs, Planned Parenthood and Dr. Henke, filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the 2011 Parental Notification Act and the 2013 Parental Consent Act. The plaintiffs argued that the parties and issues in the current case were the same parties litigating the same issues in the <em>Wicklund </em>case; therefore, the plaintiffs contended that the doctrine of issue preclusion bars the State from defending the constitutionality of the 2011 Parental Notification Act and the 2013 Parental Consent Act. On June 17, 2013, the State filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that issue preclusion did not apply because the issue in the immediate case was different from the issue in <em>Wicklund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u00b610 On January 31, 2014, the District Court issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor on the grounds that issue preclusion barred the State from defending the constitutionality of the 2011 Parental Notification Act and the 2013 Parental Consent Act. The District Court concluded that the parties in the two cases were the same, the issues in the cases were identical, and the State had a full and fair opportunity to litigate these issues to a final judgment in <em>Wicklund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b611 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s rulings on motions for summary judgment de novo. <em>Gibbs v. Altenhofen, </em>2014 MT 200, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 61, 330 P.3d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b612 Issue preclusion bars a party from reopening an issue that was litigated and determined in a prior suit. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267. We apply a four-element test to determine whether relitigation of an issue is barred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical to the issue raised in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">3. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">4. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue which may be barred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-12\"><em>McDaniel v. State, </em>2009 MT 159, \u00b6 28, 350 Mont. 422, 208 P.3d 817 <em>(citing Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18). All four of these elements must be satisfied in order for issue preclusion to apply. In the present case, we find that the first element has not been satisfied. Therefore, we do not address the remaining three elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">\u00b613 For the first element to be met, the issues in the instant case must be identical to the issues in the prior case. The identity of issues is the most important element of issue preclusion. <em>Stapleton v. First Sec. Bank, </em>207 Mont. 248, 258, 675 P.2d 83, 89 (1983). \u201cUnless it clearly appears that the precise question involved in the second case was raised and determined in the former, the judgment is no bar to the second action.\u201d <em>Phx. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Brainard, </em>82 Mont. 39, 44, 265 P. 10, 12 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b614 In <em>Wicklund, </em>the issues were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">[W]hether the challenged legislation [the 1995 Parental Notification Act] infringes pregnant minors\u2019 rights to privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[W]hether there is a compelling state interest sufficient to justify the [1995 Parental Notification] Act\u2019s infringement on the class\u2019 fundamental right to privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[W]hether the [1995 Parental Notification] Act complies with the mandates of Article II, Section 15, of the Montana Constitution, which allows the legislature to limit the fundamental rights of minors, if the exception enhances the protection of such minors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acd\"><em>Wicklund, </em>1999 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 1116 at 6-7, 11, 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"A55\">\u00b615 Although the issues decided in the <em>Wicklund </em>case were specific to the 1995 Parental Notification Act, the issues in the instant case address the same constitutional questions about the two laws presently being challenged. Thus, the issues would be identical if the laws were substantively identical. The laws, however, are not substantively identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b616 Comparing the 2011 Parental Notification Act to the 1995 Parental Notification Act evinces two substantive differences. First, the 1995 Act applied to minors under age 18, whereas the 2011 Act applies only to minors under age 16. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 50-20-203(6), MCA (1995), <em>with </em>\u00a7 50-20-223(5), MCA (2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, although both Acts allow a minor to bypass her parents\u2019 involvement by court order, the judicial bypass procedure in the 1995 Act required a minor to prove she should be exempted from the notice requirement by clear and convincing evidence. The 2011 Act is silent as to the minor\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 50-20-212(4), MCA (1995), <em>with </em>\u00a7 50-20-232(4), MCA (2011). Since the 2011 Act is silent on the subject, the burden is presumably a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See In re R.A.J., </em>2009 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 349 Mont. 100, 201 P.3d 787 (\u201cThe burden of proof in a civil case is preponderance of the evidence.\u201d) <em>(citing </em>\u00a7 26-1-403, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b617 Turning to the 2013 Parental Consent Act, we similarly note two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>substantive differences between it and the 1995 Parental Notification Act. First, the 1995 Parental Notification Act required only that notice be given to the minor\u2019s parents or legal guardian, whereas the 2013 Parental Consent Act requires that the parents or legal guardian consent to the abortion. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 50-20-203(6), MCA (1995), <em>with </em>\u00a7 50-20-504, MCA (2013). Second, in the 2013 Parental Consent Act a minor seeking a judicial bypass from the consent requirement does not have to prove her eligibility for an exemption by clear and convincing evidence as was required by the 1995 Act, making the burden in the 2013 Parental Consent Act a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 50-20-212(4), MCA (1995), <em>with </em>\u00a7 50-20-509(4), MCA (2013); <em>see In re </em>R.A.J., \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b618 In holding that issue preclusion applied to the 2013 Parental Consent Act, the District Court noted that the 2013 Parental Consent Act\u2019s consent requirement is more restrictive than the 1995 Act\u2019s notice requirement which was found to be unconstitutional in <em>Wicklund. </em>While this is true, it does not weigh in favor of issue preclusion. To the contrary, the fact that the 2013 Parental Consent Act is more restrictive highlights that the two laws are not identical. Whether, or to what extent, those differences make the 2013 Parental Consent Act more or less apt to pass constitutional muster as opposed to the 1995 Parental Notification Act is not the question before us. The question before us is only whether the issues in the two cases are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"ApI\">\u00b619 The Dissent submits that issue preclusion bars relitigation of this issue because the issues were \u201cput to rest in <em>Wicklund.\u201d </em>The Dissent contends that the exact issue that is present here \u2014 whether the State\u2019s asserted compelling interests justify an impingement on the constitutional rights of pregnant minors who choose to obtain an abortion \u2014 was the exact issue that was litigated in <em>Wicklund. </em>Dissent, \u00b6 28. The Dissent goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">It cannot reasonably be asserted, nor does the Court do so, that differences in age of the minor affected or provision of a burden of proof have any bearing on the constitutionality of the Acts in question, as \u2014 clearly\u2014the constitutionality of the interests at stake do not hinge upon these minor variations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b620 Regarding the 2011 Parental Notification Act, we do not consider the age of the minor affected to be a \u201cminor variation\u201d for purposes of determining whether issue preclusion applies. The 1995 Parental Notification Act applied to all minors under the age of 18; the 2011 Parental Notification Act applies to minors under the age of 16. Both <em>Wicklund </em>and the present case implicate the constitutionality of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>respective Acts within the context of Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 15, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\">The rights of persons under 18 years of age shall include, but not be limited to, all the fundamental rights of this Article <em>unless specifically precluded by laws which enhance the protection of such persons. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">It is axiomatic that the younger a minor is, the more protection she may require. Accordingly, a parental notification requirement may conceivably be more likely to enhance the protection of a 15-year-old than it would a 17-year-old. Whether or not this, in fact, proves to be the case is a question to be addressed on its merits. That this issue should be addressed on its merits, however, is precisely why issue preclusion does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b621 As it pertains to the 2013 Parental Consent Act, the issue in <em>Wicklund </em>was not whether the State\u2019s asserted compelling interests could ever justify <em>any </em>infringement on a minor\u2019s right to an abortion. The issue was only whether the State\u2019s asserted compelling interests could justify a law requiring minors under 18 to notify their parents before obtaining an abortion. Whether a parental consent law can pass constitutional muster when the <em>Wicklund </em>court held that a parental notification law could not is no doubt an argument that will be made to the District Court when this matter is resolved on its merits. It is, however, just that \u2014 an argument on the merits. The distinction does not serve to bar the argument entirely on grounds of issue preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"AbJ\">\u00b622 We also cannot agree with the Dissent\u2019s characterization of the lower burden of proof to obtain a judicial bypass in the current Acts as compared to the 1995 Act as a \u201cminor variation.\u201d Although the Dissent acknowledges that \u201cin other contexts these variations could be significant,\u201d it is difficult to conceive of a context in which changing the burden of proof in a statute would not be significant. If, for example, a criminal statute is in all respects identical to a predecessor statute except it allows conviction by a preponderance of the evidence instead of beyond a reasonable doubt, this variation would certainly merit an inquiry into the constitutionality of such a statute on its own merits.</p>\n<p id=\"A8V\">\u00b623  The Dissent and the District Court based their reasoning on the similarity between the old law and the new. The 2011 Parental Notification Act and the 2013 Parental Consent Act are indeed similar to the 1995 Act. Issue preclusion requires more than similarity, however, it requires that the issues be identical. As the U.S. Supreme Court held, for issue preclusion to function as intended, \u201cIt must be confined to situations where the matter raised in the second suit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>identical in all respects </em>with that decided in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 599-600, 68 S. Ct. 715, 720 (1948) (emphasis added). The material differences between the current statutes at issue and the 1995 Parental Notification Act do not meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b624 The Dissent next asserts that the Coturt is resolving this case on grounds not raised by the State in the District Court or in its opening brief, contending that the State made this \u201cwholly new argument\u201d in its reply brief on appeal. Dissent, \u00b6 35. This assertion is incorrect. Although the State better articulated this argument in its reply brief on appeal than in its earlier briefing, it did raise this argument in its opening brief before the District Court, asserting: \u201cThe \u2018identical\u2019 requirement alone pretermits collateral estoppel in this case, because the laws challenged here, although similar, are obviously not the <em>same </em>law at issue in <em>Wicklund.\u201d </em>Br. in Supp. of St.\u2019s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b625 More to the point, the cases and arguments offered by the Dissent are inapposite to the current situation before us, as they apply where a wholly new issue is presented for the first time on appeal or in a reply brief. The State\u2019s reply brief, however, did not ask us to consider something we otherwise would not have considered in this appeal. The question of whether issue preclusion applies is the sole question in front of us. Issue preclusion is a legal determination we review de novo, without deference to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727 (\u201cOn questions of law, the parties are entitled to full review by the appellate court without special deference to the views of the trial court.\u201d). Conducting full review of the legal question here requires us to determine whether all four elements of issue preclusion are met, beginning with the question of whether the issue decided in the prior case is identical to the issue raised in the current case. <em>See McDaniel, </em>\u00b6 19 (first element of issue preclusion is identity of issues). Irrespective of whether the State articulated this precise argument within the broader issue preclusion context, we would nevertheless be compelled to address it because we cannot resolve the legal issue here without doing so. \u201cWhen an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.\u201d <em>Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., </em>500 U.S. 90, 99, 111 S. Ct. 1711, 1718 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">\u00b626 Because the first element of issue preclusion is not met, issue preclusion does not apply in this case. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-4\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-11\"> To promote clarity, the trend has been to use the term \u201cissue preclusion\u201d in lieu of \u201ccollateral estoppel.\u201d <em>See McDaniel v.

First, the District Court correctly applied the principles of issue preclusion to conclude that the State was barred from defending the constitutionality of the Parental Notification Act and the Parental Consent Act. Second, the Court violates bedrock Montana law by deciding this case in favor of the State on grounds not raised by the State either in the District Court or in its opening brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b628 I first address the correctness of the District Court\u2019s decision that issue preclusion bars relitigation of the issues put to rest in <em>Wicklund. </em>The issue before the District Court was whether the State\u2019s asserted compelling interests justify an impingement on the constitutional rights of pregnant minors who choose to obtain an abortion. This was the exact issue that was litigated in <em>Wicklund, </em>1999 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 1116, at *11; thus, the first element of the issue preclusion test set forth in <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18, is satisfied. Likewise, the remaining three elements of the four-part test to determine whether relitigation of an issue is barred are also satisfied: there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication and no appeal was taken; the party against whom preclusion is now asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication; and the State was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue now barred. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b629 The Court concludes that the issue decided in <em>Wicklund </em>is not identical to the issue presented here, relying upon variations between the ages of the minors in the Acts, the fact that one Act sets forth the burden of proof while the other did not, and that one Act allows the appointment of a public defender for a minor seeking judicial bypass while no similar provision was contained in the 1995 Act. While in other contexts these variations could be significant, in this context they are wholly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b630 In <em>Wicklund, </em>the district court struck down a law that required minors to notify a parent before terminating a pregnancy, finding that it violated the Montana Constitution\u2019s express guarantees of privacy, equal protection, and the rights of minors. The 2011 parental notification law and the 2013 parental consent law both purport to advance four compelling state interests: \u201c(a) protecting minors against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>their own immaturity\u201d; (b) \u201cfostering family unity and preserving the family as a viable social unit\u201d; (c) \u201cprotecting the constitutional rights of parents to rear children who are members of their household\u201d; and (d) \u201creducing teenage pregnancy and unnecessary abortion.\u201d Section 50-20-202(2), MCA (2011); \u00a7 50-20-502(2), MCA (2013). These are the exact same state interests, word for word, that are set forth in the 1995 Act that <em>Wicklund </em>struck down. Section 50-20-202(2), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">\u00b631 As the Court\u2019s Opinion notes, the issue here is whether the State should be prevented from defending the <em>constitutionality </em>of the current parental notification and parental consent laws. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 3. It cannot reasonably be asserted, nor does the Court do so, that differences in the age of the minor affected or provision of a burden of proof have any bearing on the constitutionality of the Acts in question, as \u2014 clearly\u2014the constitutionality of the interests at stake do not hinge upon these minor variations. The Court nonetheless seizes upon these inconsequential distinctions that have nothing to do with the constitutionality of the law while altogether ignoring the verbatim identity of the State interests underlying the 1995 Act struck down in <em>Wicklund </em>and the two Acts here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b632 The Court\u2019s second transgression is that it resolves the case before us on grounds not raised by the State either in the District Court or in its opening brief on appeal. Our eases are legion for the proposition that we will not consider on appeal an issue not raised in the District Court. In <em>Kurtzenacker v. Davis Surveying, Inc </em>., 2012 MT 105, \u00b6 17, 365 Mont. 71, 278 P.3d 1002, we explained \u201cWe generally refase to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal because \u2018it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 78, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244. We have also said repeatedly that we will not consider issues raised by the appellant for the first time in its reply brief. To do so would unfairly \u201ctilt the balance in a case in favor of the party who gets the final word in presenting its arguments to this Court.\u201d <em>State v. Sattler, </em>1998 MT 57, \u00b6 47, 288 Mont. 79, 956 P.2d 54; M. R. App. P. 12(3) (\u201cThe reply brief must be confined to new matter raised in the brief of the appellee.\u201d). The Court utterly ignores these long-standing rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b633 The State argued in the District Court that collateral estoppel should not be applied to it because there have been significant factual and legal developments that have occurred with respect to the issues under consideration since <em>Wicklund </em>was decided. It also argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>collateral estoppel should not be applied against the government, and that parents have a strong and legitimate interest in involving themselves in a minor\u2019s abortion decision. The State did <em>not </em>argue in the District Court that the elements of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b634 In its opening brief on appeal to this Court, the State made the same arguments it made in the District Court. On three occasions in its opening brief, the State framed and re-framed the issue on appeal: \u201cThe question currently before this Court is whether there have been significant legal and factual developments since <em>Wicklund </em>that support Montana\u2019s argument that it has strong interests in protecting minors, protecting families, and protecting parents\u2019 rights\u201d; \u201cThe only issue in this appeal is whether any changed circumstances since <em>Wicklund </em>would counsel revisiting whether the State has compelling interests\u201d; and \u201cthe State is arguing that collateral estoppel should not apply in cases, like this one, involving important constitutional issues of public importance.\u201d The State made a passing and somewhat specious argument that the parties in this case are not identical to the parties in <em>Wicklund, </em>but it did not at all contend that the issues to be decided in the present litigation were different than those decided in <em>Wicklund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b635 The suggestion that the issues presently before the Court and those decided in <em>Wicklund </em>are not identical was presented by the State for the first time in its reply brief to this Court. The State replaced counsel who wrote the opening brief with a different attorney, who presented the wholly new argument in reply that the Court now appropriates. As noted above, we have not tolerated this tactic when employed by previous appellants, and I cannot fathom why we do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b636 In sum, the Court errs in its application of the issue preclusion test and in recasting the issue on appeal for the benefit of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag7\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
