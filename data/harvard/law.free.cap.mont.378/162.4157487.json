The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) denied her request. The decision was affirmed through administrative proceedings, and Bailey requested judicial review. The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, also affirmed the Department\u2019s decision denying authorization for the procedure. Bailey appeals and asks that the Department be required to conduct a determination of medical necessity for the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u00b62 The issue presented for review is whether an administrative rule excluding from coverage under the Montana Medicaid program all invasive procedures undertaken for the purpose of weight reduction, including gastric bypass surgery, is unreasonable and contrary to federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">\u00b63 The parties have stipulated to the facts summarized here. Bailey is a 51-year-old mother of three sons, the youngest of whom is eight years old. Bailey is approximately five feet, three inches tall, and weighs 445 pounds. Her body mass index is over 60 and she is considered morbidly obese. Bailey qualifies for the Montana Medicaid program as categorically needy because she is legally blind. Bailey has been legally blind in her right eye since birth. In 2004, she was hit in her left eye with a paintball, which caused her eyesight to degenerate further. In 1990, a car she was in was hit by a train, causing long-term injuries to her ribs, knees, and back. In 2000, both her legs were broken in a fall, and she received pins and screws in both legs. Her ankles sometimes \u2018lock up,\u201d leaving her unable to walk for days. In April 2012, Bailey underwent spinal surgery. Bailey has medical conditions including hypertension; diabetes mellitus type 2; edema/venous insufficiency; advancing osteoarthritis of the shoulders, hips, and knees; arthritis of the spine and a disc bulge pressing on her spinal cord; atypical chest pain; hypoventilation syndrome/asthma; obstructive sleep apnea; hypothyroidism; and significant restless leg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b64 Bailey has attempted to lose weight by participating in the Weight Watchers and Take Off Pounds Sensibly programs. She also participated in a year-long weight loss study through the Missoula Community Medical Center. She had some success using diet pills, which were later taken off the market. In 2011, she lost fifty pounds due to a low-carbohydrate diet and exercise. Bailey\u2019s many injuries and medical conditions, however, limit her exercise ability. Her three physicians, Dr. Elena Furrow, Dr. Joseph Knapp, and Dr. Timothy Richards, have each written letters to the Department stating that Bailey is a good candidate for gastric bypass surgery. Dr. Furrow stated that if Bailey underwent gastric bypass or other bariatric surgery, \u201cshe would most likely have improvement and even complete resolution\u201d of her chronic medical conditions. Dr. Knapp stated that Bailey\u2019s \u201cmajor medical factor is her weight,\u201d and \u201cabsent aggressive management of her weight, she will become more complicated from a health care standpoint, and become more problematic for medical management.\u201d Dr. Richards stated that gastric bypass surgery \u201cwould subsequently help all of her other medical problems.\u201d None of the physicians specifically stated that gastric bypass surgery was necessary or the only means by which Bailey\u2019s condition could be improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b65 On April 28, 2011, Dr. Richards asked the Department to authorize gastric bypass surgery for Bailey. The request was denied because gastric bypass surgery is a non-covered service under Department administrative rules. Bailey requested an administrative hearing, at which she argued that the Department\u2019s blanket exclusion of gastric bypass surgery from Medicaid coverage was unreasonable and contrary to federal law. Hearing Officer James L. Keil determined that the Department\u2019s basis for excluding gastric bypass surgery was rational and reasonable, because it was based on fiscal necessity. Keil also determined that although the Department had excluded certain treatments, it had not \u201csingled out obesity as a non-covered condition\u201d or discriminated on the basis of obesity. The Board of Public Assistance adopted the decision of the Hearing Officer, and Bailey requested judicial review in the District Court. The District Court affirmed the Department\u2019s decision to deny authorization for gastric bypass surgery, also concluding that the basis for the exclusion was reasonable. The District Court observed that Bailey had presented no evidence showing that all possible treatments for obesity were excluded from the Montana Medicaid program. Bailey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s decision on judicial review of an agency decision to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the conclusions of law are correct. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont. v.

If a state chooses to participate, however, it must comply with federal requirements. <em>Wilder, </em>496 U.S. at 502, 110 S. Ct. at 2513.

The mandatory service areas, within which a participating state must provide financial assistance, include inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, laboratory and x-ray services, nursing facility services, and services furnished by a physician, nurse midwife, or nurse practitioner. <em>Beal, </em>432 U.S. at 440 n. 2, 97 S.

Eire consistent with the objectives\u201d of Title XIX. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17) (2012); <em>Beal, 432 </em>U.S. at 441, 444, 97 S. Ct. at 2369, 2377. States are afforded \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in determining the scope of medical assistance to be provided. <em>Beal, 432 </em>U.S. at 444, 97 S. Ct. at 2371. While \u201cserious statutory questions might be presented\u201d if a state MedicEdd program were to exclude medically necessary treatments, it is well within a state\u2019s discretion to exclude \u201cunnecessary \u2014 though perhaps desirable \u2014 medical services.\u201d <em>Beal, </em>432 U.S. at 445, 97 S.

A state may not \u201carbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service ... solely because of the diagnosis, type of illness, or condition,\u201d but may \u201cplace appropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures.\u201d 42 C.F.K. \u00a7 440.230 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b610 Montana is a Medicaid participEint, and the Montana Medicaid program is administered by the Department. Section 53-6-101(1), MCA. The MontEina Medicaid program serves the \u201cpurpose of providing necessary medical services to eligible persons who have need for medical assistEince.\u201d Section 53-6-101(1), MCA. The Legislature has adopted the following statutory provisions guiding the Department\u2019s administration of the program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(2) The department Eind the legislature shall consider the following funding principles when considering chEmges in medicEiid policy that either increase or reduce services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">(a) protecting those persons who are most vulnerable and most in need, as defined by a combination of economic, social, and medical circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">(b) giving preference to the elimination or restoration of an entire medicaid program or service, rather than sacrifice or augment the quality of care for severEd programs or services through dilution of funding; Eind</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(c) giving priority to services that employ the science of prevention to reduce disability and illness, services that treat life-threatening conditions, and services that support independent or assisted living, including pain mEmagement, to reduce the need for acute inpatient or residential care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">(12) If available funds are not sufficient to provide medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>assistance for all eligible persons, the department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding principles set forth in subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Section 53-6-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b611 The Department has promulgated rules defining medically necessary services. Under these rules,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201cMedically necessary service\u201d means a service or item reimbursable under the Montana Medicaid program, as provided in these rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">(a) Which is reasonably calculated to prevent, diagnose, correct, cure, alleviate, or prevent the worsening of conditions in a patient which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">(i) endanger life;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(ii) cause suffering or pain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">(iii) result in illness or infirmity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">(iv) threaten to cause or aggravate a handicap; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">(v) cause physical deformity or malfunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">(b) A service or item is not medically necessary if there is another service or item for the recipient that is equally safe and effective and substantially less costly including, when appropriate, no treatment at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">Admin. R, Mont. 37.82.102(18). The Montana Medicaid program provides coverage in 35 service areas, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, laboratory and x-ray services, physician services, home health care, ambulance services, and physical and occupational therapy. Admin. R. Mont. 37.85.206(1). Certain services are excluded from coverage under the Montana Medicaid program, including chiropractic services, acupuncture services, naturopathic services, dietician services, physical therapy aide services, surgical technician services, nutritional services, massage services, dietary supplements, infertility treatment, and experimental treatment. Admin. R. Mont. 37.85.207(2). Also excluded from coverage are \u201call invasive medical procedures undertaken for the purpose of weight reduction such as gastric bypass, gastric banding, or bariatric surgery, including all revisions.\u201d Admin. R. Mont. 37.85.207(2)(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">\u00b612 New cases have directly addressed the specific question of whether, within their broad discretion to administer Medicaid programs, states may exclude coverage for gastric bypass procedures. In general, courts have struggled to reconcile the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201cnothing in the [federal Medicaid] statute suggests that participating States are required to fund every medical procedure that falls within the delineated categories of medical care,\u201d with its later observation, in the same case, that \u201cserious statutory questions might be presented if a state Medicaid plan excluded necessary medical treatment from its coverage....\u201d <em>Beal, </em>432 U.S. at 441, 444, 97 S. Ct. at 2370-71; <em>see also Harris v. McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 307 n. 11, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 2683 n.11 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b613 Addressing this latter statement, the First Circuit concluded, \u201c[W]e do not believe that we should read this dictum as signaling a flat rule that all services within the five general categories deemed \u2018medically necessary by a patient\u2019s physician must be provided by the state plan.\u201d <em>Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, </em>591 F.2d 121, 125 (1st Cir. 1979). The court went on to describe</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">two levels of judgment as to medical necessity in the statutory scheme. The first is the macro-decision by the legislature that only certain kinds of medical assistance are deemed sufficiently necessary to come under the coverage of its plan. The second is the micro-decision of the physician, that the condition of his patient warrants the administering of a type of medical assistance which that plan makes available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Preterm, </em>591 F.2d at 125. This view was also accepted by the Fifth Circuit, which rejected the position that \u201ca state program is required to pay for any services a physician determines to be medically necessary for the patient,\u201d and instead held \u201cthat a state may adopt a definition of medical necessity that places reasonable limits on a physician\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Rush v. Parham, </em>625 F.2d 1150, 1155 (5th Cir. 1980). Thus, the court concluded that it is not inconsistent with the objectives of Title XIX for a state Medicaid program to categorically exclude certain services. <em>Rush, </em>625 F.2d at 1155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b614 This view is not universally accepted. The Eighth Circuit has held that \u201cTitle XIX mandates that five basic categories of medical assistance be provided to all categorically needy persons when the assistance is medically necessary.\u201d <em>Pinneke v. Preisser, </em>623 F.2d 546, 549 (8th Cir. 1980). The court continued, \u201cThe decision of whether or not certain treatment or a particular type of surgery is \u2018medically necessar/ rests with the individual recipient\u2019s physician and not with clerical personnel or government officials.\u201d <em>Pinneke, </em>623 F.2d at 550. Pinneke sought coverage for sex reassignment surgery, which the court found was \u201cthe only medical treatment available\u201d to address her transgender status. <em>Pinneke, </em>623 F.2d at 548. Similarly, in <em>Weaver v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Reagen, </em>886 F.2d 194, 196 (8th Cir. 1989), the court found limitations on state Medicaid coverage of the drug AZT unreasonable where the drug was \u201cthe only approved treatment of AIDS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b615 Despite disagreement among the federal courts regarding whether a state Medicaid program must fund all medically necessary treatments within a mandatory service area, it is clear that exclusions from Medicaid coverage may not discriminate on the basis of \u201cdiagnosis, type of illness, or condition.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230. Thus, categorical exclusion of <em>all </em>treatments for a certain condition, or of the <em>only </em>available treatment for that condition, is arbitrary, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the objectives of Title XIX. <em>McCoy v. Dept. of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>907 P.2d 110, 113-14 (Ida. 1995). In <em>McCoy, </em>one of the only cases to address Medicaid coverage for the treatment of obesity, the Supreme Court of Idaho concluded that a state Medicaid rule excluding \u201call medical procedures for the treatment of obesity\u201d was overly broad and unreasonable. 907 P.2d at 112, 114. The court declined to address, however, whether narrower exclusions of specific procedures, such as gastric stapling or intestinal bypass surgery, were permissible. <em>McCoy, </em>907 P.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b616 Bailey argues that the Department\u2019s exclusion of \u201call invasive medical procedures undertaken for the purpose of weight reduction,\u201d combined with the exclusion of \u201cdietician services,\u201d \u201cnutritional services,\u201d and \u201cdietary supplements,\u201d Admin. R. Mont. 37.85.207(2)(d), (g), (i), (o), has the effect of excluding all treatments for obesity, and thus discriminates on the basis of diagnosis or condition. She further argues that the components of gastric bypass surgery fall within mandatory service areas, such as inpatient hospital services, and therefore must be covered if medically necessary. She claims the Department cannot rely on State budgetary considerations to exclude necessary medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b617 We first address Bailey\u2019s claim that rules promulgated by the Department have effectively excluded all possible treatments for obesity, and therefore impermissibly discriminate on the basis of condition or diagnosis. While it may be apparent to a layperson that the excluded categories \u2014 surgical procedures, nutritional and dietician services, and dietary supplements \u2014 encompass many possible treatments for obesity, this Court may not make a determination on this silent record that these treatments are the <em>only </em>possible methods of treating obesity. Bailey has not presented any expert testimony explaining the range of possible treatments for obesity and their feasibility for patients considered morbidly obese. Without such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>testimony, we are unable to determine whether the exclusions prohibit all treatment for the condition of obesity, and thus unable to determine whether the exclusions discriminate on the basis of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">\u00b618 In her reply brief on appeal, Bailey refers to a prior hearing decision in which a Department hearing officer stated that \u201c[t]he Montana Medicaid Program does not cover any treatments for morbid obesity, such as gastric bypass surgery, dietician services, nutritional services and dietary supplements.\u201d There is no information before us regarding how the hearing officer reached this conclusion and what evidence, if any, this statement was based upon. We are therefore unable to accord this statement any conclusive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b619 We next address Bailey\u2019s argument that the Department may not exclude medically necessary treatments falling within mandatory service areas. As noted, this is an area in which courts are divided, and guidance from the Supreme Court has been less than definitive. We agree with those courts holding that a state may \u201cadopt a definition of medical necessity that places reasonable limits on a physician\u2019s discretion,\u201d <em>Rush, </em>625 F.2d at 1154, and therefore is not required to provide coverage for every procedure falling within a mandatory service area. We are persuaded, first, by the plain language of the federal Medicaid statute, which provides that each state is to furnish medical assistance \u201cas far as practicable under the conditions in such State ... .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396-1. This speaks to the states\u2019 \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in determining the scope of coverage under the program. <em>Beal, </em>432 U.S. at 444, 97 S. Ct. at 2370. In exercising this broad discretion, the State is permitted to consider the \u201cmacro-decision\u201d of what types of medical assistance it considers sufficiently necessary to include within the program; within these reasonable limits, physicians may then exercise their discretion as to the \u201cmicro-decision\u201d regarding the appropriate treatment for an individual patient. <em>Preterm, </em>591 F.2d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b620 If we were to conclude otherwise, the State\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion,\u201d <em>Beal, </em>432 U.S. at 444, 97 S. Ct. at 2371, would be negated, \u201cthe variations [of medically necessary services] being theoretically limited only by the diversity of physicians ....\u201d <em>Preterm, </em>591 F.2d at 125. Although we acknowledge the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201cserious statutory questions might be presented if a state Medicaid plan excluded necessary medical treatment from its coverage,\u201d <em>Beal, </em>432 U.S. at 444, 97 S. Ct. at 2369-70, we do not believe such conditional speculation can be allowed to override clear statutory language allowing states to consider \u201cthe conditions in such State\u201d and provide assistance \u201cas far as practicable\u201d under those individualized conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b621 The Department has exercised the discretion granted to states by the federal Medicaid statute by defining the term \u201c[mjedically necessary service\u201d within the Montana Medicaid program. Admin. R. Mont. 37.82.102(18). We recognize that this definition itself presents certain difficulties to claimants. A \u201c[mjedically necessary service\u201d is one \u201creimbursable under the Montana Medicaid program.\u201d Admin. R. Mont. 37.82.102(18). Thus, even if a procedure meets the remaining elements of medical necessity because it is reasonably calculated to correct conditions that endanger life, cause pain, result in illness or infirmity, threaten to cause a handicap, or cause physical deformity, it is, by definition, not medically necessary if the Department has decided not to cover it. Admin. R. Mont. 37.82.102(18). The Department\u2019s definition codifies its \u201cmacro-decision\u201d making authority, <em>Preterm, </em>591 F.2d at 125, and yet, the broad and circuitous nature of the definition causes us concern. Bailey is unable to demonstrate that the treatment she seeks is medically necessary under this definition, and this Court must struggle with the issue of whether the State may exclude a medically necessary service without the benefit of any evidence demonstrating whether the service in question is, in fact, medically necessary. Bailey has not, however, challenged the reasonableness of this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b622 The record before us is slim. We have not been presented with evidence demonstrating that the procedure sought by Bailey would, but for the categorical exclusion, meet the Department\u2019s definition of medical necessity. Without this information, we cannot determine whether denial of the procedure in Bailey\u2019s case is unreasonable. Remanding to obtain a further determination of medical necessity, however, would require us to invalidate the Department\u2019s decision to exclude gastric bypass surgery from coverage. We are not able to declare the exclusion unreasonable when we have been presented with no evidence regarding the safety, success, cost-efficiency, or other aspects of surgical procedures for weight reduction. Without this information, we cannot evaluate the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s judgment that these services are not appropriate for Montana Medicaid coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b623 Finally, we address Bailey\u2019s argument that monetary considerations are not a sufficient basis for the Department\u2019s decision to exclude \u201cinvasive medical procedures undertaken for the purpose of weight reduction\u201d from Montana Medicaid coverage. Admin. R. Mont. 37.85.207(2)(o). Having elected to participate in the Medicaid program, Montana is required to comply with the objectives of Title XIX. <em>Wilder, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>496 U.S. at 502, 110 S. Ct. at 2513. Within that broad requirement, however, a state may \u201cplace appropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230. Montana law explicitly recognizes the need to address the State\u2019s fiscal realities, providing specific funding principles and permitting the Department to \u201cset priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical services made available\u201d in accordance with those principles. Section 53-6-101(12), MCA. It is implausible that the mandate to furnish medical assistance \u201cas far as practicable under the conditions in such State\u201d does not permit consideration, within the basic requirements of Title XIX, of such practical conditions as the State\u2019s financial resources. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b624  The federal Medicaid statute does not require a state Medicaid program to fund every treatment within the required categories of service. Bailey has not shown that the exclusion of \u201call invasive medical procedures undertaken for the purpose of weight reduction\u201d discriminates against persons with a diagnosis of morbid obesity by precluding all possible treatments for that condition. The State\u2019s consideration of funding priorities and principles provided a valid basis for the exclusion. The Department\u2019s rule excluding coverage for gastric bypass surgery is not invalid, and the Order of the District Court is therefore affirmed.
