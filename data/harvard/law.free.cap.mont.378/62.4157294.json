The sole issue on appeal is whether the restitution order was proper. We conclude that it was not. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b62 In December 2009, Ericka L., the mother of then four-year old A.L., sought an order of protection restraining Thorpe from being near A.L. The petition relied on A.L.\u2019s statements suggesting that Thorpe sexually abused her. On December 4, 2009, the Missoula Municipal Court granted the petition and issued a temporary order of protection restraining Thorpe from being within 1,500 feet of A.L. The order was made permanent on March 27, 2012. From December 2009 through December 2012, A.L. received counseling for the alleged sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"AVm\">\u00b63 On multiple occasions in the spring of 2012, Erika saw Thorpe\u2019s car parked outside a house near the school that A.L. attends. On one occasion, A.L\u2019s grandmother saw Thorpe on the house\u2019s back deck. Erika contacted law enforcement authorities who in turn contacted Thorpe. Thorpe explained that his girlfriend lived at the house where the car was parked. A.L. did not know of these incidents until at least November 8,2012. On that date, Erika drove with A.L. past the house and saw Thorpe\u2019s car parked there. Erika called 9-1-1 while A.L. was still in the car, alerting A.L. that Thorpe was nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b64 On November 16, 2012, the State filed an Information charging Thorpe with six counts of violating \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA, which criminalizes the violation of an order of protection. After a bench trial, the District Court found Thorpe guilty of one of those counts and dismissed the rest. At sentencing, the court sentenced Thorpe to six months\u2019 incarceration with all six months suspended. The court also ordered Thorpe to pay restitution for Erika\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses for all of A.L.\u2019s counseling, which amounted to $3,143.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u00b65 Thorpe appeals the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\u00b66 The meaning of a restitution statute as applied to the facts of a case is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>will uphold a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Cerasani, </em>2014 MT <em>2, </em>\u00b6 11, 373 Mont. 192, 316 P.3d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s power to impose a criminal sentence is constrained to specific statutory authority. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 12, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313. Section 46, chapter 18, MCA, directs a district court to order a defendant to pay restitution to a \u201cvictim\u201d who has suffered a \u201cpecuniary loss.\u201d Sections 46-18-201(5), -241(1), MCA. As applicable here, a victim is \u201ca person who suffers loss of property, bodily injury, or death as a result of... the commission of an offense[.]\u201d Section 4-6-18-243(2)(a), MCA. Pecuniary loss includes \u201cspecial damages... that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the <em>facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities </em>....\u201d Section 46-18-243(1), MCA (emphasis added). We have interpreted the definition of pecuniary loss to require a \u201ccausal relation\u201d between the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct and the loss. <em>State v. Jent, </em>2013 MT 93, \u00b6 13, 369 Mont. 468, 299 P.3d 332; <em>State v. Brownback, </em>2010 MT 96, \u00b6 20, 356 Mont. 190, 232 P.3d 385. Thus, restitution may be imposed for losses caused by the facts or events constituting \u201coffenses to which the accused (1) has admitted, (2) has been found guilty, or (3) has agreed to pay restitution.\u201d <em>State v. Blanchard, </em>270 Mont. 11, 16, 889 P.2d 1180, 1183 (1995), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12 n.1, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978; <em>see State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 19, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b68 Thorpe argues that the District Court erred by ordering him to pay restitution for losses that were not caused by his violation of the order of protection. Thorpe maintains that he was convicted for his conduct on April 25,2012, that violated the order of protection, yet the court ordered restitution for counseling costs beginning in December 2009. The State responds that Thorpe\u2019s actions caused A.L.\u2019s psychological distress and her need for counseling, and precipitated the order of protection in 2009. Under the State\u2019s theory, the alleged sexual abuse is either a criminal offense in its own right or part of the facts or events constituting the violation of the order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b69 Thorpe was found guilty of one count of violating \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA. That section states, \u201cA person commits the offense of violation of an order of protection if the person, with the knowledge of the order, purposely or knowingly violates\u201d an order of protection. Section 45-5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>626(1), MCA. The facts or events constituting Thorpe\u2019s offense consist of the entry of the order of protection, Thorpe\u2019s knowledge of the order, Thorpe\u2019s presence at his girlfriend\u2019s house, and Thorpe\u2019s knowledge that his girlfriend\u2019s house was within 1,500 feet of A.L.\u2019s school. The Information alleged that Thorpe\u2019s violation occurred in April 2012. The alleged sexual abuse for which A.L. received counseling is not a part of events or facts constituting the criminal activities with which Thorpe was charged and convicted: being within 1,500 feet of A.L,\u2019s school in violation of the order of protection. The District Court implicitly acknowledged as much by barring evidence at Thorpe\u2019s trial about the events giving rise to the order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b610 The State cites several cases in which we upheld restitution for losses that were not the immediate result of the actions for which the defendant was prosecuted. In <em>State v. McIntire, </em>2004 MT 238, 322 Mont. 496, 97 P.3d 576, we concluded that a defendant who pleaded guilty to burglary for stealing checks was liable for restitution for losses resulting from the forgery of those checks. <em>McIntire, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 19. <em>McIntire </em>relied on the \u201ccausal relation\u201d between the crime to which the defendant pleaded his guilt and the loss for which restitution was ordered. <em>Mclntire, </em>\u00b6 17. Here, by contrast, there is no evidence that Thorpe was found guilty of the sexual abuse that had the alleged causal relation with A.L.\u2019s need for counseling beginning in December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b611 In <em>State v. Ness, </em>2009 MT 300, 352 Mont. 317, 216 P.3d 773, the defendant struck the victim with his car, drove off from the scene of the crime, and repaired his car. The victim died. <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. After the defendant pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and admitted in his plea agreement that he hit the victim with his car, we concluded that the defendant was liable for restitution for the victim\u2019s funeral expenses. <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. <em>Ness </em>likewise does not support the State\u2019s argument: there, although it was not the crime for which he was convicted, the defendant admitted the criminal act that caused the loss (striking the victim with his vehicle). <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 16. We reasoned that, because Ness had admitted the act without which there could have been no tampering, there was a sufficient connection to support restitution of the victim\u2019s funeral expenses. <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Here, by contrast, there is no evidence that Thorpe ever admitted the alleged sexual abuse or agreed to pay restitution for it. Because, under \u00a7\u00a7 40-15-201 through -202, MCA, the issuance of an order of protection turns merely upon good cause and not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see Lear v. Jamrogowicz, </em>2013 MT 147, \u00b6 26, 370 Mont. 320, 303 P.3d 790, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the findings that led to the issuance of the order of protection against Thorpe are not equivalent to findings that Thorpe was criminally responsible for sexually abusing A.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b612 The State offers no authority that supports defining \u201cthe facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-243(1), MCA, so loosely that an offense of violating an order of protection would encompass events from years prior that supported good cause for entry of the order of protection. As we stated in <em>Jent, </em>\u201ca causal relation between the offender\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss is the touchstone for determining whether a person or entity is a victim entitled to restitution.\u201d <em>Jent, </em>\u00b6 13. The facts or events underlying the entry of an order of protection, if not admitted or proved in the criminal case, may be too \u201cattenuated\u201d to be considered \u201ca result of\u2019 the offense as required by the restitution statute. <em>Jent, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b613 The State also calls our attention to <em>State v. Perkins, </em>2009 MT 150, 350 Mont. 387, 208 P.3d 386, in which we upheld a restitution award that was \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA (2009) (now codified in \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(g), MCA)). But we also determined in that case that the award met the requirements of the specific restitution statutes, and that the defendant had \u201cconceded, at least in part, a connection between the amount sought and his offense.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6 11. As a general statutory provision, \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(g), MCA, cannot control over the specific provisions of the restitution statutes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-102, MCA; <em>State </em>v. <em>Plouffe, </em>2014 MT 183, \u00b6 27, 375 Mont. 429, 329 P.3d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b614  The restitution statutes did not grant the District Court the authority to impose restitution for A.L.\u2019s counseling costs in the absence of a causal relation between Thorpe\u2019s offense and those costs, or an admission by Thorpe that he committed the criminal acts that led to those costs, or an agreement by Thorpe to pay those costs. We therefore conclude that the District Court erred by ordering restitution for counseling expenses that did not result from Thorpe\u2019s violation of the order of protection. At sentencing, Thorpe argued that \u201cthe only parts of that therapy that can stem from this crime [are] November and December of 2012.\u201d We agree. As noted above, it appears undisputed that A.L. did not learn of Thorpe\u2019s violation until November 8,2012. Whether any of the counseling sessions after that date related to Thorpe\u2019s violation is a factual determination that must be made by the District Court. We remand for the District Court to consider that factual issue and to order restitution in an amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>consistent with its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b615 We vacate and remand for recalculation of the restitution owed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b93-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
