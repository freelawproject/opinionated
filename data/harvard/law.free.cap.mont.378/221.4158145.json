We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s imposition of 14 new conditions on Piller\u2019s suspended sentence violates ex post facto principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">\u00b63 In 1988, James Piller was charged by information for sodomizing a three-year-old girl whom he was babysitting. Piller pled guilty to sexual intercourse without consent, a felony. The District Court sentenced Piller to 30 years at MSP with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">\u00b64 Piller escaped from MSP on June 11,1992, and was apprehended the same day. He was charged with escape, intimidation, and possession of a weapon by a prisoner. The Third Judicial District Court, Powell County, sentenced Piller to ten years for each count, to run concurrent with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">\u00b65 Piller did not complete sex offender treatment while incarcerated at MSP. In April and June of2007, probation officer John Boyd made several requests to the county attorney to amend Piller\u2019s conditions of probation because he considered Piller an \u201cuntreated sex offender.\u201d On April 21,2007, Piller was discharged to serve the suspended portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>his sentence. The conditions for his suspended sentence were based on the original 1988 sentencing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">1. The defendant shall not frequent any place where intoxicating liquor or beer is the chief item of sale nor shall he use intoxicants or beer; nor shall he purchase, use, possess, give, sell or administer any narcotic or dangerous drugs or have in his possession same without proper prescription by a doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">2. The defendant shall not enter into any game of chance nor shall defendant frequent any place where gambling may be taking place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">3. The defendant shall conduct himself in a law abiding manner and shall not violate any law of the United States or of the State of Montana or any other State, or the ordinance of any city or town of this State or other State during the said term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">4. The defendant shall maintain as steady employment as possible [during] said term, and he shall to the best of his ability fully and completely contribute to the support of his family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">5. The defendant is placed under the supervision and control of the Adult Probation and Parole Field Services and is to abide by their rules and regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">6. The defendant shall enroll in and successfully complete the sex offenders program at the Montana State Prison prior to parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u00b66 The first report of violation of probation conditions was filed against Piller on January 18, 2011, for failing to give his probation officer a current address, calling his probation officer a \u201cbitch,\u201d using threatening language in a meeting, and for living with another convicted felon. Piller\u2019s probation officer recommended that Piller\u2019s sentence be revoked, that he be resentenced to the Department of Corrections for six years with three years suspended, and that Piller have 14 additional conditions added to his suspended sentence. At a hearing on June 29, 2011, the District Court orally found that Piller had substantially violated the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">\u00b67 Piller later filed a disposition memorandum objecting to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that new conditions be placed on his suspended sentence. On November 10, 2011, the District Court filed an order imposing a new sentence of ten years with all time suspended, and imposing the 14 new conditions to Piller\u2019s suspended sentence, as recommended by the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">\u00b68 Piller appealed the November 10, 2011 order to this Court. However, the parties stipulated that Piller\u2019s matter was not ripe for appeal because Piller\u2019s sentence had not been orally pronounced from the bench in Piller\u2019s presence. In an order dated May 31, 2012, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>remanded Piller\u2019s case back to the District Court for oral pronouncement of the sentence and a written judgment including credit for time served, as well as a specific provision considering and granting or denying credit for Piller\u2019s street time.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b69 On March 22,2012, Piller was again cited for probation violations, including a privacy in commumcations charge. The State petitioned to revoke Piller\u2019s suspended sentence, and the District Court held a revocation hearing on August 13, 2012. On September 6, 2012, the District Court held a disposition hearing. On October 18, 2012, the District Court entered an order of revocation and sentenced Piller to ten years at MSP with five years suspended, and reimposed the following 14 new conditions on his suspended sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">1. The Defendant will enter and successfully complete sex offender treatment with a MSOTA clinical member or associate member with supervision, or equivalent, who is approved by the State and the Probation Officer and at his own expense. The Defendant shall abide by all treatment rules and recommendations of his treatment provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">2. The Defendant shall not frequent places where children congregate. This includes but is not limited to: schools, parks, playgrounds, malls, movies, fairs, parades, swimming pools, carnivals, arcades, parties, family functions, holiday festivities, or any other place or function where children are present or reasonably expected to be present unless accompanied by an approved and appropriately trained, responsible adult who is aware of the Defendant\u2019s sexual conviction and approved by his Probation Officer and sex offender treatment provider. The Defendant shall obtain permission from his Probation Officer prior to going to any of the above places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">3. The Defendant will not access or have in his possession or under his control any material that describes or depicts human nudity, the exploitation of children, consensual sex acts, non-consensual sex acts, sexual acts involving force or violence, including but not limited to; computer programs, computer links, photographs, drawings, video tapes, audio tapes, magazines, books literature, writings, etc. without prior written approval of his Probation Officer and therapist. The Defendant will not frequent adult book[ ] stores, topless bars, massage parlors or use the services of prostitutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">4. The Defendant will not view television shows or motion pictures, which are geared towards his sex offending cycle, or as a stimulus to arouse deviant thoughts or fantasies, (i.e., shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>based on sexualization of underage girls or boys, etc.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">5. The Defendant shall not have access to the Internet without prior permission from his Probation Officer and sex offender therapist. If the Internet access is allowed, the Defendant must allow the Department of Corrections to install rating control software and conduct random searches of the hard drive for pornography or other inappropriate material nor shall he have on any computer he may own, any software that is intended for data elimination, encryption or hiding data.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">6. The Defendant shall not involve himself in any type of employment, service or recreational pursuit that involves the supervision of children. Under no circumstances should the Defendant be in a position of power and authority over children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">7. Pursuant to MCA 46-18-255(1), the Defendant shall be subject to reasonable employment or occupational ... prohibitions and restrictions designed to protect the class or classes of persons containing the likely victims of further offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">8. The Defendant\u2019s residence, changes and any co-habitants must have prior approval of his Probation Officer. The Defendant will not reside in a residence where there are any children under the age of 18 without the written approval of his therapist and Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">9. The Defendant shall not access \u201c900\u201d number telephone sex lines and shall have a \u201c900\u201d number block on his telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">10. The Defendant will not have a cell phone, or such other technology/device, with photo, video, or Internet capabilities allowed. If a cell phone is used, all bills and records will be made available to the Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">11. The Defendant shall remain in Aftercare or Relapse Prevention Class for the entirety of his supervision unless released at the discretion of the Probation Officer and therapist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">12. The Defendant shall reenter treatment at any time if deemed appropriate by the Probation Officer and therapist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">13. The Defendant shall submit to annual polygraph testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">14. The Defendant will not date, live with, or otherwise align himself with any person with children under the age of 18 without the express prior approval of his therapist and Probation Officer. If this approval is granted, they shall both be involved with his treatment to the extent that his treatment provider recommends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">\u00b610 Piller appeals the imposition of the 14 new conditions placed on his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b611 We review a criminal sentence only for legality \u2014 that is, whether the sentence falls within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. Tirey, </em>2010 MT 283, \u00b6 19, 358 Mont. 510, 247 P.3d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the imposition of 14 new conditions on Filler\u2019s suspended sentence for a 1988 crime violates ex post facto principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u00b613 Piller argues that the 14 new conditions imposed on his suspended sentence upon the revocation of his original sentence violate ex post facto principles because they were not authorized by the revocation statute in effect at the time of his offense in 1988, \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1987). The statute at that time allowed a judge or magistrate to revoke the suspension and order the person to serve the remainder of his prison term or continue the suspended sentence under the original terms. <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>256 Mont. 32, 35-36, 844 P.2d 97, 99 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"ApF9\">\u00b614 The revocation statute was later amended to allow district courts greater discretion at a revocation hearing. Under the amended statute, a district court could \u201ccontinue the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions,\u201d or order \u201cthe defendant to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence.\u201d Section 46-18-203(7)(b)-(c), MCA (1991). In 2001, the statute was made expressly retroactive, allowing district courts to impose additional or different conditions on the suspended sentences at revocation of all offenders under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections. 2001 Mont. Laws, ch. 493, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">\u00b615 Piller bases his ex post facto argument on the simple premise that the law in effect at the time of the crime controls as to the possible sentence, as well as the revocation of that sentence. <em>State v. Goff, </em>2011 MT 6, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 107, 247 P.3d 715 (citing <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 220, 113 P.3d 297). Piller further argues that \u201c[djistrict courts cannot apply a sentencing statute enacted after the commission of an offense because to do so violates the prohibition on ex post facto laws.\u201d <em>State v. Southwick, </em>2007 MT 257, \u00b6 25, 339 Mont. 281, 169 P.3d 698 (citing <em>State v. Gone, </em>179 Mont. 271, 280, 587 P.2d 1291, 1297 (1978)). As it would pertain to the facts of this case, Piller\u2019s argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u00b616 Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution prohibit the imposition of ex post facto laws. Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution states: \u201cNo Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\u201d Article II, Section 31 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Montana Constitution states: \u201cNo ex post facto law... shall be passed by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b617 Montana adopted federal ex post facto jurisprudence and applied it to the ex post facto clause of the Montana Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in <em>State ex rel. Nelson v. Ellsworth </em>, 142 Mont. 14, 380 P.2d 886 (1963). The defendant in <em>Ellsworth </em>argued that a law passed after the commission of his offense which delayed his parole eligibility was ex post facto as applied to him. We adopted the definition of ex post facto laws as set forth in the 1798 United States Supreme Court case, <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. 386, 1 L. Ed. 648 (1798):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">Laws under the following circumstances are to be considered ex post facto laws within the words and intent of the prohibition: 1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was when committed. 3d. <em>Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime when committed,</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\"><em>Ellsworth, </em>142 Mont. at 19, 380 P.2d at 888 (quoting <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. at 390, 1 L. Ed. at 650) (emphasis added). We held that the new law delaying parole eligibility increased the defendant\u2019s punishment and was therefore ex post facto as applied to him, <em>Ellsworth, </em>142 Mont. at 20, 380 P.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b618 Piller argues that his October 15,2012 sentence must be governed by the 1987 version of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, because that was the revocation statute that was in effect at the time of his original offense in 1988. Essentially, Piller contends our analysis should go no further than applying the law in effect at the time of the crime to control the possible sentence, citing <em>Goff, </em>\u00b6 18. The State argues that because the 2001 amendments to \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, were expressly made to apply retroactively<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to all \u201coffenders who are under the custody or supervision of the department of corrections,\u201d 2001 Mont. Laws, ch. 493, \u00a7 10, Piller should be subject to the 14 new conditions added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>to his suspended sentence at revocation under traditional ex post facto jurisprudence. The State points out that Piller\u2019s sentence as a whole was not made more punitive because he was always subject to his original 30 year prison term, and his current sentence allows him to serve the remaining five years on probation rather than incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">\u00b619 In <em>State v. Griffin, </em>2007 MT 289, 339 Mont. 465, 172 P.3d 1223, we upheld a modification to the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence under a subsequent version of \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA, because the modification, which required participation in the Intensive Supervision Program, was \u201cnot punitive in nature.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 19. <em>Griffin </em>is similar to the instant case in that a sex offender was challenging the imposition of different conditions on his suspended sentence. <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b620 Similarly, in <em>State v. Tirey, </em>2010 MT 283, 358 Mont. 510, 247 P.3d 701, we upheld changes to probation conditions at a revocation, holding: \u201c[T]he mere fact that the original sentence imposed had only conditions A, B, and C while the sentence at revocation has conditions A, B, C, D, and E does not necessarily mean that the sentence at revocation is greater.\u201d <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 27. While reiterating that \u201c[t]he law in effect at the time an offense is committed controls as to the possible sentence for the offense, as well as the revocation of that sentence,\u201d <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 26, we nevertheless held that under the 1995 version of our revocation statute, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1995), the district court could impose new conditions, provided it did not increase the defendant\u2019s punishment. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">A proper analysis requires that we look at the substance of the conditions to determine whether they are punitive in nature... . Secondly, the new conditions must be reviewed in the context of the entire sentence. That is, whether the defendant\u2019s overall sentence is the same or whether the defendant is being sentenced to more or less punishment than the sentence originally imposed,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFZ\"><em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b621 In <em>State v. Claassen, </em>2012 MT 313, 367 Mont. 478, 291 P.3d 1176, we applied the retroactive provision of our revocation statute, \u00a7 46-18-203(9), MCA (2011), in upholding a change in a sex offender\u2019s tier-level designation made at a revocation proceeding. We addressed application of the 2011 version of the law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">The State argues that because Claassen committed the underlying offense between December 2002 and September 2003, the 2001 version of the MCA governs his original sentence and his revocation. However, \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (2011), contains an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>express retroactivity provision. Therefore, all references to \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, are to the 2011 version. Because we generally apply the law in effect at the time a crime was committed, <em>State v. Stoner, </em>2012 MT 162, \u00b6 12, 365 Mont. 465, 285 P.3d 402, all other statutory references in this Opinion are to the 2001 MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlT\"><em>Claassen, </em>\u00b6 24, n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b622 We reinforce that a sentence must fall within the parameters provided by the applicable statute at the time of the offense. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, 983 P.2d 937. However, a law with a retroactive applicability date does not per se violate ex post facto principles as Piller suggests. \u201c[S]imply because a statute operates on events antecedent to its effective date does not make the statute <em>ex post facto\u201d State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 67, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829 (citations omitted). Rather, as we first articulated in <em>Ellsworth, </em>\u201cEvery law <em>that changes the punishment, </em>and inflicts a <em>greater punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime when committed,\u201d is ex post facto. <em>Ellsworth, </em>142 Mont. at 19, 380 P.2d at 888 (emphasis in original). Relevant to the issue presently before us, \u201cA proper analysis requires that we look at the substance of the conditions to determine whether they are punitive in nature.\u201d <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b623  In analyzing whether the 14 new conditions imposed on Piller\u2019s sentence are ex post facto, we must determine whether or not the conditions themselves inflict a greater punishment. The 14 additional conditions placed on Piller\u2019s suspended sentence are standard conditions for sex offenders placed on probation. We have previously held that standard conditions placed on a sex offender\u2019s suspended sentence \u201care not punitive in nature.\u201d <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 29. Furthermore, Piller conceded at oral argument that the new conditions are non-punitive. Looking at the sentence as a whole, Piller\u2019s ten year sentence with five years suspended received at revocation \u2014 including the 14 new probation conditions \u2014 is no greater than the 30 years of incarceration to which he was sentenced in 1988 (of which Piller served approximately 20 years). <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 28; \u00a7 46-18-203(7), MCA (if a defendant has violated terms of probation, at revocation a district court may impose any sentence that could have been originally imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b624  The 14 additional conditions imposed on Piller\u2019s sentence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>revocation were authorized pursuant to the 2011 version of our revocation statute, \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA. Because the conditions are not punitive in nature, they are not ex post facto. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of the 14 additional conditions placed on Piller\u2019s suspended sentence at revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b625 This matter is remanded to the District Court for modification of the written revocation order to reflect that Piller is granted credit for time served in the amount of 486 days.</p>\n<judges id=\"b256-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-15\"> Piller also raised the issue that his written revocation order did not give him credit for 486 days served. The State conceded this issue in their brief; therefore, we do not address this argument in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> The 1889 Montana Constitution, as interpreted in <em>Ellsworth </em>in 1963, contained substantially the same prohibition on ex post facto laws as our current Montana Constitution: \u201cNo expost facto law... shall be passed by the legislative assembly,\u201d Mont. Const. (1889) art. Ill, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> \u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d Section 1-2-109, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
