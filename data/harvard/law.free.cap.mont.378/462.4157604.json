In 2006, Mary McCulley (McCulley) purchased a condominium in Bozeman and sought a 30-year residential financing loan from Heritage Bank, predecessor to U.S. Bank, in the amount of $300,000. In June 2009, McCulley brought action against U.S. Bank alleging the Bank defrauded her by issuing, without notice, an 18-month, $300,000 commercial loan, rather than the 30-year residential property loan for which she applied. Relying on erroneous sworn affidavits and documents submitted by U. S. Bank, the District Court dismissed McCulley\u2019s claims and entered summary judgment in favor of the Bank. Following McCulley\u2019s pro se appeal, this Court reversed and remanded for further proceedings regarding McCulley\u2019s allegations of fraud. <em>McCulley v. Am.

Pursuant to \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, the District Court reviewed the punitive damages award and issued an order confirming it. The District Court also ordered post-judgment interest to accrue from the date of the court\u2019s decision confirming the award. McCulley cross-appeals from the court\u2019s determination of the date from which post-judgment interest accrues.

On May 25, 2006, McCulley approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Heritage Bank, later purchased by U.S. Bank, and applied for a 30-year residential loan for $300,000. Jeff Mortensen (Mortensen), Heritage Bank General Manager, took McCulley\u2019s application over the phone. The following day, Mortensen emailed an internal credit memorandum to Heritage Bank Senior Vice-President, Steve Feurt (Feurt), favorably analyzing McCulley\u2019s credit, but noting that, while the condominium was \u201cresidential,\u201d the lot upon which it was built was zoned \u201ccommercial B-2.\u201d The memorandum indicated that the commercial zoning precluded the use of \u201cstandard secondary market sources for financing a residential condominium,\u201d As a result, Mortensen suggested to Feurt, and Feurt approved, an 18-month, $300,000 commercial loan in lieu of the loan McCulley had requested, stating in an email: \u201cMight be the only business we get from her. With the risk might as well make it worth our while.\u201d The Bank recognized McCulley could not pay back the $300,000 loan in 18 months due to McCulley\u2019s low income relative to the loan amount. The Bank farther understood it would be very difficult for McCulley to find refinancing at the end of the 18 months because of the way in which the property was zoned. McCulley was not privy to the internal memo and was unaware of the significance of the commercial zoning. The Bank did not advise McCulley that it was changing the terms of the loan she had applied for to an 18-month commercial interest loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b612 On May 30,2006, the Bank sent McCulley a disclosure statement pursuant to the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding her loan application. The TILA disclosure statement reflected a 30-year adjustable interest rate loan for only $200,000. Upon receiving the TILA disclosure, McCulley contacted Mortensen and requested that the loan amount be raised to $300,000, as she had originally requested. Mortensen agreed to raise the amount to $300,000 after McCulley offered additional collateral. The Bank generated a Good Faith Estimate that referenced a 30-year payment plan for the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>loan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bank did not provide a written document to McCulley explaining that the term of the loan it was approving would be changed to 18 months. McCulley proceeded with the understanding that her loan would be for the 30-year term she had applied for, as reflected on the TILA disclosure statement and the Good Faith Estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b613 On June 16, 2006, the loan closing was held at a title company. Mortensen was present. McCulley was presented with a stack of documents bound by a metallic clip and directed to sign where \u201csign here\u201d sticky notes had been placed on the documents. An explanation of the individual documents was not provided to McCulley. Included in the stack of documents were three loan applications disclosing three different and inconsistent loans to McCulley, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">Loan Application 1: Amount: $300,000; Term: 18 months; Rate: 8.75%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">Loan Application 2: Amount: $200,000; Term: 12 months; Rate: 8.75%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">Loan Application 3: Amount: $200,000; Term: 30 years; Rate: 7.75%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The Bank also provided a disclosure form for McCulley\u2019s signature captioned: \u201cNON ASSUMABLE FIXED RATE LOAN DISCLOSURE.\u201d The disclosure form described the term of McCulley\u2019s loan as 30 years with an interest rate of 7.75%. However, a loan application form for a 30-year, $300,000 loan, as requested by McCulley and promised by the Bank, was not provided. McCulley signed all of the documents, including the three varying and inapposite loan applications, and the disclosure form, in reliance on the Bank\u2019s previous representations that the loan was for a term of 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b614 U.S. Bank acknowledged at trial it is not customary banking practice to have a borrower sign three different and inconsistent loan applications on the day of closing because it \u201cwould be misleading to the borrower.\u201d The Bank also admitted that it failed to provide McCulley with a Loan Commitment Letter, identifying the terms of the loan, although this is a customary practice in the banking industry.</p>\n<p id=\"Arb\">\u00b615 McCulley made monthly payments throughout 2006 and 2007, believing the monthly payments were the required payments under a 30-year mortgage. In 2007, Heritage Bank merged with U.S. Bank. In a joint letter, Heritage Bank and U.S. Bank informed McCulley the merger would not impact her loan. In late 2007, U.S. Bank sent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>notice to McCulley advising her that the balloon payment on her 18-month loan would be due in December. For the first time McCulley understood she did not have the 30-year residential mortgage for which she had applied. McCulley contacted U.S. Bank, which initially agreed to convert the loan into a 30-year term loan if McCulley made a principal reduction payment in the amount of $100,000. However, following McCulley\u2019s assent to do so, the Bank notified McCulley in writing that it would instead require a principal reduction of $200,000, and not the $100,000 previously agreed upon, to convert the loan. McCulley persisted in attempting to convince U.S. Bank to restructure the loan, but the Bank refused. McCulley was unable to locate long-term residential financing and the Bank placed the loan into foreclosure. McCulley sold her home to a buyer one week before the scheduled foreclosure sale for approximately $40,000 less than the loan balance. U.S. Bank\u2019s refusal to restructure the loan and the following foreclosure process created significant emotional distress for McCulley. Though previously physically and mentally healthy, McCulley began suffering from depression, which culminated in a near-fatal suicide attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b616 In June 2009, McCulley brought this action against U.S. Bank. McCulley alleged that the Bank committed actual fraud by engaging in \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactics to surreptitiously alter the terms of the 30-year residential mortgage she had requested to an 18-month balloon loan. The Bank countered that it had never represented to McCulley that it had approved a 30-year residential loan. The Bank asserted it had sent McCulley a letter dated May 26,2006, outlining the terms of her loan and explaining that she was getting an 18-month consumer bridge loan in the amount of $300,000. In a sworn affidavit, Feurt further declared that the Bank possessed a \u201cterm sheet\u201d that set forth the correct terms of the loan. Both parties moved for summary judgment. On January 12, 2012, the District Court issued an order denying McCulley\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting U.S. Bank\u2019s motion. McCulley appealed pro se to this Court. We reversed the grant of summary judgment, concluding, in light of the \u201cchronology of events, and in particular noting McCulley\u2019s arguably legitimate contention that the May 26 \u201cletter\u2019 was not a letter to her at all,\u201d that genuine issues of material fact existed. <em>McCulley, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b617 During the course of litigation after remand, the District Court learned that the sworn statements made by U.S. Bank to the court, about documents accurately communicating to McCulley the terms of the 18-month loan, and on which the court had relied in granting summary judgment, were inaccurate. Specifically, the court learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>that the May 26 \u201cletter\u201d the Bank indicated had been sent to McCulley did not exist; the \u201cterm sheet\u201d that Feurt had attested contained the terms of the loan did not exist; and affidavits submitted by the Bank indicating that it had never represented to McCulley that she would obtain a 30-year mortgage were untrue. The case was set for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AS8\">\u00b618 The jury returned a verdict in favor of McCulley on February 7, 2014. The jury awarded McCulley compensatory damages of $1,000,000 and punitive damages of $5,000,000. On April 14, 2014, the District Court entered its order affirming the punitive damages award as granted by the jury, pursuant to \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, and ordered that post-judgment interest would accrue from the date of its decision. Additional facts will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Weter v, Archambault, </em>2002 MT 336, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 284, 61 P.3d 771.

Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., Inc., </em>2012 MT 198, \u00b6 9, 366 Mont. 175, 285 P.3d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b623 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding lay witness testimony ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b624 During examination by McCulley\u2019s counsel, Mortensen contradicted the testimony he gave in his deposition after referring to his personal journals. Mortensen had provided the journals to the Bank two days before trial, but the Bank did not provide them to McCulley. Outside the presence of the jury, McCulley moved in limine to exclude Mortensen\u2019s testimony from his journals on the ground the Bank had breached its duty to supplement discovery by failing to disclose them. The Bank responded that it had received the journals only days before trial and that McCulley had not issued a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>upon Mortensen. The court found the personal journals were responsive to McCulley\u2019s Requests for Production Nos. 1 and 7 and U.S. Bank should have supplemented its discovery responses by providing them. The District Court ordered the Bank to immediately supplement discovery by producing the journals, and granted McCulley\u2019s motion precluding Mortensen from testifying based on the journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b625 M. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1) imposes a duty on a party who has responded to a request for production to supplement its response \u201cin a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the response is incomplete or incorrect... .\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) further provides that if a party fails to supplement an earlier discovery response, \u201cthe <em>party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence ... </em>at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe party facing sanctions bears the burden of proving that its failure to disclose the required information was substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d <em>R &amp; R Sails, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of the Pa., </em>673 F.3d 1240, 1246 (9th Cir. 2012). We have explained \u201cthe imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with discovery procedures is regarded with favor.\u201d <em>Richardson v. State, </em>2006 MT 43, \u00b6 56, 331 Mont. 231, 130 P.3d 634. \u201c[T]he price for dishonesty must be made unbearable to thwart the inevitable temptation that zealous advocacy inspires.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 56 (citation and internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b626 U.S. Bank argues the court erred by preventing Mortensen from testifying based on the journals. The Bank asserts that had Mortensen been able to so testify, he would have rebutted \u201cevery significant statement\u201d in McCulley\u2019s testimony. The Bank cites M. R. Evid. 612 to support its contention that, because it allowed the journals to be reviewed following the District Court\u2019s order, the court was without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>authority to preclude any testimony that may have been supplied by the journals. M. R. Evid. 612 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">If a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">(1) while testifying, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">(2) <em>before testifying, if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, </em>to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce into evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objection shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. <em>If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, </em>except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">U.S. Bank contends, alternatively, that it was under no duty to supplement discovery under M. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1) because the journals were never in the U.S. Bank\u2019s \u201clegal custody\u2019 during discovery. The Bank reasons the journals were privileged as Mortensen provided them \u201con condition of non-dissemination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u00b627  We are not persuaded by the Bank\u2019s arguments. First, assuming that the Bank complied with the Rules of Evidence by following M. R. Evid. 612, such compliance does not obviate the Bank\u2019s duty under M. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1) to supplement discovery. Second, the Bank is not the arbiter of whether a document is privileged. If the Bank believed the journals contained privileged materials, it still had a duty to supplement its responses and advise McCulley that it had come into possession of the documents. However, the Bank instead attempted to litigate by ambush, which the court rightly prohibited. Once the Bank failed to supplement its response, and thereby breached its duty, the District Court was constrained by M. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) to exclude the journals, unless the Bank could establish that its failure was substantially justified or harmless. The Bank has not attempted to justify its failure to supplement or establish the error was harmless. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>precluding U.S. Bank from using the personal journals to supply evidence through Mortensen\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b628 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding McCulley\u2019s medical records?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b629 During cross-examination of McCulley, the Bank sought to introduce her medical records in an attempt to show McCulley told medical personnel that she was not suicidal after the foreclosure. McCulley did not prepare the medical records, disputed their authenticity, and objected to the way in which the Bank was attempting to use the records. McCulley asserted it was unclear whether the \u201cprogress notes\u201d on the medical records, which the Bank was attempting to introduce into evidence, were actually in reference to her. The District Court excluded the documents and explained to the Bank it needed to lay a proper foundation. The Bank did not attempt further to lay a foundation through the testimony of a preparer or custodian of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b630 M. R. Evid. 901 requires authentication of evidence as a condition precedent to admissibility, if it is not self-authenticating. The requirement \u201cis satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d M. R. Evid. 901(a). We have explained that \u201cmedical records are not ordinarily self-authenticating and require proper foundation before they are admissible.\u201d <em>Cheff v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2010 MT 235, \u00b6 39, 358 Mont. 144, 243 P.3d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b631  The Bank offers that McCulley stipulated to the authenticity of her medical records because she produced the documents in discovery pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1). However, the only authority provided by the Bank for this proposition is M. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(1)(B), which permits a party to request that another party admit the \u201cgenuineness of any described documents.\u201d The record does not indicate the Bank ever requested McCulley to admit the genuineness of the medical records. Thus, McCulley merely verified the production of the documents under M. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1). The Bank cannot transform McCulley\u2019s discovery verification into a stipulation of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b632 Given the Bank\u2019s failure to properly lay a foundation, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the medical records.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u00b633 <em>3. Did McCulley present sufficient evidence for the jury to find U.S. Bank committed actual fraud?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b634 The Bank contends McCulley failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate actual fraud. A party asserting a claim of actual fraud must establish the following elements: (1) a representation; (2) falsity of the representation; (3) materiality of the representation; (4) speaker\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of the representation or ignorance of its truth; (5) speaker\u2019s intent that it be relied upon; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the falsity of the representation; (7) the hearer\u2019s reliance on the representation; (8) the hearer\u2019s right to rely on the representation; and (9) the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury caused by the reliance on the representation. <em>Morrow v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>2014 MT 117, \u00b6 57, 375 Mont. 38, 324 P.3d 1167. The elements of actual fraud \u201chinge on the knowledge and intent of the defendant.\u201d <em>Durbin v. Ross, </em>276 Mont. 463, 470, 916 P.2d 758, 762 (1996) (citation and brackets omitted). The Bank challenges the sufficiency of three of the nine elements of fraud, disputing that there is evidence of a false representation, that the Bank knew its representation was false, and that the Bank intended McCulley to rely on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b635 We do not assume the role of the jury on appeal, \u201cbut will only review the record to search for sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Drilcon, Inc. v. Roil Energy Corp., </em>230 Mont. 166, 178, 749 P.2d 1058, 1065 (1988). In reviewing the record, \u201cwe must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b636  We conclude McCulley presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find U.S. Bank committed actual fraud. While the Bank largely seeks to relitigate the case on appeal, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to find that McCulley was given a deceptive offer by the Bank in response to her loan inquiry, and, having obtained her audience, the Bank secretly switched the terms of the loan to the Bank\u2019s benefit and McCulley\u2019s detriment. McCulley testified that the Bank falsely represented she would be given a 30-year, residential mortgage loan. McCulley\u2019s testimony was corroborated by both the TILA statement and the Good Faith Estimate indicating her loan would be for a 30-year term consistent with her initial loan application, not an 18-month loan. The Bank failed to disclose that it was offering only a bridge loan. The Bank added to its deception by presenting three separate and inconsistent loan applications for McCulley\u2019s signature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>at closing; an additional disclosure form on the day of closing, which stated terms consistent with the loan for which she had applied; and, in contrast to standard banking practice, the Bank failed to provide McCulley documentation reflecting the Bank\u2019s change of the terms of the loan. The Bank\u2019s internal communications and other circumstantial evidence demonstrate the Bank knew at the time it sent the falsely stated documents to McCulley that, to the contrary, she would not receive a 30-year, residential loan. The evidence also established the Bank knew she could not repay the 18-month loan that it supplied in place of the loan McCulley requested. Lastly, McCulley presented evidence that she lacked knowledge of the falsity of the Bank\u2019s representations when the fraudulent conduct occurred and thus she had the right to rely on the representations. Although we cannot know what evidence the jury found persuasive, we can conclude there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have reached its verdict. Therefore, we hold that McCulley presented evidence sufficient to demonstrate the Bank committed actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b637 <em>4.

Did the District Court err in upholding the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b643 U.S. Bank challenges the jury\u2019s punitive damages award on the ground it was grossly excessive in violation of the Due Process Clause under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>BMW of N. Am. v. Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 116 S. Ct. 1589 (1996). Punitive damages may be imposed \u201cto further a State\u2019s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 568, 116 S.

However, \u201cwhen an award can fairly be categorized as \u2018grossly excessive\u2019 \u201d it enters the \u201czone of arbitrariness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 568, 116 S.

In determining whether a punitive damages award is grossly excessive under the Due Process Clause, a court must consider three \u201cguideposts\u201d announced in <em>Gore: </em>(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s misconduct; (2) the disparity, or ratio, between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 418, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 1520 (2003) (citing <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 575, 116 S. Ct. at 1598). We conduct a de novo review of the jury\u2019s punitive damages award in applying the three guideposts. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\n<em>Reprehensibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b645 The U.S. Supreme Court stated in <em>Gore </em>that \u201cthe most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 575, 116 S. Ct. at 1599. Punitive damages \u201cimposed on a defendant should reflect the enormity of his offense.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 575, 116 S. Ct. at 1599 (quotations omitted). The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed lower courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">[T]he harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsA\"><em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 419, 123 S. Ct. at 1521. \u201cThe existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S, at 419, 123 S. Ct. at 1521.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>(i) Physical or Economic Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b646 The IBank argues the injuries sustained by McCulley were \u201cprimarily economical,\u201d but concedes that McCulley did suffer emotional harm. The Bank\u2019s conduct caused McCulley serious emotional distress that directly contributed to her suicide attempt. McCulley had previously been physically and mentally healthy, but as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>a result of U.S. Bank\u2019s conduct began suffering from depression and isolation. While McCulley sustained substantial economic harm, her serious emotional damage does not permit the conclusion that she suffered only economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\n<em>(ii) Indifference to or Reckless Disregard for the Safety of Others</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AB6o\">\u00b647 The second factor in assessing reprehensibility is whether the Bank exhibited indifference or reckless disregard for the health and safety of McCulley. The Bank knew McCulley may well lose her home when it switched the terms of her loan and thus knew its conduct could cause serious emotional distress to McCulley. McCulley worked in good faith to negotiate a change in loan terms, and the Bank agreed, only to renege when McCulley attempted to honor the agreement. The Bank was clearly indifferent to the loss of McCulley\u2019s home and its actions resulted in a suicide attempt that threatened McCulley\u2019s personal safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>(Hi) Financially Vulnerable Target</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b648 The financial vulnerability of a plaintiff is particularly important when there is an \u201cinfliction of economic injury, especially when done intentionally through affirmative acts of misconduct\u201d and in such a case may \u201cwarrant a substantial penalty.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 576, 116 S. Ct. at 1599. McCulley testified at length about her financial vulnerability and her lack of sophistication. McCulley indicated she did not know what a promissory note was or what the word \u201ccollateral\u201d meant, and that she was accustomed to relying on representations of bankers in real estate transactions. The Bank knew of McCulley\u2019s financial vulnerably and there was evidence that purported to establish that this was the Bank\u2019s motivation in switching the terms of the loan. Further, the resulting loss ofMcCulley\u2019s home removes all doubt that she was financially vulnerable. Accordingly, this factor favors the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\n<em>(iv) Repeated Actions or Isolated Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">\u00b649 The U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Gore </em>\u201crecognize[d] that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 577, 116 S. Ct. at 1599-1600. The Bank characterizes its conduct as a \u201csingle, isolated incident\u201d because no \u201cother consumer was injured by the Bank\u2019s actions.\u201d However, as both the Colorado Supreme Court and Third Circuit have explained, \u201c \u2018while the \u201crepeated conduct\u201d [factor] will necessarily have less force where the defendant\u2019s misconduct did not extend beyond his dealings with the plaintiff, it may still be relevant in measuring the reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct, based on the particular facts and circumstances presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Qwest Servs. Corp. v. Blood, </em>252 P.3d 1071, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>1096 (Colo. 2011) (quoting <em>CGB Occupational Therapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs., Inc., </em>499 F.3d 184, 191 (3d Cir. 2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b650 It is true that the conduct at issue here is limited to a single loan transaction. However, the facts demonstrate that the Bank\u2019s misconduct' included multiple separate acts. The Bank deceived McCulley by switching the terms of the loan and then by supplying a TILA statement and a Good Faith Estimate prior to closing that matched the 30-year term for which McCulley had applied. The Bank presented three inconsistent loan applications at closing. The Bank provided a disclosure form that was inconsistent with the three loan applications, but consistent with the loan McCulley had requested. The Bank failed to deliver, at a later date, any written notice to McCulley showing the loan terms were not as presented, until the notice the balloon payment was due. The Bank represented to McCulley it would give her a 30-year mortgage if she paid $100,000 on the principal of the 18-month loan. When she agreed, the Bank failed to honor its commitment and requested an additional $100,000 payment. As the District Court found, the Bank \u201cwas well collateralized\u201d and capable of rectifying the wrong \"at all times.\u201d However, the Bank nonetheless initiated foreclosure proceedings on McCulley\u2019s condominium. U.S. Bank\u2019s multiple acts here weigh in favor of the jury\u2019s punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>(v) Intentional Malice, Trickery, or Deceit, or Mere Accident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9BW\">\u00b651 Lastly, we consider whether the harm caused by U.S. Bank was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. The District Court noted in detail the nature of the Bank\u2019s predatory lending, specifying in particular that its deceptive conduct placed McCulley in a situation of peril where it was all but certain the loan would end in foreclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">The Bank knew McCulley could not pay back a $300,000 in 18 months, and that she would find refinancing \u201cvery difficult.\u201d At the time the Bank approved the loan, it knew that the [condominium] was a mixed use building so the mortgage loan would not meet the underwriting standard of the secondary market into which such loans are sold. The consequence of this, which was known to the Bank, was that McCulley would be unlikely to obtain long-term financing. The Bank failed to disclose this fact to McCulley, either verbally or in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">This was not merely a case of a bank failing to apprise an unsophisticated buyer of the associated risks in purchasing her home; nor of a bank mistakenly and unintentionally changing the terms of the loan due to clerical errors. Here, the District Court found, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, that the Bank intentionally tricked McCulley by changing the loan from one that her finances <em>could support </em>to one that it knew her finances <em>could not support. </em>And when the situation played out as the Bank predicted, it initiated foreclosure on McCulley\u2019s home. We conclude that U.S. Bank\u2019s \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d tactics counsel in favor of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b652 In sum, the five factors given by the U.S. Supreme Court to evaluate the most important guidepost, reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct, weigh in favor of affirming the punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\n<em>Ratio</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b653 Turning to the second guidepost, we examine the ratio between the punitive and compensatory damages. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 418, 123 S. Ct. at 1520. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently rejected the notion that the constitutional fine is marked by a simple mathematical formula,\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 582,116 S. Ct. at 1602, the Court has provided \u201cinstructive\u201d numerical guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">[F]ew awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process .... Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State\u2019s goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, [as in <em>Gore], </em>or, [as in <em>Campbell], </em>of 145 to 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S. Ct. at 1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b654 In this case, the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages is 5:1, which fits comfortably within the single-digit instructive numerical guidelines. Additionally, the award ratio is lower than previous award ratios upheld by this Court. <em>See Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 199 (upholding 9:1 punitive to compensatory damages award) and <em>Marie Deonier &amp; Assocs. v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 297, \u00b6 67, 323 Mont. 387, 101 P.3d 742 (reinstating 6.67:1 punitive to compensatory damages award). The single-digit ratio under the second <em>Gore </em>guidepost lends support to the jury\u2019s punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">\n<em>Comparable Penalties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\u00b655 The last <em>Gore </em>guidepost requires that we consider \u201cthe difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\u201d <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 190 (citing <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 418, 123 S. Ct. at 1520). \u201c[A] reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should accord substantial deference to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Seltzer, \u00b6 </em>190 (citing <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 583, 116 S. Ct. at 1603). Neither party addresses the third guidepost or provides authority for civil sanctions. However, we note several state courts, including this Court, have sustained punitive damages awards when the last guidepost did not completely counsel in support of the award. <em>See Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 199 (upholding a punitive damages award of $9.9 million despite not mentioning appropriate civil sanctions for the conduct at issue); <em>Lewellen v. Franklin, </em>441 S.W.3d 136, 148 (Mo. 2014) (upholding punitive damages award of $1 million against only $5,000 in possible civil sanctions); <em>Campbell v. State Farm Mat. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2004 UT 34, \u00b6 45, 98 P.3d 409 (Utah 2004) (upholding $9,018,780.75 in punitive damages against only a $10,000 civil penalty for the conduct at issue). The Montana Legislature has limited punitive damages awards by enacting \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, which provides: \u201cAn award for punitive damages may not exceed $10 million or <em>3% </em>of a defendant\u2019s net worth, whichever is less.\u201d Although this cap is not at issue here, it does provide an indication of what the Legislature views as \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d Under the last guidepost, the Legislature is entitled to deference in legislating in the area of punitive damages and \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, is a relevant consideration that favors upholding the punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b656  In light of the degree of reprehensibility of U.S. Bank\u2019s conduct, the single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, and in deference to the Legislature\u2019s expressions, we conclude that, taken together, the <em>Gore </em>guideposts support the award of punitive damages. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in upholding the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b657 <em>6. Did the District Court err by ordering the accrual of post-judgment interest from the date of its order confirming the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b658 Section 25-9-204, MCA, provides, the \u201cclerk shall include in <em>the judgment... </em>any interest on the <em>verdict </em>or <em>decision </em>of the court, from the time <em>it </em>was <em>rendered </em>or <em>made.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In her cross-appeal, McCulley argues that the appropriate date from which post-judgment interest should accrue is the date of the \u201cverdict,\u201d February 7, 2014, and not the date of the District Court\u2019s later \u201cdecision\u201d to affirm the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages, April 14,2014. McCulley reasons that the statute is unambiguous in its requirement that post-judgment interest accrues from the date the jury\u2019s \u201cverdict\u201d is \u201crendered.\u201d The Bank contends that the statute is unambiguous in its requirement that post-judgment interest accrues from the date that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the \u201cdecision of the court\u201d is \u201cmade.\u201d Neither of these approaches solves the dilemma of interpreting the statute as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b659 We interpret a statute by first looking to the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, 152 P.3d 1288. We construe a statute by \u201creading and interpreting the statute as a whole, \u2018without isolating specific terms from the context in which they are used by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 25, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819 (quoting <em>Mont. Sports Shooting Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2008 MT 190, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 1, 185 P.3d 1003). We also \u201cread and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 25 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cWhere there are several provisions or particulars\u201d of a statute, \u201csuch a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b660 In <em>Hulstine v. Lennox Indus., </em>2010 MT 180, 357 Mont. 228, 237 P.3d 1277, we were faced with the question under this statute of whether interest should accrue from the date of the district court\u2019s entry of \u201cjudgment\u201d or the date of the jury\u2019s \u201cverdict.\u201d <em>Hulstine, </em>\u00b6 27. We concluded that \u201cSection 25-9-204, MCA, clearly and unambiguously allows post-judgment interest from the time the verdict was rendered.\u201d <em>Hulstine, </em>\u00b6 28. Thus, we implicitly decided that the pronoun \u201cit\u201d used in \u00a7 25-9-204, MCA, did not refer to \u201cjudgment,\u201d but instead referenced \u201cverdict or decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b661 The plain language of the statute appears to correlate the phrase \u201cverdict or decision\u201d with the phrase \u201crendered or made\u201d so that interest will be assessed on damages whether awarded by a jury (\u201cinterest on the verdict ... from the time it was rendered\u201d) or by a judge (\u201cinterest on the ... decision of the court, from the time it was ... made.\u201d). The apparent intention is to assess interest from the time the damages award is entered, whether by a jury or by a judge acting as factfinder. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-l-221(7)(b), MCA (governing awards of punitive damages by judge acting as factfinder). This rendering of the language gives effect to all of the provisions and is consistent with our decision in <em>Hulstine </em>interpreting the statute to assess interest from the date of the verdict, as well as with the purpose of the statute. \u201cThe purpose of postjudgment interest is to compensate a successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss during the time between ascertainment of the damage and payment by the defendant.\u201d 47 C. J.S, <em>Interest &amp; Usury </em>\u00a7 120 (2014). In a jury trial, the damages are \u201cascertained\u201d at the time of the verdict. Although a jury\u2019s damages award could later be \u201cincreased or decreased,\u201d \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>by the trial court, the calculation of accruing interest can be adjusted to reflect the adjusted award in that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b662 While our precedent is at odds with the federal courts, they have recognized that the purpose of post-judgment interest favors accruing the interest as of the date of the verdict. In <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue we addressed in <em>Hulstine: </em>\u201cwhether interest should be calculated from the date of verdict or the date of judgment^]\u201d <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>494 U.S. 827, 834, 110 S. Ct. 1570, 1575 (1990). The U.S. Supreme Court explained the federal statute at issue, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, \u201creferred] specifically to the \u2018date of judgment,\u2019 \u201d and thus the Court \u201cconclude[d] that postjudgment interest properly runs from the date of the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp, </em>494 U.S. at 835, 110 S. Ct. at 1576. Nonetheless, in rationalizing its holding the U.S. Supreme Court explained its decision conflicted with the purposes of post-judgment interest: \u201cEven though denial of interest from verdict to judgment may result in the plaintiff bearing the burden of the loss of the use of the money from verdict to judgment, the allocation of the costs accruing from litigation is a matter for the legislature, not the courts.\u201d <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>494 U.S. at 835, 110 S. Ct. at 1576.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b663  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court erred by ordering accrual of post-judgment interest from the date of its decision. The court should have ordered accrual of interest from the date of the jury\u2019s verdict on February 7, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b664 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-5\"> TheTruth-In-LendmgAct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq., is designed to \u201csafeguard the consumer in connection with the utilization of credit by requiring full disclosure of the terms and conditions of finance charges in credit transactions or in offers to extend credit; by restricting the garnishment of wages; and by creating the National Commission on Consumer Finance to study and make recommendations on the need for further regulation of the consumer finance industry; and for other purposes.\u201d Pub.
