We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">\u00b62 The issue presented for review is whether the District Court erred when it concluded that a 2007 finding by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, precludes Omimex from litigating the issue of whether it operates \u201ca single and continuous property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">\u00b63 Omimex is an oil and gas exploration and production company which owns and operates oil and gas production property in Montana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>including flow lines and gathering lines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Omimex presently contests DOR\u2019s central assessment of its property for tax year 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b64 Pursuant to \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA, DOR centrally assesses \u201cproperty owned by a corporation or other person operating a single and continuous property operated in more than one county or more than one state ... .\u201d Properties that are not centrally assessed are locally assessed on a county-by-county basis. Centrally assessed properties may be subject to classification as class nine property under \u00a7 15-6-141, MCA, and taxed at a rate of 12 percent of market value. Oil and gas production equipment is otherwise classified under \u00a7 15-6-138, MCA, as class eight property and subject to a tax rate of 1.5 percent to 3 percent of market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b65 For tax year 2004, DOR centrally assessed Omimex\u2019s property and classified it under class nine. Omimex contested that assessment in the Lewis and Clark County District Court, claiming it did not operate \u201ca single and continuous property,\u201d and thus its properties should be locally assessed and subject to the lower tax rate under class eight. A bench trial was conducted before Judge Jeffrey Sherlock, who issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on February 2, 2007. Judge Sherlock found that although Omimex\u2019s properties were not physically connected, they operated as a single and continuous property because they were centrally managed by Omimex\u2019s head office in Fort Worth, Texas. Judge Sherlock then addressed Omimex\u2019s contention that its property should be classified under class eight, concluding that class eight \u201cwould apply only if the property were not centrally assessed.... Class eight property would be, in the view of the Court, all gas production equipment that was not centrally assessed.\u201d Judge Sherlock concluded both central assessment and classification under class nine were proper. He then directed counsel for DOR to prepare a judgment incorporating his findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b66 Omimex appealed. On appeal, this Court began by stating, \u201cRegardless of whether Omimex\u2019s property is centrally or locally assessed, its tax rate class is determined by the application of the physical attributes of Omimex\u2019s Montana properties to the terms of the property classification statutes ... .\u201d <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 18. We looked to the definition of class nine property at \u00a7 15-6-141, MCA (2003), which included \u201ccentrally assessed natural gas companies having a major distribution system in this state ....\u201d <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 20. We concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>that because Omimex did not have a major distribution system in the state, its property was not subject to classification under class nine, regardless of whether it was centrally assessed. <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 26. We therefore considered it unnecessary to address the District Court\u2019s conclusion that central assessment was appropriate because Omimex operated a single and continuous property. <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 27. We reversed the judgment and remanded for entry of an amended judgment classifying the Omimex properties under class eight. <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 27. On remand, Judge Sherlock entered an amended judgment, vacating and superseding the earlier judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b67 In 2009, the Legislature amended \u00a7 15-6-141, MCA, deleting the phrase \u201ccompanies having a major distribution system in this state,\u201d and specifically including within class nine \u201ccommon carrier pipeline[s]\u201d and \u201cpipeline carrier[s].\u201d 2009 Mont. Laws 487. Section 15-23-101, MCA, was also amended to fist common carrier pipelines and pipeline carriers among the types of property subject to central assessment. 2009 Mont. Laws 487. The amendments did not alter the provision of \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA, requiring DOR to centrally assess properties operated as a single and continuous property.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b68 For tax year 2011, DOR again centrally assessed Omimex\u2019s property and classified it under class nine. Omimex filed a declaratory action in the Silver Bow County District Court, claiming it did not operate as a common carrier pipeline or a pipeline carrier. Omimex further argued it did not operate a single and continuous property, and thus did \u201cnot even meet the foundational statutory requirements for central assessment... .\u201d DOR moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that Judge Sherlock had already determined during the previous litigation that Omimex operated a single and continuous property. DOR claimed the doctrine of issue preclusion barred Omimex from relitigating the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b69 In response, Omimex argued that issue preclusion was inapplicable because there was no final judgment on the merits. The judgment issued by Judge Sherlock was vacated on remand, and this Court did not reach the central assessment issue on appeal. Omimex also submitted an affidavit by its vice president, Clark Storms, describing changes to Omimex\u2019s personal property since tax year 2004. Storms said Omimex had drilled additional wells, rerouted the flow of gas from one of its fields, acquired additional oil production property, and upgraded several items of equipment. Omimex claimed central assessment may no longer be appropriate due to these changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b610 The District Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of DOR, determining that our decision on appeal \u201cdid not reverse the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>court\u2019s ruling that Omimex was properly subject to central assessment because it operated a single and continuous property....\u201d The District Court further concluded that Judge Sherlock\u2019s amended judgment, which vacated the original judgment, \u201c[did] nothing to undermine the finality of Judge Sherlock\u2019s determination that Omimex operates a single and continuous property.\u201d Omimex appealed the District Court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Planned Parenthood v. State, </em>2015 MT 31, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 151, 342 P.3d 684. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred when it concluded that a 2007 finding by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, precludes Omimex from litigating the issue of whether it operates \u201ca single and continuous property.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b613 Issue preclusion, also sometimes referred to as collateral estoppel, \u201c Tbars the reopening of an issue that has been litigated and resolved in a prior suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>2006 MT 34, \u00b6 20, 331 Mont. 145, 130 P.3d 594 (quoting <em>Kullick v. Skyline Homeowners Assn., </em>2003 MT 137, \u00b6 18, 316 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 225). The doctrine of issue preclusion prevents litigants from reopening questions that were necessary to the determination of the prior action. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 18, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267. Courts apply the doctrine in order to prevent \u201cincessant[] ... piecemeal, collateral attacks against judgments.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 15. Issue preclusion applies where the following four elements are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical to the issue raised in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">3. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">4. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue which may be barred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-13\"><em>McDaniel v. State, </em>2009 MT 159, \u00b6 28, 350 Mont. 422, 208 P.3d 817. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>There is no dispute that the parties in the present action are the same parties involved in the 2007 litigation. Omimex contends that the remaining three elements of issue preclusion are not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b614  Primarily, Omimex argues there was no final judgment on the merits regarding whether it operates a single and continuous property because Judge Sherlock\u2019s 2007judgment was reversed and vacated on remand. DOR responds that although the judgment was vacated, the finding that Omimex operated a single and continuous property \u2014 upon which the judgment was based \u2014 was not. Issue preclusion bars a party from reopening matters necessary to the determination of the previous judgment. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Haines Pipeline Constr. v. Montana Power Co., </em>265 Mont. 282, 288, 876 P.2d 632, 636 (1994); <em>Boyd v. First Interstate Bank, N.A., </em>253 Mont. 214, 218, 833 P.2d 149, 151 (1992). In <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 27, we stated that it was not necessary to address the question of central assessment. The amended judgment, which vacated and superseded the previous judgment, was entered in accordance with <em>Omimex I. </em>Thus, although the finding that Omimex operated a single and continuous property may have been essential to the original judgment, it was not essential to our Opinion or to the amended judgment, and should not be afforded preclusive effect. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Haines Pipeline Constr,, </em>265 Mont. at 288, 876 P.2d at 636; <em>Boyd, </em>253 Mont. at 218, 833 P.2d at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b615  Further, when a judgment is reversed, the \u201c \u2018judgment cannot serve as the basis for a disposition on the grounds of res judicata or collateral estoppel [issue preclusion].\u2019 \u201d <em>Cal. Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Thompson, </em>321 F.3d 835, 847 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Ornellas v. Oakley, </em>618 F.2d 1351, 1356 (9th Cir. 1980)). The judgment in the 2007 litigation was three sentences long and stated that it was based upon Judge Sherlock\u2019s previously-entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. The judgment itself added no substantive legal analysis. A determination that the judgment was vacated, but the extensive reasoning, findings, and conclusions upon which it wholly relied were not, would elevate form over substance. Moreover, to reverse and vacate a judgment, yet leave intact the findings and conclusions incorporated in that judgment, would lead to contradictory and unclear results.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b616 We next address whether Omimex was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous action. Omimex argues it was not afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the question of whether it operates a single and continuous property because the issue was not conclusively decided on appeal. DOR cites a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>cases for the proposition that appellate review is not a required component of a full and fair opportunity to litigate. The cases cited, however, are those in which the party against whom preclusion was asserted never appealed from the first litigation. <em>McDaniel, </em>\u00b640; <em>Johnson v. Hamilton, </em>2003 MT 199, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 24, 75 P.3d 778; <em>Burgess v. State, </em>237 Mont. 364, 365, 772 P.2d 1272, 1273 (1989). DOR also argues that our issue preclusion inquiry has never focused on whether the issue was addressed on appeal. In the cases cited by DOR as supporting examples, either no appeal was taken from the prior decision, <em>Burgess, </em>237 Mont. at 365, 772 P.2d at 1273; <em>Nasi v. State Dept. of Highways, </em>231 Mont. 395, 396, 753 P.2d 327, 328 (1988), or the prior decision was squarely affirmed on appeal, <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Goodover, </em>264 Mont. 449, 453, 872 P.2d 764, 766 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b617 Our issue preclusion analysis is instead focused on whether the parties had a full and fair <em>opportunity </em>to litigate the issue. <em>E.g., McDaniel, </em>\u00b6 45; <em>Burgess, </em>237 Mont. at 366, 772 P.2d at 1273. Although we have adopted a relaxed requirement of finality for purposes of issue preclusion, with the result that a judgment may have preclusive effect even while an appeal is pending, <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 21, a full and fair opportunity to litigate nevertheless includes the opportunity to pursue an appeal, <em>Bell v. Dillard Dept. Stores, </em>85 F.3d 1451, 1456-57 (10th Cir. 1996); <em>Gray v. Lacke, </em>885 F.2d 399, 406 (7th Cir. 1989); <em>Monat v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>677 N.W.2d 843, 847 (Mich. 2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a party has the opportunity, but chooses not to actually seek an appeal, issue preclusion may be applied. <em>McDaniel, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Burgess, </em>237 Mont. at 365, 772 P.2d at 1273; <em>Nasi, </em>231 Mont. at 396, 753 P.2d at 328. Where appellate review is unavailable, however, issue preclusion should not be applied. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28 cmt. a (1982), For that reason, \u201c[i]f the appellate court upholds one of [the district court\u2019s] determinations as sufficient and refuses to consider whether or not the other is sufficient and accordingly affirms the judgment, the judgment is conclusive as to the first determination,\u201d but not the other. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. o; <em>see also People ex rel. Brown v. Tri-Union Seafoods, LLC, </em>171 Cal. App. 4th 1549, 1574 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009) (\u201cWhere... a court of first instance renders its judgment on alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>grounds and the reviewing court affirms on only one of those grounds, the grounds not considered are not conclusively established.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b618  Omimex did not forego the opportunity to seek review of the finding that it operated a single and continuous property. To the contrary, Omimex pursued its right to an appeal and specifically asked this Court to address the single and continuous property issue. <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 3. We considered it unnecessary to do so in the context of that appeal. <em>Omimex I, </em>\u00b6 27. As a result, despite its diligence, Omimex was unable to obtain review of Judge Sherlock\u2019s findings. Because we addressed only one of the issues raised in <em>Omimex I, </em>the other issues, including whether Omimex operated a single and continuous property, were not conclusively determined. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. o. Omimex is not precluded from now obtaining a determination of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b619 Finally, Omimex argues that the property assessed in tax year 2011 is not identical to the property assessed in tax year 2004, and thus, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Omimex continues to operate a single and continuous property. Though the parties and the District Court have framed the issue as one of the existence of genuine issues of material fact on the single and continuous property issue, we find that this argument coincides with the first element of issue preclusion: whether the issue raised in the current litigation is \u201c \u2018identical in all respects\u2019 \u201d to the issue decided in the previous litigation. <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>Comm\u2019r v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 599-600, 68 S. Ct. 715, 720 (1948)). We recently addressed the identity of issues in <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>where we considered whether a previously-decided constitutional challenge to the 1995 version of a law precluded the State from defending a similar constitutional challenge to the 2011 and 2013 versions of that law. <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>\u00b6 2. We stated that although the same constitutional questions were raised in both the first and second suits, the laws being challenged were not substantively identical, and thus issue preclusion was inapplicable. <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b620 Here, although the same question \u2014 whether Omimex operates a single and continuous property \u2014 has been raised in both the first and second suits, the property at issue has changed, just as the laws at issue had changed in <em>Planned Parenthood. </em>Omimex has drilled additional wells, diverted one of its gas lines, and acquired additional oil production properties. The 2007 litigation did not determine, and indeed could not have determined, whether these newly acquired properties are operated as a single and continuous property. The issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>raised in the present litigation is therefore similar, but not identical in all respects to the issue raised in the 2007 litigation. Issue preclusion requires not just similarity, but identity. <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"Agqk\">\u00b621  Further, we have previously observed that \u201ceach tax year is singular and self-contained.\u201d <em>Eagle Commc\u2019ns v. Treasurer of Flathead Cnty., </em>211 Mont. 195, 203, 685 P.2d 912, 916 (1984). DOR conducts a separate assessment and imposes a separate tax for each year. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 15-1-212, MCA (referring to \u201ccentrally assessed property or industrial property that is assessed annually by the department\u201d) and \u00a7 15-23-101, MCA (\u201cThe department shall centrally assess each year ... .\u201d). In the context of a requirement for annual assessment and valuation, and where Omimexhas produced evidence of changes in the characteristics of its property, application of issue preclusion is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b622  In treating the issue as one of whether genuine questions of material fact existed as to the single and continuous property issue, rather than as to whether the issue litigated in 2007 was identical to the issue in the present litigation, the District Court concluded that Storm\u2019s affidavit describing changes to Omimex\u2019s property did not speak to whether Omimex operated a single and continuous property. This characterization is accurate, but fails to account for the fact that the affidavit was submitted in response to a motion for partial summary judgment based on issue preclusion. Thus, the affidavit was not submitted to prove that Omimex did not operate a single and continuous property; it was submitted to prove that the issue of whether Omimex operated a single and continuous property in tax year 2004 was not identical to the issue of whether Omimex operated a single and continuous property in tax year 2011. Because the current litigation addresses a different tax year, and because Omimex has produced evidence that the characteristics of its property have changed, Omimexhas demonstrated the existence of genuine questions of material fact regarding whether the issue in the current litigation is identical to the issue in the 2007 litigation, precluding summary judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, the Order of the District Court granting partial summary judgment in favor of DOR is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> A description of Omimex\u2019s property and operations may be found at <em>Omimex Can., Ltd. v.
