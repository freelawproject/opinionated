(Mother) appeals an order of the Eighth Judicial District Court terminating her parental rights to her daughter, H.T. She asserts that the District Court failed to comply with both state and federal statutory requirements for terminating parental rights to an Indian child. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the termination of Mother\u2019s rights must he reversed because the District Court failed to hold an adjudicatory hearing that complied with \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Courts failure to follow statutory requirements for proceedings subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act requires reversal.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u00b62 We affirm on the first issue, and vacate and remand for entry of a new order on the issue of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\u00b63 The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) filed a petition for emergency protective services on October 10, 2012, alleging drug use by Mother and domestic violence between Mother and her boyfriend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The affidavit of a child protection specialist attached to the petition explained the circumstances. Law enforcement officers contacted the Department after being called to a Great Falls motel for a domestic violence incident. Seven-year-old H.T. told the specialist that Mother began drinking and arguing with her boyfriend on the night that H.T. was taken into emergency protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>custody. Mother and H.T. left the motel to visit Mother\u2019s friend, from whom they obtained pills that they brought back to the room. H.T. reported that Mother and her boyfriend crushed the pills and \u201csniffled] them up their noses.\u201d The arguing continued and eventually escalated into physical violence. When police arrived, H.T. was found scared and exhausted, wearing what appeared to be her mother\u2019s dirty clothes. H.T. told the specialist that there had been violence between Mother and her boyfriend in the past and that she feared the boyfriend would kill her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b64 The Department\u2019s petition sought immediate protection and temporary legal custody of H.T. to prevent further exposure to abuse and neglect. The petition stated that \u201cthe child maybe an Indian Child for the purposes of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).\u201d The accompanying affidavit farther indicated that inquiry had been made of Mother and of the maternal grandparents regarding H.T.\u2019s tribal affiliation. Based on those inquiries, notices of the action were sent to the Blackfeet Tribe and to the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The affidavit also stated that a letter had been sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for confirmation of tribal affiliation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court granted the motion for emergency protective services and temporary legal custody. The court\u2019s October 17,2012 order found that the Department was justified in not making active efforts to prevent H.T.\u2019s removal from the home \u201cbecause the child was in immediate or apparent danger of harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b65 Following the Department\u2019s efforts to locate a suitable kinship placement, H.T. was placed with a maternal great aunt on October 26, 2012. On November 15, 2012, the District Court held a show cause hearing. Mother did not contest probable cause at the show cause hearing, but her counsel stated, \u201cWe do want a separate adjudicatory hearing, just in case,\u201d The court accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation that probable cause existed to believe that H.T. was subject to abuse or neglect, and advised that it would set a date for an adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b66 The District Court initially set the adjudicatory hearing for February 7,2013, but later rescheduled the hearing for April 25,2013, The Department filed a supplemental affidavit on April 17 that updated information about H.T. and Mother since the child\u2019s removal. The affidavit indicated that the Department had received information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that H.T. was eligible for enrollment in the Fort Belknap Tribe. At the commencement of the April 25 hearing, the court began by stating, \u201cThis is the time that has been set for a show cause hearing in the matter of [H.T.]\u201d The Department\u2019s counsel indicated that the matter was set for disposition and that a treatment plan had been signed by all parties. The court then announced, \u201cI stand corrected. This is a dispositional hearing.\u201d The court inquired about Mother\u2019s stipulation to her treatment plan and about H.T.\u2019s current placement. Mother confirmed that she understood the treatment plan; her appointed counsel, who by that time had been substituted for Mother\u2019s previous attorney, indicated that there was no objection to temporary legal custody or to the treatment plan. The hearing never addressed H.T.\u2019s adjudication and the record contains no stipulation to adjudication of H.T. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b67 The District Court issued an order after the April 25,2013 hearing that adjudicated H.T. a youth in need of care. The order also required Mother to comply with her treatment plan, approved of H.T.\u2019s current placement, and granted the Department temporary legal custody for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b68 On November 5,2013, the Department filed notice that H.T. was eligible for enrollment with the Assiniboine and Gros Ventres Tribes at the Fort Belknap Indian Community (hereafter referred to as Fort Belknap). The notice appended a letter from Fort Belknap dated April 17, 2013, indicating that it \u201cchooses to intervene as a third party to monitor\u201d the proceedings and would \u201cleave jurisdiction with the state court while the plan remains reunification.\u201d Fort Belknap reserved the right to transfer jurisdiction \u201cat a later time if Termination of Parental Rights appears imminent or has taken place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b69 The Department filed a petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights on November 6,2013. The termination petition alleged that Mother had not complied with her treatment plan and that H.T.\u2019s father had abandoned H.T. The Department filed a notice on November 18, 2013, establishing that Fort Belknap had confirmed receipt of the termination petition on November 13, 2013. The court held a termination hearing on January 9,2014, and adopted and approved the termination petition. Fort Belknap did not participate in the proceedings. The court later issued a written order terminating both Mother\u2019s parental rights and the father\u2019s parental rights to H.T. and granting the Department permanent legal custody. Mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b6 10 Compliance with state statutory requirements presents a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Parks, </em>2013 MT 280, \u00b6 20, 372 Mont. 88, 310 P.3d 1088; <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>2003 MT 241, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28, 317 Mont. 291, 77 P.3d 189. We will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re T.S., </em>2013 MT 274, \u00b6 21, 372 Mont. 79, 310 P.3d 538. We will not reverse a district court\u2019s ruling by reason of an error that \u201cwould have no significant impact upon the result.\u201d <em>In re J.C., </em>2008 MT 127, \u00b6 43, 343 Mont. 30, 183 P.3d 22 (quoting <em>In re A.N. and C.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 39, 298 Mont. 237, 995 P.2d 427).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b611 \u201cIn a case governed by ICWA, we will uphold the district court\u2019s termination of parental rights if a reasonable fact-finder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d <em>In re K.B. &amp; T.B., </em>2013 MT 133, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 254, 301 P.3d 836. We review the court\u2019s application of the law to the facts of the case for correctness. <em>In re K.B. &amp; T.B., </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the termination of Mother\u2019s rights must be reversed because the District Court failed to hold an adjudicatory hearing that complied with \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b613 Mother does not dispute that she did not raise before the District Court any of the issues on which she appeals. She argues that her appeal nevertheless is reviewable because it is based on violations of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912, a provision of ICWA. The Department correctly points out, however, that a closer reading of Mother\u2019s brief reveals an argument that the District Court erred by failing to hold an adjudicatory hearing that complied with \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA. This argument is based on a violation of state law, not ICWA. Accordingly, we first decide whether to consider this argument on appeal without reference to ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b614 Generally, this Court will not review an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>In re D.K.D., </em>2011 MT 74, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 76, 250 P.3d 856. We apply the common law plain error doctrine where the error is \u201cplain\u201d and we are \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d that an aspect of the proceeding would result in \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>In re D.K.D., </em>\u00b6 16; <em>In re Custody &amp; Parental Rights of D.A., </em>2008 MT 247, \u00b6 33, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>631. We invoke the plain error doctrine sparingly. <em>In re D.K.D., </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">\u00b615 Under Montana law, a court may terminate a parent\u2019s rights for failure to successfully complete or to comply with a court-ordered treatment plan only if the child is first adjudicated a youth in need of care in accordance with \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. Unless the petition seeks termination on alternate grounds such as relinquishment, abandonment, or circumstances in which a treatment plan is not required, adjudication as a youth in need of care is \u201ca threshold requirement without which a court may not grant temporary legal custody, order a court ordered treatment plan, or terminate a person\u2019s parental rights under the statute.\u201d <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>\u00b6 22 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-406(1)(c), 41-3-420(1), and 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA); <em>In re T.C., </em>2001 MT 264, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 244, 37 P.3d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b616 A parent may stipulate that the child meets the definition of a youth in need of care. Section 41-3-434(1), MCA. <em>\u201cA </em>parent\u2019s valid stipulation under \u00a7 41-3-434, MCA, can satisfy the required findings for the adjudication of a youth in need of care even absent an evidentiary hearing.\u201d In <em>re J.M., </em>2009 MT 332, \u00b6 22, 353 Mont. 64, 218 P.3d 1213. If the parent does not stipulate to adjudication, the adjudicatory hearing must be held within ninety days of the show cause hearing. Section 41-3-437(1), MCA. At the adjudicatory hearing, the court \u201cshall hear evidence regarding the residence of the child, paternity, if in question, the whereabouts of the parents, guardian, or nearest adult relative, and any other matters the court considers relevant in determining the status of the child.\u201d Section 41-3-437(3), MCA. \u201cAdjudication must determine the nature of the abuse and neglect and establish facts that resulted in state intervention and upon which disposition, case work, court review, and possible termination are based.\u201d Section 41-3-437(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b617 It appears from review of the record that the Department assumed, based on Mother\u2019s other stipulations, that she stipulated to adjudication and that the matter was set for disposition when the parties appeared in open court on April 25, 2013. As noted above, the record does not contain any such stipulation. The Department argues on appeal that Mother\u2019s stipulation to her treatment plan \u201cnecessarily meant that [Mother] also stipulated that H.T. was a Youth in Need of Care.\u201d In <em>In re M.J.W., </em>however, we held that neither a finding sufficient to establish child abuse or neglect nor an order approving of the parents\u2019 treatment plans constituted adjudication where the court did not address adjudication in any way. <em>In re M.J.W., </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 289 Mont. 232, 961 P.2d 105. Likewise, we have observed that adoption of a stipulation for temporary legal custody \u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>equate to an adjudication by the court that the children were youths in need of care.\u201d <em>In re the Matter of M.O., M.O., and M.O., </em>2003 MT 4, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 13, 62 P.3d 265. Similarly, Mother\u2019s stipulation to her treatment plan, though containing admissions sufficient to meet the definition of child abuse or neglect under \u00a7 41-3-102(7), MCA, does not constitute a stipulation to adjudication of H.T. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b618 Without a stipulation to adjudication, the District Court was required to conduct an adjudicatory hearing. The hearing held on April 25,2013, did not comply with \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA. Although the District Court scheduled an adjudicatory hearing, due to what appears to have been a mix-up by the court and counsel, the court changed the hearing to a dispositional hearing almost immediately after it began. The record of the hearing reflects that Mother stipulated to her treatment plan and to temporary legal custody, but the parties made no mention of adjudication. These stipulations were inadequate to meet the statutory requirement of either stipulation to adjudication or an adjudicatory hearing. The court mistakenly stated in a subsequent order that Mother\u2019s attorney \u201cstipulated to the adjudication of the Youth as a Youth in Need of Care ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b619 We have determined, however, that a court\u2019s failure to conduct a formal adjudicatory hearing may be harmless error. <em>In re J.C., </em>\u00b6 54. This Court continually has stated that \u201cwe will not fault a district court for failing to address statutory deficiencies that are not brought to its attention during the proceedings because doing so would encourage litigants to withhold objections rather than raise the issues appropriately in the district court.\u201d <em>In re A.S., </em>2006 MT 281, \u00b6 35, 334 Mont. 280, 146 P.3d 778 <em>(quotingIn re A.N.W., </em>2006 MT 42, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 208, 130 P.3d 619). In <em>In </em>re A.S., we pointed out that a parent acquiesced to a child\u2019s adjudication as a youth in need of care when there was no objection to the adjudication and the adjudication was referenced repeatedly in court documents leadingup to the termination hearing. <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b620 Mother stipulated to her treatment plan, which stated that she \u201cadmittedly has a history of drug usage\u201d and \u201cneeded treatment for alcohol and drugs.\u201d Mother\u2019s treatment plan acknowledges that, on the night of H.T.\u2019s removal, she abused prescription medications and drank alcohol \u201cto the point of being unable to care for her daughter.\u201d The plan also documents Mother\u2019s history of relationships with \u201cabusive and unstable men,\u201d and states that Mother \u201cfailed to protect her child from exposure to domestic violence.\u201d By agreeing to the plan, Mother acknowledged that her mental health and substance abuse issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cprevented her from... parenting her child safely or providing] care for her on [a] consistent basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b621  Mother\u2019s treatment plan stipulates that she was unable to care for H.T. Mother never raised an objection to the court\u2019s subsequent order adjudicating H.T. a youth in need of care, and she failed to point out the court\u2019s error until this appeal. Mother does not contest her failure to follow her treatment plan. \u201cWe have held consistently that a district court may protect a child\u2019s best interest despite procedural errors that would have no impact upon the result.\u201d <em>In re </em>M.S., 2014 MT 265A, \u00b6 22, 376 Mont. 394, 336 P.3d 930 (citations omitted). Although the court erred by not holding a proper adjudicatory hearing prior to the termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights, this error was not \u201cplain\u201d or obvious. As in <em>In re A.S., </em>we hold that Mother waived her right to appeal the adjudication issue because she did not timely object or raise the issue before the District Court. Under the circumstances, the error did not undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceedings and reversing the termination order on this ground is not justified. <em>In re J.C., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-43; <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b622 <em>2. Whether the District Court's failure to follow statutory requirements for proceedings subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act requires reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b623 Congress enacted ICWA in 1978 \u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902. ICWA \u201cestablishes the minimum federal standards for the removal of an Indian child from her family and the placement of such a child in a foster or adoptive home.\u201d <em>In re M.S., </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b624 Mother argues that the District Court failed to comply with numerous ICWA requirements. She argues: that the court was required, but failed, to meet ICWA\u2019s notice and evidentiary requirements at the adjudicatory stage; that Fort Belknap did not receive proper notice of the termination hearing; that, at the termination stage of the proceedings, the court failed to make oral or written findings that continued custody of H.T. by Mother \u201cis likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child;\u201d that the District Court applied the incorrect standard of proof at the termination hearing, relying on the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard provided under state law instead of ICWA\u2019s \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard; and finally, that the court improperly based its termination decision solely on Mother\u2019s substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">\u00b625 Although Mother reuses these arguments for the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>appeal, \u00a7 1914 of ICWA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">Any Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under State law, any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed, and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 101,102, and 103 of this Act [25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1911, 1912, and 1913],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914. The issues Mother raises are thus appealable despite the failure to object. <em>In re K.B. &amp; T.B., </em>\u00b6 22 (noting that an appeals court is a court of competent jurisdiction under \u00a7 1914 and ICWA notice requirements may be raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">A <em>Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b626 ICWA specifies that notice of an involuntary proceeding in state court and of the right of intervention must be given to an Indian child\u2019s tribe when a party seeks the foster care placement of, or the termination of the parental rights to, an Indian child. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a), If the child\u2019s tribe cannot be identified, notice instead must be provided to the Secretary of the Interior. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). ICWA\u2019s requirement of timely notice serves as a limitation on both foster care placements and termination proceedings. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) (\u201cNo foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A591\">\u00b627 Mother first argues that Fort Belknap did not receive notice of the April 25, 2013 hearing, without which adjudication was in error. Second, Mother argues that Fort Belknap did not receive notice by registered mail of the January 9, 2014 termination hearing. We address these arguments in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b628 ICWA imposes a specific notice requirement for pending proceedings involving \u201cthe foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child[.]\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). We have observed that if there is any question about whether notice is to be given before both foster care and termination proceedings, the \u201c \u2018question should be resolved in favor of giving notice twice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re M.S., </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>People ex rel. S.R.M., </em>153 P.3d 438, 442 (Colo. Ct. App. 2006)). We have not, however, required adherence to this specific notice requirement where it is not prescribed by the provisions of ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u00b629 In this case, H.T. was taken from her mother under emergency circumstances and placed in kinship foster care before the first status conference. The Department made efforts promptly to identify and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>notify the proper tribe. The tribe that ultimately was determined to be the child\u2019s tribe was not notified before the initial placement, but ICWA does not prevent emergency removal of an Indian child or the emergency placement of such a child into foster care when necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fort Belknap sent a letter dated April 17, 2013, confirming H.T.\u2019s eligibility for enrollment, showing that it received notice of the action \u2014 if not specifically the scheduled adjudicatoiy hearing \u2014 before the April 25,2013 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b630 In most circumstances, the Department must give notice before a foster care placement occurs. After an emergency removal, ICWA proceedings must be initiated \u201cexpeditiously,\u201d meaning that the Department is excused <em>from </em>the normal notice requirement but is obligated to provide prompt notice in compliance with \u00a7 1912(a) after the foster care placement occurs. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922. Here, the child\u2019s removal occurred on an emergency basis, the Department proceeded expeditiously to identify and notify the proper tribe, and Fort Belknap confirmed notice and advised that it intended to monitor the proceedings as long as reunification was the plan. Because foster care placement already had been made prior to identification of the child\u2019s tribe and before the April 25 hearing, we conclude that any delay in notifying Fort Belknap of the proceedings was not improper under ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b631 Mother also argues that the record does not establish ICWAcompliant notice to Fort Belknap of the termination hearing, because notice was not sent \u201cby registered mail with return receipt requested.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). The Fort Belknap Tribe received notice of the termination hearing by certified mail, and the Department filed a return receipt with the District Court signed by an agent of Fort Belknap acknowledging the termination petition. We recognize that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>there are some differences between registered and certified mail, with registered mail being more secure. <em>See In re Morris, </em>815 N.W.2d 62, 77 n. 22 (Mich. 2012). For the purpose of indicating that Fort Belknap was given notice, however, the two are virtually identical: both provide proof of mailing and the date and time of delivery. Return receipts to confirm delivery may be requested both for registered and for certified mail. U.S. Postal Service, <em>A Customer\u2019s Guide to Mailing, </em>9 (Sept. 2014), <em>available at </em>https://www.usps.com.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b632 Mother complains that the return receipt the Department filed made it impossible to verify whether the notice of the termination was adequate; she speculates that the Department may have provided insufficient or inaccurate information, citing <em>In re Morris. </em>However, the return receipt from Fort Belknap contained the word \u201cTermination,\u201d H.T.\u2019s last name, the date of delivery, and the case number. Receipt was acknowledged a week after the Department\u2019s termination petition was filed with the court. The return receipt confirms that Fort Belknap was informed of the pending termination in a timely manner. This stands in sharp contrast to <em>In re Morris, </em>where the Michigan Supreme Court observed that the record before it contained \u201cno postal return receipts indicating whether notice was received and, if so, by whom.\u201d <em>In re Morris, </em>491 N.W.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b633  We conclude that the Department\u2019s notice to Fort Belknap of the proceedings in this case did not violate ICWA requirements. The only delay occurred when the Department did not file until November 5, 2013, Fort Belknap\u2019s April 17, 2013 letter advising of H.T.\u2019s eligibility for enrollment. But that letter demonstrates that the Department had notified Fort Belknap of the proceedings once it learned of H.T.\u2019s affiliation and that Fort Belknap had declined to participate pending a decision by the State whether to seek termination. The Department had advised the court in its April 17 supplemental affidavit that it had made this contact with Fort Belknap. The record is sufficient to demonstrate that, once the State pursued termination, Fort Belknap received actual and timely notice of the termination proceedings. Mother\u2019s arguments are not persuasive that there is a substantive distinction between registered and certified mail that renders the termination notice invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>B. Evidentiary requirements for the April 25, 2013 hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">\u00b634 ICWA requires that \u201c[a]ny party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e). These sections mandate that \u201cactive efforts\u201d and \u201cserious emotional or physical damage\u201d must be shown before an Indian child is placed into foster care, defined as \u201cany action removing an Indian child from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b635 Mother argues that testimony about active efforts was required at the adjudicatory stage. The court\u2019s written order adjudicating H.T. a youth in need of care found that the Department made \u201creasonable efforts,\u201d not active efforts. Mother also claims that the court erred when it used a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in its order adjudicating H.T. a youth in need of care, instead of the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard prescribed by \u00a7 1912(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b636 ICWA plainly requires evidence of active efforts and \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of \u201cserious emotional or physical damage to the child\u201d before foster care placements. Montana adheres to this requirement by demanding such evidence at the show cause hearing that must be conducted after the filing of an initial child abuse and neglect petition. Section 41-3-432(l)(b), (5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b637 When an Indian child has been removed under emergency circumstances, however, ICWA requires the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The State authority, official, or agency involved shall insure that the emergency removal or placement terminates immediately when such removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child and shall expeditiously initiate a child custody proceeding subject to the provisions of this title [25 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 1911-1923], transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe, or restore the child to the parent or Indian custodian, as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"AerB\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922. The ICWA guidelines confirm that, after an emergency removal, \u201cthe agency responsible for the child\u2019s removal must promptly commence a state court proceeding for foster care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>placement.\u201d <em>ICWA Guidelines </em>\u00a7 B.7(c), 44 Fed. Reg. 67589.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b638 As noted, H.T. was placed into foster care under emergency circumstances before the proper tribe had been identified. ICWA does not prevent emergency removal of an Indian child or the emergency placement of such a child into foster care when necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922. ICWA allows temporary or emergency custody proceedings without the findings required by \u00a7 1912(d) and (e) in emergency circumstances. <em>In re Esther V., </em>248 P.3d at 872-74; <em>Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, </em>822 N.W.2d at 65. The District Court expressly found in its October 17, 2012 order granting emergency protective services that, because of H.T.\u2019s exposure to domestic violence and dangerous drugs, Mother\u2019s neglect of H.T., and Mother\u2019s incarceration and inability to parent, the Department was justified in not making active efforts to prevent H.T.\u2019s removal from the home. At the November 15,2012 show cause hearing, although Mother could have required qualified expert testimony of \u201cserious emotional or physical damage\u201d under \u00a7 41-3-432(l)(b), MCA, she did not contest the Department\u2019s request for emergency protective services or H.T.\u2019s foster care placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b639  At the hearing on April 25, 2013, Mother stipulated to temporary legal custody, allowing the Department to maintain the child\u2019s kinship foster care placement without demanding the additional findings required for such an order by \u00a7 41-3-442(1), MCA. Mother did not contest the District Court\u2019s explicit finding in its April 25, 2013 order that \u201cthe parties have stipulated that ICWA is being followed, to the current placement of the Youth, and that continued custody by the Birth Parents in this case would result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d ICWA\u2019s evidentiary requirements apply to orders \u201ceffecting a foster care placement of an Indian child.\u201d <em>ICWA Guidelines </em>\u00a7 D.3(a), 44 Fed. Reg. 67592. Here, Mother\u2019s stipulation to temporary legal custody rendered unnecessary the presentation of evidence or the finding of facts on those ICWA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\n<em>C. Evidentiary requirements for the termination hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">\u00b640 ICWA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). Mother argues that the court failed to make oral or written findings at termination that the continued custody of H.T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>by Mother \u201cis likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). Mother also makes a brief argument that the court improperly based its termination decision solely on Mother\u2019s substance abuse. Lastly, she argues that the District Court applied the incorrect standard of proof at the termination hearing, relying on the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard provided under state law instead of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard required by \u00a7 1912(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b641 We dispense quickly with the first two arguments. At the termination hearing on January 9,2014, the District Court stated on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">The Court finds that ... continued custody of the child by the mother would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child in light of her drug usage and her failure to acknowledge that... domestic violence is an unsafe situation for children to be present at, be a party to, watch their mother be abused, those are all situations that are extremely dangerous to children, and detrimental to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">This statement clearly shows that the District Court made the required findings and did not base its determination solely on Mother\u2019s substance abuse. Mother\u2019s reliance on the ICWA Guidelines for this argument is misplaced; the Guidelines state that clear and convincing evidence of likely emotional or physical damage to the child is not demonstrated by evidence that shows only \u201cthe existence of community or family poverty, crowded or inadequate housing, alcohol abuse, or non-conforming social behavior[.]\u201d <em>ICWA Guidelines, </em>\u00a7 D.3(c), 44 Fed. Reg. 67593. In her reply brief, Mother argues that the court\u2019s rationale nonetheless is inadequate because it does not reference the testimony of the ICWA expert. ICWA requires that the determination be supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201cincluding testimony of qualified expert witnesses[.]\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). It does not require, as Mother seems to suggest, that the District Court refer to the expert by name in making its determination. There is no question here that the ICWA expert\u2019s testimony met the requirements of the law. <em>See In re K.B. &amp; T.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b642 Mother\u2019s final argument reveals that the District Court incorrectly applied a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard in its written order on the termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights. At the termination hearing, although the court stated that it made all of its findings \u201c[i]in accordance with the standards necessary for an ICWA case,\u201d the court did not articulate the standard it was applying. The court\u2019s conclusions of law state that \u201cthe evidence shows, by clear and convincing evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship between the Youth and the Birth Mother will result in an ongoing risk of abuse and/or neglect to the Youth.\u201d As noted above, ICWA prohibits a parent\u2019s rights from being terminated unless the court determines, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,... that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f). ICWA sets minimum federal standards that \u201cmust be followed strictly by state courts.\u201d <em>In re K.B. &amp; T.B., </em>\u00b6 21. Holding the Department to its burden of proof is a critical requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b643  While we may uphold a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights if the evidence supports a determination \u201cthat continued custody by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child[,]\u201d <em>In re K.B. &amp; T.B., </em>\u00b6 18, whether the Department proved the requisite standards beyond a reasonable doubt should be determined in the first instance by the District Court. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for entry of a new order to address whether the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f), that continued custody of H.T. by Mother likely would result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b644 We conclude that Mother received fundamentally fair procedures prior to the termination of her parental rights. She never raised any objection to the lack of a formal adjudicatory hearing, and her stipulations reflect her assent to the determination that H.T. was abused or neglected. The child\u2019s Tribe was notified of the proceedings at the early stages, indicated its desire to monitor the case, and did not participate after it received appropriate, timely notice of the termination hearing. Proper expert testimony was presented at the termination hearing. Because the District Court applied the wrong statutory standards in its final order, however, its judgment is vacated. We remand for entry of a new order on the issue whether Mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-15\"> H.T. lived with Mother.
