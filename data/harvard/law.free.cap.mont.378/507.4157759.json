We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as whether the District Court properly applied \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, in denying the Glueckerts\u2019 petition for extended contact with their grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">\u00b63 The Glueckerts\u2019 son Thayer was married to the respondent Kristin Glueekert. Thayer and Kristin had a son, M.T., who is the Glueckerts\u2019 grandson. At the time the petition was filed in November 2013, Thayer was serving on active duty in the military and was stationed outside of Montana. Thayer and Kristin had separated but the divorce was not completed and there was no parenting plan in place. M.T. has lived with his mother Kristin since his birth in April 2013 and Thayer has only had physical contact with him when home on leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">\u00b64 The Glueckerts sought to negotiate with Kristin for regular visitation with their grandson. Kristin agreed to contact and on a number of occasions provided a one-hour visit in her residence with her present, but she would generally not allow the Glueckerts to have unsupervised visits with M.T. Most of their unsupervised visits with M.T. outside of Kristin\u2019s home have occurred when Thayer is home on leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00b65 The Glueckerts\u2019 petition under \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, sought four three-hour unsupervised visits per week with M.T., and additional unsupervised visits on special occasions during the year. Kristin objected to any additional visitation beyond the contact she had provided, and objected to any unsupervised visitation. Kristin does not agree with the Glueckerts on subjects that are important to her, such as corporal punishment, views on homosexuality and the way they treat other family members. She and the Glueckerts do not have a good relationship, and the relationship is more strained because of the dispute over visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b66 At the time of the District Court\u2019s decision Kristin was planning to move to Idaho to complete training in radiography. She was willing to allow the Glueckerts to come to Idaho to visit M.T. in supervised sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b67 In May 2014 the District Court held a hearing on the merits of the petition, and subsequently granted Kristin\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court found that since Kristin allows visits with M.T., the issue was whether visitation should be regular and unsupervised. The District Court found that Kristin is a fit parent and that the Glueckerts are capable loving grandparents who are able to meet M.T.\u2019s needs. The District Court found that the Glueckerts have a \u201cwell-reasoned and sensible\u201d position that they want to enhance their bond with M.T., but that the clear and convincing evidence required by \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, requires \u201csubstantially more\u201d to overcome the statutory presumption in favor of supporting the wishes of a fit parent. The District Court denied the petition for additional contact and the Glueckerts appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u00b68 A district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>Montana State Fund v. Simms, </em>2012 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 14, 270 P.3d 64. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment to determine whether it is correct, using the same criteria under Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint </em>Mortgage, 2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">\u00b69 <em>Issue: Whether the District Court properly applied \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, in denying the Glueckerts\u2019petition for extended contact with their grandson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u00b610  The Legislature has adopted statutes providing for grandparent-grandchild contact, \u00a7\u00a7 40-9-101 to -103, MCA. This Court recently summarized application of those provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\">The Court is required to make a determination as to whether the objecting parent is a fit parent, that is, whether the parent adequately cares for the child. Section 40-9-102(2), MCA. Contact may be granted over a fit parent\u2019s objections if clear and convincing evidence establishes that the contact would be in the best interest of the child and the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>In re Gardner v. Gardner, </em>2014 MT 290, \u00b6 12, 376 Mont. 540, 337 P.3d 751, citing \u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA, and <em>Polasek </em>v. <em>Omura, </em>2006 MT 103, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 157, 136 P.3d 519. If a fit parent objects to any aspect of the contact sought by the grandparents, there is a presumption in favor of complying with the parent\u2019s wishes and the grandparents have the burden to supply evidence to overcome that presumption. <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Polasek, </em>\u00b6 15. Clear and convincing evidence is more than a mere preponderance of the evidence, and requires evidence that is definite, clear and convincing. It does not mean unanswerable or conclusive evidence or evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Thibodeau v. Bechtold, </em>2008 MT 412, \u00b6 23, 347 Mont. 277, 198 P.3d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b611  A parent retains a fundamental right to make decisions concerning her child\u2019s care, custody and control. <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2060 (2000); <em>In re Snyder v. Spalding, </em>2010 MT 151, \u00b6 19, 357 Mont. 34, 235 P.3d 578. The best interest of the child remains intact as the standard by which a grandparent\u2019s request for contact must be judged. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b612 On appeal Kristin argues that she allowed only the limited visits because of her knowledge of the Glueckerts\u2019 \u201cactions and beliefs\u201d and her determination that limiting contact is in the best interest of her child. She points to George\u2019s expressed belief that all homosexuals would go to hell; to George\u2019s calling members of his wife\u2019s family fat and lazy; and to the way both Glueckerts gossiped about others. She is concerned that the Glueckerts would disparage her and her family to M.T. if they were alone with him, and she is concerned about their beliefs on corporal punishment. Kristin felt she was betrayed by Laura during a fight Kristin had with Thayer during one of his visits to Helena. Kristin points out that she has limited resources and that responding to the Glueckerts\u2019 petition has been financially and emotionally difficult for her. Kristin points out that she continued to offer visits with M.T. at her residence, even after the Glueckerts filed the petition, and that she would allow supervised visits if she moved to Idaho. Kristin states that she believes that it is important for M.T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to have a relationship with his grandparents but that her restrictions are in his best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b613 The Glueckerts acknowledge that Kristin is a fit parent and that she allowed them to have contact with M.T. They assert that the crux of the issue on appeal is the nature and extent of their contact with M.T., and whether the District Court properly considered the best interest of the child. They contend that Kristin\u2019s stated reasons for limiting their contact to supervised visits were frivolous and inconsistent and that the limited visits that Kristin allowed were tense and strained because Kristin insisted on watching. They argue that the District Court failed to follow the statute because it did not expressly determine what was in the best interest of M.T. The Glueckerts also acknowledge that \u201csoon\u201d there will be a parenting plan in place for M.T. as between Kristin and Thayer, and that they will \u201cundoubtedly\u201d share additional unsupervised visitation with M.T. during Thayer\u2019s parenting times.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b614  To establish a statutory right to \u201creasonable\u201d contact, \u00a7 40-9-102(1), MCA, grandparents must overcome the express preference in favor of a fit parent\u2019s wishes by clear and convincing evidence showing that what they want is in the best interest of the child. <em>In re Gardner, </em>\u00b6 12. Here the District Court found that the Glueckerts had not met the standard necessary to overcome the preference for Kristin\u2019s wishes. Kristin had accommodated visits, but on her terms. The Glueckerts do not like the contact that Kristin allowed, and they do not respect Kristin\u2019s stated reasons for limiting their contact with M.T. However, Kristin has a \u201cfundamental liberty interest\u201d to make decisions concerning the care and custody of her child. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 13. There is a presumption in Montana law that Kristin\u2019s wishes, as a fit parent, should be respected. Section 40-9-102(4), MCA; <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 12. There isa requirement that only a showing meeting the standard of clear and convincing evidence can overcome the presumption in favor of the wishes of a fit parent. Section 40-9-102(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b615 The District Court held the hearing, received the testimony, observed the witnesses, and is in the best position to weigh the evidence. The Glueckerts contend that the District Court failed to comply with \u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA, by not providing an express analysis of the best interest of the child. However, it is clear that the District Court knew and quoted the proper statutory standard. Before the Glueckerts would be entitled to extended contact under the statute, they were required to show that contact would be in the best interest of the child <em>and </em>that the presumption in favor of Kristin\u2019s wishes was overcome by clear and convincing evidence. Section 40-9-102(4), MCA. The District Court determined that they failed to overcome the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>presumption in favor of the fit parent, so no further analysis was required. <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 12. The District Court\u2019s findings on the evidence were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b616  While the District Court did not engage in a separate analysis of the best interest of M.T., the Glueckerts did not show, by clear and convincing evidence, that their goal of maintaining a bond between M.T. and their side of the family with more unsupervised visits will materially suffer without the greatly expanded visitation they desire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute requires that grandparents must demonstrate what is in the best interest of the child and must provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption in favor of the fit parent. This Court does not disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that they had not produced clear and convincing evidence that there should be a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b617 Given our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to address Glueckerts\u2019 argument concerning setting a specific visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"AJf\">\u00b618 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\"> In addition, the Glueckerts acknowledge that they fully expect to have greatly increased unsupervised contact with M.T., after Thayer finishes his enlistment with the military.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b538-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A9C\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\u00b619 I believe the Court has properly answered the issues raised by the Glueckerts regarding the interpretation of the grandparent visitation statute, but I disagree with the application of the statute to the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u00b620 The District Court\u2019s order did not provide an analysis of the child\u2019s best interest, but that would be reversible error only if it had first concluded that the presumption in favor of Kristin\u2019s wishes, as a fit parent, had been overcome by the evidence. <em>See In re Gardner, </em>\u00b6 12 (\u201cContact may be granted over a fit parent\u2019s objections, if clear and convincing evidence establishes that the contact would be in the best interest of the child and the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s wishes has been rebutted.\u201d). The Court here explains <em>In re Gardner </em>clarified that <em>\u201cany aspect </em>of the contact sought by the grandparents\u201d must be tested against both the presumption in favor of a fit parent\u2019s wishes and then the best interests of the child. Opinion, \u00b6 10 (emphasis added). Thus, it would be unnecessary for a district court to analyze the best interest issue if it concluded that the presumption in favor of the fit parent had not been overcome. Opinion, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\u00b621 The District Court found that the Glueckerts have had a long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>term, positive relationship with M.T., and that they \u201care capable, loving grandparents.\u201d They reside in a \u201cwell-kept three-bedroom home and have the ability to meet M.T.G.\u2019s needs.\u201d The court concluded that, to the extent the Glueckerts want to have \u201cregular, unsupervised contact with M.T.G. to enhance their bond with the child[,] [t]heir position is well-reasoned and sensible.\u201d The court also found that, while the Glueckerts exercise unsupervised contact with M.T. while Thayer is home on leave, Kristin forbids such contact when Thayer is away on military service. In fact, the Glueckerts have been subjected to periods without any visitation at all with M.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b622 If these findings are insufficient by themselves to rebut the presumption in favor of Kristin\u2019s desire that no unsupervised contact between Glueckerts and M.T. be permitted, then Kristin\u2019s own testimony provided the remaining clear and convincing evidence to do so, in my view. When asked under cross examination if M.T.\u2019s visits with Glueckerts, as limited and supervised by Kristin and admittedly strained by the logistics she imposed, were in M.T.\u2019s best interests, Kristin answered \u201cMaybe not right now,\u201d thereby acknowledging that such arrangements were not in M.T.\u2019s best interest. When asked how such visits could be good for M.T., Kristin\u2019s answer was \u201cWell, that\u2019s my right.\u201d I would conclude on this record that the presumption in favor of Kristin\u2019s wishes was overcome by the totality of the evidence \u2014 a conclusion that Kristin\u2019s testimony virtually acknowledges.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b623 That is not to say that the specific relief sought by the Glueckerts should be granted. Their request for multiple, multi-hour weekly unsupervised visits with M.T. may well be overreaching. However, my point is that, because I believe the Glueckerts rebutted the presumption by clear and convincing evidence, they were entitled to have the visitation issue subjected to a best interest determination by the District Court that would have set an appropriate schedule. The District Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is not the role of this Court to establish a set visitation schedule for grandparents on the basis that it believes regularly scheduled, unsupervised contact would be superior to the contact allowed by a fit parent,\u201d but, assuming the presumption is overcome, that is the court\u2019s duty. I would remand for consideration of that issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
