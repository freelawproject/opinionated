In its lengthy Decree, the court adopted a Final Parenting Plan for the parties\u2019 only remaining minor child who has since reached the age of majority. The District Court also divided a substantial marital estate. As the majority of marital assets were held in Jim\u2019s corporation, Bi Lo Foods Inc., the District Court directed Jim to undertake an IRS-regulated Divisive Reorganization (D Reorg) of Bi Lo. Jim appeals the District Court\u2019s valuation of his half of the estate and the D Reorg requirement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u00b62 The parties married in Missoula, Montana, in 1989 and had three children, all of whom have reached majority. During the marriage, the parties acquired a duplex located on 35 acres of waterfront property on the Clark Fork River. The duplex was put in Melinda\u2019s name. Additionally, Jim purchased his family\u2019s well-established Bi Lo Foods grocery store. He renamed the store Pattee Creek Market (PCM) and it is currently located at 704 SW Higgins, Missoula. PCM\u2019s grocery business is one of several assets held by Jim\u2019s Montana corporation, Bi Lo Foods Inc. Jim is the sole shareholder in Bi Lo Foods Inc. The other corporate assets included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">(1) the building in which and the land upon which PCM is located;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">(2) Trout Meadows River Ranch (the Ranch), an approximate 350-acre ranch located west of Missoula on Mallard Way;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-15\">(3) a newly-constructed residence located at the Ranch;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-16\">(4) the previous residence located on the Ranch property referred to as the \u201cold ranch house\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-18\">(5) an older residence and shop located on a separate 1.6 acre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>parcel adjacent to the Ranch property, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">(6) various equipment and personal property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b63 After deriving values for all the real property, and considering business cash flows, marital contributions, liabilities, and numerous other relevant factors, the District Court determined the net value of the marital estate was approximately $2.25 million. In an attempt to equitably divide the marital assets, the court awarded the business interests of PCM, the store\u2019s building, fixtures, equipment, and the land upon which it is located to Jim. It awarded the duplex and the Ranch with its buildings to Melinda.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b64 In its analysis, the court noted that Bi Lo Foods Inc. was incorporated in 1988 as a C Corporation but that in 2010 Jim converted it to an S Corporation. However, in accordance with applicable IRS rules, Bi Lo Foods will continue to incur taxes under C Corp rules for a period of 10 years after the conversion, or until November 30,2020. Under these rules, if real property or assets held by Bi Lo Foods Inc. are sold or transferred out of the corporation, the corporation incurs a tax consequence. After hearing considerable expert testimony about distributing corporate assets in a marital dissolution, the District Court directed Jim to \u201cproceed with a Divisive Reorganization pursuant to the IRS Rules to accomplish the division of assets as set forth herein in order to avoid an immediate tax consequence to the Bi-Lo Corporation or the parties.\u201d The court determined that a D Reorg would allow Bi Lo to transfer the Ranch and its appurtenances to Melinda with the least amount of taxes or cost. The District Court primarily based this conclusion on the testimony of Ben Yonce, Melinda\u2019s expert witness and a certified public accountant (CPA) with experience in distribution of assets pursuant to a D Reorg.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b65 Jim moved the District Court to amend the Decree, arguing that a D Reorg of Bi Lo Foods would not meet IRS guidelines and the tax consequences of a failed D Reorg could be devastating to the value of the marital assets. Additionally, he argued that the court\u2019s valuation of PCM was not supported by the evidence. The District Court denied his motion on the grounds that Jim provided \u201cno basis for altering or amending the [c]ourt\u2019s decision pursuant to Rule 59.\u201d The court noted the Jim was merely restating arguments presented at trial and that restated arguments were inadequate to meet the requirements of Rule 59(e). Jim appeals both the District Court\u2019s final decree and its order denying his motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b66 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in ordering Jim\u2019s Bi Lo Foods corporation to undergo a D Reorg in order to effect an equitable distribution of the marital assets?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in valuing and distributing the marital estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to ascertain whether they are clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>In re Estate of Hannum, </em>2012 MT 171, \u00b6 19, 366 Mont. 1, 285 P.3d 463 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b610 Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property unless there was an abuse of discretion. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Lundstrom, </em>2010 MT 261, \u00b6 11, 358 Mont. 318, 245 P.3d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err in ordering Jim\u2019s Bi Lo Foods corporation to undergo a D Reorg in order to effect an equitable distribution of the marital assets?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">\u00b612 Jim argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s distribution of the marital property was inequitable. He asserts that the court erred as a matter of law when it determined that a D Reorg could accomplish the transfer of the Ranch to Melinda without tax consequences to Jim and Bi Lo. Jim claims that his corporation does not meet the requirements of a D Reorg and that a failed attempt to reorganize under the applicable rules will result in significant IRS personal and corporate penalties for Jim and Bi Lo Foods Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">\u00b613 The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) defines various corporate reorganizations that include certain types of asset acquisitions or transfers. 26 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D) defines a divisive reorganization, or D Reorg, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor, or one or more of its shareholders ... is in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred; but only if, in pursuance of the plan, stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 354, 355, or 356.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">It is undisputed that 26 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 355 (\u00a7 355) applies to the case before us. Section 355 permits tax-free separations of one of more active businesses if specific statutory and judicial requirements are met, including, but not limited to, \u201ccontrol,\u201d \u201cactive trade or business,\u201d \u201ccorporate business purpose,\u201d \u201ccontinuity of shareholder interest,\u201d and \u201ccontinuity of business enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b614 As applied to the facts of this case, to initiate a D Reorg Jim would create a Bi Lo subsidiary, referred to as NewCo in this example. Bi Lo would transfer the Ranch to NewCo, and stock in NewCo would be issued to Bi Lo and then immediately transferred to Jim. At this stage, Jim would continue to be the sole shareholder in both entities, satisfying both the control and continuity of shareholder interest requirements. Once reorganization was complete, Jim would transfer all of the stock in NewCo to Melinda.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b615 Jim asserts that a D Reorg will fail because there is no (1) valid business purpose for the reorganization; (2) continuity of shareholder interest; and (3) continuity of business enterprise for both corporations. He maintains that he is being ordered to reorganize under the Dissolution Decree in order to transfer assets to Melinda and that this reason does not constitute a valid business purpose for reorganization,</p>\n<p id=\"Ad5\">\u00b616 Jim further argues that if he is required to transfer the stock of NewCo to Melinda, there will be no continuity of ownership interest. He cites multiple Tax Court cases for the proposition that the purpose of the continuity of business interest requirement is to allow a corporation to be divided or change its organization without tax consequences when the new organization continues to be owned and operated by the same shareholder. He maintains that because he will not retain ownership in NewCo, this statutory requirement will not be met. Lastly, he submits that the rules require NewCo to be \u201cengaged immediately... in the active conduct of a trade or business\u201d that it has been engaged in for the five years preceding the reorganization. Jim maintains that the Ranch has not been engaged in a business enterprise for 5 consecutive years. He therefore predicts that the IRS will reject the reorganization as a D Reorg and that he and Bi Lo will face crippling tax consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b617 Melinda asserts that because the grocery store and the ranch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>activities are separate and distinct, division of the assets into separate corporations is reasonable and justified and would satisfy the rule requiring a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d for reorganization. She also argues that distribution of the marital assets through a D Reorg does not run afoul of the \u201ccontrol of ownership\u201d rule because neither party intends to sell the assets and the new corporation stock will be transferred to Melinda pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1041.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She rejects Jim\u2019s \u201cactive business\u201d argument by noting that Jim has consistently reported \u201cranch activity\u201d on Bi Lo\u2019s tax return as an active trade or business. She submits that Jim\u2019s argument implies that ranch activity should be passive for purposes of disallowing the D Reorg, but active for purposes of deducting current losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b618  The disposition of this case rests , on whether there was sufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings and whether the court\u2019s conclusions based upon those findings is correct. The District Court was presented with substantial conflicting expert testimony concerning the appropriateness of a D Reorg of Bi Lo Foods. Jim\u2019s expert testified that a D Reorg of Bi Lo will fail while Melinda\u2019s expert opined that it would satisfy the applicable rules. \u201cIt is well established that it is exclusively within the province of the trier of fact, and not this Court, to weigh evidence, including conflicting evidence, and judge the credibility of the witnesses. We have repeatedly held that we will not second-guess a district court\u2019s determinations regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>Owen v. Skramovsky, </em>2013 MT 348, \u00b6 22, 372 Mont. 531, 313 P.3d 205, <em>citing St. James Healthcare v. Cole, </em>2008 MT 44, \u00b6 43, 341 Mont. 368, 178 P.3d 696. Here, the record supports the District Court\u2019s challenged findings and its conclusions based upon those findings. We therefore will not disturb the court\u2019s ruling requiring divisive reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b619 As for the District Court\u2019s denial of Jim\u2019s motion to amend the ruling, the court\u2019s obligation upon receipt of Jim\u2019s motion was to determine whether Jim satisfied the requirements of Rule 59 permitting an amendment. In <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>285 Mont. 355, 360, 948 P.2d 256, 259 (1997), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">While Rule 59 does not identify any specific grounds supporting a motion to alter or amend a judgment, commentators have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>identified four subject areas where parties have successfully pursued such a motion. These four areas include motions which are filed: 1) to correct manifest errors of law or fact upon which the judgment was based; 2) to raise newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence; 3) to prevent manifest injustice resulting from, among other things, serious misconduct of counsel; or 4) to bring to the court\u2019s attention an intervening change in controlling law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">We also stated that a motion to alter or amend is \u201cnot intended merely to relitigate old matters nor are such motions intended to allow the parties to present the case under new theories.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>285 Mont. at 360-61, 948 P.2d at 259. \u201cA motion to alter or amend should not present arguments which the court has already considered and rejected.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>285 Mont. at 361, 948 P.2d at 259. Jim argued in his motion that the judgment must be amended to correct manifest errors of law and fact. The District Court concluded that no manifest, i.e., \u201cobvious, apparent and glaring,\u201d errors existed and that the court had chosen to accept the evidence and testimony of Melinda and her witnesses over Jim\u2019s. The court noted that each of Jim\u2019s arguments presented in his motion to amend had been presented and rejected by the District Court. Consequently, the court concluded the Jim had not met the requirements of Rule 59. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b620 Having determined that the record supports the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions as they apply to the D Reorg of Bi Lo, we need not address other arguments related to that issue presented by Jim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in valuing and distributing the marital estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b622 As noted above, in order to equitably distribute the marital estate, the District Court established values for the property Jim and Melinda acquired during the marriage. To derive these values, the District Court reviewed valuation evidence from both parties, including a report prepared by a CPA hired by Melinda. This expert witness used a variety of evaluation methods and provided a range of values for PCM based upon various known and unknown factors. Some valuation methods utilized figures and values provided by the December 31,2012 PCM Balance Sheet. The CPA\u2019s values for PCM ranged from $601,000 to $761,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u00b623 The District Court adopted the lowest figure in the range and attributed a $600,000 value to Jim\u2019s business interests in PCM. The court further concluded as a separate valuation that the fixtures and equipment at PCM were worth $108,817. Lastly, the court valued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>PCM building and the land beneath at $1,100,000. Jim argues that the District Court overvalued the business interests in PCM by \u201cdouble-counting\u201d PCM\u2019s equipment and fixtures. He asserts that the range of values Melinda\u2019s expert suggested for PCM included fixtures and equipment; therefore, he maintains that fixtures/equipment should not have been a separate fine item. He relies on the cover letter in which the CPA explains that the range of values provided \u201cwould include the business in its entirety, including all tangible and intangible assets of Pattee Creek Market.\u201d Jim fails to point out, however, the next sentence in the report: \u201cThe estimated values do not include the land, building, or building improvements at the location where Pattee Creek Market operates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b624 A \u201cfixture\u201d is defined as \u201c[pjersonal property that is attached to land or a building and that is regarded as an irremovable part of the real property ....\u201d <em>Blacks\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>755 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). Based upon this definition and the CPA\u2019s express caveat that the valuations do not include the land and building, Jim\u2019s assertion is not persuasive. Additionally, PCM\u2019s December 2012 Balance Sheet indicates that PCM\u2019s total current assets (including, but not limited to, bank accounts, accounts receivable, and inventory) had a value of $733,235; the building with the land and building improvements was valued at $1,114,909; and the fixtures and equipment within the store were valued at $108,817. Because the CPA expressly stated in his report that the $600,000 value for PCM did not include the building in which PCM is located, we conclude the District Court did not err in determining that the $600,000 value did not include the value of the fixtures and equipment within PCM\u2019s bmlding.</p>\n<p id=\"AGH\">\u00b625  As discussed above, the District Court received conflicting evidence vis-a-vis the D Reorg and the valuation of PCM. As it is the province of the district court to weigh evidence and witness credibility, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s ruling if there is evidence in the record, as here, to support the decision. Therefore, we conclude the District Court neither erred nor abused its discretion in ruling as it did on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b626 Finally, we note that in its order denying Jim\u2019s motion to amend, the District Court stated \u201cfrom a practical perspective, an IRS Private Letter Ruling would now be appropriate and alternative proposals to mitigate tax consequences considered if there is an adverse ruling from the IRS.\u201d Moreover, during the hearing both Melinda\u2019s CPA and Jim\u2019s CPA indicated that a private ruling was \u201cadvisable\u201d and could \u201cgive you a lot of comfort going forward.\u201d However, there is nothing in the record to indicate whether Jim obtained, or attempted to obtain, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>private ruling from the IRS. If such an advisory ruling is obtained and is adverse to Jim, or if the IRS rejects the D Reorg, Jim could then explore other options, including moving to modify the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b627 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order requiring Jim to undertake a divisive reorganization of PCM. We further affirm the court\u2019s valuation of PCM.</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\"> 26 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1041 provides for transfers of property between spouses incident to divorce.
