We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Duncan and Glover.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u00b63 In 2008 a jury in a defamation case in Flathead County returned a verdict against John Stokes for approximately $4 million. Stokes appealed the judgment in the defamation case to this Court, and in February 2009 retained attorney Greg Duncan to advise him on how to maintain his appeal of the judgment while discharging the obligation in bankruptcy. Stokes contends that Duncan advised him that he could discharge the judgment in bankruptcy and maintain his appeal. In March 2009 Duncan filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on Stokes\u2019 behalf in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana. After a meeting of creditors in April 2009, Duncan moved to withdraw as Stokes\u2019 attorney in the bankruptcy because of disagreements with Stokes over who was responsible for Stokes\u2019 incomplete disclosure of assets. In June 2009 the Bankruptcy Court granted Duncan\u2019s motion to withdraw and Stokes proceeded with the bankruptcy proceeding. In September 2009 the Bankruptcy Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>granted the motion of the United States Bankruptcy Trustee, converting Stokes\u2019 proceeding from a Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 bankruptcy and appointing a Trustee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b64 On February 28,2012, while the bankruptcy was pending, Stokes filed the complaint in the present action in Montana District Court against Duncan and his paralegal Kathleen Glover. Stokes sought damages for legal malpractice, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint alleges that Duncan failed to advise Stokes that the defamation judgment would not be discharged by filing bankruptcy, and that he would lose control over the appeal of that case. The bankruptcy Trustee moved to intervene in this action as the real party in interest, claiming the malpractice action as an asset of the bankruptcy estate. In May 2012 the District Court granted the Trustee\u2019s motion to stay all proceedings in the malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b65 In the bankruptcy action, the Trustee proposed to sell the bankruptcy estate\u2019s interest in Stokes\u2019 state court action against Duncan and Glover. The Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the action at auction. Duncan outbid Stokes and in September 2012 purchased the bankruptcy estate\u2019s interest in the action for $12,000. The Trustee sold the bankruptcy estate\u2019s interest in the malpractice action to Duncan \u201cas is\u201d with no warranty of title. The Bankruptcy Court approved the sale to Duncan and no party challenged the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b66 In October 2012 Duncan and Glover petitioned the Bankruptcy Court for an order declaring that the malpractice claim was the property of the bankruptcy estate and that it had been sold to Duncan. Stokes\u2019 Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding was discharged in January 2013, and in February 2013 the Bankruptcy Court granted Duncan and Glovers\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their petition. The Bankruptcy Court reviewed the law governing the determination of when a cause of action becomes an asset of the bankruptcy estate, and considered Stokes\u2019 argument that the suit against Duncan and Glover did not accrue prior to bankruptcy because he was not damaged until his bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court examined Stokes\u2019 complaint in the malpractice action and determined that \u201c[m]uch of this alleged malpractice took place prior to the filing of [Stokes\u2019] Chapter 11 petition.\u201d The Court explained: \u201cA fair reading of the complaint in [the malpractice action] shows clearly that the malpractice in the form of advice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>preparation of Stokes\u2019 schedules occurred prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition, with further malpractice after the petition.\u201d Given the \u201cbroad scope\u201d of Federal bankruptcy law in 11 USC \u00a7 541, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that Stokes\u2019 claims against Duncan and Glover in State court were property of the bankruptcy estate that had been purchased by Duncan.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b67 Stokes appealed to the United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit. In September 2013 the Appellate Panel vacated the Bankruptcy Court judgment, holding that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine ownership of the malpractice action against Duncan and Glover because it had been sold and was no longer part of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b68 In October 2013 Duncan and Glover appeared in the State District Court malpractice action and moved to lift the stay and for summary judgment. In July 2014 the District Court lifted the stay and granted Duncan and Glover\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Stokes\u2019 claims against them were property of the bankruptcy estate and had been purchased by Duncan. Stokes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment using the same criteria as the district court under Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P. We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and the findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram v. Greenpoint Mort. Funding, </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b610 <em>Issue: Whether the cause of action against Duncan and Glover is now owned by Stokes or by Duncan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u00b611  Filing a bankruptcy petition creates an estate in bankruptcy consisting of all legal and equitable interests held by the debtor as of the commencement of the bankruptcy action. 11 USC \u00a7 541; <em>Cusano v. Klein, </em>264 F.3d 936, 945 (9th Cir. 2001). The bankruptcy estate includes any of the debtor\u2019s civil causes of action that \u201caccrued\u201d prior to the date of the petition. These pending claims belong to the estate and not the debtor. <em>Lucas v. Stevenson, </em>2013 MT 15, \u00b6 18, 368 Mont. 269, 294 P.3d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">\u00b612 While courts \u201clook to\u201d state law to determine when a cause of action accrues, bankruptcy accrual does not necessarily coincide with accrual of the claim for purposes of applying the statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>under state law. A claim can accrue for Federal bankruptcy purposes before the state statute of limitation has begun to run. <em>Cusano, </em>264 F.3d at 947; \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA (specifying the elements of claim accrual for purposes of the statute of limitations). Under Federal bankruptcy law, a debtor\u2019s legal claim can be an asset of the bankruptcy estate if it is \u201csufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past.\u201d <em>In re Brown, </em>363 B.R. 591, 607-08 (U.S. Bank. Ct., D. Mont. 2007). A claim is \u201csufficiently rooted\u201d if the \u201cwrongdoing and redressable harm occurred before or at the time of filing, even though other damage was alleged to have occurred postpetition.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>363 B.R. at 608-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b613 Stokes\u2019 complaint against Duncan and Glover alleges that Stokes was damaged by Duncan\u2019s erroneous advice concerning the effects of filing a petition in bankruptcy. While Stokes contends that his claims did not accrue because he was not damaged until later in his bankruptcy proceeding, \u201cit is not necessary to know immediately the type and extent\u201d of injury, and \u201c[a]ll that is needed is a specific and concrete risk of harm to the party\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>In re Swift, </em>129 F.3d 792, 795-96 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b614 Stokes argues on appeal that his legal injury or damage did not occur until his petition was converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 because of Duncan\u2019s negligence. But this is inconsistent with the allegations of his complaint. In part, the complaint alleged that Duncan negligently failed to advise Stokes \u201cthat <em>filing </em>for bankruptcy could <em>never be successful </em>in discharging the Defamation Judgment and that the bankruptcy petition could <em>never accomplish the results Stokes sought </em>by filing the bankruptcy.\u201d The complaint also alleged that Duncan either knew or should have known that, \u201cupon <em>filing of the bankruptcy petition, </em>the appeal of the Defamation Judgment would be within the control of the bankruptcy trustee and that Stokes would require the bankruptcy court\u2019s permission to continue pursuit of any appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b615 Although Stokes emphasizes on appeal the damage he allegedly sustained upon conversion to Chapter 7, Stokes acknowledges that \u2014 even under Chapter 11 \u2014 his state court appeal could not have advanced unless the Bankruptcy Court granted a motion to modify the stay. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 362. This demonstrates that Stokes lost the ability to control his own appeal at the moment the bankruptcy petition was filed. <em>In Re Alvarez, </em>224 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b616 As the court noted in <em>Brown, </em>a claim accrues under Montana law for purposes of determining whether it is a bankruptcy estate asset \u201cwhen an action can be brought[,]\u201d even if \u201climitations on such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>action had not yet begun to run.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>363 B.R. at 605-06. Stokes\u2019 malpractice complaint alleged damages for Duncan\u2019s negligent acts both pre- and post-filing, including the claim that \u201che incurred unnecessary fees in <em>filing for bankruptcy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Even if his post-petition damages continued to mount due to separate acts of negligence post-petition, Stokes alleged claims that are sufficient on their face to demonstrate that he was damaged and could have brought an action against Duncan at the time the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b617  We are assisted in this matter by the decision of the United States Bankruptcy Court determining that as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law Stokes\u2019 claims were part of the bankruptcy estate. While that decision was vacated on appeal, the appellate decision was not based upon the merits of the analysis, but upon the fact that the asset was no longer in the estate. Stokes\u2019 claims against Duncan and Glover accrued at or before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, were sufficiently rooted in the pre- bankruptcy past, and were therefore an asset of the estate in bankruptcy. The Trustee was authorized to sell the claims and did so. The claims do not belong to Stokes and the District Court properly granted summary judgment to Duncan and Glover.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b464-8\">JUSTICE COTTER, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u00b619 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Duncan and Glover. The question of when Stokes\u2019 claims against Duncan and Glover accrued requires resolution of factual issues and thus is not amenable to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">\u00b620 As the Corut notes in \u00b6 13 of its Opinion, Stokes contends that his claims did not accrue at or before the filing of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, because he was not damaged until later in his bankruptcy proceeding. Specifically, he alleges that he did not suffer damage until after the Bankruptcy Court Trustee converted his Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 proceeding. This occurred approximately 6 months after Duncan filed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on Stokes\u2019 behalf. Stokes maintains that because adverse legal results occurred well after the filing of the petition, his malpractice claim against Duncan is not an asset of the bankruptcy estate. Although Stokes attributes the involuntary conversion from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 to Duncan\u2019s negligence \u2014 a contention that Duncan denies \u2014 we need not reach the issue ofblame for the conversion at this juncture. The only question for resolution at this point is whether Stokes\u2019 claims against Duncan and Glover are owned by him or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>bankruptcy estate. The determination of ownership of these claims hinges upon the time at which Stokes\u2019 claims against Duncan and Glover accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b621 Relying on <em>In re Brown, </em>the Court concludes that Stokes\u2019 malpractice claim is \u201csufficiently rooted in the prebankruptcy past\u201d so as to belong to the bankruptcy estate. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 17. In <em>Brown, </em>citing <em>In re Alvarez, </em>224 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 2000), the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana observed that claims are \u201csufficiently rooted\u201d in the debtor\u2019s prebankruptcy past \u201cwhere the wrongdoing and redressable harm occurred before or at the time of filing\u201d of the petition. <em>Brown, </em>363 B. R. at 609. The Court in <em>Alvarez </em>upheld a District Court\u2019s determination that Alvarez\u2019s legal malpractice cause of action was the property of his bankruptcy estate because the crux of his claim was Alvarez\u2019s contention that his attorneys disregarded his instructions to file a Chapter 11 case and instead filed a liquidating bankruptcy case under Chapter 7. The <em>Alvarez </em>court concluded Alvarez\u2019s legal malpractice claim came into fruition or accrued at the precise moment the Chapter 7 petition was filed because his harm occurred at that point. <em>Alvarez, </em>224 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b622 In contrast to the <em>Alvarez </em>situation, Stokes contends that he suffered no immediate harm when Duncan filed his Chapter 11 petition, as he still had the opportunity to amend his petition and schedules at any time before the closing of the case. In the words of <em>Brown, </em>he had no \u201credressable harm\u201d at the time the Chapter 11 petition was filed. Stokes maintains that the damage to him did not occur until the conversion of his case from a Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, months after the initial petition was filed, at which point he lost complete control of his assets, his radio station was sold out from under him, and his appeal of the defamation judgment against him was dismissed by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b623 Stokes\u2019 argument that his harm did not accrue until the conversion to Chapter 7 occurred has arguable legal merit. As observed in a footnote by the Court of Appeals in <em>Alvarez, </em>\u201c[t]he legal consequences of... creating a Chapter 7 estate are quite different than those attendant to a Chapter 11 petition.... Chapter 7 establishes a ... radical solution to indebtedness, requiring the liquidation of the debtor\u2019s property ... . In a Chapter 11 case, the debtor-in-possession generally manages and administers his own bankruptcy estate, with the goal of reorganizing his affairs rather than liquidating them.\u201d (Internal citations omitted.) <em>Alvarez, </em>224 F.3d at 1277, FN 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u00b624 If Stokes maintained control over his property and affairs while the Chapter 11 petition was pending and the actionable harm did not occur until the conversion to Chapter 7, then Stokes\u2019 cause of action against Duncan and Glover would be deemed a post-petition cause of action. Post-petition causes of action are not part of the bankruptcy estate. <em>Brown, </em>363 B.R. at 608, citing <em>In re Witko, </em>374 F.3d 1040, 1042 (11th Cir. 2004). As stated in <em>Witko, </em>if at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed a petitioner has not yet suffered harm, his legal malpractice claim did not yet exist and thus it was not the property of the bankruptcy estate. <em>Witko, </em>374 F.3d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b625 In my judgment, the Court errs in disregarding Stokes\u2019 accrual argument and summarily concluding that Stokes\u2019 claims against Duncan and Glover accrued at or before the filing of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Because there are conflicting assertions regarding when Stokes\u2019 claims accrued, I would reverse and remand to the District Court for resolution of these factual disputes. I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s determination that summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"> The Trustee subsequently dismissed the appeal to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
