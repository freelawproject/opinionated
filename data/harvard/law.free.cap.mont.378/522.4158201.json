We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Kummerfeldt\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b64 On June 6, 2013, Valley County Sheriffs Deputy Matthew Remmich was patrolling near the marina in Fort Peck. After hearing the loud squealing of car tires, Deputy Remmich observed a yellow Chevrolet Corvette drive out of the parking lot. Deputy Remmich noted the vehicle was \u201cmoving quite quickly\u201d and \u201cdid not stop\u201d at the stop sign. Deputy Remmich followed the vehicle for approximately one mile before observing the vehicle cross over the center line into the oncoming lane and then swerve onto the edge of the road. At that point, Deputy Remmich activated his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop. Kummerfeldt was driving and the sole occupant in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">\u00b65 During the investigatory stop, Deputy Remmich noticed that Kummerfeldt\u2019s eyes were glassy and bloodshot. Deputy Remmich requested that Kummerfeldt take a preliminary breath test (PBT) at the scene. Deputy Remmich read Kummerfeldt the preliminary alcohol screening test advisory, which stated that the officer had a right to request that Kummerfeldt take a PBT and Kummerfeldt\u2019s license would be suspended if he refused. Kummerfeldt did not immediately answer, but instead discussed for almost 20 minutes whether he should take the test. During this discussion, Deputy Remmich requested that Kummerfeldt take the PBT approximately 27 times. Kummerfeldt asked Deputy Remmich whether he could avoid losing his license if he provided a breath sample, to which Deputy Remmich replied: \u201cIf you provide a sample of breath, you will not lose your license. If you refuse to provide a sample of breath to the PBT, for the PBT, you will lose your license for at least six months.\u201d Kummerfeldt submitted to the PBT, which reported a blood alcohol concentration of 0.232 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">\u00b66 Deputy Remmich arrested Kummerfeldt for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and transferred him to the Valley County Detention Center. At the center, Deputy Remmich advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Kummerfeldt he was going to request that Kummerfeldt take a breath test, and that he may later request that Kummerfeldt take a blood test. Deputy Remmich attempted to administer the breath test; however, because the center did not have two mouthpieces necessary to provide the requisite second breath sample for the Intoxilyzer 8000, Deputy Remmich could not properly complete the test, As a result, Deputy Remmich requested that Kummerfeldt take a blood test. Kummerfeldt refused. Kummerfeldt stated he did not want to get poked by needles, but told Deputy Remmich that he would take the blood test if Deputy Remmich would also take it. Deputy Remmich seized Kummerfeldt\u2019s license for refusing to take the blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b67 On July 8,2013, Kummerfeldt filed a petition to have his driver\u2019s license reinstated. The District Court conducted a hearing on October 21,2013. The court heard testimony from both Deputy Remmich and Kummerfeldt, and watched the video recording taken by Deputy Remmich\u2019s in-car camera. On June 5, 2014, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and its order denying Kummerfeldt\u2019s petition. The court found Deputy Remmich had reasonable grounds to stop Kummerfeldt\u2019s vehicle, that Kummerfeldt\u2019s refusal to submit to the blood test was not based on fear of needles that amounted to a disability, and concluded Kummerfeldt was properly arrested for DUI. Kummerfeldt appeals. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Ditton v. DOJ Motor Vehicle Div., </em>2014 MT 54, \u00b6 14, 374 Mont. 122, 319 P.3d 1268. A district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Owen v. Skramovsky, </em>2013 MT 348, \u00b6 17, 372 Mont. 531, 313 P.3d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Kummerfeldfs petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u00b610 Kummerfeldt argues the District Court erred by denying his petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. Pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403(1), MCA, a person whose driver\u2019s license has been seized \u201cmay file a petition to challenge the license suspension or revocation in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>court in the county where the arrest was made.\u201d In reviewing the suspension of a driver\u2019s license, the court is limited to the issues set forth in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 30. The suspension of a driver\u2019s license is presumed to be correct, and the \u201cpetitioner bears the burden of proving that the state\u2019s action was improper.\u201d <em>Muri v. State, </em>2004 MT 192, \u00b6 5, 322 Mont. 219, 95 P.3d 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b611 Kummerfeldt alleges three points of error in the District Court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA. First, Kummerfeldt contends the court erred by finding Deputy Remmich had reasonable grounds to stop his vehicle. The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d requirement found in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA, is the equivalent of the \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d standard necessary to make an investigative stop. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 30. \u201cA statutory violation alone is sufficient to establish particularized suspicion for an officer to make a traffic stop.\u201d <em>State v. Schulke, </em>2005 MT 77, \u00b6 16, 326 Mont. 390, 109 P.3d 744. Kummerfeldt reasons that Deputy Remmich\u2019s in-car video does not show that he failed to stop at the stop sign in violation of \u00a7 61-8-344, MCA. However, Deputy Remmich testified that, though it was difficult to tell from the in-car video, Kummerfeldt had failed to stop. The District Court found Deputy Remmich\u2019s testimony credible and entered findings in favor of his account of the event. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 14. Given the ambiguity in the video and Deputy Remmich\u2019s testimony, which the District Court found to be credible, we are unable to conclude the District Court clearly erred in finding Kummerfeldt violated \u00a7 61-8-344, MCA. Therefore, Deputy Remmich had reasonable grounds to effectuate the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b612 Kummerfeldt next contends the State should be estopped from suspending his driver\u2019s license because of the statement made by Deputy Remmich: \u201cIf you provide a sample of breath, you will not lose your license. If you refuse to provide a sample of breath to the PBT, for the PBT, you will lose your license for at least six months.\u201d Kummerfeldt draws from Deputy Remmich\u2019s statement an affirmative representation that if he provided a PBT sample, he would not lose his license even if he refused subsequent tests. Kummerfeldt cites this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Orman, </em>224 Mont. 332, 731 P.2d 893 (1986) to support his contention that, because Deputy Remmich affirmatively represented to Kummerfeldt that he would not lose his license so long as he provided a sample for the PBT, the suspension of his driver\u2019s license was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b613 We disagree with Kummerfeldt\u2019s characterization of Deputy Remmich\u2019s statement and thereby conclude that <em>Orman </em>is inapposite. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In <em>Orman, </em>the arresting officer unintentionally but affirmatively misrepresented to the defendant that his refusal to submit to a breath test carried a shorter license suspension than the statute actually imposed. <em>Orman, </em>224 Mont. at 335, 731 P.2d at 895. Consequently, we prohibited the State from suspending Orman\u2019s license for longer than he had been advised of when he refused the test. <em>Orman, </em>224 Mont. at 336, 731 P.2d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b614  Here, Deputy Remmich did not misrepresent the consequences of refusing to take a test. In making his statement, Deputy Remmich was clearly speaking about the PBT to the effect that, if Kummerfeldt provided a PBT sample, he would not lose his license on account of the PBT. Deputy Remmich did not affirmatively represent to Kummerfeldt that if he provided a PBT sample he would be immune from losing his license regardless of his refusal to take subsequent tests. Furthermore, any possible contextual confusion that may have arisen was eliminated when Deputy Remmich read Kummerfeldt the written advisory, which accurately advised him of the consequences of refusing the PBT. Accordingly, the District Court did not err by concluding the State was not estopped from suspending Kummerfeldt\u2019s driver\u2019s license because of Deputy Remmich\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b615 Lastly, relying on <em>Wessell v. State, </em>277 Mont. 234, 921 P.2d 264 (1996), Kummerfeldt contends his refusal to take a blood test should not constitute a \u201crefusal\u201d under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, because of his alleged aversion to needles. In <em>Wessell, </em>we concluded, under the facts of that case, that the defendant\u2019s disabling fear of needles constituted a psychological inability to perform the test, which equated to a physical disability, precluding his participation regardless of his willingness. <em>Wessell, </em>277 Mont. at 240, 921 P.2d at 267-68. On that basis, we held the district court erred by concluding that Wessell had refused the test under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA. Importantly, however, in <em>Wessell, </em>the prosecution stipulated to the defendant\u2019s disabling fear of needles. <em>Wessell, </em>277 Mont. at 240, 921 P.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b616  In this case, there was no stipulation to Kummerfeldt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>disabling fear of needles or resulting inability to perform the test. Indeed, the State contested Kummerfeldt\u2019s alleged fear of needles. Kummerfeldt testified he was \u201cscared\u201d of needles, but told Deputy Remmich on the night of the incident that he would take the blood test if Deputy Remmich also took the test. Kummerfeldt further admitted that he recently had an IV and \u201ccan handle [needles] if it\u2019s necessary.\u201d We conclude, on this record, which differs from <em>Wessell, </em>that Kummerfeldt did not establish that he suffered from a psychological fear of needles rendering him physically unable to perform the test. Therefore, we hold Kummerfeldt\u2019s refusal to submit to the blood test constituted a refusal within the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b617 The District Court did not err by denying Kummerfeldt\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\"> Kummerfeldt also contends the District Court erred by finding that \u201cKummerfeldt was unable to provide an appropriate sample for each of the two breath tests requested at the detention center.\u201d We agree that this finding of fact is clearly erroneous, as Kummerfeldt was able to provide a sample. However, we \u201cwill affirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>State v. Betterman, </em>2015 MT 39, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 182, 342 P.3d 971. Here, there was sufficient evidence to affirm the District Court despite this erroneous finding of fact. Thus, the court\u2019s error does not provide grounds for reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
