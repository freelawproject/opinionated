Serata is a disabled veteran. Himes is a retired attorney who owns and serves as senior minister at Big Sky Christian Center. Over a period of years, Serata became involved in Himes\u2019 ministry. Serata considered Himes a close friend and confidant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">\u00b64 Due to his disability, Serata has rarely maintained steady employment. He works odd jobs including electrical work, logging, and equipment operation. His income also includes social security disability and VA disability. When Serata met Himes, he had very little in savings and had no investments. Serata has little experience with investing and limited knowledge on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\u00b65 In late 2007, Serata learned that he was going to receive a distribution from his grandfather\u2019s trust, which he believed would total approximately $150,000. In December 2007, Serata contacted Himes and asked for advice about how to find a risk-free investment opportunity for his inheritance. Himes and Serata met in January of 2008 to discuss the matter. After initially suggesting an attorney and accountant to Serata, Himes asked if Serata was interested in investing in \u201cthe Lord\u2019s work.\u201d Himes began to explain many investment opportunities to Serata, all of which were intended to produce income to build churches and related facilities. Among the investment opportunities Himes discussed with Serata was a company called Duratherm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">\u00b66 Himes told Serata that Duratherm was a solar-panel production company which was close to starting production. According to Himes, Duratherm had a factory, the necessary equipment, and buyers set to purchase the solar panels. Himes stated that the last piece Duratherm needed to begin full-scale production was a glue machine, which would cost approximately $150,000. Serata was interested in the venture, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>he and Himes discussed the matter over the next three months. Himes assisted Serata in setting up a corporation sole<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for his inheritance, which they named \u201cImage of Truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b67 In late March 2008, Serata met with Himes and James \u201cJeb\u201d Bryant to further discuss Duratherm. Bryant was a friend of Himes and fellow pastor. At this meeting, Bryant presented a PowerPoint presentation explaining Duratherm\u2019s Mexico-based production capabilities. Himes and Bryant, who each held an interest in the company, offered Serata a six-percent interest in Duratherm, and they began referring to Serata as their partner. At the meeting, Serata verbally agreed to invest in Duratherm. There was no written agreement. The meeting concluded with prayer, hugs, and handshakes.</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">\u00b68 After the meeting with Bryant, Serata began requesting a written contract to memorialize his investment, and information about Duratherm\u2019s expected production capacity. In an e-mail dated May 28, 2008, Bryant wrote that Serata could conservatively expect to receive a 24 percent, or $36,000, per year rate of return on his investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b69 On June 6, 2008, Serata made a wire transfer of $150,000 to Harris Bank in Illinois, at the instruction of Himes and Bryant. The beneficiary on the wire transfer was listed as Monarch Beach Properties, which Serata understood was the parent or \u201cumbrella\u201d company of Duratherm. Shortly thereafter, Himes prepared a \u201cSubscription Agreement\u201d outlining Serata\u2019s interest in Duratherm. The document contained the heading: \u201cDURATHERM BUILDING SYSTEMS INC.\u201d The subscriber was listed as Serata\u2019s corporation sole, \u201cImage of Truth,\u201d and included the following description of Serata\u2019s interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">This Subscription and Agreement, shall constitute the guarantee of issuance of a share or shares in DBS. Each share controls POINT ZERO ZERO TWO (.002) percent of the company and all ore values. It also guarantees that the subscriber shall receive POINT ZERO ZERO TWO (.002) percent royalties of the mine\u2019s defined net profits. The Subscriber is also guaranteed THREE THOUSAND (3000) shares; therefore, should the company go public and or sell, the subscriber shall be paid SIX (6) percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the total stock trade of net sales price of any and all assets after any debt and taxes are paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On the last page of the Subscription Agreement, Serata\u2019s interest was listed as \u201cPOINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT (6%) [sic] ownership in DBS, LLC.\u201d Himes assured Serata that the Subscription Agreement was a temporary document, and Serata could back out at any time. Serata admitted that he did not read this document prior to signing it, but he trusted Himes as a man of God, and he understood that the document was not a binding contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b610 Serata traveled to Mexico in the summer of 2008, believing he would be assisting with Duratherm\u2019s operations. Serata first met Bryant in Texas where Serata helped find vehicles to travel to Mexico. While in Texas, they purchased a glue machine for seven or eight thousand dollars. Serata then traveled to Mexico City and eventually Puerto Escondido, Mexico, the reported location of Duratherm\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b611 When Serata arrived in Puerto Escondido, he discovered that there was no factory ready to produce solar panels. The property they visited was a working ranch, owned and operated by friends of Bryant, consisting of mainly agricultural buildings for produce production and storage. At trial, Serata testified that what had been described as a factory ready for production was in fact a \u201cshell of a structure,\u201d which he later discovered was not even owned by Duratherm. Still wanting to assist with the venture, however, Serata remained in Mexico for over three weeks, doing basic building maintenance. Throughout the trip, Bryant insisted that lawyers in Mexico were handling the paperwork for Duratherm, but Serata was never invited to meet with any of the Mexican lawyers regarding his investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b612 During the trip to Mexico and after his return to Montana, Serata was concerned about his investment in Duratherm and made many attempts to contact Himes and Bryant regarding the conditions of the Mexico property. In an e-mail dated August 17,2008, Serata requested a statement from Bryant outlining Duratherm\u2019s assets, the names of the other partners, their percentage of ownership and type of investment, the relationship between Duratherm and Monarch Beach Properties LLC, Monarch Beach Cloisters, and other related business matters. Bryant replied by outlining the general ownership of Duratherm, with 39% being owned by Monarch Beach,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and stating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201cWe do have [paperwork at the [l]awyers in Mexico and bringing on a new owner means an entirely new filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b613 On August22,2008, Serata e-mailed Himes explaining that he felt betrayed. Serata stated Himes led him to believe his investment would purchase a glue machine for Duratherm to begin production. Serata asked to be bought out of his investment in Duratherm. On September 16,2008, Himes replied to Serata\u2019s e-mail, stating, \u201cI never suggested that you invest your money in Duratherm.\u201d Himes insisted that Serata was aware that Duratherm was a \u201cstart-up venture,\u201d and that Serata was never offered a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b614 Serata reported the events to the Ravalli County Sheriffs office. Believing it was a securities-related case, the Sherriff s office referred the case to the Office of the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance of the State Auditor\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b615 Deputy Securities Commissioner, Lynne Egan, investigated Serata\u2019s case. Egan\u2019s investigation found that neither Duratherm Building Systems, Inc,, nor Monarch Beach was registered to be sold as securities in the state of Montana, the other 49 states, or with the Securities and Exchange Commission. She also found that Himes was not registered to offer or sell securities in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b616 Egan also investigated Serata\u2019s wire transfer of $150,000 to the account at Harris Bank held in the name of Monarch Beach Properties, LLC. The account\u2019s funds were used to pay four different credit card companies, various hotels, restaurants, and retail stores. Funds were also provided directly to James Bryant, his wife, and Bryant\u2019s mother. Egan found no evidence of any funds going to Duratherm, and no evidence of the account being in any way associated with Duratherm.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">\u00b617 Himes was charged by information in Ravalli County on September 27,2011, with six felonies: 1) theft, 2) failure to register as a securities salesperson, 3) failure to register a security, 4) fraudulent practices, 5) conspiracy to commit theft, and 6) conspiracy to commit fraudulent practices. The State filed an amended information on December 1, 2011, to include a second charge of failure to register as a securities salesperson, but that charge was later dismissed because the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u00b618 After a one-week jury trial in Ravalli County, Himes was found guilty of three of the six felonies: 1) failure to register as a securities salesperson, 2) failure to register a security, and 3) fraudulent practices. Himes was sentenced to three concurrent ten-year sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>with the Department of Corrections, with all but 90 days suspended, and subject to conditions. Himes was also ordered to pay court fees and $150,000 in restitution to Serata.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b619 Himes appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b620 \u201cThe standard of review of the sufficiency of evidence to sustain a conviction is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Yuhas, </em>2010 MT 223, \u00b6 7, 358 Mont. 27, 243 P.3d 409. We review a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict, not whether the evidence could have supported a different result. <em>State v. Field, </em>2005 MT 181, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 26, 116 P.3d 813 (citations omitted). A claim that the State presented insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction is reviewable even if such claim was not raised below. <em>State v. Granby, </em>283 Mont. 193, 198-99, 939 P.2d 1006, 1009 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b621 This Court generally does not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694. However, when a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental rights are invoked, we may choose to review a claim under the common law plain error doctrine where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">\u00b622 When a criminal sentence is not eligible for review by the Sentence Review Division, we review the sentence for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313. Our review for legality is confined to determining whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. This determination is a question of law and, as such, our review is de novo. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 10. A sentencing court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">\u00b623 We review de novo whether a district court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the applicable sentencing parameters, and whether the court adhered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2011 MT116, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 443, 254 P.3d 578. The appropriate measure of restitution is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact as to the amount of restitution, our standard of review is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b624 2. <em>Whether \u201csecurity\u201d was adequately defined for the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b625 Himes argues that the jury was not properly instructed on the definition of \u201csecurity.\u201d Specifically, he asserts that the terms \u201ccertificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement,\u201d as included in \u00a7 30-10-103(22) (2007), MCA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should have been more clearly defined by the Court, citing In <em>re Det. of Pouncy, </em>229 P.3d 678, 682 (Wash. 2010) (\u201cTrial courts must define technical words and expressions used injury instructions\u201d), and <em>Simon v. Fribourg, 650 F. </em>Supp. 319, 321 (D. Minn. 1986) (\u201cIn the instant case... there is little authority to suggest that a \u2018certificate of interest or participation in a profit-sharing agreement\u2019 is a term so commonly understood and an agreement so to appreciate in value.\u201d <em>Landreth, </em>471 U.S. at 686, 105 S. Ct. at 2302.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b635  In the present case, a reasonable juror could have found that Himes sold a security to Serata based on the evidence adduced at trial. The jury was not required to rely on one single definition of a \u201csecurity,\u201d as Himes contends. Without objection, the jury was properly instructed on the statutory definition of \u201csecurity.\u201d While the State may have focused on the evidence of a profit-sharing agreement during closing argument, adequate evidence was introduced from which the jury could find that Himes sold Serata stock in Duratherm. The Subscription Agreement that Himes provided Serata identified a \u201cguarantee of issuance\u201d of a \u201c(6%) ownership in DBS, LLC.\u201d The Subscription Agreement also referred to Serata\u2019s interest as \u201cshares\u201d and reflected that Serata may receive profits in the form of cash dividends. These are all common factors associated with stock, as articulated in <em>Landreth, </em>471 U.S. at 686, 105 S. Ct. at 2302. Based on this evidence, a reasonable juror could have concluded that Himes sold Serata a security.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b636 <em>3. Whether the mens rea rule set forth in \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA, requires </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>a mental state other than \u201cwillfully\u201d in order to sustain a conviction for a felony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b637 Himes argues that the legislature did not intend for the Montana Securities Act to be a strict liability offense as defined in \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA; therefore, the State was required to attach a mental state to each element of the offense under \u00a7 45-2-103, MCA. Himes asserts that that the definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d used by the District Court was inappropriate for the offenses charged. The jury instruction at issue defined \u201cwillfully\u201d as follows: \u201cA person acts \u2018willfully\u2019 if the person is aware of what the person is doing. It does not mean that the person intended to violate the law, injure another, or acquire any advantage.\u201d This definition is based on \u00a7 1-1-204(5), MCA, which states that \u201cwhen applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted, [willfully] means a purpose or willingness to commit the act or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate the law, to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d Himes argues that we should follow federal law in our definition of \u201cwillful,\u201d which requires the act to be done \u201cwith knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\u201d <em>Bryan v. U.S., </em>524 U.S. 184, 191-92, 118 S. Ct. 1939, 1945 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b638 The State counters that the District Court offered the correct definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d based on \u00a7 1-1-204(5), MCA, and the State was not required to prove that Himes had a malicious motive; the State only had to prove that Himes was aware of what he was doing. <em>See, e.g., Erickson v. Fisher, </em>170 Mont. 491, 494, 554 P.2d 1336, 1338 (1976) (holding that an act did not need a \u201cmalicious motive\u201d to be \u201cwillful\u201d). The State further notes that, had the legislature intended knowledge of the specific offense to be an element of the crime, it could have included such language in the code as it did in other sections of the Securities Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 30-10-306(1), MCA (\u201cAny person who ... willfully violates 30-10-302 <em>knowing the statement made to be false or misleading in any material </em>respect\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b639 Under Title 45, Montana\u2019s Criminal Code, a person must have a mental state of knowingly, negligently, or purposely as to each element of an offense to be found guilty of that offense. Section 45-2-103(1), MCA. The exception to this required mental state is when \u201cthe offense is punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 or the statute defining the offense clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the conduct described.\u201d Section 45-2-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b640 Titles 45 and 46 govern the construction and punishment of offenses defined outside those titles, \u201c[u]nless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires.\u201d Section 45-1-103(2), MCA. The Annotator\u2019s Note to \u00a7 45-1-103(2), MCA, states that \u201cwhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the definition of the offense outside the code clearly includes a particular mental state or other element, that definition controls.\u201d Montana Criminal Code of 1973 Annotated (1980 rev. ed.) \u00a7 45-1-103, MCA (Annotator\u2019s Note).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b641 Himes was charged with violating several provisions of the Securities Act. The Securities Act falls outside Titles 45 and 46. However, it provides for criminal sanctions when any person \u201cwillfully violates\u201d any provision of the Act. Section 30-10-306(1), MCA. Therefore, the Securities Act \u201cincludes a particular mental state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7D\">\u00b642  The District Court correctly instructed the jury on the appropriate mental state to prove violations of the Securities Act, Section 30-10-306(1), MCA, expressly provides criminal sanctions when any person \u201cwillfully violates\u201d any provision of the Securities Act. \u201cWillfully\u201d is defined at \u00a7 1-1-204(5), MCA, and \u201csuch definition is applicable to the same word or phrase wherever it occurs,\u201d \u00a7 1-2-107, MCA. The District Court correctly instructed the jury in accordance with the statutory definition of \u201cwillfully.\u201d We have long upheld jury instructions which are reiterations of statutory language. <em>See, e.g., Hudson, </em>\u00b6 21 (\u201cThe District Court\u2019s jury instruction mirrored the language of the statute and thus correctly set forth the law applicable to the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b643 <em>4. Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction on the mental state \u201cwillfully\u201d created a strict liability offense, and therefore the ten-year sentence for that offense violates due process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b644 Himes contends that the use of the mental state \u201cwillfully\u201d by the District Court rendered his crimes strict liability offenses by default. Himes argues that all crimes must have the mental states of purposely, knowingly, or negligently unless \u201cthe offense clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the conduct described,\u201d \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA. A strict, or absolute, liability offense is one which does not require proof of a mental state as an element of the offense. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>453 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 10th ed. 2014). Himes essentially argues that because the District Court did not instruct the jury on one of the mental states required by \u00a7 45-2-104, MCA, his crimes did not require proof of a mental state, and became strict liability offenses by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b645 Himes notes that a reasonable person must understand that his or her conduct is subject to regulation for it to qualify as a strict liability offense, and such regulation is generally for protection of the public welfare. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Balint, </em>258 U.S. 250, 42 S. Ct. 301 (1922) (sale of undocumented narcotics is a strict liability offense); <em>U.S. v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S. Ct. 1112 (1971) (ownership of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>unregistered hand grenade is a strict liability offense); <em>U.S. v. Int\u2019l Min. &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>402 U.S. 558, 91 S. Ct. 1697 (1971) (shipping unregistered sulfuric acid is a strict liability offense). Himes argues that a reasonable person would not think his conduct in this case was criminal, and it should not qualify as a strict liability offense, citing <em>U.S. v. Apollo Energies, </em>Inc., 611 F.3d 679, 687 (10th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[W]hen persons would not reasonably foresee the items\u2019 regulations \u2014 strict liability becomes constitutionally suspect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b646 The State argues that the District Court\u2019s use of the mental state \u201cwillfully\u201d did not render Himes\u2019 crimes strict liability offenses by default. The State contends that the jury was required to find that Himes had the requisite mental state of \u201cwillfully\u201d when he completed the offenses. Specifically, in order to convict Himes of the offenses charged, the State was required to prove that Himes was aware of his conduct \u2014 i.e., that Himes was aware he sold or offered to sell Serata an opportunity to invest in Duratherm. Therefore, the State contends that because Himes was neither charged with, nor convicted of, strict liability offenses, his challenge to the constitutionality of his sentence is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b647 As discussed above, the District Court used the proper mental state of \u201cwillfully,\u201d for criminal violations of the Securities Act under \u00a7 30-10-306(1), MCA. Therefore, Himes\u2019 crimes were neither charged nor tried as strict liability offenses. The jury was required to find that Himes was aware of his conduct, not that Himes\u2019 intended to violate the law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-1-204(5), MCA (\u201c[W]hen applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted, [willfully] means a purpose or willingness to commit the act or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to violate the law, to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b648  We hold that sufficient evidence existed to support the finding by the jury that Himes had the requisite mental state to violate the Securities Act. <em>Field, </em>\u00b6 15. Himes offered Serata a \u201csix-percent interest\u201d in Duratherm, and Himes provided Serata with the Subscription Agreement which described Serata\u2019s \u201cshares.\u201d Himes was neither charged with, nor convicted of, strict liability offenses; therefore, the ten-year sentence that was imposed did not violate his constitutional right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b649 5. <em>Whether the District Court erred by giving a jury instruction for fraudulent practices that incorporated an Administrative Rule of Montana, thereby creating a different evidentiary standard for the crime of fraudulent practices than that required by statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u00b650 Regarding the definition of \u201cfraudulent practices,\u201d the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>instructed: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person, in connection with the offer or sale of any security, directly or indirectly, in, into, or from this state, to <em>willfully omit to provide a prospectus.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>(Emphasis added.) Himes contends that the requirement for a prospectus is based on an Administrative Rule, Admin. R. M. 6.10.401(l)(j), and not the statute defining fraudulent practices under the Securities Act, \u00a7 30-10-301(l)(b), MCA, which makes it unlawful for a person to \u201cmake any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact,\u201d but the statute does not include the requirement of a written prospectus. Himes argues that the jury was allowed to erroneously rely upon the standards set by Admin. R. M. 6.10.401(l)(j), rather than statute, \u00a7 30-10-301(l)(b), MCA, and his conviction for fraudulent practices should therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b651 The State concedes that neither the Administrative Rule nor the statute required a prospectus at the time that Himes allegedly committed the fraudulent practices with which he was charged. The State contends, however, that the inclusion of a prospectus requirement within the definition of fraudulent practices was harmless error because other sufficient evidence was presented to convict Himes for fraudulent practices pursuant to \u00a7 3Q-10-301(l)(b), MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b652  The District Court erred by instructing the jury that the willful omission of a prospectus constituted fraudulent practices when neither the Administrative Rule nor the statute included such a requirement at the time that Himes is alleged to have committed the crime of fraudulent practices. Although the State characterizes this error as harmless, there is no dispute that Himes did not provide Serata with a prospectus and we cannot simply assume that the lack of a prospectus did not form the basis for the jury\u2019s conviction on this charge, We therefore reverse Himes\u2019 conviction for fraudulent practices pursuant to \u00a7 30-10-301(l)(b), MCA, and remand to the District Court for a new trial on this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b653 <em>6. Whether Himes was properly sentenced in the following respects:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIc\">\u00b654 <em>a. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in giving Himes a suspended sentence rather than his requested deferred sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b655 Himes argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it imposed a suspended sentence rather than a deferred sentence. Himes notes that he was found guilty of \u201cnonviolent, technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>offenses,\u201d and he has no criminal history. Himes further notes a letter submitted by the jury foreperson that stated, \u201cWe the jury found that there was no criminal intent on the part of Mr. Himes in any of the issues before the Court in the trial.\u201d Himes contends that the District Court dismissed this letter as hearsay. Himes argues that hearsay is admissible at a sentencing hearing, and therefore the District Court abused its discretion by failing to consider the letter of the jury foreperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b656 The State argues that the District Court was well within its discretion when it sentenced Himes. The State contends the District Court considered the jury foreperson\u2019s letter during the sentencing hearing. The State further contends that of particular concern to the District Court during sentencing was the position of trust Himes held in Serata\u2019s life, and that the violation of that trust caused Serata to lose $150,000 and see no return on his investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b657  We hold that the District Court acted within its discretion when it imposed a suspended sentence, rather than a deferred sentence as Himes requested. The District Court properly considered the policies of punishment and public protection under \u00a7 46-18-101(2), MCA, when it determined that \u201csome punishment [of Himes] is necessary.\u201d In regards to the jury foreperson\u2019s letter, the District Court was within its discretion to consider the letter to whatever extent it deemed appropriate at sentencing. Himes\u2019 sentence was statutorily authorized under the Securities Act, which allows for a person convicted of a criminal violation of the Securities Act to \u201cbe fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\u201d Section 30-10-306(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b658 <em>b. Whether the District Court\u2019s determination of the restitution award was clearly erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b659 Restitution for victims is one of the principles on which our sentencing and correctional policies are based. Section 46-18-101(2), MCA. Restitution payments are authorized for \u201cany victim who has sustained pecuniary loss, including a person suffering an economic loss\u201d as a result of a defendant\u2019s conduct under \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA. \u201cAs a pecuniary loss is defined to be those damages that would be recoverable in a civil action, \u00a7 46-18-243(1)(a), MCA, there must be a preponderance of the evidence supporting the restitution award.\u201d <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 16, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841. The Securities Act specifically allows for civil damages for the sale of unregistered securities \u201cto recover the consideration paid for the security.\u201d Section 30-10-307(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b660 Himes argues that the $150,000 restitution award was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>erroneous because he was acquitted of the theft-related charges, and the State did not prove that there was a causal connection between his \u201ccrimes\u201d and Serata\u2019s loss. <em>See State v. Brownback, </em>2010 MT 96, \u00b6 23, 356 Mont. 190, 232 P.3d 385 (\u201c[Restitution turns on the familiar elements of loss and causation.\u201d). Himes asserts that his failure-to-register convictions had no impact on Serata\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b661 The State argues that the restitution award is authorized by both the criminal procedure code under \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA, and the Securities Act under \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA. The State also notes that the District Court stated that Serata\u2019s property loss stemmed directly from Himes\u2019 conduct, which further warranted the restitution award. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b662 The District Court stated at sentencing, \u201cBut for your conduct, Mr. Himes, there wouldn\u2019t be any need for the restitution.\u201d Himes introduced Serata to Duratherm and Bryant. Serata invested $150,000 in Duratherm, the exact amount Himes told him that Duratherm needed to purchase a glue machine to begin full-scale production. This amount reflects the consideration Serata paid for his interest in Duratherm and is appropriately recoverable under \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA. But for Himes\u2019 selling of the unregistered security, Serata would not have suffered this loss. The District Court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous and the order of restitution was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b663 The District Court properly instructed the jury on the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d and applied the correct mental state regarding criminal violations of the Securities Act. The State provided sufficient evidence to support Himes\u2019 convictions for failure to register as a securities salesperson and failure to register a security. Therefore, we affirm his convictions as to those charges. The District Court erred by instructing the jury on the definition of \u201cfraudulent practices\u201d with a definition which was not in effect at the time of Himes\u2019 actions. We therefore reverse Himes\u2019 conviction for fraudulent practices and remand for a new trial on that charge. We affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence and restitution award to Serata.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u00b664 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-9\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> A corporation sole is \u201ca corporation having or acting through only a single <em>member.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>418 (Bryan A.
