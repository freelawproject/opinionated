Patton (Gail) appeals the order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, adopting the Standing Master\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final decree of dissolution of her marriage to Billy P.

Bill was married twice before his marriage to Gail, and he has adult children. This was Gail\u2019s first marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b64 Before their marriage, Gail lived and worked in Canada. She worked for the Canada motor vehicle registration division, taught music, sold real estate, and worked in the restaurant and food industry. At the time that she married Bill, Gail was 43, renting an apartment, driving a used vehicle, and she had approximately $30,000 in a personal bank account. Bill entered the marriage with a great deal of real and personal property, including the marital home, office property, a veterinary practice, and ranching operations including livestock and range land.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b65 During their marriage, Gail and Bill enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Bill practiced as a veterinarian, and he placed $1,500 per month in the parties\u2019 shared account for Gail to spend on household expenses. Gail was primarily a homemaker, but she also worked part-time as a music teacher, and caterer, earning between $4,000 and $6,000 per year. Gail kept the parties\u2019 marital home immaculate, cooked meals, assisted with garden and yard work, and oversaw home maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b66 Gail\u2019s health declined considerably during her marriage to Bill. Gail\u2019s left shoulder is atrophied and has limited mobility. She continually suffers from abdominal, knee, and neck pain, and she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b67 Gail and Bill separated in February 2011. Gail filed for dissolution of marriage on March 4, 2011. After their separation, Gail\u2019s standard of living diminished considerably. She moved into subsidized housing and had limited assets. Working as a substitute teacher and paraprofessional for the Great Falls Public Schools, Gail earned approximately $1,300 between January 2012 and May 2012. Gail also earned $2,245 teaching at the Deep Creek School that spring; however, the Deep Creek School closed sifter the spring semester of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u00b68 On July 13,2012, the District Court filed an order granting Gail temporary maintenance and attorney\u2019s fees. The order acknowledged that Gail had no income-producing assets, she had sold her piano for $7,000 to cover her attorney\u2019s fees, and she had taken out a loan of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>approximately $10,000 from her parents for attorney\u2019s fees and living expenses. Based on Bill and Gail\u2019s monthly income and expenses, Bill was ordered to pay Gail $1,000 per month for six months, backdated to June 1, 2012, and $5,000 of Gail\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b69 On May 1,2012, the District Court appointed a standing master to oversee the case. The Standing Master conducted a two-day bench trial on August 30-31,2012. The Standing Master entered her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final decree of dissolution (Report) with the District Court on March 7, 2013. The Standing Master\u2019s Report apportioned to Gail the following personal property worth a total of $36,300 of the marital estate: art in Gail\u2019s possession, Villeroy &amp; Boch china, a brass and tile occasional table, one leather couch, chair, and ottoman, miscellaneous stainless steel cookware, a Pontiac G-6, Gail\u2019s interest in the Canadian pension system (the value of which is unknown), Gail\u2019s bank account, and the proceeds of a personal injury claim of $16,000. Bill was ordered to pay Gail $46,566<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as her equitable share of the marital real property, livestock, and Bill\u2019s retirement accounts. Bill was also ordered to pay $5,000 of Gail\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, which at the time of the hearing totaled over $30,000, and he was ordered to pay $11,430.18 worth of Gail\u2019s outstanding medical debt \u201cin lieu of maintenance.\u201d In calculating her award, the Report noted that \u201cGail has not been restricted by any physician from working full time because of her physical limitations and PTSD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b610 The Standing Master valued the entire marital estate at $1,078,005.70, and the liabilities of the estate totaled $55,632.34. According to the Standing Master\u2019s Report, Gail\u2019s share of the marital estate, including all assets apportioned to her and liabilities to be paid by Bill, totaled $99,296.18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Standing Master apportioned the remainder of the estate to Bill, including the marital home and other real estate, vehicles, bank accounts, livestock, the contract for sale of his veterinary clinic, and art, totaling approximately $995,140 worth of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u00b611 Bill filed objections to the Report on March 21, 2013. Gail filed objections to the Report on March 22,2013. Gail\u2019s objections included the valuation of the marital home, livestock, and Bill\u2019s income, the calculations of her monthly expenses, and the Report\u2019s calculation of her existing medical debt and attorney\u2019s fees. Also on March 22,2013, Gail filed a motion for additional evidence pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59 (Rule 59 Motion), setting forth an additional claim for maintenance due to the deterioration of her knee since the August 2012 trial and her inability to pay existing medical bills and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b612 On or about May 8,2013, Gail was diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma and was in immediate need of surgery. On May 23, 2013, Gail filed a motion to amend the findings or reopen the case to take additional evidence (Motion to Amend), in which she again requested the District Court reopen the case and consider the evidence of her breast cancer diagnosis in its division of the marital estate and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b613 The District Court held a hearing on September 17, 2013, to address both parties\u2019 objections to the Standing Master\u2019s Report, Gail\u2019s Rule 59 Motion, and her Motion to Amend. However, the District Court declined to rule on Gail\u2019s Rule 59 Motion or her Motion to Amend. The District Court held that it was not appropriate to take additional evidence about events occurring since the filing of the Report on March 7,2013, stating: \u201c[T]he Court finds that [taking additional evidence] is beyond the scope of judicial review as it relates to the Court\u2019s appropriate role in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b614 On October 7,2013, the District Court filed an order adopting the Standing Master\u2019s Report with only minor adjustments made to Bill\u2019s income sources and Gail\u2019s medical bills.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gail was awarded $97,054.19 of the marital estate after the adjustments in the District Court\u2019s order. The District Court ruled that Gail\u2019s Rule 59 Motion and Motion to Amend were \u201cto be left to the discretion of the Standing Master who will resume jurisdiction of this case upon the filing of this Order.\u201d On October 25, 2013, Bill filed a Notice of Entry of Judgment with the District Court and served it on Gail.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b615 On November 26, 2013, Gail filed two separate motions with the District Court. First, Gail moved that the Standing Master rule on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Rule 59 Motion and her Motion to Amend, citing the District Court\u2019s October 7, 2013 order which stated that the Standing Master would \u201cresume jurisdiction\u201d of the matter. Second, Gail moved to modify or amend the judgment to provide for maintenance pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA (Motion for Maintenance), which also referenced her previous Rule 59 Motion and her Motion to Amend. The motion cited her increased need for maintenance due to her breast cancer and her inability to work and support herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b616 Before the District Court ruled on either of her November 26,2013 motions, Gail filed a notice of appeal to this Court on November 27, 2013. Gail appeals the inaction by both the Standing Master and the District Court on her post-trial motions, and she appeals the order of the District Court adopting the Standing Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b617 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decisions de novo to determine whether it applied the correct standard of review to a master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>In re the Parenting of G.J.A., </em>2014 MT 215, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 212, 331 P.3d 835. In a case tried before a standing master, \u201cwe apply the same standard of review to an adopted master\u2019s report that we do to any other district court order.\u201d <em>Maloney v. Home &amp; Inv. Ctr., Inc,, </em>2000 MT 34, \u00b6 28, 298 Mont. 213, 994 P.2d 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property and maintenance awards to determine whether the findings of fact upon which the division is based are clearly erroneous. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>2008 MT 25, \u00b6 9, 341 Mont. 227, 177 P.3d 474. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 9. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b619 Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property and award of maintenance unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 9. In a dissolution proceeding, the test for an abuse of discretion is whether the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in a substantial injustice. <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b620 \u201cThe standard of review for discretionary trial court rulings is abuse of discretion. This standard may be applied to rulings on posttrial motions.\u201d <em>In re Johnson, </em>2011 MT 255, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 236, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>262 P.3d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Proceedings Before a Standing Master</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b621 The Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, created a standing master position in 2010 to assist with matters of family law, child abuse and neglect, and guardianship and conservatorship cases. Charter Or. Establishing Dist. Standing Master, <em>In re the Est. of a Dist. Standing Master for All Dep\u2019t of This Dist. Ct. </em>1, 4(Mont. 8th Jud. Dist. June 25, 2010) (Charter Order). The standing master is appointed in such cases at the discretion of the district court to aid in the timely resolution of these cases. Charter Order at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b622 District cotuts are authorized to appoint standing masters pursuant to Rule 53 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure and \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-124 to 126, MCA. A standing master must be appointed by an order of reference from the district cotut. M. R. Civ. P. 53(b); \u00a7 3-5-124(1), MCA. The district court has broad authority to specify or limit the standing master\u2019s duties. M. R. Civ.

M. R. Civ. P. 53(c)(2), (e)(1); \u00a7 3-5-126(1), MCA. The master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be set forth in a report to the district court. M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(1); \u00a7 3-5-126(1), MCA. \u201cThe Master\u2019s report shall not be effective as an order of the referring court unless and until the court accepts, adopts, or approves the report as an order of the court.\u201d Charter Order at 10; <em>see also </em>M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2); \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">\u00b624 A party may object to a standing master\u2019s report within ten days after being served with notice of the filing of the report, and the district court must then hold a hearing on the objections. M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2), \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA. A district court reviews the standing master\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>In re the Parenting </em>of G.J.A., \u00b6 19. A district court, \u201cmay adopt the findings and conclusions or order and may modify, reject in whole or in part, receive farther evidence, or recommit the findings and conclusions or order with instructions.\u201d Section 3-5-126(2), MCA; <em>see also </em>M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2) (\u201cAfter [a] hearing, the court may adopt the report, modify it, reject it in whole or in part, receive further evidence, or recommit it with instructions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00b625 \u201cA district court may receive additional evidence and any findings made on the basis of that evidence will be reviewed by this Court for clear error.\u201d <em>In re the Parenting of G.J.A., </em>\u00b6 19. \u201cAlthough the court has discretion to take supplemental evidence, an aggrieved party has no vested right to present supplemental evidence upon judicial review of a judgment of the District Standing Master.\u201d Charter Order at 11 (citing \u00a7 3-5-126(1), MCA). A district court \u201cmay elect to take supplemental evidence when warranted in the interests of justice\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA. Charter Order at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b626 \u201c[I]f the Master\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct, then the additional standard of review for property division, child custody, child support, maintenance, and attorney fee determinations under Title 40, Chapter 4, MCA, is an abuse of discretion.\u201d Charter Order at 13-14 (citing <em>Albrecht v. Albrecht, </em>2002 MT 227, \u00b6 7,311 Mont. 412, 56 P.3d 339; <em>In re Marriage of Stufft, </em>286 Mont. 239, 243-44, 950 P.2d 1373, 1376 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b627 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by not ruling on Gail\u2019s post-trial motions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b628 Gail contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to rule on her Rule 59 Motion or her Motion to Amend. Gail\u2019s motions below cited the court\u2019s authority to grant a new trial, and alter or amend a judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 59, and a district court\u2019s authority to take additional evidence after the filing of a master\u2019s report. Gail noted that M. R. Civ. P. 53(e) provides: \u201c[T]he court may adopt the report, modify it, reject it in whole or in part, receive further evidence, or recommit it with instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b629 Gail argued below and on appeal that her situation is similar to that of <em>In re Marriage of Kink, </em>226 Mont. 313, 735 P.2d 311 (1987). In <em>Kink, </em>the district court held a trial to determine the division of marital property in a dissolution action, after which it entered findings of fact. Both parties filed motions to amend the findings. After a hearing on the motions, the district court issued an order requesting both parties to appear for the purpose of testifying on their intentions to handle a marital asset which the court determined to be a joint venture. <em>In re Marriage of Kink, </em>226 Mont. at 314-15, 735 P.2d at 312-313. No entry of judgment had been filed in the dissolution at the time of the order requesting additional evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Kink, </em>226 Mont. at 316, 735 P.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b630 On appeal in <em>Kink, </em>we held that the district court\u2019s order requesting additional testimony on the joint venture was effectively a grant of a new trial on the court\u2019s own initiative, pursuant to M. R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>P. 59(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>In re Marriage of Kink, </em>226 Mont. at 316, 735 P.2d at 313. We concluded there was no final judgment in the dissolution action and held that the district court had broad authority to reopen a case and take additional evidence, stating: \u201cIt is well settled that the ruling on a motion to reopen a case for taking further testimony is within the sound discretion of the district court, which will only be reversed on appeal for manifest abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Kink, </em>226 Mont. at 316, 735 P.2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b631 Comparing her situation to <em>Kink, </em>Gail argued to the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">[W]e believe that Gail has met the independent standard for granting of a new trial under Rule 59 and/or the standard for taking additional evidence before a judgment is final, as set forth in <em>[In re the Marriage of Kink]. </em>There has been no final judgment in this case, and, therefore, <em>[Kink] </em>stands for the proposition that the Court has the ability to amend or modify findings and to take additional evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b632 Bill argues on appeal that Gail\u2019s Rule 59 Motion and her Motion to Amend were both \u201cdeemed denied\u201d under M. R. Civ. P. 59(f) because the District Court did not rule on either motion within 60 days. Bill argues that the Rule 59 Motion was an attempt to relitigate issues because Gail presented evidence of knee problems at the trial in August of 2012. Bill also argues that Gail\u2019s Motion to Amend was not timely because it was filed on May 23,2013, outside the ten-day time period in which Gail could object to the standing master\u2019s Report under \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b633 In declining to consider Gail\u2019s motions, the District Court held that taking additional evidence was \u201cbeyond the scope of judicial review as it relates to the Court\u2019s appropriate role in this matter.\u201d This was incorrect. Both M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2) and \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA, specifically provide that after a hearing on the objections to the standing master\u2019s report, the District Court may receive further evidence. Alternatively, the District Court may recommit the standing master\u2019s findings and conclusions or order with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b634 At the September 17,2013 hearing on the parties\u2019 objections, the District Court asserted that a party must move for a district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>resume primary administration of a case after the filing of a standing master\u2019s report. However, when the Standing Master filed her Report, this effectively terminated her administration of the case and transferred it back to the District Court by operation of statute. Upon filing of the report, a standing master is divested of authority to further rule on the matter, unless the District Court chooses to \u201crecommit it with instructions,\u201d after reviewing the report. M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2); \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b635  Under the plain language of both M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2) and \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA, the District Court should have either ruled on Gail\u2019s motions or, before adopting the Report, recommitted the case to the Standing Master with instructions to consider and rule on the motions. Instead, the District Court issued an order and judgment in which it affirmed the Standing Master\u2019s Report with only minor modifications. Within the body of the District Court\u2019s order, it stated that Gail\u2019s motions \u201care to be left to the discretion of the Standing Master who will resume jurisdiction of this case upon the filing of this Order.\u201d If this statement was intended to be a recommital of the case to the Standing Master pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2) and \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA, it appears the Standing Master did not understand it as such because she took no further action on Gail\u2019s motions after the District Court issued its order,</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b636 On November 26, 2013, Gail made further efforts to get the Standing Master and the District Court to address her health concerns by filing both a request for the Standing Master to rule on her motions based on the language in the District Court\u2019s order and her Motion for Maintenance pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. However, because Bill filed a notice of entry of judgment on October 25, 2013, Gail also filed her notice of appeal on November 27, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b637 Gail\u2019s Motion for Maintenance renewed her previous motions made pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 53 and 59, and cited \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, which allows a party to move for a modification of maintenance within two years of a final decree of dissolution \u201cupon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u201d Section 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA. Gail\u2019s Motion for Maintenance again cited her inability to work and support herself due to her breast cancer and deteriorating health.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b638 If a notice of appeal is filed before the disposition of a Rule 59 Motion, \u201ca premature notice of appeal will be treated as filed on the date the district court decides the motion to alter or amend judgment or the motion is deemed denied.\u201d <em>Estate of Earl M.

However, \u201c[t]he district court is not deprived of jurisdiction to enter its order on any such motion by the premature filing of a notice of appeal.\u201d M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(iv)(E). Therefore, the District Court had the authority to rule on Gail\u2019s Motion for Maintenance for 60 days after it was filed on November 26, 2013, despite her filing of a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b639  We have previously held that in certain circumstances, when a court does not exercise its discretion in a matter, this itself constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>State v.

As discussed above, the District Court should have either ruled on Gail\u2019s motions or recommitted them to the Standing Master for ruling. The District Court abused its discretion by declining to rule on Gail\u2019s post-trial motions, including her Motion for Maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b640 <em>2.

The Charter Order outlines the procedure for objecting to a standing master\u2019s report pursuant to \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA. The objections must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">(1) be written;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">(2) be timely-filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">(3) specifically identify the subject finding of fact or conclusion of law asserted to be in error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">(4) for each such assertion of error, <em>specifically state with particularity </em>the asserted factual or legal basis or reason for the assertion with citation to relevant legal authority and, as applicable or necessary, precise citation to the pertinent section of the hearing record or transcript.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Charter Order at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">\u00b645 Gail\u2019s objections to the Standing Master\u2019s Report did not cite to the transcript of the trial held August 30-31, 2012, and she failed to make specific citations to the trial transcript at the hearing on September 17, 2013. The Charter Order states that \u201can objecting party\u2019s failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements] for objections to the Master\u2019s report may, in the discretion of the court, subject the party\u2019s objections to adverse summary ruling.\u201d Charter Order at 9.

Whether the Standing Master\u2019s Report contains errors of law.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvU\">\u00b646 Section 40-4-202, MCA, governs the distribution of a marital estate and vests a district court with broad discretion to apportion the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>marital estate in a manner equitable to each party under the circumstances. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>2008 MT 25, \u00b6 9, 34 Mont. 227, 177 P.3d 474. A marital estate includes all the \u201cproperty and assets belonging to either or both [spouses], however and whenever acquired and whether the title to the property and assets is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d Section 40-4-202(1), MCA. In making an equitable distribution of the marital estate, \u201cthe court shall consider the duration of the marriage and prior marriage of either party, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties.\u201d Section 40-4-202(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b647 If a marital estate includes property that is pre-acquired, gifted, or inherited by one or both spouses, \u201cthe court must additionally consider the contributions of the other spouse to the marriage including the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker; the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property; and whether or not the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance.\u201d <em>In re Funk, </em>2012 MT 14, \u00b6 34, 363 Mont. 352, 270 P.3d 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b648 The Report recognized that Gail made significant nonmonetary contributions to the marriage as a homemaker. In considering the factors under \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, however, the Report stated that \u201cthe significance of Gail\u2019s contributions was necessarily lessened by Bill\u2019s retirement,\u201d thereby distinguishing Gail and Bill\u2019s marriage from In <em>re Funk </em>and <em>In Re Marriage of Tummarello, </em>2012 MT 18, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28, as those cases pertain to the nonmonetary contributions of a homemaker to a marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b649  The Standing Master erred in her assertion that Gail\u2019s and Bill\u2019s respective stages of life \u2018lessened Gail\u2019s contribution\u201d to the marital estate. Nothing in <em>Funk </em>or <em>Tummarello </em>supports the premise that one party\u2019s stage of life \u201cnecessarily lessen[s]\u201d the other party\u2019s contributions to the marital estate. Gail made significant contributions to the maintenance of Bill\u2019s premarital property as a homemaker, and her contributions to the property continued after Bill\u2019s retirement. The Standing Master erred in weighing the factors of \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, in regards to Gail\u2019s nonmonetary contributions to the marriage as a homemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b650  The Standing Master further erred by denying Gail maintenance payments after specifically finding that she qualified for maintenance. \u201cGenerally, maintenance is not favored. Maintenance is appropriate when a spouse has insufficient assets to cover living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>expenses and reasonably cannot earn a sufficient amount to maintain an appropriate standard of living.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, 2009 </em>MT 187, \u00b6 10, 351 Mont. 71, 209 P.3d 249 (citations omitted). Although property can be awarded in lieu of maintenance under \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, \u201cThe term \u2018sufficient property has been interpreted to mean income-producing property rather than income-consuming property.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Tow, </em>229 Mont. 483, 486, 748 P.2d 440, 441 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"A2e\">\u00b651 \u201cThe maintenance order must be in amounts and for periods of time that the court considers just.\u201d Section 40-4-203(2), MCA. In awarding maintenance, the court must consider the partys financial resources, the time it takes for the party requesting maintenance to find appropriate employment, the standard of living established during the marriage, the duration of the marriage, the age, health, and emotional condition of the party seeking maintenance, and the ability of the paying party to meet their own needs while paying maintenance. Section 40-4-203(2)(a) to (f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b652 The Standing Master found many of the factors in \u00a7 40-4-203(2), MCA, weighed in favor of maintenance payments to Gail. The Report states that Gail \u201chas found it difficult to obtain full time employment,\u201d and \u201cGail has essentially no property and currently lacks the ability to meet her needs independently.\u201d While the couple was \u201ccomfortable during the marriage,\u201d the Standing Master noted that \u201cGail\u2019s standard of living has diminished dramatically since the parties\u2019separation. She is now living in subsidized housing.\u201d Gail\u2019s post-separation monthly expenses were found to be $805 per month, a figure based on her rent while living in subsidized housing. In contrast, Bill\u2019s monthly expenses were listed as $1,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b653 Our statutes and case law do not support the Standing Master\u2019s conclusion that Bill\u2019s payment of a portion of Gail\u2019s debt was appropriate in lieu of maintenance payments. Gail was unable to meet her needs independently, especially given the standard of living established during her marriage. Section 40-4-203(2), MCA. The finding that Gail\u2019s monthly expenses were $805 was based on her rent while living in subsidized housing, not the standard of living established during the marriage. Furthermore, a payment of debt is not \u201cincome-producing property\u2019 which would help Gail meet her own needs in the future. <em>In re Marriage of Tow, </em>229 Mont. at 486, 748 P.2d at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b654 We remand these matters to the District Court for correction of these errors of law. The Standing Master erred in her consideration of Gail\u2019s contribution to the marriage as a homemaker, and the denial of maintenance payments to Gail was erroneous when she was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>awarded a payment of a small portion of her debt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">c. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by adopting the Standing Master\u2019s division of the marital estate and order that Bill pay a portion of Gail\u2019s debt in lieu of maintenance.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b655 The Standing Master considered Gail\u2019s health and ability to work to support herself when she divided the marital estate and ordered payment of a portion of Gail\u2019s debt in lieu of maintenance pursuant to the factors outlined in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA and \u00a7 40-4-203(2), MCA. As the division of the marital estate currently stands, Gail received only $82,866<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from an estate valued at $1,078,005.70 after a 14-year marriage to which she made significant contributions as a homemaker. The determination that Gail would not receive maintenance was premised largely on Gail\u2019s ability to work and support herself, which Gail contends in her post-trial motions has been adversely affected by her breast cancer diagnosis and other health issues. The consideration of Gail\u2019s post-trial motions and the corrections of the errors of law noted above will significantly impact the division of the marital estate and the award of maintenance to Gail; therefore, we decline to review the District Court\u2019s adoption of the Standing Master\u2019s Report for an abuse of discretion at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b656 3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by adopting the Standing Master\u2019s Report which excluded evidence of Bill\u2019s alleged abuse of Gail when determining maintenance payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b657 If a district court finds no clearly erroneous findings of fact, and the conclusions of law are correct, it must review a standing master\u2019s determination of maintenance payments for an abuse of discretion. Charter Order at 13-14. We review a district court\u2019s division of property and award of maintenance for an abuse of discretion absent clearly erroneous findings. <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 9. In a dissolution proceeding, the test for an abuse of discretion is whether the district court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in a substantial injustice. <em>Jackson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">\u00b658 \u201cThe maintenance order must be in amounts and for periods of time that the court considers just, <em>without regard to marital misconduct.\u201d </em>Section 40-4-203(2), MCA (emphasis added). However, \u201ca distinction exists between awarding a larger portion of the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>estate in order to penalize marital misconduct, and, on the other hand, considering the medical and financial consequences of marital abuse in the allocation of the marital estate.\u201d <em>In re Fenzau, </em>2002 MT 197, \u00b6 26, 311 Mont. 163, 54 P.3d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b659  Gail argues that the Standing Master should have allowed her to testify to Bill\u2019s alleged role in causing her physical and emotional limitations, citing <em>Fenzau, </em>\u00b6 26. Gail asserts that this was admissible evidence of her \u201cphysical and emotional condition,\u201d a factor that must be considered when determining maintenance payments under \u00a7 40-4-203(2)(e), MCA. Bill argues that any evidence of his alleged abuse was properly excluded, also citing <em>Fenzau, </em>\u00b6 26. Gail concedes that she was allowed to testify as to her physical and emotional limitations and challenges. Because maintenance orders must be determined \u201cwithout regard to marital misconduct\u201d under \u00a7 40-4-203(2), MCA, and Gail was permitted to testify about her current conditions, we conclude the Standing Master did not abuse her discretion by excluding the evidence of Bill\u2019s alleged role in causing Gail\u2019s limitations and challenges. The District Court in turn did not abuse its discretion by adopting the Report which excluded the evidence of Bill\u2019s alleged abuse.'</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b660 The District Court erred by failing either to rule on Gail\u2019s motions, including her Motion for Maintenance, or otherwise to recommit the matter to the Standing Master with instructions to rule on these motions. The District Court erred by adopting the Report to the extent the Standing Master\u2019s conclusions of law failed to properly consider Gail\u2019s contributions to the marriage as a homemaker and her qualification for maintenance payments. The District Court was within its discretion to adopt the Report\u2019s exclusion of evidence of Bill\u2019s alleged abuse of Gail because the Standing Master properly considered the medical and financial consequences of the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b661 Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> The Standing Master\u2019s Report lists Gail\u2019s share of the property as 10% of the Antelope Lane Property and the Cascade Office Property ($28,530), 5% of the livestock value ($7,100), and 10% of the Waddell and Reed accounts ($12,566), which totals $48,196.
