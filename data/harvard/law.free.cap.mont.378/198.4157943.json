We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b62 B.O.T. presents the following issue for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\n<em>Whether there was substantial evidence to conclude that B.O.T., because of a mental disorder, was unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health or safety.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u00b63 On December 24,2013, the State filed a petition for commitment alleging that on the night of December 23, 2013, B.O.T. was taken by ambulance to the emergency room of Community Medical Center in Missoula. B.O.T. had apparently been lying on the ground at a Missoula bus station. The District Court later observed that the night was cold, and that it was \u201csleeting and raining and extraordinarily miserable.\u201d B.O.T. was admitted to Community Medical Center overnight for observation and treatment. Further diagnosis revealed that B.O.T. suffered from several chronic health conditions: diabetes, hypertension, and hyperkalemia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\u00b64 The petition further alleged that hospital staff reported B.O.T. was very uncooperative and pulled out his IV in order to get some candy. After the IV was put back in place, B.O.T. broke it into two pieces. Due to B.O.T.\u2019s irrational behavior and his refusal to take medications as directed, B.O.T. was referred for a mental health evaluation to be conducted by J. David Washburn, a licensed clinical social worker. Mr. Washburn found B.O.T. difficult to evaluate because B.O.T.\u2019s thinking was extremely disorganized, his mumbled speech was difficult to understand, and B.O.T. did not provide much useful information. Mr. Washburn deduced that B.O.T. was a client at Winds of Change Mental Health Center, and upon further inquiry, Washburn learned that B.O.T.\u2019s condition had been deteriorating because of B.O.T.\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the administration of medication by staff at that facility. In addition, Mr. Washburn learned that B.O.T. was given a food stamp card to purchase food, but was either unwilling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>or unable follow through with getting a PIN to activate the card. B.O.T. was also reportedly \u201chaving delusions about receiving large sums of money deposited into his account from his sister in Louisiana ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b65 On December 26, 2013, the District Court held an initial appearance on the State\u2019s petition and advised B.O.T. of his rights pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-115, MCA. B.O.T. was appointed counsel, professional persons were appointed to examine B.O.T., and a case manager from Western Montana Mental Health Center was appointed as friend to protect B.O.T.\u2019s interests. A commitment hearing was scheduled for December 27, 2013. Pending the hearing, the District Court ordered that B.O.T. be detained at Montana State Hospital (MSH) pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-124, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b66 During the commitment hearing on December 27,2013, the State presented the testimony of Thomas Hodgetts, a licensed clinical social worker and certified mental health professional with Western Montana Mental Health Center. Hodgetts had evaluated B.O.T. around noon the day of the hearing. Prior to the evaluation and commitment hearing, Hodgetts reviewed the evaluation conducted by Washburn, the records of MSH, and consulted with Rosie Jennings, a treatment provider at Winds of Change. Hodgetts explained that B.O.T. had been residing at several group homes operated by Winds of Change, but was no longer able to do so because of inappropriate sexual behavior and refusal to take medication. He was not able to stay at the Poverello Center for the same reasons. Additionally, Hodgetts related that B.O.T. had some misdemeanor charges involving inappropriate sexual behavior, which resulted in a three-week stay in the Missoula Detention Center. Hodgetts indicated B.O.T. was released about ten days prior to the State\u2019s filing of the petition, and had been residing at area motels. However, B.O.T. had been evicted from the Colonial Motel and feared he would be arrested for nonpayment of room charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b67 Hodgetts surmised that Winds of Change was the designated protective payee for B.O.T.\u2019s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) funds. Finally, Hodgetts described that, based upon available information, B.O.T. \u201cabsolutely did not want to create a PIN number in order to access his [food stamp] card. He was noncompliant with his case manager\u2019s suggestions on how to do that. He would not cooperate with the case manager in obtaining a PIN number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b68 Hodgetts concluded that B.O.T. was \u201cunable \u2014 not allowed to go to the Poverello Center, which puts him at risk of homelessness in the middle of winter. That certainly would be harmful.\u201d Further, Hodgetts noted B.O.T. was not able to access his food stamp card. Hodgetts explained that \u201ceven though B.O.T. may have the [financial] resource, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>he does not seem able to utilize the resource that\u2019s available to get food. So he does not have access to safe shelter and safe food at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b69 Hodgetts also testified that, based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty, B.O.T. suffers from schizoaffective disorder and it was Hodgetts\u2019s opinion, based upon the foregoing information, that B.O.T. is unable to meet basic needs of food and shelter. Hodgetts opined that the least restrictive environment for treatment of B.O.T. was MSH. Finally, because B.O.T. had been uncooperative in receiving his injectable antipsychotic medication, Hodgetts believed an involuntary medication order was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b610 B.O.T. testified that his plan, if he were permitted to leave the hearing, was to go to the bus station, go to the Winds of Change \u201ccompound\u201d to get \u201cthe balance of $700 due me,\u201d and then go to WalMart to buy some tape to finish boxing up his things. After boxing up his things, he would travel \u201cwestward, to El Monte, California,\u201d where his brother has a medical practice \u201cthat is in need of a research associate.\u201d When counsel inquired about what he would do for food, B.O.T. explained that he would get his last month\u2019s check from Winds of Change, go charge his debit card, and \u201cgo to the Savmor food store and buy a pastrami sandwich.\u201d He would then buy his bus ticket for El Monte and leave at \u201c11 o\u2019clock tonight.\u201d If he did not have enough money for a bus ticket he anticipated he would go back to the Missoula Detention Center. B.O.T. also clarified that his diagnosis is schizo type and not schizoaffective or schizophrenic, and that he takes 1.1 milligrams of Risperdal for his mental disorder and metformin for his diabetes. Although B.O.T. was able to articulate coherent answers to some questions with reasonable specificity, his answers overall can only be characterized as disjointed and disorganized.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b611 The District Court made the following observation at the conclusion of the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">Well, this is a tough case because there\u2019s a lot of people that are odd out there, and we can\u2019t lock them all in Warm Springs. There\u2019s a lot of people that have trouble with day-to-day living, and we can\u2019t lock them all up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">On the other hand, [B.O.T.\u2019s] thinking is plainly disorganized. By his own admission, he\u2019s got some kind of schizo-related disease. And it\u2019s pretty apparent that he was at risk on at least the night of the 23rd because he ended up at the emergency room for some kind of medical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">And it does appear that he\u2019s got an issue with housing. I\u2019m not even sure that the Colonial, based on his testimony, is available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>to him. His plan to go to Cahfomia is all hinged on getting money from ... Winds of Change, I guess which ... I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s possible, although I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">And I think he is a danger to himself in his current condition; not because he\u2019s going to do self-harm, as the witness said, but because he\u2019s going to either engage in some kind of conduct that gets him back in jail or in the hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b612 In its written order, the District Court concluded that \u201c[B.O.T.] was unable to provide the Court with a clear plan to care for his basic needs.\u201d B.O.T. \u201cadmitted to having a serious mental illness\u201d and is \u201cunable to demonstrate how he would care for himself to protect himself from harm if released from inpatient treatment.\u201d The District Cotut ordered B.O.T. committed to MSH for 90 days and that medication could be involuntarily administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s order of commitment to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence or if, after review of the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>L.K.-S., </em>\u00b6 14. When determining whether substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>In re Mental Health of T.J.F., </em>2011 MT 28, \u00b6 17, 359 Mont. 213, 248 P.3d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b614 <em>Whether there was substantial evidence to conclude that B.O.T., because of a mental disorder, was unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health or safety.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\u00b615 At the trial on a petition for commitment, the court must first determine whether the respondent suffers from a mental disorder, defined as \u201cany organic, mental, or emotional impairment that has substantial adverse effects on an individual\u2019s cognitive or volitional ftmctions.\u201d Section 53-21-102(9)(a), MCA. Upon finding that a person suffers from a mental disorder, the court must then determine whether the respondent requires commitment by considering several criteria set forth in \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, including \u201cwhether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d All physical facts and evidence must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and all other matters must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. Mental disorders must be proven to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. If the court is satisfied that any one of the criteria listed in \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, is met, then commitment may be ordered. Section 53-21-127(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b616 The District Court found, and the parties do not dispute, that B.O.T. suffers from a mental disorder as defined in \u00a7 53-21-102(9)(a), MCA. Although the District Court did not specifically state which provision of \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, it was relying upon, the District Court concluded that \u201c[biased on his mental state and recent behaviors, Respondent is unable to meet his basic needs, which puts Respondent at risk of imminent self harm.\u201d We construe this as a determination made pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a), MCA, and accordingly review whether substantial evidence supports the finding that B.O.T., \u201cbecause of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for [his] own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b617 The professional person may testify as to the ultimate issue of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment, but this testimony is insufficient if there is no evidence that the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to take care of the respondent\u2019s own basic needs. Section 53-21-126(4)(a), MCA. We again observe, however, that it is \u201cnot necessary to present evidence of overt acts to prove that respondent suffers from a mental disorder that renders him substantially unable to provide for his basic needs.\u201d <em>In re R.F., </em>2013 MT 59, \u00b6 26, 369 Mont. 236, 296 P.3d 1189 <em>(citingIn re G.P., </em>246 Mont. 195, 198, 806 P.2d 3, 6 (1990)). Evidence of overt acts or omissions is only necessary where the commitment is based upon the imminent threat of self-inflicted injury or injury to others. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA; <em>R.F., </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b618 The State\u2019s only witness was its professional person, Thomas Hodgetts. Hodgetts testified that it was his opinion that B.O.T. could not meet his basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter as a result of B.O.T.\u2019s serious mental disorder. Hodgetts based his opinion upon information obtained in records, from consultation with other treatment providers, and from consultation with B.O.T, himself. No objection was made to Hodgetts\u2019s testimony regarding the information he relied upon in making his conclusion. The evidence established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>B.O.T. had a history of serious mental illness requiring injectable antipsychotic medication, that he was homeless, and that he was unable to obtain food because he refused to activate his food stamp card. B.O.T.\u2019s own testimony established that he had a serious mental disorder, that he had no housing or shelter, and that he had no immediate ability to obtain food \u2014 relying instead upon an inactivated food stamp card and a wire of money from a sister in Louisiana. As the District Court observed, B.O.T.\u2019s thinking was \u201cplainly disorganized\u201d and B.O.T.\u2019s inability to care for his own basic needs \u201cputs [B.O.T.] at risk of imminent self harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b619 B.O.T. argues that because a person may temporarily be between housing placements does not mean a person cannot take care of his basic needs. B.O.T. also argues that no evidence was submitted that B.O.T. was malnourished or hungry and that evidence was presented by B.O.T. that he was compliant in taking his medication. Finally, B.O.T. argues that a significant portion of the State\u2019s evidence was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b620 The question here is whether there was substantial evidence admitted without objection at the commitment hearing which supported the court\u2019s findings. <em>T.J.F., </em>\u00b6 17. The evidence presented without objection showed that B.O.T. had recently presented to the emergency room because of a lapse in care of his chrome medical conditions, as well as uncertainty regarding his living conditions and his disorganized thought. B.O.T. had no immediate ability to obtain food and no cognizable plan for housing or shelter. B.O.T.\u2019s serious mental disorder requires administration through injection of antipsychotic medication. B.O.T. also suffers from diabetes which requires medication, and he had elevated potassium levels upon admission to the emergency room. B.O.T.\u2019s own testimony confirmed many of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b621 The Court\u2019s role is not to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to enable the lower court to reach a different conclusion, but simply to determine whether the conclusion that it did reach is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Schmidt v. Cook, </em>2005 MT 53, \u00b6 31, 326 Mont. 202, 108 P.3d 511. Based upon our review of the record, there is substantial evidence demonstrating that B.O.T. was unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. The findings made by the District Court were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b622 Finally, we address B.O.T.\u2019s contention that a significant amount of the State\u2019s evidence relied upon inadmissible hearsay. B.O.T. did not object to the State\u2019s evidence, nor does B.O.T. request that we invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the doctrine of plain error in order to review the alleged error. While we held <em>in In re Mental Health of J.D.L., </em>2008 MT 445, \u00b6 9, 348 Mont. 1, 199 P.3d 805, that the Court will exercise plain error review in an involuntary commitment proceeding to consider unpreserved error \u201cbecause [the respondent\u2019s] substantial right \u2014 liberty\u2014is at stake and our failure to review the District Court\u2019s alleged error would compromise the judicial process,\u201d ordinarily, we still require the assertion of plain error to be raised and argued on appeal. B.O.T. has not asserted plain error review or developed an argument that the alleged error violated a substantial right. We therefore reject B.O.T.\u2019s claims that hearsay evidence was improperly admitted, which were raised for the first time on appeal and without an assertion or argument that plain error review is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b623  In conclusion, we note the District Court\u2019s apt observation \u201cthat this is a tough case because ... [t]here\u2019s a lot of people that have trouble with day-to-day living, and we can\u2019t lock all of them up.\u201d We emphasize that neither having a mental disorder nor being homeless or hungry are reasons in themselves to involuntarily commit a person. However, the finding that a mental disorder results in a person being homeless or hungry is sufficient to satisfy the criteria of \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a), MCA, and invoke the provisions of \u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA, authorizing involuntary commitment. We observe that in many instances these are difficult findings for the trial court to make, and we are therefore vigilant regarding our standard of review and the province of the trial court to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses. We thus conclude that the judgment and order of the District Court finding that B.O.T. suffered from a mental disorder which prevented B.O.T. from taking care of his own basic needs is supported by substantial evidence and the findings of the District Court are not clearly erroneous. The judgment and order involuntarily committing B.O.T. is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-12\"> Hyperkalemia refers to abnormally high potassium concentration in the blood, <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>795 (28th ed. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
