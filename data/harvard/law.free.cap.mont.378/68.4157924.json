We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether Heppner\u2019s speedy-trial rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u00b63 On April 29, 2012, Heppner was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). A complaint was filed April 30,2012, in the Lewis and Clark Justice Court, charging Heppner with DUI, a misdemeanor, and concealing or tampering with evidence, a felony \u2014 the tampering charge arose from Heppner\u2019s refusal to comply with a search warrant for a blood sample. Heppner made his initial appearance in Justice Court the same day. The Justice Court ordered Heppner to the 24/7 Sobriety Program, which required Heppner to take twice-daily alcohol breath tests or wear a SCRAM (Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring) bracelet as a condition of his release from jail pending trial. Heppner elected to wear the SCRAM bracelet rather than appear twice daily for alcohol breath tests. Heppner was required to pay the cost of monitoring, eight dollars per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">\u00b64 On May 15,2012, the State filed an information in District Court charging Heppner with DUI and tampering with evidence. On May 23, 2012, Heppner pled not guilty to the charges, and trial was set for August 27,2012. On August 1,2012, Heppner moved to vacate the trial date and set a change-of-plea hearing. The change-of-plea hearing was set for August 15, 2012, but was continued twice \u2014 once on Heppner\u2019s motion, and a second time by stipulation of the parties. On August 30, 2012, District Judge Dorothy McCarter held in <em>State v. Green </em>that refusing to comply with a search warrant for a blood sample is not concealing or tampering with evidence. Order on Motion for a New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Trial, <em>State v. Green </em>(First Jud. Dist. Ct. Aug. 30, 2012) (ADC-2011-339). In light of Judge McCarter\u2019s order, on September 26, 2012, the State moved to dismiss Heppner\u2019s felony tampering with evidence charge and to \u201cremand\u201d the case to the Helena Municipal Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court granted the motion and Heppner\u2019s case was transferred to the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b65 On October 1,2012, the Municipal Court arraigned Heppner, and he again pled not guilty to the DUI. Trial was set for March 7, 2013. On November 14,2012, Heppner filed a motion to dismiss because the misdemeanor charge had not been brought to trial within six months of arraignment as required by the misdemeanor speedy-trial statute, \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. Heppner\u2019s motion mentioned the right to a speedy trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, but offered no meaningful analysis of those provisions. The Municipal Court denied Heppner\u2019s motion. The court held that Heppner had given up his right to a jury trial in the District Court when he moved to vacate the District Court trial for a change of plea. The Municipal Court held that when the matter was transferred to Municipal Court, Heppner \u201cavailed himself of the new opportunity [to request] a trial by jury\u201d in the Municipal Court, and concluded that \u201cproviding rights in a new Court setting is just cause for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b66 On February 13,2013, Heppner obtained new counsel and filed a motion to continue the trial date. The motion was granted and the trial date was rescheduled for May 9, 2013. On March 20, 2013, Heppner moved for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss, this time arguing under both the statute and under the constitutional speedy-trial provisions. The Municipal Court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b67 On May 6, 2013, Heppner moved to vacate the trial date and set a change-of-plea hearing. The change-of-plea hearing was set for May 9,2013. Heppner pled guilty to DUI (second), and reserved his right to appeal the denial of his speedy-trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b68 Heppner appealed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of his speedy-trial claim to the District Court. The District Court denied Heppner\u2019s appeal. Heppner now appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy-trial rights to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b69 On appeal from a municipal court, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court. Sections 3-5-303,3-6-110, MCA. In its appellate capacity, the district court is confined to review of the record and questions of law. Section 3-6-110, MCA. When reviewing the decision of the district court in such an appeal, we review the case as if the appeal had originally been filed in this Court, applying the appropriate standard of review. <em>City of Helena v. Broadwater, </em>2014 MT 185, \u00b6 8, 375 Mont. 450, 329 P.3d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b610 Whether the constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated is a question of law, and we review a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of law is correct. <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>2014 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 375 Mont. 374, 328 P.3d 1132. The trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings are reviewed to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b611 <em>Whether </em>Heppner1s <em>speedy-trial rights were violated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b612 A criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to a speedy trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. Distinct from that constitutional right, a criminal defendant also has a statutory right to be brought to trial on a misdemeanor charge within six months of arraignment. <em>State v. Luke, </em>2014 MT 22, \u00b6 12, 373 Mont. 398, 321 P.3d 70; \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">After the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Section 46-13-401(2), MCA. The statute\u2019s protections are not available to a defendant when the trial was postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion, or the State showed good cause for delaying the trial. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 13. In such cases, only the constitutional protection applies, and the appropriate analysis is the test set forth in <em>Ariegwe. State v. Hodge, </em>2014 MT 308, \u00b6 14, 377 Mont. 123, 339 P.3d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">\u00b613 Heppner invokes both his statutory and his constitutional rights to a speedy trial. We note at the outset that analysis of the misdemeanor statutory speedy-trial right is conducted separately from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>a constitutional speedy-trial analysis and is an entirely different analysis. The parties\u2019 briefs confuse the two, applying standards from one to analysis of the other. To clarify, the constitutional analysis set forth in <em>Ariegwe </em>has no application in a statutory speedy-trial claim. While a defendant may pursue claims under both the statute and <em>Ariegwe, </em>the analyses of each should be conducted separately. Therefore, we first analyze Heppner\u2019s statutory speedy-tried claim and then analyze his constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Statutory Speedy-Trial Bight</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b614 The Municipal Court denied Heppner\u2019s initial speedy-trial claim on the grounds that Heppner waived his rights when he moved to vacate the tried date in the District Court and requested a change-of-plea hearing. The Municipal Court held that when Heppner\u2019s DUI charge was transferred to Municipal Court, Heppner was provided rights in a new court setting \u2014 the right to a tried \u2014 that he had ostensibly given up in the District Court by moving to vacate his District Court trial for a change of plea. The Municipal Court concluded that the reinstatement of Heppner\u2019s right to a trial in the new court setting constituted just cause for delay. The Municipal Court\u2019s conclusion that Heppner could not avail himself of the speedy-trial right under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, was correct; its reasoning, however, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b615  The mere filing of a motion to vacate a trial date and set a change-of-plea hearing does not waive a defendant\u2019s right to a trial. A defendant does not waive the right to trial until he pleads guilty, and the court accepts the guilty plea. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-12-210(l)(e), MCA (before accepting a guilty plea, the court must inform defendant there will be no trial if the court accepts a guilty plea). Thus, the Municipal Court erred when it determined there was good cause to extend the misdemeanor trial date beyond the six-month deadline because Heppner\u2019s right to a trial was reinstated when the DUI charge was moved to the Municipal Court and Heppner was rearraigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b616 Nevertheless, the Municipal Court was correct that Heppner\u2019s District Court motion to vacate his trial date for a change of plea made the misdemeanor speedy-trial statute inapplicable. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, provides that misdemeanor speedy-trial protections are only available to a \u201cdefendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion.\u201d Heppner was arraigned on May 23,2012, and trial was set for August 27, 2012, well within the six month time period. Prior to dismissal of the felony charge and transfer of the DUI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to Municipal Court, Heppner moved to vacate the initial trial date for a change of plea. He then moved, first individually and then jointly with the State, to continue the change-of-plea hearing. Heppner\u2019s trial, therefore, was postponed upon his own motion, which removed him from the statute\u2019s protections. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 13. Because the statute\u2019s protections were not available to Heppner after he moved to vacate the trial date, the constitutional speedy-trial right remained his only protection. <em>Hodge, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Constitutional Speedy-Trial Right</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b617 Heppner argues that he is entitled to dismissal for violation of his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Article <em>U, </em>Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Constitutional speedy-trial claims are analyzed under the four-factor balancing test set forth in <em>Ariegwe. </em>The Municipal Court, however, never considered the constitutional speedy-trial claim Heppner raised in his renewed motion to dismiss for violation of the right to a speedy trial. The court made no findings of fact, nor did it consider any of the factors in the constitutional speedy-trial rights balancing test set forth in <em>Ariegwe. </em>The Municipal Court summarily denied Heppner\u2019s motion without conducting any analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b618  The State argues that a constitutional analysis is never applicable to a misdemeanor charge because the statute provides stricter protections. This Court has indeed held that the constitutional analysis generally is not applicable to a misdemeanor because the misdemeanor speedy-trial statute is \u201cmore strict\u201d them the constitutional provisions. <em>See State v. Case, </em>2013 MT 192, \u00b6 6, 371 Mont. 58, 305 P.3d 812 (quoting <em>State v. Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. 358, 362, 691 P.2d 1348, 1350 (1984)). By its own terms, however, the statute provides no protection where the defendant has moved for a continuance or the prosecution has shown good cause. Were we to follow the State\u2019s argument, the statute would cause a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial to evaporate as soon as he moved for a continuance or the State showed good cause to extend the trial beyond the six-month deadline. A statute cannot abrogate a constitutional right. Where the statute\u2019s protections are not sought or not available, a defendant may still assert constitutional speedy-trial rights. <em>Hodge, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u00b619 The minimum delay necessary to trigger a speedy-trial analysis is 200 days. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 41. The interval between accusation and disposition (either trial or guilty plea) is the relevant time period for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>analyzing a speedy-trial claim. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 42-43. In this case, the accusation happened on April 29,2012, when Heppner was arrested for DUI.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges remained pending until May 9,2013, when Heppner pled guilty \u2014 375 days later. This is sufficient to trigger a constitutional speedy-trial analysis. However, the Municipal Court did not address Heppner\u2019s constitutional speedy-trial claim and the District Court did not consider it because it concluded a constitutional challenge was not applicable to misdemeanors. Thus, we are unable to determine whether Heppner\u2019s constitutional speedy-trial rights were violated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">[T]he court must, of necessity, enter findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to each of the four factors <em>and </em>how the four factors were balanced against each other. Without these findings of fact and conclusions of law, appellate review of the court\u2019s final disposition of the claim is, as a practical matter, impossible, and we will he forced to remand the case to the trial court in such situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 117 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b620 Having determined that the delay in Heppner\u2019s case was sufficient to trigger analysis under the <em>Ariegwe </em>factors, we reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to remand to the Municipal Court for the purpose of taking evidence and making appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding Heppner\u2019s constitutional speedy-trial claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\"> The State\u2019s word choice, \u201cremand,\u201d is inaccurate. The case was in front of the District Court under the court\u2019s original jurisdiction, rather than appellate jurisdiction, and the case originated not in the Municipal Court, but in the Justice Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> On appeal, the State argues that the date the information was filed in the District Court is the appropriate starting point. The right to a speedy trial attaches, however, as soon as someone becomes an accused, \u201cwhether that accusation be by arrest, the filing of a complaint, or by indictment or information.\" <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 42 (quoting <em>State v. Larson, </em>191 Mont. 257, 261, 623 P.2d 954, 958 (1981)). Thus, Heppner\u2019s constitutional speedy-trial right attached when he was arrested on April 29,2012, and that is the appropriate starting date for determining the length of the delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
