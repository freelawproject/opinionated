The underlying criminal proceeding is still pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b62 An information was filed on September 11,2013, alleging that on August 15, 2013, Violette struck 75-year-old Mary Mehrer in the face and seriously injured her. The State charged Violette with three counts: aggravated assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA; criminal mischief, which is not pertinent to this appeal; and elder abuse, in violation of \u00a7 52-3-825, MCA. The allegations state that Mehrer was an \u201colder person\u201d as defined in \u00a7 52-3-803(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b63 The State\u2019s affidavit in support of leave to file an information recounts that Mehrer and her husband have a cabin in the Snowy Mountains, in Fergus County, that is accessed by going up Beaver Creek drainage and onto Rocky Mountain Lane. In order to get to their cabin, the Mehrers travel on an access road that goes by a house and property owned and occupied by Violette. The Mehrers believe they have an easement on the road to access their property. Violette is alleged to have impeded the Mehrers\u2019 access over the road in the past. On August 15, 2013, the Mehrers were returning to Lewistown from their cabin when they noticed the road was obstructed at Violette\u2019s residence by parked vehicles. Mehrer got out of her vehicle to take a picture when Violette approached, yelling obscenities and telling Mehrer to leave. Mehrer reported to law enforcement that Violette grabbed her camera and threw it on the ground, and then struck Mehrer in the face, knocking her to the ground. Mehrer suffered head trauma and vision loss when she struck the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b64 Violette filed a pretrial motion requesting that the court order the State to elect between prosecuting him for either aggravated assault or elder abuse. Violette argued that if he is prosecuted for both offenses, he will be denied his federal constitutional protection against double jeopardy and the protections of Montana\u2019s \u201cmultiple charges\u201d statute, contained at \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA. The District Court denied Violette\u2019s motion, concluding that the elder abuse statute is neither a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault, \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA, nor a specific instance of aggravated assault, \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(d), MCA. Violette appeals and argues that elder abuse is a specific instance of the conduct of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b65 We recognized in <em>Keating v. First Judicial District, </em>278 Mont. 218, 224, 924 P.2d 1297, 1300 (1996), that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy \u201cis designed to prevent the individual from being put at risk of conviction at a second trial,\u201d and that, regardless of conviction or acquittal, a defendant has incurred the risk \u201conce he endures the second trial ... .\u201d At that point, \u201che has been put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>jeopardy/ and that fact cannot be remedied or expunged after the fact.\u201d <em>Keating, </em>278 Mont. at 224, 924 P.2d at 1300. If the prohibition against double jeopardy is to have any significance, it \u201cmust be given effect prior to, not after, the second trial.\u201d <em>Keating, </em>278 Mont. at 224, 924 P.2d at 1300. In keeping with these principles, we considered Keating\u2019s writ of habeas corpus raising double jeopardy claims pending commencement of Keating\u2019s second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b66  Those circumstances do not present here. Before a question of double jeopardy arises, there must be an initial determination as to whether jeopardy has attached in the first instance. The guarantee against double jeopardy \u201chas been said to consist of three separate constitutional protections. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense <em>after acquittal. </em>It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense <em>after conviction . </em>And it protects against multiple <em>punishments </em>for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Wirtala, </em>231 Mont. 264, 269, 752 P.2d 177, 181 (1998) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 129, 101 S. Ct. 426, 433 (1980)), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 8, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9. Here, \u201cjeopardy\u201d has never attached in Violette\u2019s prosecution because he has not previously been tried for or convicted of the instant offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b67 Montana\u2019s \u201cmultiple charges\u201d statute is consistent with these principles. Section 46-11-410, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">(1) When the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct <em>may be prosecuted </em>for each offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">(2) A defendant may not, however, be <em>convicted </em>of more than one offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">(a) one offense is included in the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">(d) the offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a specific instance of the conduct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b68 Based upon the language of \u00a7 46-11-410(1), MCA, Violette may be prosecuted for more than one offense arising out of the same transaction. Section 46-11-410(1), MCA, embodies the well-established principle that the State is vested with broad discretion in making charging decisions and, when the facts support possible charges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>more than one crime, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <em>State v. Matt, </em>2005 MT 9, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 340, 106 P.3d 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b69  At this juncture, Violette has not been convicted of aggravated assault or elder abuse, and consequently his double jeopardy claim and reliance on the protections of \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, are premature. We make no determination as to the merits of Violette\u2019s claim that elder abuse is a specific instance of aggravated assault prohibited by \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(d), MCA, except to say that jeopardy has not attached to his prosecution in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b610 Therefore, the Court finds good cause for the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b611 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED this appeal is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, and the matter is remanded to the District Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">Dated this 24th day of February, 2015.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-7\">/s/ laurie McKinnon</judges>\n<judges id=\"b349-8\">We Concur:</judges>\n<judges id=\"b349-9\">/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT</judges>\n<judges id=\"A39\">/S/ JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA</judges>\n<judges id=\"ApW\">/S/ PATRICIA COTTER</judges>\n<judges id=\"ApCf\">/S/JIM RICE</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> Jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn. <em>Crist v.
