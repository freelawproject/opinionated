We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b62 Moreau presents the following issue for review: Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Moreau\u2019s petition because she lacked standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b63 Cristita Moreau\u2019s husband Edwin worked at the W. R. Grace mine from 1963 until 1992. He died of asbestos-related lung cancer in 2009. In 2010 Moreau, as personal representative of Edwin\u2019s estate, filed a claim for occupational disease benefits with Grace\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, Transportation Insurance. Transportation denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b64 In 2012 Moreau filed a petition in Workers\u2019 Compensation Court seeking a determination of Transportation\u2019s liability for the costs of Edwin\u2019s medical care. In 2013 Transportation accepted liability for Edwin\u2019s medical expenses, and Moreau and Transportation entered a settlement agreement. Transportation reimbursed Medicaid, other providers, and Moreau individually for medical expenses they had paid for Edwin\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b65 The Libby Medical Plan (Plan) paid slightly over $95,000 of Edwin\u2019s medical expenses. The Plan was an entity established and funded by Edwin\u2019s employer, W. R. Grace, to pay the medical care expenses of employees who were injured by asbestos exposure. Both the Plan and W. R. Grace refused to accept any reimbursement from Transportation for the medical expenses the Plan had paid on Edwin\u2019s behalf. Moreau then demanded that the amount of the reimbursement declined by the Plan and W. R. Grace should be paid either to Edwin\u2019s Estate or to a charity selected by the Estate. Transportation refused to pay the money and Moreau filed a second petition to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">\u00b66 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied the petition, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear it under \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that since Edwin received the medical care and the care was paid for by the Plan, any further recovery would result in a double payment. Moreau was not liable to providers for the prior payments that the Plan made on Edwin\u2019s behalf, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>and she had no right to any payment from Transportation. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that Moreau lacked standing to proceed and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AUr\">\u00b67 Moreau appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b68 The determination of a party\u2019s standing is a question of law, as is the interpretation of a statute. We review these issues de novo to determine whether the district court was correct. <em>Druffel v. Board of Adjustments, </em>2007 MT 220, \u00b6 9, 339 Mont. 57, 168 P.3d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b69 <em>Issue: Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Moreau\u2019s petition because she lacked standing,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b610 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is a court with limited but exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes concerning workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Liberty Northwest v. State Fund, </em>1998 MT 169, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 289 Mont. 475, 962 P.2d 1167; <em>Carlson v. Cain, </em>216 Mont. 129, 141, 700 P.2d 607, 615 (1985). Section 39-71-2905, MCA, establishes the jurisdiction of the Court, providing that: \u201cA claimant... who has a dispute concerning any benefits under chapter 71 of this title may petition the workers\u2019 compensation judge for a determination of the dispute after satisfying dispute resolution requirements otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d That same section provides that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to resolve such disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b611 The workers\u2019 compensation statutes \u201cmust be construed according to [their] terms and not liberally in favor of any party.\u201d Section 39-71-105(5), MCA. Under the plain terms of \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, the requisite for bringing a case to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for determination is a claimant who has a dispute concerning any benefits. The question of standing is whether a party is entitled to have a court decide the merits of a dispute. <em>Heffernan v. Missoula, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6 30, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80. A party\u2019s lack of standing does not deprive a court of its underlying subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Ballas v. Missoula, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16, 340 Mont 56, 172 P.3d 1232, and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court \u201chas jurisdiction over disputes involving medical benefits.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Albertson\u2019s, </em>2004 MTWCC 59, \u00b6 21. Entitlement to payment for medical expenses is a benefit under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Section 39-71-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00b612 The petitioner in this case is the Estate of Edwin Moreau, appearing through its personal representative, Cristita Moreau. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is binding on the employee and \u201cthe employee\u2019s personal representative.\u201d Section 39-71-411, MCA. The undisputed facts establish that Edwin Moreau was an employee whose workers\u2019 compensation benefits were covered by Transportation. After the Estate filed the initial petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, Transportation agreed that Edwin\u2019s medical benefits claimed by the Estate were covered claims and that it was liable for those claims. The Estate and Transportation entered a settlement of those claims, which provided that Transportation would pay Edwin\u2019s medical expenses or would reimburse those who had already paid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b613  When interpreting a statute, this Court seeks \u201cto implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language controls.\u201d <em>In re the Conservatorship of Kloss, </em>2005 MT 39, \u00b6 10, 326 Mont. 117, 109 P.3d 205. The plain language of \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, entitles Moreau, as personal representative of the Estate, to bring this matter before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b614 The Estate had standing and was entitled to have its petition determined on the merits. We express no view whatsoever as to the merits of the Estate\u2019s claim here, and remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b615 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
