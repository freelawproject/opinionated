Welles, Inc., (Welles) and the State of Montana appeal dispositive orders from the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. The following issues resolve the appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court correctly denied summary judgment to Welles.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-14\">\n<em>2.

We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">\u00b62 This case arises out of a highway paving project conducted near Ennis in 2000. The State contracted the job to Welles, which in turn sub-contracted parts of the job to Montana Materials, Inc., RSJ, Inc., and GL J, Inc. (collectively, \u201cJensen\u201d). The State and Welles insured the job through Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co. (Liberty). On September 30, 2000, Jensen applied primer (oil) and blotter (a sand-like substance) to the road. That night, a storm struck, causing the primer to emulsify in rainwater. The oil splashed onto passing vehicles, causing about $600,000 in damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">\u00b63 The vehicle owners brought claims against the State, which the State paid. Consistent with the general contract, Welles reimbursed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the State for what it paid to the vehicle owners. The State sued Liberty, seeking indemnification under its insurance contract for the costs that Welles did not cover; Welles sued Jensen, seeking indemnification under the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b64 Both Welles and Jensen moved for summaryjudgment on Welles\u2019s indemnification claim against Jensen. The District Court denied Welles\u2019s motion on April 24, 2008, and granted Jensen\u2019s motion on January 25,2010. In 2012, Liberty moved to dismiss the State\u2019s action against it for failure to prosecute. On January 24, 2014, the court granted the motion and dismissed the State\u2019s action. In February 2014, the court entered a final judgment. The State appeals the dismissal and Welles appeals the summaryjudgment orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b65 We review summary judgment orders de novo, <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and the entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. We review a dismissal for failure to prosecute to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Westland v. Weinmeister, </em>259 Mont. 412, 415, 856 P.2d 1374, 1376 (1993). We will vacate the dismissal if, after reviewing the record, we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Doug Johns Real Estate, Inc. v. Banta, </em>246 Mont. 295, 298, 805 P.2d 1301, 1303 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b66 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly denied summary judgment to Welles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u00b67 The contract between Welles and Jensen includes the following indemnity clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">The Subcontractor shall indemnify the Contractor against and save it harmless from any and all claims, suits or liability for injuries to property, injuries to persons including death, and from any other claims, suits or liability <em>on account of any act or omission </em>of the Subcontractor, or any of his officers, agents, employees or servant[s].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">(Emphasis supplied). The District Court interpreted this clause to require Jensen to indemnify Welles for foreseeable losses resulting from Jensen\u2019s negligent or wrongful conduct. The court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>that Welles failed to raise a triable dispute about whether Jensen acted negligently when it applied the primer. The court therefore denied Welles\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b68 The role of a court interpreting a contract provision is to ascertain and effectuate the parties\u2019 mutual intentions. Section 28-3-301, MCA; <em>Whary v. Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P., </em>2014 MT 71, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 266, 320 P.3d 973. The clear and explicit language of the contract reflects the parties\u2019 intentions and controls a court\u2019s interpretation. Section 28-3-303, MCA; <em>Whary, </em>\u00b6 10. To the extent that there is ambiguity, indemnity clauses generally should be \u201cliberally construed in favor of the party intended to be indemnified.\u201d <em>Lesofski v. Ravalli Cnty. Elect. Coop. Inc., </em>151 Mont. 104, 107, 439 P.2d 370, 371 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"AEn\">\u00b69 Welles argues that the District Court erred by interpreting the indemnity clause to require negligent or wrongful conduct. Welles directs the Court\u2019s attention to cases in which other courts interpreted similar indemnity clauses and did not require proof of negligence or wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b610 In <em>Fairbanks North Star Borough v. Roen Design Ass\u2019n., Inc., </em>727 P.2d 758 (Alaska 1986), the Alaska Supreme Court interpreted a clause in which a contractor promised to indemnify a principal for particular losses \u201cincurred for or on account of injuries or damages to persons or property as a result of any act or omission of the Contractor in the performances pursuant to this contract.\u201d <em>Fairbanks, </em>727 P.2d at 759. The court rejected the argument that indemnity turned on whether the contractor was negligent, noting that the clause did \u201cnot limit indemnity to <em>\u2018tort </em>liability, claims, suits or demands,\u2019 nor to \u201cliability claims, suits or demands ... incurred ... as a result of any <em>negligent </em>act or omission of the Contractor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fairbanks, </em>727 P.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u00b611 Similarly, in <em>Cont\u2019l Heller Corp. v. Amtech Mechanical Servs., Inc, </em>53 Cal. App. 4th 500, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 668 (1997), a California Court of Appeals interpreted a clause in which a subcontractor agreed to indemnify a general contractor for any loss \u201cwhich arises out of or is in any way connected with the [sub-contractor\u2019s] performance of work under this Subcontract.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>53 Cal. App. 4th at 504-05, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 670. The court rejected the argument that indemnity turned on whether the contractor was negligent, noting that the contract stated that the duty to indemnify applied to <em>\u201cany </em>acts or omissions,\u201d and not simply \u201cwillful misconduct or negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>53 Cal. App. 4th at 505, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00b612 What was true for the indemnity clauses in <em>Fairbanks </em>and <em>Heller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>holds trae for the indemnity clause in Welles\u2019s contract with Jensen. Jensen agreed to indemnify Welles for losses \u201con account of <em>any </em>act or omission\u201d by Jensen. The clear and explicit language of the contract does not limit the duty to indemnify to negligent or wrongful acts or omissions. If that was the intention of the parties, it would have been easy for them to manifest it in the contract\u2019s language. For instance, in <em>Amazi v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>249 Mont. 355, 816 P.2d 431 (1991), a contract required indemnification of losses \u201con account of damage to property [that]... is the result... of the [indemnitor\u2019s] <em>negligent </em>acts or omissions or <em>willful </em>misconduct.\u201d <em>Amazi, </em>249 Mont. at 359, 816 P.2d at 433-34 (emphasis supplied). Unlike the parties to the contract in <em>Amazi, </em>Welles and Jensen did not include a negligence requirement in the language of their indemnity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">\u00b613  The role of a judge in construing a contract is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-4-101, MCA; <em>Cortese </em>v. <em>Cortese, </em>2008 MT 28, \u00b6 10, 341 Mont. 287, 176 P.3d 1064; <em>see also </em>14 Am. Jur. Pleading and Practice Forms <em>Indemnity </em>\u00a7 3 (2013) (\u201cWhere parties have expressly contracted with respect to the duty to indemnify, the extent of the duty must be determined from the language of the contract ... .\u201d). The District Court erred by inserting a negligence requirement where Welles and Jensen omitted any such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b614 The District Court also accepted Jensen\u2019s argument that the losses in this case were not foreseeable. Again, the plain language defeats interpreting the indemnity clause to impose such a requirement. Jensen argues, however, that the indemnity clause\u2019s \u201con account of\u2019 language implies foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b615 When interpreting a contract, we give words their plain and ordinary meaning unless a technical meaning is apparent. Section 28-3-501, MCA; <em>Krajacich v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2012 MT 82, \u00b6 17, 364 Mont. 455, 276 P.3d 922. We decline to define \u201con account of\u2019 as turning on the technical, legal concept of foreseeability, which derives from tort law. <em>See Sternhagen v. Dow Co., </em>282 Mont. 168, 176, 935 P.2d 1139, 1144 (1997). The ordinary meaning of \u201con account of\u2019 is \u201cby reason of\u201d or \u201cbecause of.\u201d <em>The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary </em>64 (Oxford University Press, 1971) (providing the example, \u201cHe keeps at home now, on account of his great age.\u201d). As used in the indemnity clause, \u201con account of\u201d simply requires a direct causal relationship between the act or omission and the claimed loss. To the extent that there is any room for a different interpretation, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>construe the phrase in favor of Welles, the indemnitee. <em>Lesofski, </em>151 Mont, at 107, 439 P.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b616  It is undisputed that Jensen placed the primer on the road on September 30, that the rainstorm happened that night, and that the primer emulsified, splashed onto, and damaged the vehicles. There is a direct causal relationship between Jensen\u2019s act of placing primer on the road on September 30 and the damage that the primer inflicted on passing vehicles that night and the next morning. Jensen argues that the damages were \u201con account of\u2019 the rain. But with or without the rain, it cannot be disputed that, but for the placement of the primer on the road the preceding day, traffic would have crossed the construction area without incident. This but-for connection means that the damage to the vehicles was \u201con account of\u2019 Jensen\u2019s \u201cact or omission.\u201d Accordingly, Welles is entitled to indemnification and summary judgment. We vacate the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Jensen and remand for the District Court to enter judgment in favor of Welles.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b617 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by dismissing the State\u2019s claim against Liberty for failure to prosecute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b618 M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) provides, \u201c[I]f the plaintiff fails to prosecute... a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.\u201d \u201cDecisions on motions to dismiss for failure to prosecute entail a careful balancing of the competing public policy interests in resolving lawsuits on the merits and encouraging prompt disposition of <em>disputes.\u201d Hobble-Diamond Cattle, Co. v. Triangle Irrigation Co., </em>272 Mont. 37, 40, 899 P.2d 531, 533 (1995). Four factors bear on the propriety of dismissal: (1) the plaintiffs diligence in prosecuting the claims; (2) the prejudice to the defense caused by the delay; (3) the availability of alternative sanctions; and (4) the existence of a warning to the plaintiff that the case was in danger of dismissal. <em>Becky v. Nw. Bank Dillon, N.A., </em>245 Mont. 1, 12, 798 P.2d 1011, 1015 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"A9i3\">\u00b619 In <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>we weighed the dismissal factors and determined that a district court abused its discretion by granting a M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) motion to dismiss. <em>Hobble-Diamond, 272 </em>Mont. at 43, 899 P.2d at 535. First, we noted that the evidence failed to support the District Court\u2019s conclusions that the plaintiff had been dilatory for thirty-two months and that the defendant had suffered prejudice as a result. Rather, the record revealed that the plaintiff had been dilatory for twelve months and the defendant had not been prejudiced. <em>Hobble-Diamond, 272 </em>Mont. at 41, 899 P.2d at 534. Because \u201cthe District Court relied on inappropriate time periods and erroneously found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>actual prejudice,\u201d we next gave \u201cclose consideration\u201d to the alternative sanctions that were available. <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont. at 42, 899 P.2d at 535. Finally, we observed that the District Court did not warn the plaintiff of the danger of dismissal. <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont. at 42-43, 899 P.2d at 535. Weighing all the dismissal factors, we concluded that dismissal was improvident. <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont, at 43, 899 P.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">\u00b620 Here, the District Court concluded that the State failed to prosecute its case between January 25,2010 (when the court made its last summary judgment ruling), and March 21, 2012 (when Liberty moved for dismissal), because, \u201cfollowing the January 25,2010 order, the State did nothing to pursue its remaining cause of action despite repeated requests by Liberty regarding the State\u2019s intentions.\u201d The court based this conclusion on a series of letters that Liberty submitted into evidence as support for its motion to dismiss. In the first letter, dated November 11, 2010, Liberty\u2019s counsel (1) thanked the State\u2019s counsel for visiting with him \u201cto refresh our recollections concerning this case,\u201d (2) specified a settlement offer amount, and (3) stated that Liberty looked forward to the State\u2019s response. The succeeding letters suggest that the State never responded to the settlement offer. On January 16, 2012, the State\u2019s counsel wrote that the State would respond to Liberty\u2019s settlement offer after conferring with Welles\u2019s counsel within the next thirty days, but the State never gave Liberty a response after the thirty days had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b621 The State argues that the District Court nonetheless was incorrect in concluding that the State took no action after January 2010. Indeed, Liberty\u2019s letter in November 2010 suggests that the two sides held settlement talks a short time before the letter. That a plaintiff is not filing motions or speaking in a courtroom does not necessarily mean the plaintiff is dawdling. For instance, in <em>Doug Johns, </em>letters showed that the parties engaged in settlement negotiations during the supposedly dilatory period. <em>Doug Johns, </em>246 Mont. at 298, 805 P.2d at 1304; <em>see also Becky, </em>245 Mont. at 8-9, 798 P.2d at 1016 (noting that the plaintiff consulted financial experts and attorneys during the supposedly dilatory period). Further, we cannot charge the State with the seventeen-month delay between the filing of Liberty\u2019s motion to dismiss in April 2012 (to which the State responded) and the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the case in January 2014. The pertinent period for consideration is the seventeen months between November 2010 and April 2012 when the State failed to respond to the settlement offer or to move forward with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b622 The State\u2019s seventeen-month delay was poor practice. Still, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>precedent suggests that the individual circumstances of a case determine whether a delay of this length is unreasonable. For instance, in <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>we determined that a one-year delay in prosecuting an action after a canceled status conference was \u201cnot <em>per se </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont. at 41, 899 P.2d at 534. And in <em>Becky, </em>we determined that a thirty-month delay was not unreasonable where the plaintiffs offered reasonable excuses for the interval, <em>Becky, </em>245 Mont. at 17, 798 P.2d 1017. But in <em>Westland, </em>we concluded that five years between the complaint and the motion to dismiss was an \u201cunreasonably long time\u201d to prosecute a \u201csimple case\u201d where the plaintiff took no action in the eighteen months preceding the motion to dismiss. <em>Westland, </em>259 Mont. at 416-17, 856 P.2d at 1377; see <em>also Pool v. Butte Pro-Release Center, Inc., </em>283 Mont. 287, 290, 939 P.2d 1011, 1013 (1997) (concluding that the plaintiffs failure to make himself available for deposition for the twenty-two months preceding the motion to dismiss constituted unreasonable delay). Although the State offers little excuse for its conduct, in this complex case involving multiple parties, contracts, and cross-motions, we conclude that the seventeen-month delay, like the twelve-month delay in <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>was <em>\u201cnotperse unreasonable.\u201dHobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont. at 41, 899 P.2d at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b623 The District Court determined that Liberty suffered actual prejudice because the State\u2019s delay resulted in (1) the unavailability of fact witnesses and (2) Liberty being unable to close its case file. In <em>Pool, </em>the defendant supported his motion to dismiss by attaching an affidavit attesting to witnesses who were unavailable because of a delay in prosecution. <em>Pool, </em>283 Mont. at 290, 939 P.2d at 1013. But in this case, Liberty submitted no evidence \u2014 either in the affidavit it attached to its motion or anywhere else \u2014 to support the finding that witnesses had become unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b624 Further, Liberty and the State were not the only parties in this litigation. Welles did not (and could not) appeal the summaryjudgment orders until final judgment was entered, which did not occur until after the dilatory period. Mont. R. App. P. 6(1); <em>Trombley v. Mann, </em>2001 MT 154, \u00b6 6, 306 Mont. 80, 30 P.3d 355. Presumably, Liberty had to keep its file open until after Welles could resolve its appeal. Thus, it is not clear that Liberty could have closed its file any sooner had the State been diligent instead of dilatory. Moreover, Liberty did not submit attorney billing statements or any other evidence showing harm that resulted from simply having to keep its case file open. The record does not support a determination of actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00b625 In <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>we noted that, because \u201cthe District Court relied on inappropriate time periods and erroneously found actual prejudice,\u201d closer consideration of the third factor was necessary. <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont. at 42, 899 P.2d at 534-35. The same holds true here. The District Court\u2019s dismissal order does not acknowledge that the State responded to Liberty\u2019s motion to dismiss by moving for a scheduling conference to set a date for trial. In <em>Doug Johns, </em>we stated that \"simply... scheduling] the case for trial\u201d would have constituted an \u201cadequate remedy\u201d for a party\u2019s delay. <em>Doug Johns, </em>246 Mont. at 299, 805 P.2d at 1304. Given the availability of this and other remedies \u2014 including ordering the State to pay any attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of the delay \u2014 the third factor weighs against dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">\u00b626 Finally, on the fourth factor, the District Court concluded that, while it did not warn the State that it might dismiss the case, Liberty did. Specifically, in March 2012, Liberty sent a letter to the State informing the State that Liberty would move to dismiss if the State did not respond to the settlement offer. We noted in <em>Hobble-Diamond </em>that, \u201c[f]or purposes of considering the [dismissal] factors ... it is sufficient to observe that the court did not formally warn [the plaintiff] that its case was in danger of dismissal.\u201d <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>272 Mont. at 42-43, 899 P.2d at 535. We agree that the State should not have ignored Liberty\u2019s warning. But even if that warning were sufficient to satisfy the fourth factor, it alone is not compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b627  Weighing the factors, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by dismissing the State\u2019s case against Liberty. Although we do not condone the State\u2019s delay, on balance \u2014 particularly, absent a showing of actual prejudice \u2014 we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district comb committed a clear error in weighing the relevant factors <em>\u201dDoug Johns, </em>246 Mont. at 298, 805 P.2d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b628 We reverse the appealed orders.
