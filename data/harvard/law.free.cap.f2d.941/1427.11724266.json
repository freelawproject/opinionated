They now challenge their convictions; appellant Snyder also challenges his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-27\">We find no reason for setting aside appellants\u2019 convictions, and therefore affirm them. Appellants received a fair trial; the errors they cite \u2014 the trial court\u2019s instruction to a witness to \u201cleave all your wild stories for someone else\u201d and its submission of a tape recording to the jury \u2014 were harmless, if error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-28\">We set aside, however, appellant Snyder\u2019s sentence, and remand the case for further proceedings. In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 275, 112 L.Ed.2d 230 (1990), we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeeH\">[wjhere the district court has not elicited fully articulated objections following the imposition of sentence, this court will vacate the sentence and remand for further sentencing in order to give the parties an opportunity to raise and explain their objections. Where the district court has offered the opportunity to object and a party is silent or fails to state the grounds for objection, objections to the sentence will be waived for purposes of appeal, and this court will not entertain an appeal based upon such objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>tions unless refusal to do so would result in manifest injustice. The procedure that we announce today is to be followed for all sentences imposed after the expiration of one hundred and twenty days following the date of this opinion [i.e., after Aug. 28, 1990].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1506-4\">The district court, after imposing Snyder\u2019s sentence, did not elicit fully articulated objections from counsel; rather, the court merely inquired whether there was \u201canything further.\u201d Neither side voiced any objections. Snyder now contends that the court erred in fashioning his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">The purpose of eliciting objections following the imposition of sentence is twofold. First, an objection, if well made, may permit the court to cure an error on the spot \u2014 perhaps making an appeal unnecessary. Second, by eliciting the parties\u2019 objections, the trial judge narrows, and sharpens, the issues presentable on appeal. So that the objections Snyder now makes to his sentence may be presented to, passed upon, and perhaps cured by the sentencing judge, we vacate Snyder\u2019s sentence and remand his case for further proceedings in accordance with <em>Jones\u2019 </em>mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-6\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
