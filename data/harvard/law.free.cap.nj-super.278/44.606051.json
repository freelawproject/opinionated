He was convicted of fourth degree criminal sexual contact <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3b; 2C:14-2c(2)) and fourth degree criminal trespass <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3a). He was sentenced to concurrent eighteen-month terms with a nine-month period of parole ineligibility to be served consecutively to the sentence he was already serving. An appropriate Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty was also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Defendant appeals, contending that the following trial errors warrant reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">\n<em>POINT I:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">ADMISSION OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS FOR SIMILAR OFFENSES BY TRIAL COURT WAS UNDULY PREJUDICIAL SO AS TO AMOUNT TO REVERSIBLE ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">A.

The Evidence Does Not Support The Imposition Of A Period of Parole Ineligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">We have carefully reviewed this record in light of these contentions and have concluded that our intervention is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">/</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The trial judge determined under <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 886 A.2d 378 (1978) that for credibility purposes, defendant\u2019s previous convictions for sexual offenses were relevant and could be admitted if he took the stand. This ruling was legally unexceptionable. These offenses were properly held admissible for impeachment purposes. <em>State v. L.J.P., </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 443, 637 A.2d 532 (App.Div.1994). <em>State v. Brunson, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>377, 394, 625 A.2d 1085 (1993) was decided after the trial in this case. The fact that defendant raised this point at trial is of no moment to <em>Brunson\u2019s </em>prospectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">In charging the jury as to fourth degree criminal sexual contact, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-15\">A person is guilty of criminal sexual contact if he commits an act of sexual contact with the victim, and the victim is one of whom the person knew or should . have known was physically helpless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-16\">\u201cSexual contact\u201d is the intentional touching by the victim or the defendant, either directly or through clothing, of the victim or defendant\u2019s intimate parts for the purpose of humiliating the victim, or sexually arousing or sexually gratifying the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-17\">\u201cInt\u00edmate parts\u201d means the following parts: Sexual organs, genital area, anal area, inner thigh, groin, buttock or breast of a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>According to the law, \u201cphysically helpless\u201d means that condition in which a person is unconscious, or is physically unable to flee or is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Defendant contends that whether a person is physically helpless is a question of law for the trial judge and not a question of fact for the jury; and, in addition, that the judge should have instructed the jury that one is not physically helpless when asleep. Neither of these contentions is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The \u201cphysically helpless\u201d standard was properly defined by the trial judge as a matter of law in accordance with the model jury instructions for criminal sexual contact. <em>Model Jury Charge, </em>Criminal Sexual Contact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3b (2C:14-2c(l) through (5)) (Approved 11/17/81). According to the definition, one is physically helpless when he or she is in a condition of unconsciousness or is physically unable to flee or is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act. Encompassed within these words is a variety of factual scenarios. It is thus for the jury and not the judge to determine whether, as a matter of fact, a victim\u2019s condition meets the physically helpless standard. <em>See People v. Irving, </em>151 A.D.2d 605, 542 N.Y.S.2d 693 (N.Y.App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Defendant\u2019s suggestion that, as a matter of law, sleep does not meet this standard is equally unavailing. First, it makes common sense that a person who is actually asleep is incapable of fleeing or communicating unwillingness to act. Indeed, <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>defines sleep as a \u201cnatural, periodically recurring physiological state of rest, characterized by relative physical and nervous inactivity, unconsciousness, and lessened responsiveness to external stimuli.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, </em>1150 (2d College ed. 1982). \u201cUnconscious\u201d is defined as \u201c[n]ot possessed of mind____[/Insensible to the reception of any stimuli and incapable of performing or experiencing any controlled functions,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1525 (6th ed. 1990), or \u201c[h]av-ing lost, esp. temporarily, the capacity for sensory perception,\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, supra, </em>at 1316. Obviously, a person who is lacking sensory perception and is unable to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>any controlled function, including communication of a lack of consent, meets the definition of physical helplessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Other jurisdictions faced with this issue have determined that sleep can establish physical helplessness. In <em>State v. Moorman, </em>a North Carolina statute which defined physical helplessness as unconsciousness or inability to resist or communicate unwillingness to submit to a sexual act was at issue. <em>State v. Moorman, </em>320 <em>N.C. </em>387, 358 S.E.2d 502 (1987) (interpreting <em>N.C.Gen.Stat. </em>\u00a7 14-27.3(a)(2)). The North Carolina Supreme Court held that a case involving a sleeping victim could be brought under a physically helpless standard noting that common law rape \u201coccurred when there was sexual intercourse with a victim who was asleep or otherwise incapable of providing resistance or consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>358 S.E.2d at 505. (citing <em>Brown v. State, </em>138 <em>Ga. </em>814, 76 <em>S.E. </em>379 (Ga.Ct.App.1912); <em>Territory of Hawaii v. Tatsuo Noguchi, </em>38 <em>Haw. </em>350 (1949); <em>State v. Lung, </em>21 <em>Nev. </em>209, 28 <em>P. </em>235 (1891); <em>Payne v. State, </em>40 <em>Tex.Crim. </em>202, 49 S.W. 604 (App.1899); 75 C.J.S. <em>Rape </em>\u00a7 11 (1952); 3 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 289 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Likewise, a Minnesota statute imposing liability for third degree criminal sexual conduct upon one who engages in non-consensual sexual penetration while the victim is physically helpless was interpreted to include a victim who is asleep. <em>State v. Griffith, </em>480 <em>N.W.2d </em>347, 349 (Minn.Ct.App.1992) (interpreting <em>Minn.Stat. </em>\u00a7 609.345(l)(d) (1990)). <em>See also State v. Perkins, </em>395 N.W.2d 729, 731 (Minn.Ct.App.1986) (\u201c[T]he definition of \u2018physically helpless\u2019 includes a person who is asleep or unconscious.\u201d) (citing <em>Minn.Stat. </em>\u00a7 609.341(9)).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">In a rape case, the Court of Appeals of Virginia held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">\u201c[T]he jury had to decide the factual issue of whether the victim was asleep, and thereby in a state of physical helplessness, when [defendant] had sexual intercourse with her. The jury determined the victim was asleep at that time and credible evidence in the record supports that determination____ Thus, the jury properly found, based on the evidence, that Woodward had sexual intercourse with the victim, through the use of her physical helplessness and is guilty of rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\"><em>[Woodward v. Virginia, </em>12 <em>Va.App. </em>118, 402 <em>S.E.</em>2d 244, 246 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>In directly addressing the question of whether, for the purposes of a sexual touching crime, one is physically helpless when asleep, the Court of Appeals of Washington held that \u201c[T]he state of sleep appears to be universally understood as unconsciousness or physical inability to communicate unwillingness. Therefore, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was physically helpless based on the evidence she was asleep.\u201d <em>State v. Puapuaga, </em>54 <em>Wash.App. </em>857, 776 P.2d 170, 172 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Here the jury heard and accepted the victim\u2019s testimony that she was asleep when defendant touched her. From that evidence, it was free to find that the victim was physically helpless within the meaning of the criminal sexual contact statute. <em>See State ex rel. M.T.S., </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 258-59, 588 A.2d 1282 (App.Div.1991) (dictum) (\u201cHad the trial judge accepted the victim\u2019s story that she was penetrated while sleeping, there might have been a finding that she was \u2018physically helpless\u2019 at the time.\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>422, 609 A.2d 1266 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">We turn finally to defendant\u2019s sentence. We have carefully reviewed this record and have concluded that the aggravating factors relied upon by the trial judge to justify a sentence greater than the presumptive and to impose a period of parole ineligibility were fully supported by the evidence. (No mitigating factors were found.) The weighing of these factors conformed to the legislative policies underlying our sentencing law and the sentence is not so unreasonable as to shock our conscience. <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>834, 364-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
