Following a two-week trial by jury, Gregg was convicted of first-degree aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a; aggravated assault of which Ms. Wexler was the victim, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l); the disorderly person\u2019s offense of simple assault of which Ms. Falk was the victim, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-la(l); fourth-degree assault by auto causing serious bodily injury of Ms. Wexler, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-lc; and the disorderly person\u2019s offense of assault by auto causing bodily injury to Ms. Falk, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lc. He was sentenced to a thirty-year term with a twelve-year period of parole ineligibility on the aggravated manslaughter conviction and a concurrent seven-year term on the aggravated assault conviction. No custodial term was imposed on the simple assault conviction and the assault by auto convictions were merged into the assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In appealing from the judgment of conviction, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">I.

THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY IMPOSED THE S.N.S.F. PENALTY AND THE INCORRECT V.C.C.B. ASSESSMENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial because we are persuaded that the fundamental fairness required of the criminal trial process was irretrievably compromised by the prose-cutorial excesses in the State\u2019s summation coupled with the admission of prejudicially repetitious testimony and testimony admitted contrary to discovery theretofore provided to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Defendant, forty-two years old at the time of this event, married, the father of four children, and a resident of Bergen County, is a serious alcoholic of long standing. At the time of this accident, he had already had \u201cmany charges\u201d of driving while intoxicated, had obtained driving licenses in other states, suffered from alcoholic black-outs, and lost time from work. Although he had entered an in-patient detoxification program several years before, he had left it after only ten days. It further appears that Gregg was what is known as a binge drinker, alternating considerable periods of abstinence with periods of heavy drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The binge which ended so tragically in Mr. Falk\u2019s death began on the evening of May 26, 1991, the day before Memorial Day, when Gregg consumed a six-pack of beer, breaking a several-month abstinence. On the morning of Memorial Day, he found the family dog dead and blamed himself for the mishap. He arranged to have the dog buried at a pet cemetery, returning home from that task in the early afternoon. He had by that time been drinking beer fairly steadily. In mid-afternoon, he decided to leave the depressed environment of his home and drive his pickup truck to Cherry Hill to visit friends. It was that odyssey of driving southward on the major highways of the state punctuated by stops at bars to drink beer which finally brought him, at about 8 p.m., to Matawan Road in Old Bridge. He had been observed shortly before by several witnesses driving dangerously and erratically. The odyssey ended when he collided head-on into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Wexler vehicle which was stopped at the intersection of Matawan Road and Cliffwood Avenue waiting to make a left turn. Defendant was then speeding, was in the wrong lane of travel, had never applied his brakes and had not taken any other evasive action. He too was injured in the collision and taken to a nearby hospital where, two hours after the accident, blood tests showed his blood alcohol level to be .298 percent. It was extrapolated as over .3 when the collision occurred. There were also traces of Valium suggesting ingestion within the prior twenty-four hour period. There was considerable testimony respecting his verbal and physical abusiveness to those around him after the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The facts adduced by the State, including the events that took place up to the time of the crash, were undoubtedly more than sufficient to sustain, beyond a reasonable doubt, a verdict of aggravated manslaughter under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-4a, namely, a criminal homicide where \u201cthe actor recklessly causes death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d Our problem with the verdict is that the prosecutor was not content to present and argue the relevant facts that proved his case. He was, rather, intent upon portraying defendant as an utterly and thoroughly worthless and depraved human being.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We address first the evidence respecting defendant\u2019s post-crash behavior. The prosecutor called a parade of witnesses to testify as to defendant\u2019s conduct following the crash and at a time when he was himself injured, in shock, and very, very drunk, and, of course, at a time after the conduct that was the gravamen of the charge had already taken place. In view of defendant\u2019s inordinately high blood alcohol level, the degree of his intoxication at the time of the crash was evident. Hence the only relevance of defendant\u2019s post-crash conduct was to corroborate what had already been proved in that regard. That conduct, however, became the centerpiece of the trial. The repetition of that evidence by multiple witnesses obviously reinforced the impression the prosecutor was intending to convey to the jury of defendant\u2019s fundamentally bad character. It also served as the foundation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s address of the jury in his opening and closing statements. Thus, in summation, he characterized defendant\u2019s post-crash conduct as that of a person who is \u201cwasted, trashed, rip-roaring drunk, grossly, outrageously intoxicated, ossified, dead drunk, falling down until violently drunk.\u201d These pejoratives were consistent with his description in his opening statement, in which, after employing a variety of personally demeaning and degrading epithets, he summed up for the jury defendant\u2019s post-crash behavior as that of a \u201cnasty, violent drunk, disgustingly drunk....\u201d The \u201cviolent, nasty drunk\u201d theme was returned to again and again. The culmination of the prosecutor\u2019s post-crash description of defendant was this invitation to the jury\u2019s collective imagination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">If you could just use a split screen for a second, there\u2019s one image, it\u2019s got to be indelibly printed in your head. You think in terms of a split screen where you see on television where they show one-half of a football game, another half of a football game. Picture here is Herb Falk fighting for his life, writhing in pain and agony, slowing [sic] dying from within, bleeding to death from within, and while Herb Falk is suffering in that agony at the same time here\u2019s the defendant spitting, cursing, fighting, threatening and behaving just in an absolutely disgusting manner. That image has to be imprinted in your mind. While this innocent man is dying this man was making a complete, complete fool of himself because of the alcohol that he consumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">There was indeed very little of the summation that was not couched in terms of personal pejorative. At one point the prosecutor had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">And if he wants to drink himself into oblivion or drink himself into a coma or drink and do whatever he wants, watch television, pick his nose, do whatever he wants to do, and not get behind the wheel of a car, that\u2019s his business, but the minute he had that much to drink, to the tune of a .298 blood alcohol level, and got behind the wheel of that truck and drove the way he drove and killed an innocent man it became my business and it became your business and it became your business to convict him of aggravated manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The prosecutor repeatedly resorted to name-calling, referring to defendant as disgusting, a ninny, a buffoon, nasty, and violent, and using a whole slang dictionary\u2019s worth of demeaning colloquialisms for an intoxicated person. In short, while we have no doubt that the evidence respecting defendant\u2019s post-crash behavior was relevant, albeit to a limited degree and for a limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>purpose, it is regrettably clear that the prosecutor abused this evidence by using it for the primary purpose of portraying defendant as an utterly vile, contemptible and despicable person.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We do not intend in any way to minimize the tragedy suffered by the Falk family or to suggest anything but the most profound disapprobation of defendant\u2019s conduct. Our overriding concern, however, is with the integrity of the criminal justice system. We do not doubt the prosecutor\u2019s right \u2014 indeed, his obligation \u2014 to present the State\u2019s case forcefully and graphically, and we recognize that he is, therefore, accorded broad latitude in his summing up. <em>See, e.g., State v. Purnell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>518, 540, 601 A.2d 175 (1992); <em>State v. Zola, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>384, 427-428, 548 A.2d 1022 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 103 L.Ed.2d 205 (1989); <em>State v. Pratt, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307, 323, 544 A.2d 392 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>314, 554 A.2d 864 (1988). Nevertheless, prosecutors also have the overriding obligation to see that justice is fairly done. Thus, as we said in <em>State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 535, 493 A.2d 596 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>393, 508 A.2d 253 (1986), the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cobligation to play fair is as compelling as his responsibility to protect the public.\u201d The prosecutor is not, therefore, at liberty to obtain a conviction by striking \u201ca foul blow____\u201d <em>State v. Gookins, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>42, 49, 637 A.2d 1255 (1994) (reiterating the guiding principle that in reviewing criminal convictions, the court must assure continuing public confidence in the impartiality and fairness of the judicial process).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">As the Supreme Court made clear in <em>State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 341, 580 A.2d 221 (1990), the prosecutor is required to refrain from making derogatory statements about a criminal defendant. <em>See also State v. Pennington, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>547, 576-577, 575 A.2d 816 (1990); <em>State v. Williams, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 455, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>39, 50-51, 269 A.2d 153 (1970); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 102-103, 392 A.2d 234 (App.Div.1978). The prosecutor here based his whole presentation to the jury on derogatory remarks whose effect on the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>was obviously exacerbated, and intended to be exacerbated, by his excessive references to the victim impact of defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>See, e.g., State v. Harvey, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>407, 425, 581 A.2d 483 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>931, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1336, 113 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>268 (1991). In sum, the prosecutorial strategy here was plainly designed to impassion the jury. <em>See State v. Hightower, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>378, 411, 577 A.2d 99 (1990). That strategy denied defendant a fair trial based on the admissible evidence to which he was constitutionally entitled. While we are mindful of the plain-error rule in the context of substantial admissible evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt, we are also persuaded that when there has been a substantial subversion of the justice system, as here, the only proper remedy is a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Since defendant must be retried, we need not address at length the other issues he raises on this appeal. We do, however, note the following. We are satisfied, for the reasons stated by him, that the trial judge did not err in rejecting the proffered defense of pathological intoxication under N.J.S.A 2C:2-8d. <em>See State v. Sette, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>156, 611 A.2d 1129 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>597, 617 A.2d 1219 (1992). We are also satisfied that the judge did not mistakenly exercise his discretion in permitting the State to offer Dr. Charles Tindall as a witness despite the late furnishing of his report to the defense. The import of Dr. Tindall\u2019s testimony was largely responsive to the pathological intoxication defense and consequently in the nature of rebuttal. Nor do we find error in the judge\u2019s refusal to charge the jury regarding the perjury of a State\u2019s witness who, at a Rule 104 hearing, did not disclose his disorderly person\u2019s convictions in response to a question respecting prior criminal convictions. The status of disorderly person\u2019s convictions in this context is at least equivocal, and a perjury charge would have been inappropriate. We are, however, satisfied that once the court made the entirely proper ruling of excluding medical evidence of Ms. Wexler\u2019s fractured patella because of the prosecutor\u2019s discovery failure, it was error to permit Ms. Wexler herself to testify respecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>fracture. The fracture was a matter of substantial moment, representing the only basis on which her injuries could have been regarded as sufficiently serious to justify an aggravated assault, rather than a simple assault, conviction. Consequently, we conclude the defendant\u2019s conviction of that crime was reversible on that ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Nor need we address defendant\u2019s challenges to the sentence imposed upon him. We do note, however, the extent to which the judge\u2019s statement of reasons concentrated on defendant\u2019s post-crash conduct. We assume, however, that if defendant is again convicted following a trial at which that conduct will be properly focused, it will be properly taken into account, if at all, by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The conviction appealed from is reversed, and we remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
