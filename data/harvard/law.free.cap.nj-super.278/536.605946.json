Default judgment was entered against Daniels for failure to plead or otherwise defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Ornes was attacked in an alley adjacent to the bakery by Daniels during his working hours under the program. Admission to such program is authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-91.3 and applicable Department of Corrections \u201cguidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In pertinent part, the statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">The commissioner or his duly authorized agent or agents may extend the limits of the place of confinement of a prisoner [to] ... work at paid employment ... in the community on a voluntary basis while continuing as a prisoner of the institution or facility to which he is committed----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-91.3(b) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The guidelines to the program state that purpose of the work-release program is to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">[P]rovide a program in New Jersey correctional institutions whereby selected inmates, prior to parole or expiration of maximum sentence, are released for a daily scheduled period of time to engage in full or part time employment in the community at an approved work opportunity____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Pursuant to the guidelines, both an inmate and an employer must satisfy a number of criteria before inclusion in the work-release program. A potential employer must be evaluated by a prison official for the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">a. Credibility of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-15\">b. Proximity to the institution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-16\">c. Working conditions of the employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-17\">d. Availability of transportation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-18\">e. Training opportunities afforded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-19\">f. Potential hazards to health of the employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>g. Employer\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of Departmental Standards, i.e., workmen\u2019s compensation, minimum wage, etc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">h. Duration of the offered employment and benefits; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">i. Union application and response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The evaluation includes a background check of the potential employer with local police and an on-site inspection of the work-site. The placement \u201cmust provide dignity on the job, treatment that is the same as his/her peers, and the same wages.\u201d Once accepted, an employer is regularly monitored; a process that, according to the guidelines, includes a visit at least once monthly by a prison official to discuss \u201cthe program impact upon the employer, civilian employees and community reaction to the pro-gram____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Marine had been a work-site for approximately eight years before the attack. Daniels had been placed there approximately one month when it occurred. Although the record is unclear as to the terms of any agreement between Marine and the prison, there was deposition testimony that a written contract existed. It appears clear that Marine had no authority to change any program rules and that it was instructed to treat inmates like any other employees. The bakery\u2019s owners had no knowledge as to the background of any inmate in the program, nor were they given input into who was selected for placement at Marine.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Inmates were not permitted to leave the premises of the bakery. If this happened, or if there was any other problem, the bakery was instructed to contact both the local police and the work-release program coordinator. Daniels was discovered to be missing on the same night as the assault. One of Marine\u2019s owners contacted the police and the Southern State Correctional Facility immediately. Shortly before this, police had been informed of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">On appeal, Ornes argues that (1) the State is not entitled to immunity under the Tort Claims Act because it faded to properly perform ministerial acts and duties and because Daniels was not \u201cescaped\u201d at the time of the attack, and (2) that Marine Italian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Bakery is not entitled to derivative immunity because it failed to properly carry out ministerial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Tort Claims Act immunity applicable to the State in this case is provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">a. An injury resulting from the parole or <em>release </em>of a prisoner or from the terms and conditions of his parole or release or from the revocation of his parole or release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">b. any injury caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">(1) an escaping or escaped prisoner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">(2) an escaping or escaped person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-14\">(3) a person resisting arrest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-15\">(4) a prisoner to any other prisoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-16\">(emphasis provided)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2(a) the State enjoys absolute immunity against suits for injuries resulting from an assault committed by an inmate participating in a community work-release program. <em>Burg v. State, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 325, 371 A.2d 308 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>11, 379 A.2d 242 (1977). <em>Compare Flodmand v. Institutions and Agencies Dep\u2019t, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 511-12, 420 A.2d 365 (App.Div.1980) (finding no immunity where inmate still in custody attacked visitor at correctional facility). Ornes\u2019s contention that the State\u2019s tort immunity applies to the results of its decision to implement a work-release program, but not to consequences of its administration of such a program, is without merit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2 makes no such distinction. <em>Burg, supra, </em>at 322, 371 A.2d 308. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the State was immune from suit for Daniel\u2019s attack on Ornes.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Since the State clearly enjoys immunity from suit in this case pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2(a), it is not necessary for us to address Ornes\u2019 argument that Daniels was not an \u201cescaped\u201d prisoner under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2(b) at the time of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">As to the question of Marine\u2019s derivative immunity, we note that a public contractor may share immunity with the State if, while working under the guidance and supervision of a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>entity, the contractor has not deviated independently and negligently from that contract. <em>Rodriguez v. N.J. Sports &amp; Exposition Authority, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>39, 45, 472 A.2d 146 (App.Div.1983), <em>certif. denied, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>291, 475 A.2d 586 (1984); <em>Cobb v. Waddington, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 18, 380 A.2d 1145 (App.Div.1977). A public contractor may be held liable, however, for negligent execution of its contract, as derivative immunity is an affirmative defense for which the contractor bears a burden of both pleading and persuasion. <em>Vanchieri v. New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>80, 87, 514 A.2d 1323 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Derivative immunity is explained in <em>Vanchieri </em>as resting upon two principles. First, the costs of denying immunity would inevitably be passed directly by public contractors to the immunized public entity, rendering meaningless the tort immunity where the contractor was merely doing what it contracted to do. \u201cThe second principle underlying public contractor immunity concerns notions of fairness.\u201d <em>Vanchieri, supra, </em>at 86, 514 A2d 1323. While the facts in <em>Vanchieri </em>concerned the question of innocent compliance with government directions and specifications, we think that the present case must be tested on its own merits within the framework of the <em>Vanchieri </em>tests of increased public cost and inherent fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Marine certified that the only critical obligation imposed under its contract with the prison was to notify it and the police if an inmate disappeared. No contrary proofs were presented. Unlike the <em>Vanchieri </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>cases, the public contractor here was not engaged in the business of providing' security. Marine was not even in the business of contracting with the State to sell its products or services for a profit. Its sole function, as we see it, from the standpoint of public cost, sound public policy and fairness, was to provide inmates designated by the prison with a normal job in a normal work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It would be ironic, and surely unfair, to insulate from liability the institution charged with supervision of prisoners, while exposing a bakery to liability for violent conduct of a prisoner whom it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>has done no more than to employ in accordance with an agreement with the State which has not been shown to impose upon the employer additional supervisory obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Absent specific agreement with the State, employers of work-release programs should not have the responsibility for security. It is apparent that routinely placing liability upon the employer would represent a cost passed on to the State. This appears to us sufficient to meet the first <em>Vanchieri </em>principle. As to the fairness principle, Marine is a bakery, not a warder. Its undertaking of the role of employer should not, under the <em>Vanchieri </em>principles, be interpreted to render meaningless the State\u2019s immunity or to expose Marine as a work-site employer to the costly burden of fulfilling a function not within the limited scope of its undertaking. <em>Compare Black v. Borough of Atlantic Highlands, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 454, 623 A.2d 257 (App.Div.1993) (finding summary judgment inappropriate for independent contractor where record suggested a tenable basis for breach of non-immunized duty.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-20\"> We have been cited to no regulations adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
