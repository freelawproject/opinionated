On the following day the prisoner made two confessions, one to the editor of a newspaper who had called to get any statement which the prisoner might care to make for publication, and the other to the prisoner\u2019s employer who had gone to see him because of a friendly interest. Neither of these persons (said a word to induce the prisoner to confess, and no reference was made to his previous confession, if they knew of it. The sheriff was present when the first two confessions were made, but not at the third.

Before Longenecker, P.

He was a stone mason and had been occupied during the week working at his trade at or near Meyers-dale. On his homeward trip he stopped at Garrett, where he was paid $37.80 for work which he had previously done. During the evening at Berlin he became more or less intoxicated and did not leave until about 11:30 o\u2019clock. Before starting he went into Mr. Dively\u2019s restaurant, where he ate oysters and made a few small purchases, and in paying for them displayed the money he had, which the commonwealth contended was then seen by the defendant and Harry Weller, who together resolved to follow him when he left the town and rob him. Glessner went on foot out of the town to the eastward, over the road leading in the direction of his home. The following morning, between 6 and 7 o\u2019clock he was found lying by the roadside, about one and a half miles out of Berlin, in an unconscious condition, with marks of violence upon his person and the unmistakable evidence of foul play. The money he had during the previous night was gone, except a dime which was found near the spot where he lay, in the public road. His hat and a picket, which he is supposed to have used as a walking stick, also lay near by. Pie was removed to the house of a relative a short distance away and Dr. Shaw was at once called, but he never rallied again and died during the early part of the afternoon. An autopsy, conducted by Dr. Shaw, disclosed the fact that the deceased had been struck several severe blows on the head, one of which produced a blood clot upon the brain which the doctor testified caused death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">District Attorney Meyers: \u201cWe propose to prove by the witness on the stand that a voluntary confession was made by the defendant, Milton Sheets, to him of his participation in this crime, the day after he was arrested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>At this point, at their request, the court permitted the defendant\u2019s counsel to offer to prove that on the evening preceding the interview with witness Lambert, one Eagan, a detective from Pittsburg, had procured a confession from defendant in the same jail, by improperly making promises and holding out inducements to obtain admissions; that the confession to Eagan, made but the evening before the interview with Lambert, was procured by undue means.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">Robert S.

What time of the evening of his arrest did you see Sheets in prison? A. About 9 o\u2019clock. Q. Who were with you to see him? A. The Detective Eagan, and Sheriff Hartzell. Q. Had you known Eagan before that? A. I had been introduced to him. Q. As a detective from where? A. From Pittsburg. Q. Were any others present except you and the detective and the sheriff? A. The defendant was there. Q. Where did you see him? A. I think in the female portion of the jail. Q. State what, if anything, you heard Detective Eagan say to the defendant about making a statement. A. Well, he urged him to tell the truth, and he said, if you do, while I am engaged in hunting up evidence against you, I will do all in my power to save you. Q. Did he state anything as to what would be better or worse for him? A. He told him he knew all about it, and the best thing he could do would be to make a free, frank statement of all that transpired. Previous to that he asked a number of questions. Q. Tell us what the conversation was before Sheets made any statement. A. When we went into the jail Sheets was in bed and the sheriff brought him out and Eagan said, \u2018Milt,'how often did you hit that old man?\u2019 And the defendant said that he had not struck him. He then asked him if he had gone to Ream\u2019s livery stable and secured a bottle, and he said he had not. He then asked him if he had not followed Glessner out the road, and he said he had not. Q. Did he say anything about Weller ? A. Afterwards he did. Q. Before or after he told him what he would do or would be good for him? A. He told him first and Mr. Sheets denied all knowledge of it, then he told him that Weller had told him. He said that he had been engaged to hunt up evidence against him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Cross-examined, by Mr. Meyers: \u201c Q.

Then he asked him if he had not gone to Hearn\u2019s livery stable and procured a bottle, and he said he had not. Then the detective asked him if he had not followed Glessner out the road, and he denied that he had. He asked him if he had not gotten a stick of wood at Swartzendruber\u2019s, and he denied that. The detective then said: \u2018We know all about this; Weller has made a full statement and you might as well tell the truth, and I promise you if you do I will be your friend and do all I can to aid you.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-11\">\u201c Q.

Justos Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Generally where a confession of guilt has been obtained from a prisoner by undue means it will be inferred that a confession of the same or like facts afterward made by him was induced by the same influences; and evidence of a second confession will not be received unless from the length of time intervening, or from proper warning of the consequences of confession or from other circumstances it appears that the influence which led to the first confession has been entirely removed: Wharton\u2019s Grim. Ev. sec. 667; 1 Greenleaf on Ev. sec. 221. But no general rule can define the facts which in all cases should be deemed to have influenced the mind of the prisoner, as matters which would readily affect the mind of one person would have no influence upon that of another. The age, character and situation of the prisoner, and all the circumstances under which the confession was made, are to be taken into consideration, and the question whether the original influence continues to operate must be left largely to the discretion of the trial judge, who hears the testimony, sees the witness and observes the conduct of the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In this ease the first confession was made after the prisoner\u2019s arrest, to a detective, who asked him to make a full statement and promised that if he would do so he would befriend him. Evidence of this confession was not offered. The confessions of which evidence was admitted were made the next day; one to the editor of a newspaper, who knew the prisoner and told him that he had called to get any statement which he might care to make for publication; the other to the employer of the prisoner, who had gone to see him because of a friendly interest. Neither of these persons said a word to induce the prisoner to confess, and no reference was made to his previous confession if they knew of it. The sheriff was present when the first two confessions were made, but not at the third. On neither occasion did he speak to the prisoner, nor did the prisoner speak to him. He acted as a jailor merely in admitting the parties. These confessions were entirely voluntary, and had no connection in thought with the first confession, and we see no reason to believe that they were made under the influence of a hope of personal aid which had been excited by the detective. The evidence was therefore properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The second question raised by the assignments is whether the instructions as to the power and duty of the jury to ascertain the degree of the crime were incorrect or inadequate. The undisputed evidence was that the killing had been committed in the perpetration of robbery. The defense was insanity. In the course of the charge the learned judge read to the jury that part of section 14 of the act of March 31, 1860, which makes such a crime murder of the first degree, but omitted to read that part of the section which makes it the duty of the jury to ascertain the degree. The part read is as follows: \u201c All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison or lying in wait, or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, robbery or burglary shall be deemed murder of the first degree, and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder of the second degree.\u201d The part omitted is: \u201c And the jury before whom any person indicted for murder shall be tried, shall if they find such person guilty thereof, ascertain in their verdict whether it be murder of the first or second degree.\u201d In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>charge it was said: \u201c The commonwealth contends that Glessner\u2019s death resulted from a beating at the hands of the defendant to rob him of his money. If that fact is established by the evidence in this case beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is found that the defendant was at the time responsible for his acts, he should be convicted in the first degree; because in such case the law makes no provision for a verdict of a lower grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">This instruction was in substance repeated several times and the jury were not at any time distinctly told that they had the power to ascertain the degree, and the court was not asked so to instruct them. No question as to the degree of the crime was raised at the trial. The jury returned a verdict of \u201c Guilty in manner and form in which he stands indicted.\u201d They were sent back with this instruction: \u201c Gentlemen, we will ask you to retire and specify the degree in your verdict. It is a general verdict; you must state the degree. A verdict of \u2018 Guilty in manner and form in which he stands indicted \u2019 could not be received, so you will retire to your room again and state the degree. The indictment is for murder generally, but the jury must state the degree in which you find the defendant guilty.\u201d They then returned a verdict of <em>\u201c </em>Guilty of murder of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">While the statute defines the degree, it is made the exclusive duty of the jury by their verdict to ascertain it, and fit is the right of the prisoner to have it ascertained by them. In Rhodes v. Com., 48 Pa. 396, it was held to be error to instruct the jury that if they found the prisoner guilty they must state in their verdict that he was guilty of murder of the first degree. But it was said in the opinion that it would not have been error to have instructed them that the crime proved was murder of the first degree; the error was in compelling them so to find. This ruling was affirmed and followed in Lane v. Com., 59 Pa. 371, but it was said by Thompson, C. J. \u201c . . . . nor are we to be understood as finding fault with the practice which is entirely proper of judges freely advising jurors as to the duty of ascertaining that degree of murder toward which the facts seem to point, always leaving them however free to deliberate upon, and the duty and responsibility of finding the degree, if they convict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In Shaffner v. Com., 72 Pa. 60, the instruction assigned for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>error was : <em>\u201c </em>If the prisoner is guilty there can be no difficulty in ascertaining the degree, for being by poison it must be in the first degree, if purposely administered;\u2014if you are convinced he is guilty of the crime, it is murder of the first degree as fixed by the act of assembly, and it is your duty so to say without regard to the consequences to the prisoner.\u201d This was said to approach the boundary line of peremptoriness, but not to be error. In McMeen v. Com., 114 Pa. 300, the jury were instructed: \u201c If the defendant murdered his wife by means of poison it would be murder in the first degree, and the jury needs neither definition nor instruction in regard to any other kind of homicide. If you find the defendant sent the poison to his wife with the intent to take her life, then the law says that is murder in the first degree, and you should say so in your verdict. If you fail to find such guilty intent then acquit the defendant.\u201d This was held to be a correct instruction. In these cases and many others the distinction is drawn between a proper statement of the law and a binding instruction to the jury which takes from them the ascertainment of the degree. An imperative instruction which takes from the jury their right to ascertain the degree is erroneous, but one which points out to them their duty under the law, but leaves them free to act, is not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">There was then no error in the instruction given, and we need only consider whether the charge was inadequate in not informing the jury of their power in fixing the degree. That part of the 74th section of the act of 1860, which defines murder of the second degree was read to the jury; and after having returned a general verdict they were sent back to fix the degree, and distinctly told that they must state in their verdict the degree of which they found the prisoner guilty. If the whole of the section had been read it is conceded that no further instruction would have been required, and the only ground of the exception is that it was not all read. The jury were told all that the omitted part of the section contains, and they would have known no more of their power in the matter if it had all been read. They were informed by the part read that there were two degrees of murder, and after returning a general verdict of guilty they were instructed to state in their verdict the degree of which they found the prisoner guilty. In this instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>no mandatory direction having been given, their power to fix the degree was necessarily implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The real ground of defense was the insanity of the prisoner and under the undisputed evidence the verdict should have been either guilty of the first degree or not guilty on the ground of insanity. The case was so treated at the trial. There was no suggestion in the points for charge that there could be a verdict of the second degree. If more specific instructions were desired they should have been asked for. \"Where the evidence shows unmistakably that there should be a conviction of the higher degree of murder, or of murder instead of manslaughter, the omission of the court to give instructions as to the lower grade when not requested to do so, has been held not to be error, if the jury have been left free to fix the grade of the crime: Brown v. Com., 76 Pa. 319; Nevling v. Com., 98 Pa. 322; Clark v. Com., 123 Pa. 555; Com. v. Crossmire, 156 Pa. 304; Com. v. Hollinger, 190 Pa. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The judgment is affirmed, and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court of oyer and terminer of Somerset county in order that the sentence may be carried into execution according to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
