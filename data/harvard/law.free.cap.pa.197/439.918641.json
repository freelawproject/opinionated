Bruce, while in the employment of the defendant in constructing a bridge over the Ohio River, was injured by the negligent act of Oliver Weigle, another employee of the defendant, in permitting a piece of timber to fall upon Bruce\u2019s head. Weigle went into the defendant\u2019s employment in July, 1896, and while there was evidence that he had a reputation for carelessness and awkwardness, it did not appear that the defendant company had any knowledge of his reputation. There was proof that Weigle was somewhat nervous, and that he exercised more than ordinary care in clambering over the bridge, and that in crossing on a beam or girder he would sometimes get down on his hands and knees. The specific act which caused the accident was the only one of the kind ever shown to have occurred on the part of Weigle. The court entered a compulsory non-suit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\"><em>jError assigned </em>was in refusing to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-11\"><em>Robert Ritehie, </em>with him <em>John M. </em>Buchanan, <em>William A.

No act of incompetency on the part of Weigle previous to the act complained of was shown, and it was not claimed prior to that time that any incompetency on his part was suggested or known to the defendant. All of his previous acts evinced care on his part, and could not well be considered as proof of incompetency in the performance of the duties pertaining to the work to which he was called. It follows from the evidence in the case that the defendant was not properly chargeable with negligence in employing him. That he used more than ordinary care in the performance of the work to which he was assigned was no evidence of incompetency. Nor did such care at any'time impose additional liability on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
