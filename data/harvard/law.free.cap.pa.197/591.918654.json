Samuel Hazlett had sole and exclusive control of the business, and the bank was known as Samuel Hazlett\u2019s bank. From January 1, 1866, to April 1, 1881, the business was conducted in a building owned by the partners and inherited by them from Samuel Hazlett, Sr., who died November 7,1863. After April 1, 1881, and up to March 19, 1898, when the bank was closed, the business was conducted in a building erected and owned by Samuel Hazlett individually. On March 31, 1898, Samuel Hazlett made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, by virtue of which all the assets of the bank went into the hands of his assignees, and the assigned estate is now in process of settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-8\">3. Mrs. Sarah Hazlett, the mother, died December 10, 1873; Mary E. Hazlett married Joseph Brown, December 21, 1865, and she and her husband are both still living; Sarah H. Vo well, who married Stewart B. Vowell, September 22, 1859, died on July 7, 1886, and was buried in the Washington, Pa., cemetery, her husband is still living; Margaret Hazlett married Dr. Wray Grayson, of Washington, Pa., December 27, 1877, and lived with him in Washington, Pa., until January 00, 1899, when he died. Robert W. Hazlett, who had for many years lived in Wheeling, W. Va., died at his home since this suit was instituted. Mrs. Brown and her husband have lived in Pittsburg, Pa., for many years, and Mrs. Vowell and her husband lived in Chicago, 111.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-9\">4. Up to July 1, 1877, the profits and losses of the banking business were divided between the partners every six months, as provided in the partnership agreement, and Samuel Hazlett charged up his salary as part of the expenses of the concern. After that date all the profits were taken and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>credited to Samuel Hazlett individually, and lie drew no salary, as is shown by his \u201c profit and loss account book.\u201d Presumably all the partners except Samuel Hazlett withdrew from the business and firm at or about that time, but there is nothing in the plaintiff\u2019s case that shows that an actual settlement between the partners was made then or at any subsequent time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">5. From March 2 to October 18, 1897, at different dates, John H. Little deposited in the bank sums of money aggregating over $21,000, and took from Samuel Hazlett therefor certificates of deposit in the form following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-6\">\u201c$3,000.

Robert W. Hazlett having died since the suit was brought, the jury was sworn as to the three remaining defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-10\">6. John H. Little in 1866 had a conversation with Samuel Hazlett in which he was told by Samuel Hazlett that he and his brother and sisters had gone into the banking business, and was then solicited to open an account with them. Again, some time between 1866 and 1872, in another conversation with Samuel Hazlett, the same information was given him. In 1872 Mr. Little opened an account in the bank and was one of its patrons from that time until it closed. He never had any conversations with either Mrs. Grayson or Mrs. Brown, and was never given any actual notice that the firm had been dissolved. He knew of the marriage of Margaret Hazlett to Dr. Wray Grayson, and knew that Mrs. Brown was a married woman, but did not learn of the death of Mrs. Yowell until lately, and never knew that Mrs. Hazlett was a member of the firm. He was not told by Samuel Hazlett that the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>was to terminate at the end of ten years, and did not know that the partnership contract was in writing until shortly before he brought this suit. During the twenty years between 1877 and 1897 when he did business with the bank and made deposits therein, he gave no thought to the fact that Margaret Grayson and Mary E. Brown were or had been partners, or that their marriage or their being members of the firm in any way affected his security as a depositor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-5\">THE LAW OE THE CASE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-6\">1. Let us inquire into the nature of a partnership contract, and the relation a firm and the individual members of a firm sustain to its creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-7\">\u201c Partnership is a contract of two or more persons to place their money, effects, labor and skill or some or all of them in lawful commerce or business and to divide the profits and bear the loss in certain proportions.\u201d \u201c The two leading principles of the contract are a common interest in the stock of the company and a personal responsibility for the partnership engagements.\u201d 3 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 24. If a firm makes a contract whereby it becomes indebted to a stranger to the partnership, the result is that not only the property of the firm, but the separate estate of each individual member of the firm can be taken to satisfy the firm creditor. Each individual member of a firm in a sense is- its surety, and assumes a personal responsibility for its engagements when he or she enters into the partnership contract. Hence, as stated in Story on Partnership, \u201c persons who enter into the partnership shall be of sound mind, sui juris and capable of making contracts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-8\">The case at bar is an illustration of this principle. Samuel Hazlett, the active member of the firm, that it is alleged he represented when he made the certificates sued upon, prior to the time the suit was instituted made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors and turned over all the assets of the bank, including its- entire capital stock, to his assignees. John H. Little, the creditor holding these certificates, believing that the assets of the bank would not pay him and the other creditors in full, brought this suit to enforce his claim against the individual members of the firm and to take in execution the property that belongs to them individually. It is not a suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>prosecuted for the purpose of taking in execution the property of the alleged partnership, that is already in the hands of the law; it is the separate estate of these two married women that he is after, and he can only succeed upon the assumption that their contract to be personally responsible for the engagements of the firm is valid and binding upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-5\">That brings us to the second question, and that is, could a married woman make a partnership contract in Pennsylvania prior to the passage of the Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332, so as to make her personally responsible for the firm\u2019s engagements ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">In considering this question we must be careful to properly limit the scope of our inquiry. It may be conceded that a married woman\u2019s contract of partnership will, under certain circumstances, be sustained. Neither the party or parties with whom she contracts, nor strangers to the contract, can set up her disability to her disadvantage and to their own gain. The rule which incapacitates a married woman from entering into a contract is for her benefit and protection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-7\">In Silveus\u2019s Executors v. Porter, 74 Pa. 448, the creditors of the husband of a married woman who was a member of a partnership undertook to take her property to pay his debts. The Supreme Court held that what was earned for her under the contract of partnership was the property of the wife, and not liable for the husband\u2019s debts. The contest was between the wife and her husband\u2019s creditors, and clearly they could not set up her disability to make a partnership contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-8\">In Endlich &amp; Richards on the Rights and Liabilities of Married Women, at sec. Ill, cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in support of their claim that a married woman could enter into a partnership contract, the authors recognize the distinction between a married woman enforcing her rights under a partnership contract against her husband\u2019s creditors, and third parties enforcing their claims against her under such a contract. In the last paragraph of the section they say: \u201c But whether she can be held under her covenant of partnership to the ordinary liabilities of partners is another question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-9\">Again, it may be conceded that the money contributed by a married woman to the capital stock of a firm of which she is a member, as well as her share of the undistributed profits, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>they pass to an assignee for the benefit of the creditors of the firm under an assignment made by a member of the firm authorized to make such an assignment, will go to the creditors and cannot be claimed by her on the ground that the partnership contract was void by reason of her coverture; or it may be conceded that a copartner of a married woman, under the right of each partner to apply firm assets to the payment of its liabilities, may subject the joint or firm property to levy and sale in discharge of partnership indebtedness by giving a judgment note therefor in the name of the firm, and thus take from her on her partnership contract the money she put into the capital stock of the firm, and that she would not be allowed in equity and good conscience to have such a judgment set <em>aside; </em>but these concessions as to the rights and limited liability of a married woman under a contract of partnership into which she has entered are not decisive of the question before us, namely, is a married woman who is a member of a partnership, as Chancellor Kent puts it, supra, \u201c personally responsible for partnership engagements.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-5\">Under the facts in this case, the law to which we must look for a solution of this question is the common law as modified by our act of April 11, 1848, relative to the rights of married women. The contract dated November 27,1865, fixed the term of the partnership at ten years from January 1, 1866. If, on January 1, 1876, it was agreed by and between the partners to continue the partnership and it was not by reason of that agreement terminated at that time, then the agreement thus entered into by Mary E. Brown would be an agreement entered into by a married woman, and her liabilities would be fixed as of that date. If the partnership was still in force on December 27, 1877, the date of Margaret Hazlett\u2019s marriage to Dr. Grayson, it would be dissolved by her marriage, and unless after her marriage it was agreed to continue it, it was not in existence when this suit was <em>brought; </em>and if after her marriage she agreed to continue it, then her contract and how it would be affected by the fact that she was a married woman would be adjudged under the law as it stood at the time of her marriage, December 27, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-6\">Again, if the partnership had by the agreement of the parties been extended beyond the period of ten years from 1866, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>was in existence on July 7, 1886, it was then dissolved by the death of Sarah H. Vowell; and in 1897, when the certificates sued on were made, Mrs. Mary E. Brown and Mrs. Margaret Grayson were not partners of Samuel Hazlett, unless on July 7, 1886, after the death of Mrs. Vowell they, Samuel and Robert, agreed to continue the partnership, and at that date a married woman\u2019s rights and disabilities were fixed by the common law as modified by the act of 1848. To repeat: the partnership proven by the plaintiff terminated by its own term January 1, 1876 ; if then continued by agreement, it was again terminated by the marriage of Margaret Hazlett, December 27, 1877; if then again continued by agreement, it was again terminated by the death of Mrs. Sarah H. Vowell, July 7,1886; and if it was in existence in 1897, it was again continued by the agreement of the parties after Mrs. Vo well\u2019s death. On January 1,1876, December 27, 1877, and July 7, 1886, Mary E. Brown was a married woman, and on December 27,1877, and on July 7,1886, Margaret Grayson was a married woman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-4\">Now, let us see what was the law as to the liabilities of married women before the passage of the act of June 3,1887 : \u201c At common law generally all contracts, agreements, covenants, promises and representations of married women were absoluto!y null and void at law and in equity. The grounds of their invalidity were that a married woman had no legal existence, being merged in her husband, and that she had no consenting capacity, as she was under the power and control of her husband and his wish was her law. The common-law rule .... still so far exists that any capacity of a married woman to contract is regarded as exceptional, and the ground thereof must be alleged and proved by one setting it up: \u201d 14 Am. &amp; Eng.

That the plaintiff has not shown that Margaret Grayson and Mary E. Brown were partners of Samuel Hazlett when he signed the certificate of deposit sued upon; on the contrary the fact that the term, of the original partnership was fixed at ten years, which expired January 1, 1876, the fact that Mrs. Sarah Hazlett died in 1873 and Sarah Yowell in 1886, the fact that Mary E. Hazlett married in 1865 and Margaret Hazlett in 1877, the fact that Margaret Grayson never shared in profits and losses after July 1,1877, and that Samuel Hazlett\u2019s \u201cprofit and loss \u201d account book shows that after July 1, 1877, he took all the profits and ceased to charge the expense side of the account with the salary that the partnership contract allowed him, the fact that he moved into a building of his own, specially built for banking purposes, in 1881, and for sixteen years occupied it, doing business in his own name, and the fact that he had not spoken to his brother for many years, taken together would support an affirmative finding that Mary E. Brown and Margaret Grayson were not partners with Samuel Hazlett and Robert W. Hazlett in 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-6\">2. That the evidence does not show, expressly or by implication, that the plaintiff, John H. Little, had in his mind that Margaret Grayson, Mary E. Brown and Robert <em>W. </em>Hazlett were partners of Samuel Hazlett in 1897, when he received his certificates of deposit, and it does not show that he had a right under the law to presume that they were partners at that time; on the contrary, he was bound under the law and facts as he knew them to presume that the partnership entered into January 1,1866, was dissolved; and there is no evidence in the case to show that a new partnership had been entered into by the four defendants against whom he has brought suit, or that they ever agreed to continue the business as surviving partners after the death of Mrs. Sarah H. Yowell under this old agreement, or that they ever agreed to continue the business after the dissolution caused by the marriage of Margaret Hazlett in December, 1877; the evidence and the fair and logical inferences that can be drawn therefrom, clearly show that the plaintiff\u2019s action is based upon an afterthought; the thought was not present in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>his mind when he made his deposits in 1897 that Mrs. Grayson and Mrs. Brown were jointly liable with Samuel Hazlett, but after an unsuccessful effort to get Samuel Hazlett to pay his claim at a heavy discount and after he saw for the first time the written contract of partnership, the thought came to him that thirty years before Samuel Hazlett had told him of these silent partners, and the further thought came to him that he had had no actual notice from Mrs. Grayson and Mrs. Brown that this partnership had been dissolved, upon these two facts, a recollection of which came to him nine months after the bank closed, his suit is evidently founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">3. That even if Mrs. Grayson and Mrs. Brown did agree to continue the business after the marriage of Margaret Hazlett in 1877, and after the death of Mrs. Yowell in 1886, being then married women, their agreement cannot be enforce! against them in this action, the purpose of which is not to reach the firm assets, but to take in execution their individual estate in satisfaction of a personal obligation that arose out of their implied agreement that they would pay the certificates of deposit, which Samuel Hazlett alone signed and which are the basis of this action, if the firm did not pay them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-6\">And now, January 11, 1900, motion to lift compulsory non-suit refused, exception noted and bill sealed for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b631-8\"><em>II. W. </em>Irwin, with him <em>John Q. </em>Bane, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ail\">\u2014Prior to the passage of the acts of 1887 and 1893, a married woman could be a partner with any one except her husband, but her separate estate was not liable for the debts of the partnership. Since the passage of the acts of 1887 and 1893, a married woman may contract with reference to her separate estate and business, and may bind herself as fully and completely as if she were not married. It follows, therefore, that she may be a member of a partnership, and that she is personally responsible for all debts created by the partnership of which she is a member: Silveus v. Porter, 74 Pa. 448; Brooks v. Merchants\u2019 Nat. Bank, 125 Pa. 394.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-9\">If she could be a partner, independent of the question of her personal liability for the debts, then it follows that the marriage of Mrs. Grayson did not dissolve the partnership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>It is claimed, however, that the death of Mrs. Vowell was legal notice to the plaintiff of the dissolution of the firm. We readily concede the general rule that death dissolves a partnership, and that it is notice to all the world, but we maintain that this rule applies only to actions against the estate of the deceased partner; and there is a good reason why the rule should apply in such a case, because the partner is gone and cannot give notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-5\">Under the act of June 8, 1898, a married woman, who is a member of a partnership, is entitled to the same rights and subject to the same liabilities as any other partner: Loeb v. Mellinger &amp; Co., 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-6\">The evidence shows that the partnership was continued beyond the period of ten years limited in the articles of copartnership. The plaintiff having shown this fact, the presumption is that the partnership continued and the burden was upon the defendants to show a dissolution: Plumer v. Lord, 87 Mass. 460; Bitter v. Rathman, 61 N. Y. 512; Abbott v. Jackson, 48 Ark. 212; Kutcher v. Williams, 40 N. J. Eq. 436 ; Wieman v. Anderson, 42 Pa. 317; Bates on Partnership, sec. 588; 1 Bindley on Partnership, sec. 84; Vail v. Winterstein, 94 Mich. 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-7\">The question, whether a married woman could be a member of a partnership prior to the act of 1887, is settled by this court in Brooks v. Merchants\u2019 Nat. Bank, 125 Pa. 394.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-8\"><em>JD. F. Patterson, </em>with him <em>John W. A. Donnan </em>and <em>Henry M.

McClimans, 24 Pa. 367 ; Bear v. Bear, 33 Pa. 525; Stebbins v. Crawford County, 92 Pa. 289; Heugh v. Jones, 32 Pa. 433; Glyde v.

It is of a public not a private nature, and hence no notice is necessary: 2 Bates on Partnership, sec. 610.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-11\">Where no time is fixed for its dissolution, either party may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>dissolve it at his pleasure, and unless there be an express stipulation to the contrary, it is dissolved by the death of either party: Gratz v. Bayard, 11 S. &amp; R. 41; Shipe\u2019s App., 114 Pa. 207 ; Marlett v. Jackman, 85 Mass. 287 ; Eustis v.

Brown and Margaret Grayson, and refused on the motion of J. H. Little, plaintiff, to take it off. The result of the trial was a verdict of the jury in favor of J. H. Little, plaintiff, and against Samuel Hazlett, defendant, for the sum of $24,086.61. The facts ascertained by the court and included in its opinion are conceded by the appellant\u2019s counsel to be substantially correct. No question of inaccuracy or insufficiency in the facts as found is raised, and on this branch of the case no special consideration is required. It therefore remains to determine whether the court below erred in entering and refusing to take off the compulsory nonsuit. A careful examination and consideration of the decisions relating to the question involved has satisfied us that the court below committed no error in refusing to set aside the compulsory nonsuit, and in determining that no cause of action was shown against Mary E. Brown and Margaret Gray-son. We therefore dismiss the assignment of error and base our affirmance of the judgment on the able opinion of the learned court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
