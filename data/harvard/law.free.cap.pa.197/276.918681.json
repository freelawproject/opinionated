Upon November 6, 1869, the Germania Life Insurance Company of New York, one of the defendants, issued this policy, No. 25,174, on the life of William Guckert for $3,000, which was fully paid up on November 6, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-17\">2. Thereafter, by one or more assignments in writing and attached to the policy, the title to the same became vested in Mm. Catherine Guckert, the wife of said William Guckert,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>3. On or about November 25, 1897, Mrs. Catherine Guckert made a gift of said policy to Ella May Hani, the plaintiff herein, who was her daughter by a former marriage, by delivering the policy to her, and declaring that she gave it to her to be her own, but without any written assignment, and her daughter accepted the same, took possession of the policy, and has had possession thereof ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">4. Mrs. Catherine Guckert was at that time very ill and confined to her room, if not to her bed, but appears to have been of sound mind, and to have been fully aware of what she was doing, and the evidence discloses that she had before that time expressed an intention of making such a gift, and after that time declared that she had made it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">5. Mrs. Catherine Guckert died on March 31, 1898, leaving to survive her her husband, William Guckert, and her daughter, the plaintiff, Ella May Hani, and letters of administration were granted to the husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-7\">CONCLUSIONS ON LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-8\">There can be no question that a parol gift accompanied by delivery of such a security or instrument as a paid-up policy of insurance is valid, and the plaintiff is, therefore, so far as the parties to this bill are concerned, the owner of the policy, and is entitled to a decree that the evidence taken herein should be filed and become matter of record, and remain in perpetuam reimemoriam; that the policy belongs to her, and that the defendants should be enjoined from doing anything with the policy inconsistent with her ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-9\">Let a decree be drawn accordingly, costs to be paid by the defendant, Wm.

If the gift was imperfect, equity will not enforce it: Smith\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 428.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">The policy called for a written assignment. Mrs. Guekert knew this, for in this manner she had received it.

The mother of the plaintiff, who was her only daughter, was the owner of the policy, and some months before her death made a parol gift of it to her. The gift was supported by the testimony of two witnesses whose competency and truthfulness were not successfully assailed. The donor, after her delivery of the policy, declared that she had given it to her daughter, and her declaration was sustained by another witness. Besides, she had previously declared her intention to make the gift. The testimony supporting the gift and the testimony in contradiction of it, together with all the circumstances connected with and surrounding the case were carefully considered by the learned court below and held to be in accordance with the donee\u2019s contention. Our own conclusion, founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>upon a due consideration of* all the testimony is in harmony with the conclusion arrived at by the learned court below. Further comment on this branch of the case is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">It seems formerly to have been the doctrine that the gift of a chose in action unless by some document payable to bearer, required an assignment or some equivalent transfer, and that the transfer must be actually executed. It is now held with substantial unanimity that a written assignment is not necessary in such cases, and that a delivery of a chose in action under such circumstances as would constitute a gift of property in possession amounts to an equitable assignment of the property represented, which the courts will recognize and uphold. Thus the delivery of a bond, certificate of stock or note to the donee, with the intention of transferring to him the right of property, is sufficient to constitute a gift: 8 Am. &amp; Eng. Eney. of Law, 1822. A. delivered to his niece living with him a certificate for ten shares of the stock of an insurance company standing in his own name, stating that he made her a present of it. After-wards the company issued forty shares additional stock representing surplus earnings. These he delivered to his niece saying they were hers. The dividends were drawn by A. till his death, but whether he paid them over to the niece or whether she knew anything about them did not appear. Held, that the delivery of the certificates with an intention to pass the title amounted to an equitable assignment of the shares which a court of equity would uphold: Reed v. Copeland, 50 Conn. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Some of our own cases which are relevant to and sustain the conclusion arrived at by the learned court below may be properly referred to herein: Madeira\u2019s Appeal, 17 W. N. C. 202; Malone\u2019s App., 38 Leg. Int. 303; Com. v. Crompton, 137 Pa. 138, and cases cited therein; Pryor v. Morgan, 170 Pa. 568; Wise\u2019s App., 182 Pa. 168. These cases constitute a sufficient answer to any intimation from the defendant of error in the conclusion assailed by the second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
