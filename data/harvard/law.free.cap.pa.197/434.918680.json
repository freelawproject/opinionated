Wilson, 1T2 Pa. 30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">The facts of the case are stated in the opinion of Reed, P. J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-10\">In December, 1883, Tobias Painter conveyed, by quitclaim deed, to the defendants a tract of land in Eldred township, Jefferson county, containing 141 acres more or less. The consideration for this conveyance was $500 cash, and $4,000, secured by a mortgage upon the land conveyed, payable when the title to said land \u201c has been thoroughly tested by said first parties (defendants), and proven to be a good and perfect title, the said title beingin dispute and claimed by Marvin, Rulofson &amp; Company. If said title should prove to be not a good and perfect title, the said first parties (defendants), are not to pay the said $4,000.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-11\">In order to test the validity of the title to the land conveyed, the defendants brought an action of ejectment against Marvin, Rulofson &amp; Company, in ease No. 124, of February term, 1884, which is still pending and undetermined. The present action has been brought to enforce payment of the mortgage mentioned, and the defendants have interposed as a defense thereto that the title to the land conveyed is still in dispute, and, therefore, that the action has been prematurely brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-12\">The plaintiff makes no complaint regarding the time which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>has elapsed since the action of ejectment was instituted by the defendants, and the question of whether the defendants have acted with due diligence and in good faith in making a thorough test of the title is not before us. The plaintiff\u2019s allegation is that the title has been thoroughly tested and proven to be a good and perfect title. It is sought to sustain this allegation on two grounds: (1) That it has been so determined by the Supreme Court in the action of ejectment referred to, and (2) by a disclaimer of title filed of record in said action by the defendants therein. If either of these contentions can be sustained, it is conceded that this action to recover said sum of $4,000 has been properly brought. But the defendants deny that the title to said land has been settled in either of the ways suggested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">From an inspection of the record in the action of ejectment it appears that the plaintiffs therein, (and defendants here), secured a verdict for the land in dispute. On appeal to the Supreme Court, however, the judgment of the lower court was reversed generally, and a venire facias de novo awarded. It is true Mr. Justice Williams, in delivering the opinion of the court, indicates that the Tobias Painter tax title, which he conveyed to the defendants, is a good and perfect title, and that he also states, commenting upon whether the court below erred in gmng a binding instruction for the plaintiffs, that \u201cfor so much of the land as was north of an extension of the north line of the Smith survey or the McNaughton line, a binding instruction was entirely proper, but for so much as was south of that line the right of the plaintiffs depended upon what the jury might find the fact to be as to the character of that line.\u201d But it is to be observed that the Supreme Court did not direct the court below to enter judgment for the plaintiffs for the land lying north of the \u201c extension of the north line of the Smith survey or the McNaughton line,\u201d and this for the very evident reason that it did not appear that there was any of the land in dispute north of that line. Whether there is of not will depend <em>\u201c </em>upon what a jury may find the fact to be as to the location of the McNaughton line.\u201d Moreover, the opinion of the Supreme Court, on the facts as presented on the trial, that the tax title was a good and perfect title to whatever land, if any, it covered, is only significant in the event that the situation does not change on another trial. There is nothing in this, however, to estop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>or prevent the defendants in that case, on another trial, from showing new or additional facts wholly destructive of that title. The opinion is advisory, but not conclusive on the question of title, and since no judgment has been entered in the case the question of whether the title is a good and perfect one still remains open and undetermined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">The contention that the defendants in the ejectment case have filed a disclaimer, and thereby have established the validity of the Tobias Painter title seems to have been an afterthought. No reference is made to it in the precipe and suggestion filed for issuing the writ of scire facias on the mortgage, and consequently nothing is said about it in the affidavit of defense. But an examination will show that this disclaimer is not of such a character as to warrant us in entering judgment against the defendants on this rule. The disclaimer is only for a part of the land in dispute. We are unable to determine from the paper itself how much, but it was stated on the argument, by the attorney who filed it for Marvin, Rulofson &amp; Company, that it only covers about twenty acres off the north end of the tract. If that be true, and, if it be admitted that the Tobias Painter title to that extent has been thereby proven to be a good and perfect title, the plaintiff would not be entitled, on this showing, to recover the full amount of the mortgage. The difference in the quantity of land conveyed and that for which the vendor\u2019s title has been thus established would be so great that a deduction in the price or amount to be paid would undoubtedly be allowed. The dicta on this subject are so numerous as to be authoritative, and are thus summed up by Mr. Justice Shaiiswood in Kreiter v. Bomberger, 82 Pa. 63: \u201c There are indeed many dicta that the difference in the quantity may be so great as to be evidence itself of fraud or deceit or of great misapprehension between the parties, and then equity will relieve. Though no case is to be found of an actual application of the doctrine in favor of the vendee, or to show what must be the extent of the difference to raise the presumption, yet perhaps it may be fairly conceded, that in an action to enforce the payment of the purchase money, a deduction under such circumstances will be allowed. Such is the weight of extra judicial opinions: Boar v. McCormick, 1 S. &amp; R. 166 ; Glen v. Glen, 4 S. &amp; R. 488; Bailey v. Snyder, 13 S. &amp; R. 160; McDowell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>v. Cooper, 14 S. &amp; R. 296; Ashcom v. Smith, 2 P. &amp; W. 219; Frederick v. Campbell, 13 S. &amp; R. <em>136; </em>Haggerty v. Fagan, 2 P. &amp; W. 533; Coughenour\u2019s Admrs. v. Stauft, 77 Pa. 191. See Griswold v. Gebbie, 126 Pa. 353.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">A careful examination of the grounds suggested for bringing and maintaining this action leads us to the conclusion that they are not well founded, and therefore, that the action has been prematurely brought. The rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is accordingly discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-7\"><em>George E.

The learned court below in a clear and comprehensive opinion showed that the affidavit was sufficient to prevent judgment. In this conclusion we all concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
