Before Criswell, P.

It was not disputed that prior to December 29, 1866, title was in W. H. Adams, who on that day conveyed the lots to J. R. Patterson &amp; Company in fee simple. The deed did not show who composed the firm of J. R. Patterson &amp; Company. The evidence was uncontradicted that J. R. Patterson died on January 18, 1868. On July 19, 1886, judgment was entered on a judgment note bearing date July 23, 1881, purporting to have been given by J. R. Patterson &amp; Company to <em>W. </em>J. Kountz for $3,950. Plaintiff claimed under a sale on execution issued on this judgment. The court gave binding instructions for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

That it was for a partnership debt must be presumed : Evans v. Watts, 192 Pa. 112; Morris v. Wallace, 3 Pa. 319; Grier v. Hood, 25 Pa. 430; Miller v. Royal Flint Glass Works, 172 Pa. 70; Boyd v.

Patterson being the only defendant named upon the record in the judgment entered to No. 206, April term, 1886, and he having died long prior to the entry of said judgment and many years before the date of the note on which such judgment was confessed, the judgment so entered was absolutely void as to him, and his name must be stricken from the record, and if so stricken from the record the judgment would only remain against the \u201c &amp; Co.,\u201d a name too indefinite to sustain a judgment: McConnell v.

Whether its title under the tax deeds was good or not is not material until plaintiff has shown at least a prima facie title in himself. This he failed to do. He claims under a sale on execution against J. R. Patterson &amp; Company in 1886, on a judgment founded on a note made in 1881. It is admitted that title to the land was in J. R. Patterson &amp; Company in 1866, but defendant gave uncontradicted evidence that the Patterson who as individual or as one of a firm owned the land in 1866, died in 1868. The judgment on which plaintiff\u2019s title rested was therefore either void because entered against a dead man, or was against a different J. R. Patterson from the one to whom the land was conveyed bjr Adams in 1866. In either case plaintiff\u2019s title failed even against one who held the bare possession. The tax sale deeds put in evidence by defendant were superfluous ones, but their admission did plaintiff no harm. On the undisputed evidence plaintiff showed no title in himself and the verdict was properly for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
