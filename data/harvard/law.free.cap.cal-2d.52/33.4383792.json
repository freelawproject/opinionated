They fixed the penalty on each murder count at death and found that defendant was sane at the time of every offense. On this appeal from the ensuing judgment and an order denying a new trial, defendant attacks the M\u2019Naughton rule by which California measures the insanity which renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>a person incapable of crime<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and urges this court \u201cto re-examine the existing test in California for determining criminal responsibility and to update its thinking and rulings on said subject.\u201d We are not convinced that it is necessary or proper for us to undertake this task.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">At the trial on the pleas of not guilty defendant introduced no evidence. The prosecution evidence, which includes extrajudicial declarations of defendant, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Defendant, 33 years old and of no particular occupation or fixed abode, met Butler (victim of counts 3 and 4, the felonious assaults) for the first time on Los Angeles\u2019 \u201cskid row\u201d on November 16, 1956. At defendant\u2019s suggestion they visited bars and drank beer, for which defendant paid. According to Butler, in one of the bars defendant handed Butler $5.00 as a loan offered by defendant when he learned that Butler was without funds; according to defendant, he produced the $5.00 when Butler agreed to defendant\u2019s request that they indulge in a homosexual relationship. They walked to defendant\u2019s hotel room and there drank whiskey. According to Butler, he then for the first time realized that defendant was interested in a homosexual relationship; according to defendant, Butler refused to perform his agreement. Butler ran from the room. Defendant chased him for two or three blocks and demanded and received the $5.00. When Butler refused to return to the hotel room defendant stabbed him once in the abdomen with a hunting knife. Defendant assisted Butler to the lobby of defendant\u2019s hotel. Butler testified that \u201cIt was just getting dark\u201d and, in explanation of his failure to call for help when he was attacked on the street, that it \u201cseems there was nobody around or nobody that would have done any good at all until I got in the lobby. \u2019 \u2019 There Butler shouted for help. While the hotel clerk was calling the police defendant knocked Butler to the floor and kicked him twice, breaking his collarbone. Defendant fled from the hotel and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Much of the hereinafter recounted detail as to defendant\u2019s conduct is taken from recordings of his extrajudicial statements. For 10 days after the assaults on Butler, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>wandered about <em>Los Angeles </em>and nearby cities. On November 26, 1956, on a street in Long Beach, defendant for the first time met John Berg (victim of count 2, murder). Defendant was annoyed by Berg\u2019s homosexual approach, but went with Berg to his apartment in order to obtain a place to sleep. During the night Berg \u201ckept pestering\u201d defendant with homosexual attentions. In the morning defendant was awakened by Berg \u201cstill fooling around\u201d and stabbed him once in the abdomen and six times in the throat with a knife which defendant described as \u201cHunting knife. Ninety-eight cents. Favorite knife. Very cheap and very good. ... I\u2019ve gone through about three of them knives.\u201d Defendant washed, searched the apartment for money without success, dressed in a suit of Berg, and departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Defendant went to San Diego, then returned to the Los Angeles area. On November 29, 1956, defendant saw 10-year-old Lawrence Rice (victim of count 1, murder) playing on the Ocean Park beach. Defendant bought the boy soft drinks and hamburgers and walked with him along the beach and under the Santa Monica pier. There defendant stabbed the boy several times in the abdomen and about 18 times in the back. Some of the wounds were inflicted before and some after defendant pulled down the child\u2019s trousers and underclothes and pulled up his shirt. Defendant slashed the boy\u2019s left buttock and departed. He took a bus to Los Angeles and returned to \u201cskid row.\u201d There, on the afternoon of November 29, 1956, he came to the attention of the police because he happened to be present when they made an arrest unconnected with defendant. When defendant so came to their attention, the officers detained him, cheeked their records, and found that there was a warrant for his arrest for the Butler assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On the trial of the general issue three court-appointed physicians who were experienced in psychiatry and who had examined defendant (Dr. Marcus Crahan, Dr. Karl Von Hagen, Dr. Robert Wyers) testified to opinions as follows: Defendant\u2019s intent when he fatally stabbed Berg and the Rice boy was to obtain sexual sadistic gratification, to torture, and to bill. The intent to torture and kill was deliberately formed and premeditated before defendant inflicted any wound. Before he met Berg or Rice defendant had planned that when he found a suitable victim under circumstances in which he believed he could escape detection he would kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">At the trial on the sanity issue defendant, the three pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>viously mentioned court-appointed physicians, and Dr. Frederick Hacker, another court-appointed psychiatrist who had examined defendant, were called by the defense and testified to their opinions that defendant was legally sane. Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, a psychiatrist who became interested in defendant and was afforded opportunity to talk with him without defendant\u2019s knowing that Kelley was a physician and psychiatrist, testified for the People to the same opinion. The doctors explained that they used the M\u2019Naughton test. Defendant explained that he knew, and \u201cAny seven year old child knows,\u201d that \u201caccording to your laws\u201d defendant\u2019s homicides were wrong and subject to the death penalty, but that in defendant\u2019s opinion his slayings were not wrong \u201cbecause I am perfectly justified in every carcass I got. ... I figured that all out. ... If you want some carcasses you have to pay with your own. That is quite all right as long as you get enough of them.\u201d Asked by the prosecutor whether it was \u201ca fair statement\u201d that \u201cYou can\u2019t and will not conform\u201d to the laws and the rules of society, defendant replied, \u2018 \u2018 That is correct! Exactly it! I don\u2019t have to, with a knife in my hand. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Defendant, according to his testimony and repeated extrajudicial admissions, had committed 11 homicides including the two for which he was on trial. Five of these he described and police investigation confirmed their commission; others could not be confirmed, for defendant refused to disclose the identity of the victims and the place of the killings because no one would pay him for the information. Defendant, although voluble, also refused to answer some inquiries as to his reactions because, as he testified, they were \u201cmoney questions.\u201d Throughout defendant\u2019s testimony and extrajudicial declarations runs the theme that law-enforcement officials, psychiatrists, representatives of media of public communication, and even the trial judge and jury should pay defendant for disclosing his actions, thoughts, and feelings. Defendant gave elaborate pseudo-scientific explanations of the reasons for his killings and his asserted belief that they were justified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The instructions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the issue of insanity are based upon the M\u2019Naughton rule. Defendant did not request instructions presenting any other rule, but from the proceedings during the taking of testimony and from the hereinafter described state of the California law it is obvious that any such request would have been useless and we do not at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>base our decision upon defendant\u2019s failure to request different or additional instructions. A history of M\u2019Naughton in this state is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The basic M\u2019Naughton rule (stated <em>ante, </em>footnote 1) was approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffman </em>(1864), 24 Cal. 230, 235.  In 1872 when the Legislature enacted the Penal Code (including the provision of section 21 that \u201cAll persons are of sound mind who are neither idiots nor lunatics, nor affected with insanity\u201d and the provision of section 26 that \u201cAll persons are capable of committing crimes, except ... 3. Lunatics and insane persons\u201d) it presumably had the Coffman decision in mind and intended to leave its definition of insanity in effect (see <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1955), 45 Cal.2d 345, 355 [8-9] [289 P.2d 450, 54 A.L.R.2d 1137]). Also the Political Code, to be construed as passed at the same moment and part of the same statute as the Penal Code (Pol. Code, \u00a7 4480), provided (\u00a7 4468) that \u201cThe common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, or the Constitution or laws of this State, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>rule of decision in all the courts of this State.\u201d And the code commissioners cited the Coffman case in their note to subdivision 3 <em>(supra) </em>of Penal Code, section 26 (hereinafter quoted in full) and, quoting from that ease in their note to section 1016 of the Penal Code (under which the issue of insanity was formerly raised by the plea of not guilty; as hereinafter stated, our code has since been amended to provide for specific plea of, and separate trial of the issue of, not guilty by reason of insanity), stated that \u201cThe unsoundness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of mind, or insanity,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that will constitute a defense in criminal actions is <em>well described </em>by Tindal, in M\u2019Naughton. (Italics of the code commissioners.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Promptly after the adoption of the Penal Code, there was judicial reiteration of the basic M\u2019Naughton rule <em>(People </em>v. <em>M\u2019Donnell </em>(1873), 47 Cal. 134, 135, 136-137) and rejection of the irresistible impulse test <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoin </em>(1882), 62 Cal. 120, 123 [45 Am.Rep. 651]). And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kerrigan </em>(1887), 73 Cal. 222, 224-225 [14 P. 849], the court recognized that authorities cited by the appealing defendant \u201csupport his contention that \u2018moral insanity is now as well understood by medico-jurists, and almost as well established by judicial recognition, as the intellectual form,\u2019 \u201d but adhered \u201cwith confidence\u201d to the M\u2019Naughton rule and approved an instruction that \u201cIn our courts of law there is no such doctrine established or recognized as moral insanity, distinguished from mental derangement, as an excuse for crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Hubert </em>(1897), 119 Cal. 216, 221 [51 P. 329, 63 Am.St.Rep. 72], adapted from M\u2019Naughton (p. 932 of 4 St. Tr. (N.S.), p. 723 of 10 Clark &amp; Fin., p. 211 of Eng. Rep.) the following test: \u201cIf the defendant had certain special delusions which completely possessed him, but was perfectly sane on all other subjects, . . . then he must be judged as though the facts with respect to which the delusions exist were real.\u201d Rejecting the irresistible impulse test, the Hubert case held (p. 223 of 119 Cal.), \u201cconceding that the act was the offspring of an irresistible impulse, and the impulse was irresistible because of mental disease, still the defendant must be held responsible if he at the time had the requisite knowledge as to the nature and quality of the act, and of its wrongfulness.\u201d This holding was said to be supported on two policy grounds: difficulty of proof (\u201cWe do not know that the impulse was irresistible, but only that it was not resisted\u201d), and the expectation that fear of punishment will restrain persons whose power of self-control is impaired by mental disease (\u201cwhen the will power is weakened, although the mentality is not at all or only slightly impaired, the fear of punishment must be of some value as a restraint, and the class of people referred to need that restraining influence\u201d). The court (p. 224 of 119 Cal.) recognized that \u201cThere are doubtless some cases . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>in which the fear of punishment does not restrain, but where the rule works manifest injustice the unfortunate defendant is in some way saved from punishment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Apparently concerning the question whether the legal formulation as to insanity which renders a defendant incapable of crime should include some express requirement of causal connection between the insanity and the criminal act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hubert </em>(1897), <em>supra, </em>119 Cal. 216, 223, had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cIt has been proposed as a rule to leave it to the jury to say whether the act was the offspring of insanity, meaning, I presume, whether the defendant would have committed the act had he not been insane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cThere are many degrees of mental unsoundness. Some cases could only be detected by a very stilled expert. Some cases of mental unsoundness might be known only to very intimate acquaintances, and perhaps by them only noticeable under peculiar conditions. But, however slight the defect, only Omniscience can say whether the act would have been committed had the taint not existed. It is an impracticable rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The M\u2019Naughton rule continued to be accepted in California, over arguments that it was unscientific (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sloper </em>(1926), 198 Cal. 238, 245-246 [1-3] [244 P. 362]), at the time the Legislature in 1927 (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1016, 1017, 1020, 1026; Stats. 1927, ch. 677) provided for the specific plea and separate trial of the issue of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The 1927 legislation upon its face effected only procedural changes <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>(1928), 204 Cal. 470, 474-480 [1-10] [268 P. 909, 270 P. 1117]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1928), 94 Cal.App. 192, 194-197 [1] [270 P. 715]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Troche </em>(1928), 206 Cal. 35, 42-45 [1-5], 48-49 [11-12] [273 P. 767]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Leong Fook </em>(1928), 206 Cal. 64, 70 [1], 74-76 [4-5] [273 P. 779]) but it is apparent that the Legislature had in mind the substantive law as to insanity because the reason for making the procedural changes was \u201cto overcome some of the abuses which have crept into the administration of justice by reason of the frequent interposition of the defense of insanity in criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>(1928), <em>supra, </em>204 Cal. 470, 477; see Shepherd, <em>Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity </em>(1928), 2 So.Cal.L.Rev. 53; Shepherd, <em>The Plea of Insanity </em>(1929), 3 So.Cal.L.Rev. 1.) Again in 1927, as in 1872, the Legislature presumably knew of the existing domestic decisional law as to the substantive definition of the insanity which constitutes a defense to a charge of crime, and intended not to change it. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1955), <em>supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 345, 355 [8-9].) Rather, its use of the judicially construed word insanity in legislation on that subject indicated its intent that the definition should be continued <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1949), 34 Cal.2d 87, 93 [5] [207 P.2d 47]) and the court promptly recognized that intent by reiterating, in one of the most important cases which upheld the validity of the 1927 legislation, the M\u2019Naughton view with its assumption that reason can operate in a separate compartment of the mind, unaffected by mental disorder such as \u201cpartial insanity\u201d or \u201cmoral insanity\u201d or \u201cinsane delusion or hallucination\u201d or \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d to appraise right and wrong and choose the right, and then reach out of its compartment and prevent wrong conduct which the insane portions of the mind would initiate. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Troche </em>(1928), <em>supra, </em>p. 46 [7] of 206 Cal.) Indeed, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leong Fook </em>(1928), <em>supra, </em>206 Cal. 64, 72 [3], undertook to erect still another wall in the compartmental concept of insanity when it said, in explanation of the legislative provision for a separate trial on the issue of insanity, that \u201cproofs of insanity . . ., in the nature of things, and as a rule, are separable from the facts and circumstances attending the commission of the homicide.\u201d (The questionableness of this view is fully presented in the dissents of Justice Preston in the Troche (p. 51 of 206 Cal.) and Leong Fook (p. 78 of 206 Cal.) cases; we cannot agree with those dissents, however, that the provision for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>separate trial of the insanity issue is so unreasonable as to make the legislation invalid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The issue which the Legislature, by the 1927 enactment, took out of the trial on the general issue was a narrow one\u2014insanity as defined by the M\u2019Naughton rule, not all questions of mental disease or disorder. This was recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Selph </em>(1930), 106 Cal.App. 704, 707 [289 P. 918], explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1949), 33 Cal.2d 330, 346-357 [202 P.2d 53] (see also the dissenting opinions in Wells), and has since been further developed in such cases as <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1954), <em>supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 550, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorshen </em>(1959), <em>supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 716. During the same period that this court was developing the concepts of Wells, Baker, and Gorshen, we had occasion to say (in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1953), 40 Cal.2d 876, 894 [256 P.2d 911]) that M\u2019Naughton \u201chas been followed consistently [citation] despite voluminous critical writings on the subject. It is the generally accepted rule. [Citations.] Defendant has not offered a more workable test and if it is to be changed his argument should be addressed to the Legislature. Indeed, such attempts have been made without avail.\u201d And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Berry </em>(1955), 44 Cal.2d 426, 433 [8] [282 P.2d 861], we unanimously repeated that arguments for change in the test should be made to the Legislature rather than the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Since 1953 (when we decided Daugherty) and 1955 (when we decided Berry) the criticisms of M\u2019Naughton and the reasons for our conclusion that applications for alteration of the rule should be addressed to the Legislature have not significantly changed. A proposal of defense counsel points up reason for our previous and continued reluctance to assume the expertise which would be required to formulate new standards or (as in the formulae proposed on behalf of defendant)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>to leave the question whether the particular defendant suffers from a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d which would require a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity to be explained by evidence of experts in medicine and psychology and decided by the jury without any legal test. Defense counsel asked that we appoint not less than three forensic psychiatrists to consult with and advise them and counsel for the People in preparation for oral argument and to appear before this court as its friends and give testimony to aid in a reexamination of M\u2019Naughton and resolution of the \u201cmixed questions of law and fact\u201d which counsel say are presented on this appeal. The advancement of this proposal indicates that the reexamination should be by the Legislature, which is equipped for fact-finding, rather than by this court, which is traditionally disinclined and functionally not equipped to perform the fact-finding operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">A verdict on a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity is not merely an acceptance or rejection of a medical diagnosis, or a decision that punishing the accused would or would not be therapeutic for him. Nor is it purely a determination that society would be better protected, on the one hand, by execution of the accused or his confinement in an institution set up under the Penal Code, or, on the other hand, by his confinement in an institution set up under the Welfare and Institutions Code. By their decision on the insanity plea the jury are to some extent expressing ancient convictions that society can properly punish the man who offends it because the punishment is a sort of justified collective purge or vengeance; a purge to rid society of the offender and thereby to protect it, and vengeance to show retribution on the transgressor, thereby to deter others and thus to protect society. These strong persuasions of society may seem to some rather strikingly related to the rationalizations of defendant Nash, but such long established convictions cannot be adjudicated out of existence and we think that legal formulae designed to deal with them should come from the broad base of the Legislature, which is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>sumably more closely in touch with and sensitive to the views of the citizenry on this controversial subject than are the courts. There is danger in judicial changes of long-established rules of law when such changes proceed from a court\u2019s assumption that it can recognize what has become a fact of a social science.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The law as it is now understood and applied in California recognizes that all men are not endowed with equal intellectual capacity or similar moral convictions, but it requires, for the protection of society, that all conform to certain minimal standards of social interaction. The general structure of criminal responsibility for an individual\u2019s acts is said to be based on the \u201cposit that each normal person intends to do the act which he does do and that such intention is based upon the exercise of free will.\u201d (Bernard L. Diamond, M.D., <em>With Malice Aforethought </em>(1957), 2 Archives of Criminal Psycho-dynamics, No. 1, quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorshen </em>(1959), <em>supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pp. 716, 724, footnote 4.)  Although the law requires compliance with its standards by all persons it does not impose criminal sanctions on all persons. Penal Code, section 26 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u201cAll persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the following classes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u2018 \u2018 One. Children under the age of fourteen, in the absence of clear proof that at the time of committing the act charged against them, they knew its wrongfulness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u201cTwo. Idiots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u201cThree. Lunatics and insane persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u201cFour. Persons who committed the act or made the omission charged under an ignorance or mistake of fact, which disproves any criminal intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u201cFive. Persons who committed the act charged without being conscious thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">\u201cSix. Persons who committed the act or made the omission charged through misfortune or by accident, when it appears that there was no evil design, intention, or culpable negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">\u201cSeven. Married women (except for felonies) acting under the threats, command, or coercion of their husbands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">\u201cEight. Persons (unless the crime be punishable with death) who committed the act or made the omission charged under threats or menaces sufficient to show that they had reasonable cause to and did believe their lives would be endangered if they refused. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The law also specifies (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1367) that \u201cA person cannot be tried, adjudged to punishment, or punished for a public offense, while he is insane. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Afm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>From the foregoing discussion and the quoted statutory law it would appear to follow that, excepting only in cases where the death penalty may be imposed, it is relatively unimportant to society and to the accused whether the determination as to criminal responsibility <em>insofar as it may rest on the issue of sanity </em>is made at the time of initial trial or later. The immediately important question for both the state and the defendant is this: Did the defendant commit the act charged ? If he committed it, sane or insane, he should be held under restraints adequate and appropriate to the circumstances. If the circumstances require actual confinement it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>is not at the moment important what name be applied to the institution. The character of the supervision and study to be given the accused is important. As a result of such study it is conceivable that eventually a more informed diagnosis of the defendant and of his act might be accomplished and treatment appropriate to illness or evil disposition be applied. But our statutes do not yet authorize such procedure and, in this case, the death penalty has been imposed; accordingly, we must resolve the issues on the law as it now stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The most difficult problem arises in formulating for the trial process a just, understandable, and workable hypothesis for separating the insane from the sane insofar as criminal responsibility is concerned. Dr. Diamond in the above cited study <em>(With Malice Aforethought) </em>concedes that \u201cMedical psychology has embarrassingly few answers to this one question which the criminal law is most interested in. It does no good to proclaim to the jurist that scientific evidence proves that there is no such thing as free will. There is a subjective phe-, nomenon which the normal individual experiences as free will. Illusory or not, free will remains the basis of all criminal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>simply because free will is the basis of all normal social behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">This quoted statement is of little help to us in connection with the present problem because it concerns \u201cnormal social behavior,\u201d whereas we are dealing with the <em>abnormal. </em>The circle appears complete when we note that the very purpose of criminal law is to prevent abnormal behavior and protect society against it to the extent that such departures from the normal would destroy or impinge on recognized rights of other members of the social order. More directly addressed to our problem, Dr. Diamond\u2019s article continues: \u201cIn truth, today, we do not have a sufficient foundation of scientific knowledge about the ego functions of decision, choice, and determination of action to justify the formulation of any general principles which could be applied to the law.....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cThe task then becomes to understand the motivations, intent, and actions of the individual who deviates from the common-sense posit of free will. This can be accomplished without specious generalizations which would attack the very structure of the law itself and would compel non-acceptance by the juridical mind. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The \u201calienists\u201d appointed by the court \u201cto examine the defendant and investigate his sanity\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1027) directed their investigations and their testimony to the question whether this defendant met the tests of accountability established by existing California law. The evidence that he did meet those tests is overwhelming. The instructions are intelligently formulated and adequately comprehensive to inform the jury of that law and require their compliance with it. No prejudicial error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">For the reasons above stated the judgment and order.appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Gibson, C.

The quoted language is chiefly that of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Defendant did not remember his natural parents and believed that he was illegitimate. He was circumcised and believes that \u201csociety\u201d had no right to interfere with Ms body in this fashion. His foster-father was weak. Defendant was subjected to strict discipline and unprovoked cruelty by his foster-mother and in parochial schools. He became eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>vinced that Christians are hypocrites and that there is a \u201cprice tag\" on charity. Also his foster-parents and the parochial schools left him sexually ignorant and inhibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">By the time defendant entered public high school he was \u201can emotional wreck.\" \u201cIt was a mental impossibility\" for him to make \u201cadjustments that a child must make, to be ready for that kind of freedom.\" As a child, defendant testified, he recognized his inability to \u201cface reality,\" but \u201cEver since I got a knife, I make my reality. I can face it very easily.\" Defendant left high school after less than a year. He served for more than a year in the Civilian Conservation Corps, which \u201cseemed to be the ideal setup for me\" because there was \u201cjust enough discipline and just enough laxity.\" Then, during more than a year of private employment in various jobs and states, defendant \u201cmade a fairly good adjustment, other than, let\u2019s say, sex.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack defendant enlisted in the Army. For a year \u201cI made a good soldier\" (but \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be a good one overseas\" because \u201cI didn\u2019t have nothing to die for. I hadn\u2019t done any living yet\"). Then \u201cthis instability really showed itself\" and, after twice being A.W.O.L., defendant, to avoid the punishment of imprisonment, announced that he was homosexual and was discharged. Defendant considers this admission of homosexuality \u201cone of the greatest mistakes in my life.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Defendant spent the next few years drifting from one odd job to another. He committed a series of \u201cstrong-arm robberies\" for which he was never apprehended, although he was jailed several times for \u201csuspicion of robbery\" and for minor offenses. In 1945 he was confined for psychiatric examination for five days in Los Angeles County General Hospital, \u201crailroaded\" to a Veterans Hospital for 28 days, and released as mentally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In 1948 defendant was convicted of \u201cgrand theft from the person\u201d and sent to San Quentin Prison. He is bitterly resentful because he was imprisoned for a longer time than is usual for a first offender. He was paroled in 1953 and after six months he had an argument with his parole officer and was returned to San Quentin as \u201cunadaptable to outside conditions.\" He was again released in 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">While defendant was in San Quentin he determined to revenge himself upon society by murdering. He first thought of derailing a train, then decided that this would not be sufficiently personal (\u201cWhen you get a train you get a bunch of old fogeys who have nothing to live for anyway\"); that he would prefer to \u201cknow his customers\"; that he would give \u201ctop priority\" to sailors (because they had much sexual freedom and because they <em>1 </em>\u2018rolled queers\u2019\u2019) ; then, to children (because they had more to anticipate than adults and because their deaths would cause their parents suffering and destroy their hopes and ambitions for the children\u2019s future); and, \u201cif I got tired of the first two, . . . girls, anywheres from fifteen, eighteen, twenty, something like that, years of age. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">When defendant was released from San Quentin in 1955 he tried unsuccessfully to enlist in the Merchant Marine. He then went from</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Footnote <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> begins on page 43. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>place to place, sometimes worked at odd jobs, and committed homicides pursuant to his plans to revenge himself on society. The victims of the killings which defendant described were civilian homosexual \"pick-ups\u201d and the Eice child. Defendant was particularly pleased when his victims \"had something to live for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Defendant\u2019s first killing was in December, 1955. A few days thereafter he was arrested for assault upon another homosexual \"pick-up,\u201d convicted of a misdemeanor, and served six months. At this time he was examined by two psychiatrists who determined that he was not a sexual psychopath. After his arrest on the present charges defendant, in talking with Dr. Kelley, described these examinations and explained \"how you go about fooling some psychiatrists. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The climax of defendant\u2019s thinking about Christian hypocrisy, money, and the importance of Ms information was Ms proposal, fantasy, or wish that shortly before his execution some high official, in a televised ceremony, would pay him a large sum in return for the disclosures which he had withheld; with this sum defendant proposed, in order to have the satisfaction of mocking Christianity, to purchase a Catholic funeral and burial because \"it is against the Catholic Church laws to bury a person in a Catholic graveyard dying under such circumstances,\u201d but \"For enough money, they will do anything.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The pertinent instructions (with their relation to California Jury Instructions Criminal (1958) indicated in our bracketed inserts) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">_\u201c[From CAL JIG 801.] Insanity, as the word is used in these instructions, means such a diseased and deranged condition of the mental faculties of a person as to render Mm incapable of knowing the nature and quality of his act and of distinguishing between right and wrong in relation to the act with which he is charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\"The test of accountability is this: Did the party have sufficient mental capacity to appreciate the character and quality of the act?

If he had the capacity thus to appreciate the character and to comprehend the probable or possible consequences of his act, he was sane under the law, and is responsible to the law for the act thus committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>[Formulated by the People.] An offender cannot set up his own standard.

That presumption may be rebutted but is controlling until overcome by a preponderance of evidence showing that the defendant was insane at the time when the offense charged was committed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">[CALJIC 80S.] Moral insanity, as an independent state, is not recognized by law as a defense to crime, and does not constitute such insanity as is a legal defense. Moral insanity, in itself, is not a bar to responsibility for criminal acts; hence, howsoever perverted, if at all, the feelings, conscience, affections and sentiments of a person may be, unless the intellectual faculties and reasoning powers are so affected by mental disease as to render him incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong in relation to the act with which he is charged, he is responsible to the law for his criminal acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">\u201c[CALJIC 806.] The law does not recognize the plea of irresistible impulse as a defense to crime.

As the main opinion correctly points out, the rigid rules then adopted are no longer the law of this state. As I understand the recent decisions of this court, relevant evidence of an accused\u2019s mental condition affecting intent where intent is an element of the crime charged is now admissible on the trial of the guilt issue. Thus the basis of my dissatisfaction with the rigid application of the M\u2019Naughton rule no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">For these reasons I concur with the reasoning and holding in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
