J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGv\">This is an appeal from a declaratory judgment determining the obligations of two insurance companies whose policies, respectively, were issued to the driver and the owner of an automobile involved in an accident. On March 27, 1956, John M. Steinberg, who was insured by American Automobile Insurance Company, was driving a ear which, as a customer, he had borrowed from Max Barish, Inc., an automobile dealer and garage company insured <em>by </em>Republic Indemnity Company of America. The persons injured in the accident recovered by stipulation a judgment of $5,000 against both the driver and the owner of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The limits of each of the two policies are sufficient to cover the loss. The policy issued by Republic to the owner provides in its body for extension of coverage to any person using an automobile of the owner with permission, but affixed to the policy is Special Endorsement No. 4 which provides: \u201cIt is agreed that, with respect to any automobile used with the permission of the named insured by a customer of the named insured, such insurance as is provided by the policy applies only to the named insured.\u201d The policy issued by American to the driver insures him when using the automobile of another with permission. Both policies contain clauses to the effect that if the insured has other insurance covering the loss the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of the loss than the limit recited in the policy bears to the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>limit of all valid and collectible insurance against the loss, but that with respect to coverage for the driving of a car not owned by the insured the insurance under the policy shall be excess over any other valid and collectible insurance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">The trial court concluded that Special Endorsement No. 4 was contrary to public policy and invalid, that Republic\u2019s policy covered the driver as an additional insured and provided primary insurance whereas the policy issued by American provided excess insurance only, and that Republic was obligated to satisfy the whole judgment without being subrogated to any right of the owner against the driver. Republic has appealed from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The conclusion that Special Endorsement No. 4 is invalid is supported by <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Employees\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 31, 37-40 [307 P.2d 359], In that case the court held that an endorsement which restricted the coverage of an automobile liability insurance policy to accidents occurring when the ear was being driven by the named insured or members of his immediate family was contrary to the public policy expressed in sections 402 and 415 of the Vehicle Code and therefore invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was expressly held that section 415 as it then read must be considered part of every automobile liability insurance policy. The section specifically required coverage of any person using the car with permission as well as coverage of the named insured, and it follows that Special Endorsement No. 4, which purports to exclude coverage of a customer of the owner, is invalid under the rules of the Wildman case. The fact that here, unlike the situation pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>sented in that case, the injured persons were afforded protection by the coverage of the derivative liability of the owner and by the policy carried by the driver is immaterial because the operation of section 415\u2019 was not limited to the situation where the injured persons were not protected by other insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Republic urges us to reconsider the Wildman case in view of an amendment of section 415 enacted in 1957 after the date of that decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The new legislation, according to Republic, was intended to clarify the meaning of the section by showing that the requirements there set forth were not a necessary part of every automobile liability policy. The 1957 enactment does not affect the present case or the correctness of our holding in the Wildman case. The amendment is not retroactive and therefore has no direct application to the accident involved here, which took place prior to 1957.  It makes a material change in the phraseology of the section, and such a change is ordinarily viewed as showing an intention on the part of the Legislature to change the meaning of the provision rather than interpret it. <em>(Whitley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>18 Cal.2d 75, 79 [113 P.2d 449] ; <em>Estate of Todd, </em>17 Cal.2d 270, 274-275 [109 P.2d 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Since Special Endorsement No. 4 of Republic\u2019s policy must be disregarded, Steinberg, who was driving the automobile, was an additional insured under the terms of the policy issued by Republic to the owner. Thus the policies of both insurers covered the driver\u2019s liability, and each insurer would have been obligated to satisfy the whole judgment against Steinberg if the other insurance had not existed. The next question is whether the loss must be borne by one of the two insurers or apportioned between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The language of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses contained in both policies is substantially the same. The clauses consist of two parts; the first provides generally for prorating where there is other insurance covering the loss, and the second provides, as a specific exception, that when the named in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>sirred is driving a car not owned by him the insurance will be excess over all other insurance. Because American\u2019s named insured, Steinberg, was driving another person\u2019s ear, American\u2019s insurance falls within the exception specified in its policy if the insurance of Republic is treated as other insurance. On the other hand, Republic\u2019s insurance comes under the prorate provision in its policy if American\u2019s insurance is treated as other insurance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\">Where \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of this type appear in the automobile liability policies of both the driver and the owner, the cases have generally given effect to the excess provision in the policy of the driver and have held that the insurer of the owner is primarily liable and must bear the whole loss, within the limits of its policy. <em>(Pleasant Valley etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>CalFarm Ins. Co., </em>142 Cal.App.2d 126, 136 [298 P.2d 109]; <em>General Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Western Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>241 F.2d 289, 295; <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Preferred Acc. Ins. Co., </em>78 F. Supp. 561, 565; <em>Citizens Casualty Co. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Allied Mutual Ins. Co., </em>217 Md. 494 [144 A.2d 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">These eases are based on the reasoning that the policy of the owner is other insurance within the meaning of the excess provision of the driver\u2019s policy and that therefore this provision is <em>effective; </em>they do not consider the driver\u2019s policy as other insurance within the meaning of the prorate provision of the owner\u2019s policy and accordingly treat the prorate provision as not operative. Although this reasoning has been referred to as circular, depending on which policy one happens to read first (see <em>Oregon Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>Guar. Co., </em>195 F.2d 958, 960), we have concluded that the result reached in the cases cited above is correct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are construed in accordance with their purpose, the prorate clause in the owner\u2019s policy, as we shall see, is not applicable to a situation like the one involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in American\u2019s policy is identical with that contained in the \u201cNational Standard Automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Policy,\u201d used by the great majority of casualty insurers in the United States. (See Faude, The 1955 Revision of the Standard Automobile Policy, Coverage: Insuring Agreements and Exclusions, 1955 Proceedings of the Section of Insurance Law of the American Bar Association, p. 48.) Although Republic did not use the standard form, its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is substantially the same as that appearing in the standard policy. That policy as well as the policies involved here extends coverage to the named insured when he drives a car other than his own and also to any other person when driving the car of the named insured. For that reason there will be dual insurance when an accident is caused by a person not driving his own car and both the driver and the owner are insured under a standard policy. Clearly the excess provision of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is intended to show how the loss should be borne in this frequently recurring situation. It is impossible, and could not have been intended, that the excess provision would govern with respect to the insurance of the driver and that at the same time the prorate provision would control with respect to the insurance of the owner because pro-ration of the loss and treating the driver\u2019s insurance as excess over the insurance of the owner obviously lead to inconsistent results. The only construction of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause under which both its parts will be meaningful is that the <em>excess </em>provision alone controls in every situation which falls within its terms, such as when a person is driving the ear of another and both the driver and the owner have insurance, and that the <em>prorate </em>provision alone governs in all other situations, for example, when more than one policy has been issued to the same person. When the driver\u2019s insurance is excess, it necessarily follows that the insurance of the owner is primary, and therefore the owner\u2019s insurer must bear the entire loss to the extent of the limits of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Shenk, J., Schauer, J., Spence, J., McComb, J., and Peters, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied August 5, 1959.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The \u201cother insurance\u2019\u2019 clause in American\u2019s policy contains a further provision, not present in Republic\u2019s policy, relating to insurance issued at lower premium as excess insurance over disclosed prior insurance of the named insured.
