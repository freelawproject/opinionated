The vehicle soon accelerated to a high rate of speed. In response, Detective Long activated the patrol car\u2019s red light and siren and \u201cadvised radio\u201d of the pursuit. Long obtained assistance from other patrol cars and the department\u2019s helicopter. A pursuit ensued for approximately a mile and a half at which point the helicopter and several patrol cars effected a stop. Detective Long arrived immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Corporal Lauther also arrived at the scene of the stop and observed Officer Ritter, with his gun drawn, instructing a man to come forward. No other reference to the gun appears in the record. The man was 15 feet away from a tree situated in a backyard. Next to the tree was a fence. The man was then identified not as \u201cwanted person\u201d Jessie Taylor but rather as Danny Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Corporal Lauther was advised by Officer Yoshita, who piloted the helicopter, to search the area around the tree as defendant had been observed in that area. Lauther found a woman\u2019s bracelet and a glove near the tree and observed car keys and a flashlight on the other side of the fence in the backyard. Lauther handed Detective Long the bracelet and directed him to complete the search of the area near the tree and the fence. Long retrieved the flashlight, car keys and one brown glove from the backyard. On a tree near the street, Long located another brown glove.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Without asking defendant any questions Detective Long then showed the items to the defendant to find out whether they belonged to him. Defendant remarked, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, I just lost my head, when I threw them away, I just lost my head.\u201d Defendant was then arrested and other items of jewelry were found in his pockets during a subsequent booking search at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>At the time Detective Long showed defendant the items, he had no information that the items were either contraband or tools used to commit a crime. At that time, defendant was not suspected of having committed a crime warranting a custodial arrest but was rather being detained for traffic violations: failure to yield to a red light and siren, speeding, and reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The bracelet and the jewelry found on defendant were later identified as having been taken in a burglary that had occurred earlier that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Defendant pled guilty to one count of receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and admitted he violated probation which had been granted upon a prior conviction for credit card fraud. (\u00a7 484f.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1538.5) inasmuch as the evidence was a product of an illegal arrest.  He argues the statement made to Detective Long, upon which the officers and the trial court relied to establish probable cause to arrest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was obtained unlawfully because he had not been given his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Thus, his argument continues, the arrest was illegal and the fruits of the illegality\u2014particularly the items found in his pockets when he was booked at the jail\u2014should have been suppressed. Defendant contends Detective Long should have given him his <em>Miranda </em>rights because he was \u201cin custody\u201d at the time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Under <em>Miranda, </em>\u201cthe prosecution may not use statements . . . stemming from custodial interrogation . . . unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 444 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 706].)  The People initially contend we need not reach the question whether defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes because no \u201cinterrogation\u201d occurred. The People\u2019s argument is premised on the fact that Detective Long merely showed the items of property to defendant without asking him any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The argument is unavailing. \u201cMiranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>(Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 291, 300-301 [64 L.Ed.2d 297, 307-308, 100 S.Ct. 1682], fns. omitted.) While Detective Long\u2019s display of the items to defendant was not certain to provoke an incriminating response, given all circumstances such a response was reasonably likely.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">Moreover, if defendant was \u201cin custody,\u201d <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required even though by showing defendant the items Detective Long merely intended to allow defendant to explain incriminating circumstances. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 318, opn. by Kaus, J.)  \u201c[U]nder <em>Miranda </em>the vital question is custody, not whether the investigation has focused on the person interrogated [citations], and it is immaterial that the questioning relates to a crime other than the one which triggered the custody and is investigatory as far as that offense is concerned. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re James M. </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 133, 136-137 [139 Cal.Rptr. 902], fn. omitted, opn. by Kaus, J.)  Thus, if defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d when Detective Long showed him the items, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. We therefore turn to that issue: whether defendant was \u201cin custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only where a suspect is subject to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d <em>(Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 492, 494 [50 L.Ed.2d 714, 719, 97 S.Ct. 711].)  \u201cWhile arrest is not a condition precedent to the right to <em>Miranda . . </em>. warnings, custody is: the vice requiring the prophylaxis of the notice of rights is the inherently coercive atmosphere pervading <em>custodial </em>interrogation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 419, 443 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">California cases have held that suspects were not \u201cin custody\u201d where they were stopped routinely for traffic violations (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 602, 608-609 [209 Cal.Rptr. 575]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montoya </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 807, 810 [178 Cal.Rptr. 211]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hubbard </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 827, 835-836 [88 Cal.Rptr. 411]) or for \u201cinvestigatory stops\u201d or \u201cdetentions.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 767 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 889, 896, fn. 5 [135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salinas </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 925, 936 [182 Cal.Rptr. 683], and authorities cited therein; <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 612, 620 [80 Cal.Rptr. 223]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Manis </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 653, 669 [74 Cal.Rptr. 423].) However, none of these cases involved the kinds of restraint that were used to stop and detain defendant in the instant matter. We therefore turn to basic <em>Miranda </em>principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The rule is that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required before questioning where a citizen has been taken into custody <em>or </em>otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way or is led to believe, as a reasonable person, that he is so deprived. <em>(Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 420 [82 L.Ed.2d 317, 332, 336, 104 S.Ct. 3138]; <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, supra, </em>429 U.S. 492 at pp. 494-496 [50 L.Ed.2d at p. 719]; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at pp. 466-467 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 706]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 438, 448 [58 Cal.Rptr. 115, 426 P.2d 515]; see <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 133-134 (plur. opn. of Kaus and Grodin, JJ.).) \u201cAlthough the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of receiving Miranda protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Beheler </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1121, 1125 [77 L.Ed.2d 1275, 1279, 103 S.Ct. 3517], quoting <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, supra, </em>429 U.S. at p. 495 [50 L.Ed.2d at p. 719]; see <em>Green </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 134-135 (plur. opn. of Kaus and Grodin, JJ.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As applied to interactions between citizens and police on the street, these concepts were recently given further definition in <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra, </em>468 U.S. 420 [82 L.Ed.2d 317]. There, the court considered whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required where an officer pulled over a vehicle, had the driver perform field sobriety tests, and asked the driver whether he had been consuming intoxicants. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 423, 424 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 324, 325].) Concluding no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were necessary, the <em>Berkemer </em>court reasoned as follows: \u201cPerhaps most importantly, the typical traffic stop is public, at least to some degree. Passersby, on foot or in other cars, witness the interaction of officer and motorist. This exposure to public view both reduces the ability of an unscrupulous policeman to use illegitimate means to elicit self-incriminating statements and diminishes the motorist\u2019s fear that, if he does not cooperate, he will be subjected to abuse. The fact that the detained motorist typically is confronted by only one or at most two policemen further mutes his sense of vulnerability. In short, the atmosphere surrounding an ordinary traffic stop is substantially less \u2018police dominated\u2019 than that surrounding the kinds of interrogation at issue in <em>Miranda </em>itself, see 384 U.S. at 445, 491-498 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], and in the subsequent cases in which we have applied <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201cIn both of these respects, the usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called \u2018Terry stop,\u2019 see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868] (1968), than to a formal arrest. Under the Fourth Amendment, we have held, a policeman who lacks probable cause but whose \u2018observations lead him reasonably to suspect\u2019 that a particular person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime, may detain that person briefly in order to \u2018investigate the circumstances that provoke suspicion.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 881 [45 L.Ed.2d 607, 95 S.Ct. 2574] (1975). \u2018[T]he stop and inquiry must be \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation.\u201d \u2019 <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>at 29 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868].) Typically, this means that the officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\u2019s suspicions. But the detainee is not obliged to respond. And, unless the detainee\u2019s answers provide the officer with probable cause to arrest him, he must then be released. The comparatively nonthreatening character of detentions of this sort explains the absence of any suggestion in our opinions that <em>Terry </em>stops are subject to the dictates of <em>Miranda. </em>The similarly non-coercive aspect of ordinary traffic stops prompts us to hold that persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>temporarily detained pursuant to such stops are not \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cRespondent contends that to \u2018exempt\u2019 traffic stops from the coverage of <em>Miranda </em>will open the way to widespread abuse. Policemen will simply delay formally arresting detained motorists, and will subject them to sustained and intimidating interrogation at the scene of their initial detention. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberti, </em>293 Ore. 59, 95 [664 P.2d 1104, 1125] (1982) (Linde, L., dissenting) (predicting the emergence of a rule that \u2018a person has not been significantly deprived of freedom of action for <em>Miranda </em>purposes as long as he is in his own car, even if it is surrounded by several patrol cars and officers with drawn weapons\u2019), rev\u2019d on rehearing, 293 Ore. 236 [646 P.2d 1341] (1982), cert. pending, No. 82-315. The net result, respondent contends, will be a serious threat to the rights that the <em>Miranda </em>doctrine is designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cWe are confident that the state of affairs projected by respondent will not come to pass. It is settled that the safeguards prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>become applicable as soon as a suspect\u2019s freedom of action is curtailed to a \u2018degree associated with formal arrest.\u2019 <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1124 [77 L.Ed.2d 1275, 103 S.Ct. 3517] (1983) (per curiam). If a motorist who has been detained pursuant to a traffic stop thereafter is subjected to treatment that renders him \u2018in custody\u2019 for practical purposes, he will be entitled to the full panoply of protections prescribed by <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495 [50 L.Ed.2d 714, 97 S.Ct. 711] (1977) (per curiam).\u201d <em>(Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at pp. 439-440 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 334-335], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>Berkemer </em>demonstrates the semantic slipperiness of the requirement that a citizen be \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. We ordinarily associate the concept of being \u201cin custody\u201d with the notion that one has been formally arrested. Thus, for example, section 834 provides, \u201cAn arrest is taking a person into custody, in a case and in the manner authorized by law.\u201d  However, <em>Berkemer </em>makes clear that the question whether a citizen is \u201cin custody\u201d cannot be applied in a mechanical fashion by ascertaining, for example, whether a citizen has in fact been arrested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. 420 at p. 440 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 335].)  Rather, as <em>Beheler </em>itself notes, \u201cthe circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of receiving Miranda protection . . . .\u201d <em>(Beheler, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 1125 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Thus the phrase \u201cin custody,\u201d as used in the context of <em>Miranda, </em>is not synonymous with \u201ccustodial arrest\u201d but is rather a term of art that describes when a citizen has been subject to sufficient restraint by the police to require the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Both <em>Berkemer </em>and <em>Beheler </em>supply some important concrete guidelines for applying these rather nebulous rules. Thus, for example, in holding no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required during the roadside stop at issue, <em>Berkemer </em>identified several relevant circumstances: (1) the duration of the citizen\u2019s detention; (2) the public nature of the detention and the ability of passersby to observe police conduct; and (3) the number of police officers confronting the citizen. <em>(Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at pp. 437-438 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 333-334].) <em>Beheler </em>provides a benchmark by which the degree of police restraint can be measured: restraint on freedom of action requires <em>Miranda </em>warnings when it is \u201cof the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>(Beheler, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 1125 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1279].) <em>Berkemer </em>also provides some guidance in ascertaining the degree of restraint commonly associated with a formal arrest under <em>Beheler: </em>\u201cThere can be no question that respondent was \u2018in custody\u2019 at least as of the moment he was formally placed under arrest and instructed to get into the police car.\u201d <em>(Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 434 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 331].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Although <em>Berkemer </em>discusses the circumstances of detention noted above, nothing in the opinion suggests that these are exclusive. We believe the relevance of any given circumstance bearing on the need for <em>Miranda </em>warnings is ultimately determined by asking whether it tends to show that a reasonable person would, or would not, believe that his freedom had been restricted to a degree associated with a formal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">One well-recognized circumstance tending to show custody, which we shall apply here, is the degree of physical restraint used by police officers to detain a citizen: \u201cIf the police officer uses physical restraint on the suspect [citation] or draws a gun [citation] it is more likely to be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>custodial than if the questioning occurs without physical restraint or opportunity to restrain. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Herdan </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 300, 307, fn. 11 [116 Cal.Rptr. 641].) It goes without saying that the display of a weapon by police officers plainly conveys to a reasonable citizen the message that he is not free to leave; i.e., that his freedom of action is dramatically curtailed. Moreover, we believe a reasonable citizen who is questioned by police at gunpoint feels an \u201cinherently compelling pressure\u201d (see <em>Berkemer, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 433 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 330]) to respond to the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Turning to the instant case, we begin with the axiom that the People have the burden of proving that any search without a warrant falls within an exception to the warrant requirement so that the search is lawful. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711, 725 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278].) Here the burden was on the People to show that items seized from defendant at booking were the products of a lawful custodial arrest. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 64, 70 [60 Cal.Rptr. 254, 429 P.2d 606], revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom. Ross </em>v. <em>California </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 470 [20 L.Ed.2d 750, 88 S.Ct. 1850].) Since the lawfulness of the arrest turned on the lawfulness of defendant\u2019s statement to the officers, the burden was upon the People to prove the statement was obtained properly in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 751, 761 [72 Cal.Rptr. 873, 446 P.2d 993].) That burden, in turn, required the People to produce evidence showing that defendant was not subject to restraints requiring the giving of warnings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In the instant case, the only evidence produced by the People on the officers\u2019 use of a weapon showed that Officer Ritter held defendant at gunpoint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have no doubt that a reasonable person surrounded by at least four officers, several vehicles and a helicopter, and held at gunpoint, was subject to restraints on his freedom of action comparable to those associated with a formal arrest. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Herdan, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at pp. 307-308.) Indeed, the instant scenario closely resembles the one the <em>Berkemer </em>court confidently predicted \u201cwill not come to pass;\u201d i.e., that a citizen would not be \u201cin custody\u201d even where surrounded by several patrol cars and officers with drawn weapons. <em>(Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 440 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 335].) That scenario will not come to pass in this case. We conclude defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d and the officers were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>obligated to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings before Detective Long effectively questioned him by showing him the suspicious items of property. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 319; <em>People </em>v. <em>Quicke </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 502, 513 [78 Cal.Rptr. 683, 455 P.2d 787].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We caution we do not suggest that <em>Miranda </em>warnings must be given in each instance where police officers initially use weapons or other force to effect an investigative stop. For <em>Miranda </em>purposes, we think the crucial consideration is the degree of coercive restraint to which a reasonable citizen believes he is subject <em>at the time of questioning. </em>Police officers may sufficiently attenuate an initial display of force, used to effect an investigative stop, so that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required when questions are asked. Thus, for example, a police officer may well act reasonably in drawing his gun while he approaches a citizen in an uncertain situation. However, having ascertained that no immediate danger justifies his display of his weapon, the officer may also reholster it. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harley </em>(2d Cir. 1982) 682 F.2d 398, 400.) Assuming the citizen is subject to no other restraints, the officer\u2019s initial display of his reholstered weapon does not require him to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking the citizen questions. As a practical matter, a contrary conclusion would imprudently endanger police officers by discouraging them from using protective measures reasonable in the circumstances to effect investigative stops. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(2d Cir. 1981) 652 F.2d 244, 249-250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In the instant case, as we have noted, <em>Miranda </em>was violated because the People failed to carry their burden of showing that the considerable force used initially to detain defendant was attenuated (if it was) before he was questioned. Since defendant\u2019s arrest was based upon his statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>the arrest was unlawful and the items taken from defendant in a subsequent booking search must be suppressed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Zolnay), supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 729, 735; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wetzel </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 104, 107-110 [113 Cal.Rptr. 32, 520 P.2d 416].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The items found on the ground and in the tree in the vicinity of the vehicle stop need not be suppressed because they had been abandoned and were in plain view. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Siegenthaler </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 465, 470 [103 Cal.Rptr. 243, 499 P.2d 499]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingram </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 673, 681 [176 Cal.Rptr. 199], and authorities cited therein.)  However, even though only some of the evidence against defendant must be suppressed, reversal of the judgment is required because defendant\u2019s conviction was obtained by plea of guilty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 545, 550-556 [189 Cal.Rptr. 519, 658 P.2d 1320]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 767 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Blease, Acting P.

In such circumstances, the police do not effect an unlawful arrest without probable cause. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>at p. 641.) \u201c[A]n otherwise valid stop does not inevitably escalate to an arrest merely because the suspect\u2019s car was boxed in by police cars, because the police drew weapons, or because reasonable nondeadly force was used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>achieve or continue the seizure.\u201d (LaFave, <em>\u201cSeizures\u201d Typology: Classifying Detentions of the Person to Resolve Warrant, Grounds, and Search Issues </em>(1984) 17 U.Mich.
