Group </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 728 F.2d 1244, 1246-1247, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-12\"><em>\u201cInternational Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), establishes that for personal jurisdiction to lie, \u2018due process requires ... a defendant . . . [to] have certain minimum contacts with [the forum] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d \u2019 Minimum contacts may give rise to \u2018general\u2019 or \u2018limited\u2019 personal jurisdiction.  <em>General jurisdiction </em>[our italics] arises when a nonresident defendant\u2019s activities in the forum are so substantial and continuous that due process does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>not require a connection between the cause of action pleaded and the nature of the defendant\u2019s activities in the state. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-4\">\u201cThe test for <em>limited jurisdiction </em>[our italics], however, does not sweep so broadly, nor does it focus on what the <em>defendant </em>has <em>failed </em>to do within a state. We have set forth the requirements of limited in personam jurisdiction as follows: (1) The nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he <em>purposefully </em>[our italics] avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. (2) The claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant\u2019s forum-related activities. (3) Exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The evidentiary showing of the parties in the superior court was by declarations under penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">We first consider the evidence as it bore upon the <em>\u201cgeneral juris</em>diction\u201d of California\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The declaration of the Indiana corporations declared: \u201cBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana are both Indiana mutual insurance corporations, each incorporated under the Indiana Insurance Law . . . who operate jointly pursuant to a written contract and who maintain their principal place of business at 120 West Market Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. . . . [\u00b6] Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana are neither authorized nor licensed to transact any business in the State of California and do not in fact transact any business in the State of California. As a matter of corporate policy, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana have never solicited to sell and have never sold insurance policies in the State of California. Neither Blue Cross nor Blue Shield of Indiana maintain any office mailing address, agent for service of process, telephone, employees, sales representatives, nor any officer or director in the State of California. Neither Blue Cross nor Blue Shield of Indiana maintain any bank account, nor own any property (real or personal) in the State of California. Neither Blue Cross nor Blue Shield of Indiana is now registered nor has either ever sought registration from the California Commissioner of Insurance. Neither Blue Cross nor Blue Shield of Indiana now pay nor have they ever paid taxes in the State of California, [\u00b6] As a matter of corporate policy, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana enter into insurance contracts with Indiana employers and with individuals who are residents of Indiana. Neither Blue Cross nor Blue Shield of Indiana maintain any offices outside the State of Indiana, nor is either registered to do business in any state other than Indiana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>On the same issue of <em>\u201cgeneral </em>jurisdictionthe declaration of the appealing cross-complainant\u2019s attorney stated only that: \u201c/ <em>have information and believe </em>that Blue Cross of Indiana has moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in California in at least several difference [szc.j cases, indicating thereby that they do in fact have frequent contacts with California other than in the instant case, and in fact have been brought to court in at least several times by California residents.\u201d (Our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">\u201cAn affidavit based on \u2018information and belief\u2019 is hearsay and must be disregarded . . ., and it is \u2018unavailing for any purpose\u2019 whatever. . . . A ruling \u2018of the court is to be based upon facts which may be presented to it, and not upon the belief of the affiant. \u2019 . . . Such allegations on \u2018information and belief\u2019 furnish \u2018 \u201cno proof of the facts stated. . . <em>(Star Motor Imports, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 201, 204 [151 Cal.Rptr. 721]; and see authority there collected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Manifestly the trial court\u2019s ruling that California\u2019s courts had <em>no </em>\u201cgeneral jurisdiction\u201d over the Indiana corporations was established by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">We advert now to the evidentiary proof in respect of the <em>\u201climited jurisdiction\u201d </em>of California\u2019s courts over the Indiana corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Concerning this issue, cross-complainants\u2019 attorney\u2019s declaration states: \u201cThe attached correspondence is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit \u2018A.\u2019 These letters represent my early correspondence with Blue Cross and describe and detail the relationship between the Thiebaut\u2019s and Blue Cross and Blue Cross\u2019 contacts with California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Attached to the declaration are 10 pages of single spaced, closely typed, copies of letters, the meaning of which is difficult to ascertain. And there is scant record reference, as required by rule 15(a), California Rules of Court. All of the letters were written <em>after </em>the parties had assumed adversary postures, and litigation was threatened. And none of them remotely suggests that the Indiana corporations had <em>\u201cpurposefully </em>[our italics] availed [themself] of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum [i.e., California], thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d (See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Erie Ins. Group, supra, </em>728 F.2d 1244, 1247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">There was thus also, substantial evidence supportive of the superior court\u2019s conclusion that California had <em>no </em>\u201climited jurisdiction\u201d over the cross-defendant Indiana corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>The order quashing service of summons and dismissing the cross-complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Racanelli, P. J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 17, 1986, and appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 9, 1986.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
