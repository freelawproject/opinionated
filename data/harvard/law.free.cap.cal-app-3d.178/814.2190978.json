Code, \u00a7 187, 189), in the commission of which he personally used a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). He admitted one prior conviction for a robbery, a serious felony within the meaning of Penal Code section 667. In the published portion of this opinion we consider defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence hearsay statements made by the victim shortly before he was fatally shot. We find that contention, and the remaining ones considered in the unpublished portion, to be unpersuasive and consequently shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">For a number of years before his death the victim, Kelvin Boney, had been married to Barbara Bustos. At the time of his death Boney and Barbara had separated and were in the process of a dissolution. For approximately the same period of time defendant had been involved in a meretricious relationship with Georgina Bustos, the sister of Barbara. Shortly before the incident in question they also had separated. Boney had moved into the apartment of Judy Masten and they planned to marry. Defendant continued to live in his house in Roseville.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">On the afternoon of July 18, 1983, defendant paid a visit to Boney at Masten\u2019s apartment in Sacramento. Defendant, Boney, and Masten spent the afternoon talking and drinking.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Between 7 and 8 p.m., defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Boney left Masten\u2019s apartment. Masten testified that defendant wanted them to go to Roseville and Boney wanted her to go, but that she told Boney she did not want to go. She went to get her purse and saw defendant\u2019s car leave with Boney in the passenger seat. By defendant\u2019s own concession, he and Boney then went to defendant\u2019s residence in Roseville.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">At some time between 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Boney telephoned Anthony Rodriguez, who was the boyfriend of Masten\u2019s daughter. Boney wanted a ride from Roseville to Sacramento. Rodriguez refused to give him a ride but, since Masten did not have a telephone, he agreed to take a message to her. Boney gave defendant\u2019s telephone number to Rodriguez and asked him to tell Masten to call him. Rodriguez delivered the message.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Masten went to a pay telephone and called the number Rodriguez had given her. Boney answered and asked her to come and get him. He exclaimed, \u201cCarlos went crazy and he\u2019s going to shoot me.\u201d He told Masten to bring a gun. Masten obtained an address from Boney. She attempted to get directions, but heard some angry yelling and then the telephone went dead. The address Masten had obtained was erroneous. She had written 323 D Street, while defendant actually lived at 232 D Street. Masten drove around for several hours but was unable to find her way there. She attempted to call defendant\u2019s number but received no answer. She called Antonia Bustos, the mother of Barbara and Georgina, and told her about the call from Boney. Antonia confirmed that Masten had the wrong address, but told her no more. Eventually Masten went to her son\u2019s house where she stayed the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The next morning, defendant\u2019s mother, who lives in southern California, received a telephone call from defendant. He said he was at the San Diego airport and asked her to pick him up. Shortly thereafter she received a call from Georgina Bustos, who asked whether she had heard from defendant. She confirmed that she had and that he was at the airport. After confirming that defendant was away, Georgina went to his house to get some of her things. There she discovered the body of Boney. Boney had died from a small caliber shot to the chest. Expert testimony established that the death weapon was fired from close range, probably about six inches. The death weapon, which belonged to defendant, was found in the yard near his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Defendant admitted involvement in Boney\u2019s death, but he claimed that it was an accident. He testified that they drank and talked at his house. The talk turned to guns and defendant told Boney he had purchased a pistol. Boney asked to see it and defendant retrieved it from his bedroom. As defendant held it out to him, Boney grabbed the gun and said, \u201cgive me that gun.\u201d As Boney pulled the gun towards himself it accidentally dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>charged. Defendant realized that Boney had died and he was devastated. He then decided to go to his mother\u2019s house because she was the only one in the world he trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Based upon this scenario the jury found defendant to be guilty of one count of second degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187) with a finding that he personally used a firearm in the offense (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). After waiving a jury trial on the issue, defendant admitted the prior conviction for robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) in a hearing before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Discussion<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to introduce Boney\u2019s statements to Masten during the telephone call. As we have recounted, Masten testified that the victim told her defendant had \u201cgone crazy\u201d and was going to shoot him. He instructed her to come and get him and to bring a gun. Masten heard some angry yelling and the telephone went dead. The People sought to introduce the statements as spontaneous declarations of the victim, and to establish his state of mind to negate any claim of accident. Defendant objected that the statements were inadmissible hearsay. Initially the trial court indicated that it would overrule the objection. However, after reflecting on the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, the court decided to allow the case to progress before ruling and directed the prosecutor to avoid reference to the statements until later in the case. After defendant established through cross-examination that the victim was a \u201ctough guy,\u201d who became unpredictable and violent when drinking, the court allowed the evidence to be admitted. That ruling is now challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Initially, we note that the prosecution sought to introduce Boney\u2019s statements on a theory upon which they were clearly admissible, namely as spontaneous declarations. Evidence Code section 1240 provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: [\u00b6] (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and [\u00b6] (b) Was made spontaneously while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception. \u201d  This section incorporated part of what was formerly known as the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule. (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) The Hearsay Rule, \u00a7 544, p. 517.) As Witkin notes, California has now adopted Wigmore\u2019s terminology in place of res gestae and \u201cstatements coming under this exception are properly described as \u2018spontaneous exclamations,\u2019 \u2018spontaneous declarations,\u2019 or \u2018spontaneous statements.\u2019\u201d (Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 517.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 1176 [81 Cal.Rptr. 5, 459 P.2d 259], the Supreme Court observed that Evidence Code section 1240 \u201ccodified an existing exception to the hearsay rule (Law Revision Commission Comment to \u00a7 1240), which was carefully restated in <em>Showalter </em>v. <em>Western Pac. R.R. Co. </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 460, 468 [106 P.2d 895], To be admissible, \u2018(1) there must be some occurrence startling enough to produce . . . nervous excitement and render the utterance spontaneous and unreflecting; (2) the utterance must have been before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent, i.e., while the nervous excitement may be supposed still to dominate and the reflective powers to be yet in abeyance; and (3) the utterance must relate to the circumstances of the occurrence preceding it. (Wigmore on Evidence, [2d ed.], sec 1750.).\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The time which has elapsed between the event and the statement is an important factor because a spontaneous statement must be made under the immediate influence of the event so as to negate any probability of reflection or fabrication. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pp. 1176-1177; <em>Showalter </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R. R. Co. </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 460, 469 [106 P.2d 895]; <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Easter </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 845, 854 [21 Cal.Rptr. 905].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In general, the closer in time the declaration is to the event to which it refers the less likely it is to be the product of reflection and fabrication. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>It is rare, but not unknown, for there to be available spontaneous declarations made during the very transaction at issue. Because of this rarity, most of the cases have been concerned with declarations made shortly after the event.  Excited statements made close in time to the event are generally regarded as admissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Francis </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 241, 254 [180 Cal.Rptr. 873]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 1018, 1032-1033 [162 Cal.Rptr. 748]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Forgason </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 356, 365 [160 Cal.Rptr. 263]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Panky </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 772, 779 [147 Cal.Rptr. 341]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orduno </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 738, 745-746 [145 Cal.Rptr. 806].)  And a statement made contemporaneously with one criminal event has been regarded as \u201cclearly admissible\u201d in a prosecution for a subsequent crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Worthington </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 359, 366-367 [113 Cal.Rptr. 322].) In <em>Worthington </em>the defendant was charged with murdering a mother and child. Two days before the killings a witness had heard the mother angrily order the defendant out of the daughter\u2019s bedroom saying, \u201c \u2018He\u2019s trying to go down on my daughter. \u2019 \u201d The statement was admitted to prove the defendant had been trying to molest the daughter and thus to establish his motive at the time of the killings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Here the statements were virtually the victim\u2019s last words before he was murdered. The evidence in this case established that the defendant and Boney were together at defendant\u2019s home. Boney sent a message to his fiance and when she returned his call he sounded frightened. He said defendant had gone \u201ccrazy\u201d and was going to shoot him. He asked her to come and get him and to bring a gun. Before she could obtain directions to defendant\u2019s house Masten heard angry yelling and the telephone line went dead. The telephone was located in the kitchen. The following morning Boney was found on the kitchen floor shot through the chest by defendant\u2019s gun. The bullet perforated Boney\u2019s heart and quickly caused death. A spent .22 caliber casing was found by the investigating officers in the kitchen. The investigation revealed no indication of a struggle between Boney and his killer. In the meanwhile defendant had fled to southern California. Under these circumstances it is apparent that Boney\u2019s excited utterance was contemporaneous with the transaction which led to his death and while his reflective powers were still in abeyance. The statement was therefore a spontaneous declaration admissible under Evidence Code section 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Moreover, we agree with the People that it was also within the trial court\u2019s discretion to admit the statements to show the victim\u2019s state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>mind.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   \u201cUndoubtedly, in a proper case, and in a proper manner, testimony as to the \u2018state of mind\u2019 of the declarant, where there is an issue in the case is admissible, but only when such testimony refers to threats as to future conduct on the part of the accused, where such declarations are shown to have been made under circumstances indicating that they are reasonably trustworthy, and when they show primarily the then state of mind of the declarant and not the state of mind of the accused.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 881, 893 [13 Cal.Rptr. 649, 362 P.2d 473].) Statements by a victim concerning the defendant\u2019s prior conduct such as threats made to him tend to establish the victim\u2019s state of mind towards the defendant, namely, fear of him, and may be admitted where that state of mind is in issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Armendariz </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 573, 588 [209 Cal.Rptr. 664, 693 P.2d 243].) Such statements are not admitted to show the truth of the matter asserted, that the threats were made, or the defendant\u2019s conduct in conformity therewith. They are instead admitted to show the victim\u2019s conduct in conformity with his state of mind. <em>(Ibid.) </em>For example, where the defendant claims self defense or that the killing was accidental, then statements by the victim showing his fear of the defendant may be admitted to show that the victim would not likely have been an aggressor against the defendant or would not likely have allowed himself to be in the position in which the defendant claims the accident occurred. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lew </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d <em>774, </em>779-780 [69 Cal.Rptr. 102, 441 P.2d 942].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In determining whether to admit the evidence to show Boney\u2019s state of mind the trial court was initially cautious. Later in the case, however, it became apparent that the defense was attempting to portray Boney as a \u201ctough guy\u201d with a bad temper who could become violent and unpredictable, especially while drinking. The court ruled that \u201cthe line has been crossed\u201d and that the defense had put in issue Boney\u2019s conduct, demeanor and actions. We find no abuse of discretion in this ruling. At the point the court ruled that the evidence could be admitted the defense was obviously attempting to show that Boney\u2019s behavior caused or contributed to his death. His fear of defendant, shown by his statements to Masten, would tend to negate the possibility that he would have been aggressive with defendant or that he would have asked defendant to get his pistol from the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Defendant complains that the court failed to give the jury an instruction limiting the use of the evidence to its use as proof of the victim\u2019s state of mind. We agree with the People that the failure to request a limiting instruction precludes defendant from raising this issue on appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 618-619 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97].) We reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that it would have been futile to request a limiting instruction. During the original discussion, when the court indicated it would admit the evidence, the court invited counsel to suggest a limiting instruction. The court then changed its ruling and excluded the evidence until later in the case when the state of the evidence supported its admission. When the court allowed the evidence to be presented defendant did not request a limiting instruction. There was no reason for defendant to believe the court would have refused a limiting instruction had he suggested one, as the court had earlier invited him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In any event, we have noted that the evidence was admissible under the spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240.) Statements admitted under that rule are generally admissible and are not limited to a specific purpose. Although the court failed to rule on the People\u2019s offer of the evidence under section 1240, our conclusion that the evidence was admissible under that section compels us to conclude that there was no reversible error in failing to limit the use of the evidence when it was admitted to show the victim\u2019s state of mind. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Braeseke </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 691, 700-701 [159 Cal.Rptr. 684, 602 P.2d 384].)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">III-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Puglia, P. J., and Regan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\">In fact, the evidence was conflicting whether Boney was drinking at that time. Masten testified that she and defendant were drinking and that Boney was not. Defendant testified that Boney was drinking but that he was concealing it from Masten. The autopsy surgeon testified that he concluded that Boney\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of his death was approximately .14 percent. It was uncertain whether that was attributable to an afternoon of steady drinking, or a period of more concentrated drinking after defendant and Boney left Masten\u2019s apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\">See footnote, page 814, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1170, the severely beaten victim of a robbery was taken to a hospital in an unconscious condition. About an hour after the crime, the victim regained consciousness shortly before his death and in answer to a nurse\u2019s questions stated that he had been beaten or robbed by two or three assailants. The <em>Washington </em>court held that \u201c[n] either lapse of time between the event and the declarations nor the fact that the declarations were elicited by questioning deprives the statements of spontaneity if it nevertheless appears that they were made under the stress of excitement and while the reflective powers were still in abeyance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1176.) Nonetheless, the statutory requirement that the statement be made while the declarant is under the stress of the excitement caused by the perceived event \u201chas been construed to introduce a very tight time limitation on out-of-court declarations which [the] parties seek to qualify as \u2018spontaneous exclamations.\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Cheryl H. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1130 [200 Cal.Rptr. 789].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\">As Jefferson explains, \u201cThe spontaneous-statement hearsay exception is designed to admit a statement made spontaneously under the stress of excitement caused by an exciting or startling act or event and that describes this act or event.
