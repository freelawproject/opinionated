Code, \u00a7 790 et seq.;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see also \u00a7 1620.2) which regulates trade practices in the business of insurance applies to independent claims adjusters. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">In November 1981, Bodenhamer Jewelers was burglarized as a result of which petitioners, Ronald and Nada Bodenhamer, filed claims under insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>anee policies issued by St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company and Lexington Insurance Company. Both insurance companies hired General Adjustment Bureau (GAB), to adjust the claims. When disputes arose concerning the amount of the claims, petitioners filed suit against the insurers, against Coldwell-Banker, insurance brokers, and against real parties in interest, GAB and Richard C. Rosa, the GAB employee who processed the claim. As to real parties, petitioners alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and violations of section 790.03.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In a motion for summary judgment or partial adjudication of issues, real parties challenged the cause of action for violation of subdivision (h) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>section 790.03, on the ground that this section does not apply to independent insurance adjusters.  The trial court agreed and granted summary adjudication in favor of real parties on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioners seek a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The purpose of the Act is \u201cto regulate trade practices in the business of insurance ... by defining . . . such practices in this State which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined. \u201d (\u00a7 790.) Section 790.02 prohibits any person from engaging in any trade practice defined in section 790.03 as \u201can unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance,\u201d including the prohibition of \u201cunfair claims settlement practices.\u201d Section 790.01 applies the Act to \u201creciprocal and interinsurance exchanges, Lloyds insurers, fraternal benefit societies, fraternal fire insurers, grants and annuities societies, insurers holding certificates of exemptions, motor clubs, nonprofit hospital associations, agents, brokers, solicitors, surplus line brokers and special lines surplus line brokers <em>as well as all other persons engaged in the business of insurance.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Since the Act applies to all persons engaged in the business of insurance the sole and first impression question is whether independent claims adjusters fit within that definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Real parties contend that the fact that \u201cadjusters\u201d are not expressly listed in section 790.01 reveals that the Legislature intended that the Act should not apply to the independent insurance adjuster. They consider it significant that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\u2019 model legislation, upon which the Act was patterned (see <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 880, 885 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>329]), specifically included adjusters. The model act did so by defining \u201c \u2018Person\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany individual, corporation, association, partnership, reciprocal exchange, inter-insurer, Lloyds insurer, fraternal benefit society, <em>and any other legal entity engaged in the business of insurance, including agents, brokers and adjusters. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">What we deem significant is that the mention of \u201cadjusters\u201d in the model act is only by way of illustration of those who are \u201cengaged in the business of insurance\u201d and that the Act in section 790.01 uses very similar language in taking the same approach: its many examples are not exclusive. That an adjuster is clearly seen by the drafters of the model act to be within the definition of \u201cany other legal entity engaged in the business of insurance\u201d could not have escaped the California Legislature which simply used another list of examples. Thus we do not regard this minor difference between the model act and the Act as indicative of an intent to exclude adjusters.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In the same vein real parties conclude that since the organizations specifically listed in section 790.01 are either insurers or brokers, the term \u201call other persons engaged in the business of insurance\u201d must be limited only to insurers or brokers. Given the broad purpose of the Act\u2014regulation of trade practices in the business of insurance\u2014it would do considerable violence to the statutory language to read as outside the reach of the Act, insurance adjusters who by definition conduct an important aspect of the business regulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Real parties\u2019 last line of defense is that if the Act does apply to insurance adjusters it reaches only those who are employees of insurers and thus not independent adjusters. They point out that at the time the Act was enacted regulation and licensing of independent insurance adjusters was the task of the Director of Consumer Affairs pursuant to the Private Investigator Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7512 et seq.) as contrasted with the administration of the Act which is entrusted solely to the Insurance Commissioner. (\u00a7\u00a7 790.04, 790.05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">There is nothing novel or incongruous in subjecting a business to the regulation of more than one agency or more than one code. What would be odd would be to construe the Act as prohibiting unfair settlement practices by employees of an insurance company but as not prohibiting identical acts when perpetrated by an independent adjuster working for an insurance company. But if there is any logic to this argument concerning incongruity by dual regulation it was erased when the Legislature in 1980 removed the licensing and regulation of insurance adjusters from the Director of Consumer Affairs and placed those concerns in the lap of the Insurance Commissioner by enactment of the Insurance Adjuster Act (\u00a7 14000 et seq.). By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>so doing the Legislature put in letters 10 feet tall its determination that the insurance adjuster is in the business of insurance. Nor is there any conflict between the Act and the Insurance Adjuster Act. (Compare \u00a7\u00a7 14038 and 14039 with \u00a7 790.03.) Both Acts apply to the independent insurance adjuster.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to vacate its order granting the motion of GAB Business Services, Inc. and Richard C. Rosa pursuant to section 437c of the Code of Civil Procedure insofar as that order held that these defendants cannot be liable for violation of section 790.03 of the Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Anderson, P.

The orders left Nada Bodenhamer with a cause of action against petitioners for fraudulent misrepresentation. An appeal of the summary judgment against Ronald Bodenhamer, though available now, is not an adequate remedy since the case will go on without a substantial portion being heard on the merits. (Cf. <em>Nazaroff v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 553, 557-558 [145 Cal.Rptr. 657].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Although the appellate reports contain examples of actions brought without challenge under section 790.03, subdivision (h) against independent adjusters, no appellate court has been faced with the question in any context remotely similar to the one at hand. For example, in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>GAB Business Services, Inc. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 519 [207 Cal.Rptr. 519], the court opined that the Act would have no applicability to cases where the independent claims adjuster represented a self-insured entity. Also wide of the present situation is <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Employee Benefits Services </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 898 [214 Cal.Rptr. 679], which involved an unsuccessful attempt by an injured worker to state a cause of action under the Act against his self-insured employer and its independent claims adjuster for delay in paying a worker\u2019s compensation award. The Court of Appeal held that the conduct complained of was clearly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
