We conclude the trial court erred in issuing the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In 1980 respondent filed an application with the North Coast Regional Coastal Commission (Regional Commission) for permission to construct a 10-unit inn, single family residence, dining room, and 16-space parking lot on 19.8 acres of unimproved land on Navarro Head, located approximately 20 miles south of Fort Bragg at the junction of State Highways 1 and 128 in Mendocino County. Navarro Head is described as a \u201ccritical view corridor\u201d in Mendocino County\u2019s land use plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent also sought permission to build an access road leading to the proposed inn along the path of an existing unimproved dirt road off Highway 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Permission was granted subject to nine conditions, only two of which are pertinent to the controversy herein. The Regional Commission staff determined that the proposed access road would \u201cnot be consistent with the Coastal Act\u2019s visual resource policies.\u201d Specifically, it concluded the paved road would \u201cnot blend into this highly scenic portion of the coast.\u201d Therefore, it proposed conditioning respondent\u2019s receipt of a permit on relocating the access road so that it adjoined Navarro Ridge Road instead of Highway 1. The permit was also conditioned to require the recordation of an open-space easement in a doughnut shape around the proposed inn \u201c[t]o ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>that the scenic resources of the portions of the terrace which are not proposed for development are not impaired . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Respondent objected to the Regional Commission\u2019s proposed relocation of the access road, claiming it would increase construction costs by some $40,000 and also claiming Highway 1 access was critical in drawing visitors to the inn and restaurant. The Regional Commission held a hearing, and the condition requiring relocation of the proposed access road was deleted. Respondent was allowed to pave the existing dirt road off Highway 1 on the condition that landscaping would be utilized to reduce the adverse scenic impact of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Although respondent consistently expressed opposition to the open-space easement condition during the review process, he chose to accept the Regional Commission\u2019s final approval of his permit (with the easement condition) and did not appeal. The grant of this permit was appealed to the State Commission by the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club argued that the access road should be relocated from Highway 1 as originally proposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State Commission declined to hear the appeal finding \u201cno substantial issue\u201d was presented under the Coastal Act. (See Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30625, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">One and one-half years later, Pacific Legal Foundation wrote a letter on respondent\u2019s behalf to the State Commission, which had succeeded to the responsibilities of the terminated Regional Commission under Public Resources Code section 30305. Respondent requested that his coastal development permit be amended to delete the open-space easement condition. The letter questioned the necessity of the easement to protect the view from Highway l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondent also wanted the easement condition struck because it reduced the value of his property and made development financing more difficult to obtain. The State Commission staff report recommended granting respondent\u2019s request to remove the doughnut-shaped easement but \u201conly if the adverse visual effects of the project are mitigated through . . . [p]lacing an open-space easement over the northwest slope of the property [the area of the access road] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>A hearing was held on respondent\u2019s amendment request on November 18, 1982. An understanding of the arguments made at that hearing is critical to an understanding of the issues on appeal. Respondent argued that the State Commission, when acting on the amendment application, could not shift the easement to the area of the access road because it had already been determined on the original permit application that the visual impacts of the access road were adequately mitigated by the landscaping conditions. Furthermore, since the inn would not be visible from Highway 1, the existing open-space easement around the inn served no purpose and was inappropriate. Therefore, respondent maintained, the permit should be amended and reissued free of <em>any </em>open-space easement conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The State Commission staff report refuted the notion that the visual impacts of the access road and the structures were to be viewed independently with separate mitigation measures required for each use. Rather, the staff insisted that the original open-space easement was intended to mitigate the visual impact of the project <em>as a whole. </em>In other words, the State Commission staff took the position that in its original action on this permit, the Regional Commission had the option of mitigating the visual impacts of the <em>entire project </em>by placing an open-space easement on any portion of the property. It chose to place an open-space easement around the inn. The easement now could be moved to the northwest slope of the property because it would serve the same purpose of the original easement\u2014mitigation of the visual effects of the project as a whole. The staff recommended the State Commission move the open-space easement to the access road area \u201cresulting in a different area of open-space protection but nevertheless similar long term visual protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">After spirited debate, the State Commission denied respondent\u2019s request to delete all open-space easement conditions from his development permit and approved the staff recommendation moving the open-space easement to the access road area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Respondent filed for writ of administrative mandamus challenging the open space easement condition imposed by the State Commission. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The trial court granted the writ and mandated the State Commission \u201cto strike all open-space easement conditions from [re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>spondent\u2019s] coastal development permit.\u201d The factual narrative accompanying the court\u2019s decision reflected the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the two open-space easements were \u201cintended for different purposes.\u201d Specifically, the court found the first easement around the inn was imposed to protect the view from Highway 1; the second easement was imposed to mitigate the visual impact of the road. The court reasoned, \u201cHowever, the Commission had previously approved use of the road without this easement. Therefore it was unnecessary.\u201d The trial court concluded the State Commission had proceeded in excess of jurisdiction and had abused its discretion in requiring \u201can open-space easement from a landowner whose project, without the easement, already complies with the [Coastal] Act.\u201d The court further found the State Commission had abused its discretion, had made a decision not supported by its findings, and had acted unconstitutionally because no burden was imposed on the public which justified imposition of the permit condition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Preliminarily, we must determine whether the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d or \u201cindependent judgment\u201d test applies to the review of the mandamus judgment herein.  If the substantial evidence test applies (as the State Commission contends) the role of the trial court and this court are identical\u2014we must scrutinize the administrative record and determine whether substantial evidence supports the State Commission\u2019s findings and whether these findings support its decision. In making these determinations, the reviewing court must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the State Commission\u2019s findings and decision. <em>(Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12]; <em>Pescosolido </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 964, 970 [191 Cal.Rptr. 415].) If the independent judgment test applies (as respondent contends) the trial court was authorized to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and this court can overturn its findings only if the evidence received by the trial court, including the administrative record, is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the <em>trial court\u2019s </em>findings. <em>(Whaler\u2019s Village Club </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 240, 251 [220 Cal.Rptr. 2].) We emphasize the critical distinction\u2014under the substantial evidence test, the appellate court and the trial court perform the identical function of reviewing the administrative record to determine whether the State Commission\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Under the independent judgment test, the appellate court reviews the administrative record to determine whether the <em>trial court\u2019s </em>findings are supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Central Coast Regional Com. </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 833, 842 [130 Cal.Rptr. 169].)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Unless a fundamental vested right is involved, the substantial evidence test is to be applied by both the trial court and the appellate court. <em>(City of Walnut Creek </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 1012, 1016 [162 Cal.Rptr. 224].)  Respondent had neither a vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>right to develop his property in a particular fashion nor did he have a vested right to a permit free of conditions; therefore, the trial court should have determined only whether the State Commission\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence. (Accord, <em>Whaler\u2019s Village Club </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 250-251; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Central Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>58 Cal.App.3d at p. 842; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 700, 707-708 [129 Cal.Rptr. 417].)  Accordingly, we must determine whether (1) the findings of the State Commission are legally sufficient, and (2) whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and support the State Commission\u2019s decision. <em>(Markley </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 656, 672-673 [182 Cal.Rptr. 659].) Our inquiry, as was the trial court\u2019s, is limited to the record made before the State Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Franz </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 124, 142-143 [181 Cal.Rptr. 732, 642 P.2d 792]; <em>Grupe </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 148, 163 [212 Cal.Rptr. 578]; <em>City of Walnut Creek </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d at p. 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">The commission staff made certain findings which were adopted by the State Commission. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 13092, subd. (d).) Among those findings was a determination that \u201cthe previous permit conditions adequately protect the visual resource and can be deleted <em>only if </em>there is an <em>alternative means </em>of achieving this lost mitigation.\u201d (Italics added.) The State Commission found that placing the open-space easement over the northwest slope and imposing a deed restriction requiring State Commission review of any request for future development \u201cwill bring the project into conformance with the Coastal Act and are necessary to assure the continued protection of the major visual resource of the Navarro Head area . . . .\u201d There is ample substantial evidence in the record to support these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The administrative record acknowledges that respondent\u2019s project will serve visitors, which is designated a \u201cpriority\u201d use under the Coastal Act. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30222.) However, this consideration is balanced with a concern that the project be developed in such fashion that the adverse impacts, whether significant or not, be sufficiently mitigated. The importance of preserving the rural character of this highly scenic portion of the Mendocino coast is recognized in Public Resources Code section 30251, which states: \u201cThe scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of public importance. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of natural land forms, [and] to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas . . . .\u201d It is self-evident that permit approval to construct an inn, single family residence, dining room, parking lot and access road, no matter how artfully designed, significantly impairs the scenic qualities of this area. The permit proceedings, while obviously cataloging the adverse impacts of each individual component of the project, clearly involved the overriding concern that the project <em>as a whole </em>be conditioned to provide scenic protection as required by the Coastal Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In granting respondent a coastal development permit subject to an open-space easement condition, the Regional Commission attempted to strike a balance between ensuring that sufficient sites be developed to accommodate visitors and making certain that the proposed development \u201cbe visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas . . . .\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">At the hearing before the State Commission on November 18, 1982, respondent presented his theory\u2014adopted by the trial court\u2014that the open-space easement was unnecessary because his project, absent the open-space easement, met the requirements of the Coastal Act. The State Commission rejected this hypothesis. Its refusal to strike the open-space easement condition from respondent\u2019s permit was predicated on its finding that the first easement could be removed \u201conly if the adverse visual effects of the project [were] mitigated through\u201d other means. There is substantial evidence in the administrative record supporting this finding, and the State Commission\u2019s findings support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The trial court, while finding the State Commission\u2019s imposition of an open-space easement condition an abuse of discretion, also found the action \u201cunconstitutional because no public burden exists as found by the Commission.\u201d  It is generally recognized that \u201c[i]f as a condition to receipt of a permit, the applicant must donate property for a public use that bears no relationship to the benefit conferred on the applicant or the burden imposed on the public, there is a taking of property without payment of just compensation in violation of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(Remmenga </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 623, 627 [209 Cal.Rptr. 628]; see also <em>Liberty </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 491 [170 Cal.Rptr. 247].)  However, the record contains no evidentiary support for respondent\u2019s claim that the imposition of this open-space easement condition constituted an unconstitutional exercise of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In reviewing the action of the State Commission, we are bound by the reasoning of <em>Associated Home Builders, etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 633 [94 Cal.Rptr. 630, 484 P.2d 606, 43 A.L.R.3d 847], In <em>Associated Home Builders </em>our Supreme Court considered a challenge to a statute which conferred upon cities and counties the power to require dedication of land or payment of fees for park or recreational purposes as a condition of subdivision approval. The purpose of requiring the dedication of land was to preserve open space for the recreational use of residents of the new subdivisions. The primary challenge to the statute was that it deprived a subdivider of property without just compensation. The court upheld the constitutionality of the dedication requirement, finding a constitutionally sufficient nexus between the subdivider who \u201crealizes a profit from governmental approval of a subdivision\u201d and \u201cthe influx of new residents [which] will increase the need for park and recreational facilities.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The clear weight of authority, relying on <em>Associated Home Builders, </em>upholds the constitutionality of development permit conditions similar to those imposed on respondent. The requirement of uncompensated dedication of public access as a condition of approving new coastal development has been consistently upheld as constitutional. <em>(Whaler\u2019s Village Club </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 255-262; <em>Grupe </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 165; <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 678, 699 [183 Cal.Rptr. 395].)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The court in <em>Sea Ranch Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com\u2019n. </em>(N.D. Cal. 1981) 527 F.Supp. 390, vacated because of mootness in 454 U.S. 1070 [70 L.Ed.2d 606, 102 S.Ct. 622], condensed the law in this area: \u201c[The] cases indicate planning bodies may condition development on aesthetic conditions or dedications of property for public recreational facilities or access. The fact that the development has no direct nexus to the condition, that the benefit to the public is greater than to the developer, or that future needs are taken into consideration, does not destroy the validity of the condition. The court is free to look to these factors, as well as the general goals behind the authorizing statute, in evaluating the reasonableness of the regulation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 395, fn. omitted; see also <em>Remmenga </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com., supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 623 [upholding the requirement of a payment of $5,000 in lieu of dedication of a right of way to the coast].)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The open-space easement condition imposed on respondent\u2019s building permit is directly related to the disappearance of open land in the coastal region\u2014an exigency to which respondent\u2019s project definitely contributes. We therefore conclude that the open-space easement condition imposed in this case was reasonably related to one of the principal objectives of the Coastal Act, which is to preserve the \u201cscenic and visual qualities of coastal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>areas,\u201d and was supported by the evidence in the record. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Respondent presents the unique argument, unsupported by authority, that dedication of the open-space easement binds the hands of future commissions and deprives him, as a property owner, of the right to a hearing on future development. As respondent puts it, \u201c[b]y indelibly recording its opinion about future development in [respondent\u2019s] chain of title, the present commission would be able to bind the hands of future commissions which might otherwise have granted a future [development] permit application for [respondent] or his successors.\u201d The short and obvious answer to this argument is that the Regional Commission\u2019s approval of respondent\u2019s project <em>equally </em>binds the hands of future commissions which might have been more disposed to preserving Navarro Head in its natural and undeveloped state. The project will permanently alter this site, and the limited protection afforded by the open-space easement should be of similar duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the trial court is directed to deny the petition for writ of administrative mandamus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Low, P. J., and King, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 14, 1986, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 7, 1986. Lucas, J., and Panelli, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-11\">The scenic importance of the area is described in near-lyrical fashion in the general plan: \u201c[Navarro Head] is especially important because it is many visitors\u2019 introduction to the Mendocino coast. To travelers emerging from the dense redwood forest of Highway 128, the fog, wind, winding road and grassy hillsides above the high bluffs and surf convey the wildness and inaccessibility that make the drive worthwhile.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">An open-space easement is an instrument whereby the owner relinquishes to the public the right to construct improvements upon the land, effectively preserving for public use or enjoyment the natural or scenic character of the open-space land. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 51051.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The appeal focused on the visual impact of the road and questioned \u201chow the undeveloped character of the area within the coastal view zone can be maintained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\">It was argued \u201cthe [open-space easement] condition would in fact provide no scenic protection because the area to be covered by easements is east of the ridgeline, on the downslope of the bluff top, and <em>not visible from Highway 1. </em>Because the condition was clearly intended to preserve the view but yet could not physically serve that purpose, it should be abandoned.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\">One of the commissioner\u2019s comments gives an insight into the State Commission\u2019s reasoning process: \u201c[T]here seem to be two different ways of doing the same thing which is to preserve as much as possible the open and pristine area of this hill allowing a developer a chance to go ahead with his project, and, in my view, the developer would be much better off with an easement on the front steep slope where a driveway is already going which then gives him a chance to expand around his building than the present sort of garter belt which was around the building where he didn\u2019t have any chance to expand. . . . [I]t seems to me that the revised staff easement does the same thing of preserving the area but gives more flexibility and benefit to the developer, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re being incompatible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">With this elementary rule of mandamus review, we disregard numerous theories advanced by respondent to uphold the trial court\u2019s grant of administrative mandate which were <em>not </em>advanced below. The painstaking process of narrowing down the asserted issues to those appearing on record at the administrative level was unnecessary and counterproductive to a prompt resolution of this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">This conclusion is bolstered by comments made at the hearing by the chairman of the State Commission who participated in the original decision to impose an open-space easement condition on respondent\u2019s development permit. His \u201crecollection [was] that the open space easement was mitigation not only for the road but for the structure as well on the top of this prominent location.\u201d He later reiterated his \u201crecollection that mitigation applied to the project as a whole.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The State Commission urges this court to render an opinion on whether the commission <em>should have accepted </em>respondent\u2019s offer in the spring of 1983 to deed an open-space easement subject to certain enumerated conditions. The State Commission also makes an argument against respondent\u2019s receipt of attorney\u2019s fees, <em>should </em>the trial court attempt to order them in the future. We decline to discuss the merits of either issue. \u201cAn appellate court will not review questions which are moot and which are only of academic importance. It will not undertake to determine abstract questions of law at the request of a party who shows that no substantial rights can be affected by the decision either way.\u201d <em>(Keefer </em>v. <em>Keefer </em>(1939) 31 Cal.App.2d 335, 337 [87 P.2d 856].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
