Following our first decision holding the ordinance invalid as entirely preempted by state law, the Supreme Court granted hearing and, in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 277 [219 Cal.Rptr. 467, 707 P.2d 840], held that only two, severable parts of the ordinance were preempted. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 292, 304.) The court declined to reach further constitutional arguments directed against the remainder of the ordinance, however. Instead, the court retransferred the cause to us with directions to consider those issues on the merits but only if we should first find that the superior court abused its discretion in denying the application for preliminary injunction on the implied ground of failure to satisfy the \u201cinterim harm\u201d factor necessary for issuance of the injunction. (Pp. 289-290.) We will conclude that the superior court did not so abuse its discretion and, accordingly, will not address the constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We recapitulate part of the Supreme Court\u2019s summary of how the ordinance operates. \u201cThe ordinance imposes a permit requirement upon any person engaged in, conducting, or carrying on the operation of an \u2018escort service.\u2019 (\u00a7 1074.2.) An \u2018escort service\u2019 is defined as \u2018[a]ny business, agency or person who, for a fee, commission, hire, reward or profit, furnishes or offers to furnish names of persons, or who introduces, furnishes or arranges for persons, who may accompany other persons to or about social affairs, entertainments or places of amusement, or who may consort with others about any place of public resort or within any private quarters.\u2019 (\u00a7 1074.1.) Similarly, an \u2018escort\u2019 is defined as \u2018[a]ny person who, for a fee, commission, hire, reward or profit, accompanies other persons to or about social affairs, entertainments or places of amusement or consorts with others about any place of public resort or within any private quarters.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201cIn order to obtain an escort service permit, the applicant must fill out an application which calls for a personal description, a current and two previous addresses and a prior business or employment record. Also, three portrait photographs must be furnished, a listing of all criminal convictions except minor traffic violations must be provided, written proof of majority must be shown, and \u2018[sjuch other identification and information necessary to discover the [foregoing] matters\u2019 must be submitted. (\u00a7 1074.4.) The chief of police is permitted to take the applicant\u2019s fingerprints and additional photographs and may \u2018confirm, by independent investigation, the truth and accuracy of the . . . information [provided in the application].\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u201cThe ordinance also requires any escort or other employee who works in an escort service in San Francisco or performs any such service in the city to secure a permit. The employee permit application requires information similar to that required for a service permit. (\u00a7\u00a7 1074.5, 1074.7.)\u201d <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>at pp. 284-285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Within 14 days after a noticed public hearing, a permit must issue \u201cunless: (1) the operation \u2018would not have complied with all applicable laws, including but not limited to, the Building, City Planning, Housing and Fire Codes of the City . . . and the rules and regulations adopted by the Chief of Police pursuant to this Article;\u2019 (2) the applicant has had a prior license revoked by the city, the state, or the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission; or (3) the applicant has been convicted of any offense which (i) requires sex offender registration (Pen. Code, \u00a7 290), (ii) involves the \u2018use of force and violence upon the person of another\u2019 or sexual misconduct with children, or (iii) is described in Penal Code sections 311, 647, subdivision (a), 647a, 647, subdivision (b), 315, 316, 318 or 266 through 267. (\u00a7 1074.12.) ....</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u201cBeyond the permit process, the ordinance requires that both clients and employees be at least 18 years old (\u00a7\u00a7 1074.16, 1074.17) and that each escort service keep a daily register containing the identity and hours of employment of each employee. The register must contain the \u2018true\u2019 name and address of each patron, along with the hours, the fee charged, and the location where the service was used. This register is \u2018at all times during business hours . . . subject to inspection\u2019 by the police and health departments and must be maintained on the premises for one year. (\u00a7 1074.21.)\u201d <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>at p. 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u201cOnce issued, a permit may be revoked after a hearing if the permittee has engaged in conduct which violates any provision of the ordinance,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>any implementing rules and regulations adopted by the chief of police, or any state or local law. Revocation may result \u2018in any case where the permittee or licensee refuses to permit any duly authorized police officer . . . to inspect the premises or the operations therein . . . .\u2019 (\u00a7 1074.15.)\u201d <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>at pp. 285-286, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u201cThe granting or denying of a preliminary injunction does not constitute an adjudication of the ultimate rights in controversy. [Citations.] Generally, the ruling on an application for a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. The exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that it has been abused. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Trial courts should evaluate two interrelated factors when deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction. The first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial. The second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued. <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>at p. 286.) \u201cWhen a trial court denies an application for a preliminary injunction, it implicitly determines that the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy either or both of the \u2018interim harm\u2019 and \u2018likelihood of prevailing on the merits\u2019 factors.  On appeal, the question becomes whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on <em>both </em>factors. Even if the appellate court finds that the trial court abused its discretion as to one of the factors, it nevertheless may affirm the trial court\u2019s order if it finds no abuse of discretion as to the other.\u201d <em>(Id,., </em>at pp. 286-287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In our first decision, we expressly declined to consider the \u201cinterim harm\u201d factor, relying on Court of Appeal and Supreme Court decisions which had not considered that factor when presented with only questions of law on undisputed material facts. The Supreme Court in <em>Cohen, </em>however, distinguished those decisions as ones in which the parties apparently had not disputed the point on appeal. The court then clarified that an assessment of interim harm is always necessary where the issue is in dispute. <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 287-289.) Accordingly, and since respondents in this case did raise the point in this court, we have been directed to consider the \u201cinterim harm\u201d factor and, if we find no abuse of discretion, to affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the order denying the preliminary injunction. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 289.) Only if we find an abuse of discretion are we to consider the \u201clikelihood of prevailing on the merits\u201d factor, which in this case presents pure questions of law that can be addressed as though the case had proceeded to trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (P. 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Beyond the preemption argument addressed in <em>Cohen, </em>appellants attack the ordinance as unconstitutionally infringing or \u201cchilling\u201d protected rights to free speech and association by, inter alia, (1) denying all minors permits, (2) defining too vaguely and broadly who and what conduct is covered (especially language describing persons who \u201caccompany\u201d or \u201cconsort with\u201d others for remuneration), (3) operating as a prior restraint (the permit requirement), (4) potentially intruding on the attorney-client relationship for those clients who, for a fee, are referred to an attorney for consultation, and (5) delegating unfettered discretion to the chief of police to promulgate and enforce rules and regulations. The requirements of kept registers and unannounced police inspections are challenged as unconstitutional abridgements of rights to privacy, counsel, and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. The ordinance\u2019s criminal sanctions are challenged as unsupported by adequate notice of what conduct is proscribed. The ordinance is also alleged to single out \u201cescort services\u201d for coverage, in violation of equal protection principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u201cTo qualify for preliminary injunctive relief plaintiffs must show irreparable injury, either existing or threatened. <em>(City of Santa Monica </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>[(1964)] 231 Cal.App.2d 223, 227 ....).. . [\u00b6]  Additionally, preliminary injunction is not an appropriate remedy \u2018[t]o prevent the execution of a public statute, by officers of the law, for the public benefit\u2019 or \u2018[t]o prevent the exercise of a public or private office, in a lawful manner, by the person in possession.\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3423; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526.) While these general strictures do not preclude the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief when the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance is challenged, nevertheless, \u2018. . . trial courts should be extremely cautious ... to enjoin law enforcement officials from enforcing an ordinance obviously approved and adopted by duly elected representatives of the people for the purpose of promoting and protecting public morality <em>prior to a trial on the merits. </em>\u2019 (Italics in original.) <em>(City of Santa Monica </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at 226.)\u201d <em>(7978 Corporation </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 42, 46 [115 Cal.Rptr. 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>There are two plaintiffs-appellants in this action.  Bruce Cohen sues as a resident taxpayer under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a to enjoin the illegal expenditure of public funds. Nowhere in the complaint or elsewhere has Cohen asserted any threat or injury to himself personally from the ordinance. His interest appears to be limited to his taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook, an interest which is sufficient to confer statutory standing to maintain this action and bring it to a final judgment permanently enjoining unlawful expenditures <em>(Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 267-270 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206]) but which to our knowledge has never been held to substitute for the high degree of existing or threatened injury required for the <em>prejudgment </em>injunctive relief sought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Citing the policy that section 526a is to be liberally construed to achieve its remedial purpose of allowing taxpayers to challenge illegal government activity without a showing of special damage to the particular taxpayer <em>(Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 268-269 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206]; see also <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757, 764-765 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 533 P.2d 222]), appellants insist that we must \u201cconclusively presume\u201d irreparable injury and a balance of interim harms in their favor. All that is required to trigger the presumption, they argue, is a bare showing that public funds are about to be expended in an unconstitutional or otherwise illegal manner. The proposed standard would automatically equate illegal spending with a right to preliminary injunctive relief. For two reasons, that cannot be. First, the <em>Cohen </em>decision demands consideration of interim harm as a related <em>but distinct </em>question from the underlying merits of the challenge. The proposed rule would leave only the consideration of illegality, and the balance of harms would automatically follow in every case. Second, treating the balance of interim harms as a conclusive presumption leaves no room for a true <em>balancing. </em>The preliminary injunction would have to issue in every case where some illegality appeared, no matter how strong the countervailing showing of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It follows that appellants could not prevail on the balance of interim harms factor by virtue of Cohen\u2019s taxpayer standing alone, and we have already seen that Cohen claimed no further actual or threatened harm to himself personally. No affidavits or other documents were presented to show that persons in the community at large felt imminently threatened. The ordinance had not yet been enforced, and the chief of police had not adopted rules or regulations. Appellants\u2019 worst fears that the ordinance would be applied indiscriminately or enforced unreasonably were speculative. No one had yet been threatened with arrest, prosecution, or the denial or loss of a permit. There was no showing, for example, that employees of escort services at that time included minors or persons with prior offenses that might preclude either their employment or the business obtaining a permit. The sole show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ing, in fact, was the face of the ordinance which, among other things, called for patrons to register, and for applicants and employees to provide the required identification and background information. The trial court presumably balanced the extent to which such disclosures might inhibit the exercise of First Amendment freedoms (cf. <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 757, 767-772 [chilling effect of unrestricted undercover police surveillance in university classrooms noted]) against respondents\u2019 showing of harm should enforcement be enjoined pending the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Appellant Keegan G. Low does allege threatened personal harm but only to the extent that the ordinance might affect his occupation as an attorney practicing within the city. Low declares that he risks prosecution in his practice\u2014particularly where he is referred potential clients through the Lawyer Referral Service of the Bar Association of San Francisco\u2014in that he is unable to determine from reading the ordinance whether his \u201cconduct in associating, consulting, and consorting with clients referred to [him] from the Lawyer Referral Service, falls within the definitions contained in the ordinance.\u201d He claims to be unsure whether to apply for a permit before taking future referrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Supreme Court has in essence resolved this claim by dismissing a similar argument, made in the preemption context, that the ordinance is an invalid attempt to regulate the practice of law. The court stated: \u201cThis claim is without merit. . . . [\u00b6] No provision of the escort service ordinance explicitly or implicitly regulates the practice of law. An \u2018escort\u2019 is defined as any person who, for money or other consideration, may \u2018accompan[y] [or] consort[] with others about any place of public resort or within any private quarters.\u2019 (\u00a7 1074.1, subd. (b).) <em>Even a broad reading of that definition cannot reasonably be said to include attorneys engaged in the practice of law.\" (Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 277, 302-303, italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, Captain Diarmud J. Philpott specifically declared in opposition to the application for preliminary injunction that, as the individual charged with responsibility for enforcing the ordinance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he did not understand the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>nance to apply to businesses such as legal referral services and would not so enforce the ordinance unless, after investigation of a citizen complaint, it appeared that the business was \u201cactually operating\u201d as the type of business that generally advertizes itself as an \u201cescort service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Against appellants\u2019 showing, respondents offered the declaration of Captain Philpott, which revealed the need to regulate escort services. Based on his four years combined experience as captain and commanding officer of the vice crimes division and as a lieutenant in charge of that division\u2019s prostitution and gambling bureau (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>he declared: \u201cI formed the opinion that virtually every escort service operating in the City and County of San Francisco was a front for prostitution. In addition, I was aware that employees of escort services in San Francisco were frequently involved, during working hours, in activities which led to charges of theft or which involved missing persons, assault, and murder.\u201d He also recalled testifying as a police representative before the finance committee for the board of supervisors that regulation of escort services was needed: \u201cI testified that escort services in San Francisco are frequently fronts for prostitution and provide an opportunity for theft, extortion and bodily harm against customers . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Absent a greater showing of harm to appellants and in light of the apparent harm that would befall the city and county if enforcement of the ordinance were enjoined, the trial court acted within its discretion in impliedly finding against appellants on the interim harm factor. Accordingly, we cannot consider the merits of appellants\u2019 constitutional arguments and must affirm the order appealed from. <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 277, 289.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The order of September 18, 1981, denying the application for preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Kline, P. J., and Rouse, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 6, 1986.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Those provisions of the ordinance prohibiting any escort from engaging \u201cin any type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>criminal conduct with a customer\u201d (\u00a7 1074.22, subd. (A)) and forbidding anyone to aid and abet a violation of the ordinance (to the extent that such violation consists of a violation of state law) (\u00a7 1074.23) are now declared preempted and hence invalid. <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 292.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Three aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the case are particularly perplexing. First, neither in their petition for rehearing in this court nor in their petition in the Supreme Court did respondents raise the \u201cinterim harm\u201d issue. The high court evidently urged the issue itself. Second, that court was in the identical position as this court to review the record on this point, and yet it chose to return the case to us (see <em>Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 304, conc. and dis. opn. by Mosk, J.). Third, the high court violated its own rule by addressing the merits of the preemption issue without first finding an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u201cIt is no doubt quite common for a lawyer during the course of the lawyer-client relationship to \u2018accompany\u2019 a client to a \u2018place of public resort\u2019 such as a restaurant or social club. The client may also pay the lawyer for his or her time during such an outing, as well as the expenses of the meeting. However, even in such circumstances, it is rare that the lawyer is paid for providing the client with social company. Rather, it is far more likely that he or she is paid for providing legal advice during the meeting. The rendering of legal services which may involve an occasional social meeting in a public place does not transform the attorney-client relationship into one of \u2018escort\u2019 and \u2018patron\u2019 as those terms are used in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201cThe same reasoning applies even if the \u2018accompanying\u2019 or \u2018consorting\u2019 takes place \u2018within any private quarters\u2019 such as the lawyer\u2019s office or the client\u2019s place of business.\u201d <em>(Cohen, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 303-304.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Captain Philpott is the commanding officer for the department\u2019s vice crimes division, which includes the prostitution and gambling bureau and the narcotics bureau.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
