J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeWu\">Plaintiff William Donohue appeals from judgment entered against him and in favor of defendant State of California following the granting of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">Plaintiff commenced an action to recover damages for personal injuries and property damage sustained when plaintiff\u2019s car was struck by a car driven by John Coronado, a minor, while Coronado was taking the driving portion of his examination for issuance of a California driver license. The complaint contained two causes of action. The second cause of action, directed against the State of California and Vickey Hadley, a driving examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>employed by the Department of Motor Vehicles,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged: Defendants negligently instructed, directed and controlled Coronado in his driving examination and failed properly to supervise him in the performance of the examination; defendants further failed to keep a proper lookout for oncoming traffic and to warn Coronado of such traffic; as a direct and proximate result of defendants\u2019 negligence, the car driven by Coronado collided with plaintiff\u2019s car causing plaintiff to sustain personal injuries and damaging his car; prior to the filing of the complaint the State Board of Control rejected plaintiff\u2019s verified claim for damages sustained in the accident. Attached to the complaint, and incorporated therein by reference, was a copy of the claim which recited that agents, employees and representatives of the State of California, Department of Motor Vehicles, negligently performed their duties \u201cso as to permit an uninsured motorist to take a driver\u2019s test\u201d and drive upon a public street where such motorist caused a collision with plaintiff\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Defendant State of California demurred generally to the second cause of action on the ground that the description of defendant\u2019s negligence set forth in the claim differs materially from the allegations of defendant\u2019s negligence contained in the complaint. The demurrer was overruled. Thereafter, in September 1979, defendant answered the complaint. In June 1983 defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground previously asserted in the demurrer. The motion was denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September 1983 defendant moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for an order specifying that certain issues are without substantial controversy. The motion for summary judgment was denied but the court determined that nine of the fourteen issues listed by defendant are without substantial controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">On April 20, 1984, defendant again moved for judgment on the pleadings, repeating its argument that the action may not be maintained because the facts alleged in the complaint as a basis for defendant\u2019s liability were not set forth in plaintiff\u2019s claim. As additional grounds for the motion defendant contended it owed no duty to plaintiff and, in any event, is not liable under principles of sovereign immunity. On April 30, 1984, the motion was denied. On October 31, 1984, plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the complaint was granted, and defendant\u2019s answer was deemed responsive to the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>complaint. Defendant orally moved for judgment on the pleadings apparently on the grounds set forth in its April 30 motion. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment entered in favor of defendant and against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Before considering plaintiff\u2019s contentions, we note a point ignored by the parties. The notice of entry of judgment indicates that judgment was entered pursuant to the order granting defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and plaintiff purports to appeal from such a judgment. The record contains no judgment; it contains only an order granting the motion. In view of the requirement that a clerk\u2019s transcript contain the judgment appealed from, whether or not designated by the parties (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5(d)), it must be presumed that no judgment was prepared, signed and entered. However, plaintiff\u2019s attempt to appeal from a nonexistent judgment does not require dismissal of the appeal. The merits of the appeal have been fully briefed by both parties and no prejudice to defendant would result from considering the merits. Under these circumstances, \u201c[t]o dismiss the appeal \u2018merely to have a judgment formally entered below with a new appeal would be a useless waste of judicial and litigant time. \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dominguez </em>v. <em>City of Alhambra </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 237, 242 [173 Cal.Rptr. 345].) Accordingly, we order the trial court to enter, nunc pro tunc as of the date of the order granting defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, a judgment dismissing the action as to defendant (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 581, subd. (c), 58Id), and we then construe the notice of appeal to refer to such judgment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Plaintiff contends that because the complaint was upheld as against a general demurrer and two motions for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court abused its discretion in granting defendant\u2019s third motion for judgment on the pleadings. We do not agree. \u201cA motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself. [Citation.] The motion may be made even when a general demurrer has been previously overruled. The interests of all parties are advanced by avoiding a trial and reversal for defect in pleadings. The objecting party is acting properly in raising the point at his first opportunity, by general demurrer. If the demurrer is erroneously overruled, he is acting properly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>raising the point again, at his next opportunity. If the trial judge made the former ruling himself, he is not bound by it. [Citation.] And, if the demurrer was overruled by a different judge, the trial judge is equally free to reexamine the sufficiency of the pleading. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ion Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877 [173 Cal.Rptr. 361].) In its first motion for judgment on the pleadings defendant argued that the action is barred because of the variance between plaintiff\u2019s claim and the allegations of the complaint. This court summarily denied defendant\u2019s petition for an extraordinary writ to require the trial court to set aside its order denying the motion and enter an order granting the motion (see fn. 2).  The summary denial, without opinion, of a petition for a writ is not res judicata. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Marandola) </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 444, 447 [158 Cal.Rptr. 739].) Accordingly, the trial court was free to grant a later motion for judgment on the pleadings based in part on the ground asserted in the earlier motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Also without merit is plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court, after denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on April 30, 1984, acted contrary to law in reconsidering and granting the motion on October 31 absent compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well established that a trial court retains jurisdiction and the discretion to hear a renewed motion after denying previously such a motion, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1008, or its predecessor, section 182.\u201d <em>(Strick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 916, 921 [192 Cal.Rptr. 314].)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Plaintiff further argues that because the trial court, in response to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, refused to find that certain issues are without substantial controversy, there remained triable issues of fact and judgment on the pleadings therefore was precluded. This argument ignores the distinction between the respective functions of motion for summary judgment and motion for judgment on the pleadings.  The purpose of a summary judgment proceeding is to permit a party to show that material factual claims arising from the pleadings need not be tried because they are not in dispute. <em>(Andalon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>600, 605 [208 Cal.Rptr. 899].) \u201c \u2018The procedure for the entry of a summary judgment provides a method by which, if the pleadings are not defective, the court may determine whether the triable issues apparently raised by them are real or merely the product of adept pleading.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Architects Collaborative </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 110, 118-119 [166 Cal.Rptr. 184].)  On the other hand a motion for judgment on the pleadings, like a general demurrer, challenges the sufficiency of a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. <em>(Tiffany </em>v. <em>Sierra Sands Unified School Dist. </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 218, 224 [162 Cal.Rptr. 669].) Such a motion raises a legal, not a factual, issue <em>(Hospital Council of Northern Cal. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 331, 337-338 [106 Cal.Rptr. 247]) and that issue is simply whether the complaint states a cause of action. <em>(Goodley </em>v. <em>Wank &amp; Wank, Inc. </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 389, 392-393 [133 Cal.Rptr. 83].)  Thus, regardless of the existence of triable issues of fact, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly granted if the complaint does not state a cause of action for any of the reasons set forth in the motion. (See <em>Longshore </em>v. <em>County of Ventura </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 14, 21 [157 Cal.Rptr. 706, 598 P.2d 866].)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Defendant successfully moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground, among others, that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it alleges, as the basis of defendant\u2019s liability, facts not set forth in plaintiff\u2019s written claim presented to and rejected by the State Board of Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The filing of a proper claim pursuant to Government Code section 910<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action against the state for damages caused by tort. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 905.2, 945.4; <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 454 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223]; <em>Bozaich </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 688, 696 [108 Cal.Rptr. 392].) \u201cIf a plaintiff relies on more than one theory of recovery against the State, each cause of action must have been reflected in a timely claim. In addition, the factual circumstances set forth in the written claim must correspond with the facts alleged in the complaint; even if the claim were timely, the complaint is vulnerable to a demurrer if it alleges a factual basis for recovery which is not fairly reflected in the written claim.\u201d <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1982) 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Cal.App.3d 72, 79 [188 Cal.Rptr. 479]. See also <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Permanente Medical Group </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 673, 676-677 [171 Cal.Rptr. 527]; <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 66, 82-83 [128 Cal.Rptr. 454]; <em>Connelly </em>v. State <em>of California </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 744, 747, 753 [84 Cal.Rptr. 257].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s verified claim, after setting forth his name and address, stated: \u201c3. Date and Place of Accident: The accident in question occurred on March 31, 1978 at 11:44 a.m. in the City of West Covina, County of Los Angeles, State of California. [\u00b6] 4. General Description of Injuries: At the above time, place and date, agents, employees, and representatives of the State of California, Department of Motor Vehicles, so negligently, carelessly and recklessly managed, supervised, controlled and performed their duties so [sic] as to permit an uninsured motorist to take a driver\u2019s test thereby allowing said testee to drive upon a public street wherein said testee caused a collision with claimant\u2019s vehicle thereby causing severe personal injuries to claimant and nervous shock and disorder to claimant with resulting loss in income. [\u00b6] 5. Amount Claimed: $300,000 for general damages and all medical and related expenses.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that defendant \u201cnegligently and carelessly instructed, directed [and] controlled\u201d Coronado in his driving examination, negligently failed properly to supervise him in the performance of his examination, and negligently failed to keep a proper lookout for, and warn Coronado of, oncoming traffic; as a result of defendant\u2019s negligence \u201cor wrongful act or omission,\u201d the car driven by Coronado collided with plaintiff\u2019s car causing plaintiff to sustain personal injuries and damaging his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 744, judgment of dismissal was affirmed as to causes of action alleging damage to property caused by negligent release of water from state-operated dams where a claim for damages filed with the State Board of Control alleged that state representatives negligently provided plaintiff with inaccurate information about the anticipated rise in a river. Said the court: \u201cAppellant\u2019s claim presented to the State Board of Control alleged that his damages resulted from erroneous information regarding the anticipated rise in the level of the Sacramento River. No mention is made of negligence in the operation of the dams. Hence, in the light of the requirement (Gov. Code, \u00a7 910 et seq.) that an action of this character be preceded by a proper claim, the demurrer as to these causes of action was properly sustained without leave to amend.\u201d (3 Cal.App.3d at p. 753.) In <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d 72, a prisoner presented a claim against the state for medical malpractice in failing to diagnose and treat his medical problems. In an action filed following denial of the claim, the amended complaint alleged that the state breached a duty owed to plaintiff to summon immediate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>competent medical attention. In affirming judgment of dismissal entered upon the sustaining of defendant\u2019s demurrer to the amended complaint without leave to amend, the court stated: \u201c[T]he facts set forth in plaintiff\u2019s claim clearly do not correspond with the facts alleged in the amended complaint. . . . The claim does not recite that his injury was the result of a failure on the part of any employee to summon immediate and competent medical care, but was the \u2018result of the failure of the Department of Corrections to diagnose and treat or allow claimant to maintain his ongoing medications. \u2019 \u201d (139 Cal.App.3d at p. 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In the present case plaintiff\u2019s written claim asserts that defendant was negligent in permitting an uninsured motorist to take a driving test, whereas the complaint alleges that defendant was negligent in failing to instruct, direct and control the motorist in his driving examination. The act of permitting an uninsured motorist to take a driving test is not the factual equivalent of the failure to control or direct the motorist in the course of his examination. Thus, as in <em>Connelly </em>and <em>Nelson, </em>the factual basis for recovery alleged in the complaint is not reflected in plaintiff\u2019s claim filed with the State Board of Control. It follows that defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Citing <em>Elias </em>v. <em>San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 70 [135 Cal.Rptr. 621], plaintiff argues that under the doctrine of substantial compliance his claim is sufficient to support this action. In <em>Elias </em>the court stated: \u201cThe primary function of the claims act is to apprise the governmental body of imminent legal action so that it may investigate and evaluate the claim and where appropriate, avoid litigation by settling meritorious claims. [Citations.] The act should not be applied to snare the unwary where its purpose has been satisfied [citations]; consequently courts employ a test of substantial rather than strict compliance in evaluating whether a plaintiff has met the demands of the claims act. [Citations.] <em>If the claim satisfies the purpose of the act without prejudice to the government, substantial compliance will be found. </em>\u201d (68 Cal.App.3d at p. 74; italics added.) If plaintiff\u2019s claim had asserted that the accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to control and supervise the motorist in the course of his driving examination, defendant might have concluded that the claim had merit and might have settled without the necessity of a lawsuit. By presenting a claim wherein defendant\u2019s liability was predicated solely on its negligence in allowing an uninsured motorist to take a driving test, plaintiff thwarted the purpose of the claims act and forced defendant to defend a lawsuit based on an entirely different state of facts. Accordingly, there is no basis for application of the doctrine of substantial compliance in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Plaintiff notes that the State Board of Control could have given him written notice of any insufficiency in his claim and argues that the board\u2019s failure to do so resulted in the waiver of any defense as to the sufficiency of the claim. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 910.8, 911.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The contention lacks merit. The insufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s claim lies in its failure to set forth the factual basis for recovery alleged in the complaint; defendant could not have discovered such defect until plaintiff filed his complaint. Defendant raised the defense of insufficiency of the claim at the earliest opportunity by demurring to the complaint on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The trial court is directed to enter, nunc pro tunc as of October 31, 1984, a judgment dismissing the action as to defendant State of California.
