(Michael), a minor, appeals from an order of the juvenile court continuing his status as a ward (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 602, <em>777),</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>removing him from the custody of his parents (\u00a7 726), and committing him to the Youth Authority (\u00a7 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In this case of first impression,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we are called upon to decide whether a juvenile court judge may consider previously suppressed evidence during the disposition phase of a juvenile delinquency proceeding. Absent a statute to the contrary, we have concluded there is no constitutional bar, state or federal, to the consideration of such evidence at a disposition hearing. Indeed, the Arnold-Kennick Juvenile Court Law (\u00a7 200 et seq.) expressly provides that the juvenile court \u201cshall receive in evidence\u201d such \u201crelevant and material evidence as may be offered\u201d on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the minor. (\u00a7 706; see also \u00a7 725.5.) It was therefore proper for the juvenile court to consider at Michael\u2019s disposition hearing the fact that he was carrying three bindles of cocaine and $35 in currency when he was taken into custody, even though that same evidence had been ordered suppressed at an earlier stage in the juvenile proceedings. When considered with other evidence indicating the previous disposition had not been effective in rehabilitating Michael, we hold further that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in committing him to the Youth Authority. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">I. Procedural Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">A. <em>The Petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On August 30, 1984, separate petitions were filed against Michael pursuant to sections 602 and <em>777, </em>respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The section 602 petition alleged that Michael, on August 28, 1984, had possessed cocaine and had possessed cocaine for sale, in violation of Health and Safety Code sections 11350 and 11351. That same petition further alleged that based on these allegations, the previous disposition of the juvenile court had been ineffective in rehabilitating Michael, within the meaning of sections 726 and <em>777.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The section <em>777 </em>supplemental petition alleged that Michael had last appeared before the juvenile court on February 9, 1984, when he was declared a ward under section 602 for having committed a robbery. (Pen. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u00a7 211.) It was further alleged that in February, he had been ordered, inter alia, to obey all laws, to spend 60 days in juvenile hall, to refrain from the use of alcohol and drugs, and to remain out of the Chinatown area in Salinas. Finally, the supplemental petition alleged that the previous court order had been ineffective in rehabilitating Michael in that \u201con August 28, 1984, he was arrested for possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale on Soledad Street, [in] the Chinatown area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">B. <em>Suppression and Jurisdiction Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">1. <em>Suppression Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> Following detention and \u201cDennis H.\u201d hearings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the matter was set for a suppression hearing (\u00a7 700.1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a jurisdiction hearing as to both petitions. At that time, the parties stipulated that both the suppression and the jurisdictional issues would be submitted on the police report; that the first full paragraph of the police report was to be considered for purposes of probable cause only; that the police officers had no search or arrest warrant; and that the controlled substance seized from Michael was cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Briefly, the first paragraph of the police report (considered only on the probable cause issue) indicated that officers had received information that \u201ca Mexican male adult, named Michael, between the age of 17 and 19 years of age\u201d and wearing tan pants and a black leather jacket, was selling cocaine at a certain location in Chinatown. The police were told that the suspect kept bindles of what appeared to be cocaine in his jacket pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>According to the remaining portion of the police report (considered on all issues), the officers were in the Chinatown area, they approached Michael (who fit the general description given) and asked him if he had anything on him. Michael raised his arms away from his side and said nothing. The officer reached into Michael\u2019s left front pocket and found a bindle containing a white powder substance, which appeared to be cocaine. After taking Michael into custody for possession of cocaine, the officer searched Michael further and found two more bindles of cocaine and $35 in currency. After being advised of his rights, Michael acknowledged he had been dealing in cocaine for two weeks, but refused to give investigators specific information as to the supplier of his cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">At the suppression hearing, Michael challenged the admissibility of the cocaine bindles and currency found on him, as well as his later statements. Michael\u2019s motion to suppress was granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">2. <em>Jurisdictional Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Following its suppression ruling, the juvenile court judge found that none of the allegations in the section 602 petition were true. Referring to the section 777 supplemental petition, the judge noted that the allegations \u201cjust said [Michael] was arrested with possession of cocaine on Soledad Street in the Chinatown area, so that does indicate a violation of [a] condition of probation as to where he was located.\u201d He therefore found the allegations of the supplemental petition to be true. The matter was then set for a disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">C. <em>Disposition Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Before the disposition hearing, a probation report was prepared (see \u00a7\u00a7 280, 702; rule 1371(b)), which included within it a discussion of the circumstances of the violation on August 28, including references to the cocaine and currency previously ordered suppressed. The judge began the disposition hearing by indicating he had read the probation report and by stating his tentative views of the case: \u201cI will tell you frankly, I think it calls for Youth Authority.\u201d As one of his reasons,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge stated, \u201cI just think that anybody who is involved in a robbery [referring to Michael\u2019s prior offense] and then is down in this\u2014in the Chinatown area where he was told not to be, he lives close by, but he was told not to be in the area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>with three bin\u00f3les of cocaine and a hundred [sic] dollars on him,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] he is giving us a message loud and clear, [\u00b6] Now, having said that, I will be willing to have all kinds of arguments to the contrary to show why it shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">After defense counsel objected, the judge continued the matter so counsel could research and prepare points and authorities as to whether or not the suppressed evidence could be considered when determining a proper disposition. The court subsequently ordered Michael committed to the Youth Authority. In doing so, the court expressly considered \u201cthe fact that the minor was found in the forbidden area, as described in the probation report, and in possession of three bin\u00f3les of cocaine and $35.00 in currency.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">A. <em>Nature of Hearings on Supplemental Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> The precise issue in this case is whether, in a juvenile delinquency proceeding,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a juvenile court judge may consider previously suppressed evidence when making a determination of disposition<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on a supplemental petition filed pursuant to section 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Preliminarily, it is helpful to our analysis to clarify the nature of the hearing on a supplemental petition. The statutory law is silent on the subject. (See <em>In re Francis W. </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 892, 897 [117 Cal.Rptr. 277].) In his argument, the Attorney General seeks to analogize the hearing with parole or probation revocation hearings, and cites cases where the consideration of illegally seized evidence was upheld. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vandemark </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 522 F.2d 1019, 1022 [probation revocation]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayko </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 604, 609 [86 Cal.Rptr. 726] [same]; <em>In re Martinez </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 641, 650 [83 Cal.Rptr. 382, 463 P.2d 734] [parole revocation].) But a hearing on a supplemental petition is neither of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>these.  A juvenile court may neither grant <em>(In re Owen E. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 398, 403-404 [154 Cal.Rptr. 204, 592 P.2d 720]; <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 773, 787 [134 Cal.Rptr. 228]) nor revoke parole. <em>(In re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 315, 326-328 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684].) And analogies to an adult probation revocation hearing were rejected as \u201csuperficial\u201d by our Supreme Court in <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 235-236 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345]. Although each proceeding is triggered by a petition alleging acts of misconduct by a person already subject to the jurisdiction of the court, neither the purposes nor the consequences of these disparate proceedings are the same. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">To promote uniformity in practice and procedure in this area (see rule 1301(b)), the Judicial Council, acting pursuant to its constitutional and statutory authority (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6; \u00a7 265), has prescribed that a two-part hearing be held on a supplemental petition, analogous to the jurisdiction and disposition hearings held on the original petition. (Rule 1392(d); see Adv. Com. com., rule 1392(d), Deerings Ann. Rules of Court (1980 ed.) p. 423; 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1984 Supp.) Parent and Child, \u00a7 479A, p. 568.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\n                   As this rule is not inconsistent with statute, it has the force of positive law binding on the courts and parties in the same way as a procedural statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 705, 711-712 [180 Cal.Rptr. 196, 639 P.2d 267]; <em>Albermont Petroleum, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cunningham </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 84, 89 [9 Cal.Rptr. 405].)  It follows that when the juvenile court is determining the truth of the allegations of a supplemental petition, i.e., the jurisdictional phase, the minor is entitled to the same panoply of constitutional protections (including proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the benefits of the exclusionary rule) that he would have been entitled to on an original petition. <em>(In re Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 240; <em>In re Francis W., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at pp. 897-898.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thereafter, when determining the proper disposition on a supplemental petition, i.e., the dispositional phase, the same procedures used at the disposition hearing on the original petition apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">A disposition hearing, in turn, is most analogous to a sentencing hearing in an adult criminal proceeding. (See, e.g., 1 California Juvenile Court Practice, <em>supra, </em>ch. 9, p. 225 et seq. \u201cDispositional Hearing (Sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ing)\u201d.) Absent any juvenile court case law on the subject, we will be looking to cases involving adult sentencing procedures for whatever guidance they may provide on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">B. <em>Admissibility of Suppressed Evidence at Disposition Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">1. <em>Statutory Exclusionary Rule in Penal Code Section 1538.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Both at trial and at this level, Michael has relied on <em>People </em>v. <em>Belleci, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 879 to support his position. In <em>Belled, </em>a 20-year-old drug offender, being tried as an adult, was committed to the Youth Authority on one count after his motion to suppress relating to another count had been granted pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5 (hereafter, section 1538.5). The Supreme Court held that the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting, at the sentencing hearing, evidence that previously had been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Significantly, however, the Supreme Court refused to base its ruling either on constitutional grounds or as a judicially declared rule of evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Belleci, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 882-883.) Instead, it relied exclusively on an interpretation of section 1538.5, the statute governing motions to suppress in criminal proceedings. \u201cSubdivision (d) of section 1538.5 declares that \u2018If a search or seizure motion is granted pursuant to the proceedings authorized by this section, the property or evidence shall not be admissible against the movant at any trial or other hearing\u2019 unless the People seek reconsideration of the ruling by invoking other provisions of the section or by appeal. No such review was sought, and the question therefore is whether the sentencing proceeding is a \u2018hearing\u2019 within the meaning of this statute.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 883.) After concluding that a sentencing proceeding was a \u201chearing\u201d in every customary sense of the word <em>(ibid.), </em>the court explained that its reading of the statute \u201cdoes not make <em>all </em>illegally obtained evidence inadmissible \u2018at any trial or other hearing,\u2019 but only such evidence as has been the subject of a motion to suppress \u2018granted pursuant to the proceedings authorized by this section,\u2019 i.e., section 1538.5.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 887.) To that extent alone, the court stated, the Legislature had enacted a \u201c\u2018statutory exclusionary rule.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>2. <em>Inapplicability of Belled to Juvenile Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Section 1538.5, however, is inapplicable to juvenile court proceedings. <em>(In re David G. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 247, 252-255 [155 Cal.Rptr. 500].) Shortly after the <em>David G. </em>decision, the Legislature enacted section 700.1 as a juvenile court counterpart to Penal Code section 1538.5. (Stats. 1980, ch. 1095, \u00a7 2, p. 3511; <em>see Derrick J. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 748, 751 [194 Cal.Rptr. 348]; <em>Abdullah B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 838, 842 [185 Cal.Rptr. 784]; <em>In re Steven H., supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 449, 453.) Conspicuously absent from section 700.1, however, is any language comparable to that portion of section 1538.5 relied on in Belled.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Appellant acknowledges the lack of any specific statutory language restricting the use of previously suppressed evidence at juvenile disposition hearings. To bring his case within the analytical framework of <em>Belled, </em>he relies instead on the general evidentiary principles set forth in section 701 of the juvenile court law. It reads, in part: \u201cThe admission and exclusion of evidence shall be pursuant to the rules of evidence established by the Evidence Code and by judicial decision. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence, legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases, must be adduced to support a finding that the minor is a person described by Section 602, ...\u201d  But section 701 applies only to jurisdiction hearings (Thompson, Cal. Juvenile Court Deskbook (Cont.Ed.Bar, 2d ed. 1984) \u00a7 8.30, p. 116) and, as already noted, the exclusionary rule is recognized in that phase of a section 602 delinquency proceeding. (See fn. 12, ante.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">3. <em>Admissibility of \u201cRelevant and Material\u201d Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The admissibility of evidence at a disposition hearing is actually controlled by section 706, which provides, in part: \u201cAfter finding that a minor is a person described in Section 601 or 602, the court shall hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the minor. <em>The court shall receive in evidence </em>the social study of the minor made by the probation officer and <em>such other relevant and material evidence as may be offered </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added; see also rule 1371(d).) Further, in 1982, section 725.5 was added to the juvenile court law. It reads: \u201cIn determining the judgment and order to be made in any case in which the minor is found to be a person described in Section 602, the court shall consider, in addition to other relevant and material evidence, (1) the age of the minor, (2) the circumstances and gravity of the offense committed by the minor, and (3) the minor\u2019s previous delinquent history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>These statutes reflect the strong public interest in imposing a proper disposition and make it essential that a juvenile court judge has broad access to relevant information concerning a minor found to have committed delinquent acts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Regarding adult sentencing, the United States Supreme Court has said: \u201cHighly relevant\u2014if not essential\u2014to [a trial judge\u2019s] selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics. And modern concepts individualizing punishment have made it all the more necessary that a sentencing judge not be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 241, 247 [93 L.Ed. 1337, 1342, 69 S.Ct. 1079], fn. omitted.) To require rigid adherence to the exclusionary rule during the juvenile disposition process would deprive the juvenile court judge of access to highly reliable information pertinent to the formulation of a proper disposition. Conversely, no appreciable increment in deterrence of police misconduct would result from applying a second exclusion at the disposition hearing after the rule has once been applied at the trial itself. (See 1 La Fave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.4(f), pp. 75-76; \u00a7 1.5(b), p. 89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Thus, in contrast to the statutory exclusionary rule found controlling in <em>Belled, </em>we find that sections 706 and 725.5 of our juvenile court law expressly authorize the juvenile court to receive and consider otherwise inadmissible evidence at the disposition hearing so long as it is relevant and material to the disposition issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In the absence of any statutory exclusionary rule, we must next determine whether the state or federal constitutions bar the consideration of the illegally obtained evidence at the disposition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">4. <em>Impact of Proposition 8</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Our conclusion under state law is actually reinforced by the adoption in 1982 of Proposition 8 which, in part, added section 28, subdivision (d) (hereafter, section 28(d)) to article I of the California Constitution. That section provides, inter alia: \u201cExcept as provided by statute hereafter enacted by a two-thirds vote of the membership in each house of the Legislature, <em>relevant evidence shall not be excluded </em>in any criminal proceeding, including pretrial and post conviction motions and hearings, or <em>in any trial or hearing of a juvenile for a criminal offense, whether heard in juvenile or adult court.\" </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Analyzing that language, our Supreme Court has concluded that \u201cthe electorate intended to mandate admission of relevant evidence, even if unlawfully seized, to the extent admission of the evidence is permitted by the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 887-888 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) Further, section 28(d) has limited the judiciary\u2019s power \u201cto create nonstatutory exclusionary rules, whether denominated rules of procedure, rules of evidence, or substantive rules, for the exclusion of unlawfully seized evidence if those rules afford greater protection to a criminal defendant than does the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 888-889, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">5. <em>The Federal Exclusionary Rule Does Not Apply</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">a. <em>United States Supreme Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In determining the scope of the federal exclusionary rule, we are bound by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. <em>(In re Lance W., supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 882.)  Although that court has never been faced with our precise issue, either in a juvenile or adult context, it has said that \u201c[d]espite its broad deterrent purpose, the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Calandra </em>(1974) 414 U.S. 338, 348 [38 L.Ed.2d 561, 571, 94 S.Ct. 613].) \u201cOnce guilt has been determined, evidence which would be inadmissible on the issue of guilt may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>nevertheless be received as bearing on the punishment to be imposed. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 241. . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 717, 725 [108 Cal.Rptr. 835, 511 P.2d 1187].)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">b. <em>Analogous Rulings in Other Jurisdictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Absent any binding decision by the United States Supreme Court, we look to the federal circuits and other state courts for further guidance on the issue. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129].) We find that the prevailing rule in adult criminal proceedings elsewhere is that illegally seized evidence <em>may </em>be considered at sentencing. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(5th Cir. 1982) 680 F.2d 1055; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(4th Cir. 1976) 540 F.2d 1205, 1210-1212; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vandemark, supra, </em>522 F.2d at pp. 1021-1025; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schipani </em>(2d Cir. 1970) 435 F.2d 26 [22 A.L.R.Fed. 852], cert. den., 401 U.S. 983 [28 L.Ed.2d 334, 91 S.Ct. 1198]; see also <em>Elson </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska 1983) 659 P.2d 1195, 1202-1205; <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1979) 43 Ore.App. 979 [607 P.2d 745, 748-750]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Swartz </em>(Iowa 1979) 278 N.W.2d 22; <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(1978) 157 N.J.Super. 442 [384 A.2d 1164, 1168-1169]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Benge </em>(1974) 110 Ariz. 473 [520 P.2d 843, 849-850].) In his treatise on the Fourth Amendment, Professor La Fave notes our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Belleci, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 879, as an isolated example where legislation was deemed to have caused the issue to be decided the other way. (See 1 La Fave, Search and Seizure (1985 pocket supp.) \u00a7 1.4, p. 65, fn. 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In striking a proper balance between the interests of the judicial system in sentencing and the purposes of the exclusionary rule, however, most of the jurisdictions referred to above have sought to avoid a blanket exception to the exclusionary rule that might provide a new incentive for illegal police conduct. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 65, fn. 77.) These qualifications on the general rule of admissibility have been succinctly summarized by the Alaska Supreme Court: \u201cIn summary, we conclude that where the state is able to prove (1) that the illegal evidence is reliable, (2) that the police did not obtain the evidence as a result of gross or shocking misconduct, and (3) that the evidence was not obtained for purposes of influencing the sentencing court, the illegally seized evidence may be considered by the sentencing court in fashioning a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>(Elson </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>659 P.2d at p. 1205, fns. omitted); compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vandemark, supra, </em>522 F.2d at pp. 1022-1025 [illegal evidence admissible at sentencing] with <em>Verdugo </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1968) 402 F.2d 599, 609-613 [illegal evidence obtained to influence sentencing inadmissible].)  There is, however, no indication in our record that the cocaine and currency found on Michael was unreliable, that the officer\u2019s conduct in seizing it was gross or shocking, or that the evidence was obtained by the officer with a motivation to enhance the disposition later imposed on Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>6. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Finally, we note that in cases such as <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428] and <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068], the Supreme Court has been careful to limit its holdings recognizing the due process rights of minors to the jurisdiction (or adjudicatory) phase of juvenile delinquency proceedings. \u201cThe problems of pre-adjudication treatment of juveniles, and of post-adjudication disposition, are unique to the juvenile process; hence what we hold in this opinion with regard to the procedural requirements at the adjudicatory stage has no necessary applicability to other steps of the juvenile process.\u201d <em>(In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at p. 31, fn. 48 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 548].) \u201cAnd the opportunity during the post-adjudicatory or dispositional hearing for a wide-ranging review of the child\u2019s social history and for his individualized treatment will remain unimpaired.\u201d <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 366 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We therefore conclude that there is no statutory or constitutional prohibition on the consideration of illegally obtained evidence at a juvenile delinquency disposition hearing. To the contrary, sections 706 and 725.5 of the juvenile court law expressly authorize the juvenile court judge to receive and consider all relevant and material evidence offered on the question of a delinquent minor\u2019s proper disposition. Thus, even though that evidence may have been illegally obtained and was ordered suppressed at an earlier phase of the proceeding, it was proper for the juvenile court below to consider the fact that Michael was found in possession of the cocaine and currency when it decided Michael\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">C. <em>Commitment to Youth </em>Authority<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Anderson, P.
