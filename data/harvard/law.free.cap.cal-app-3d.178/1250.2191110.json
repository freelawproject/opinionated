As we explain, the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">Defendants Gregory Pina and Joanne Alexander appeal from judgments entered after a court trial in which they were found guilty of possession for sale and sale of PCP (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11378.5, 11379.5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">Facts &amp; Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">On March 29 and again on April 2, 1984, undercover narcotics officers for the San Jose Police Department bought a bindle of PCP from defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>at their residence. On April 28, police returned and arrested them. At that time, both defendants consented to an immediate search of the premises, during which police found 6 to 7 PCP cigarettes and 21 grams of PCP, with an estimated street value of $1800 to $2300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">In October a preliminary examination was held, and on November 5, 1984, defendants were arraigned in the Santa Clara County Superior Court on an information charging them with possession for sale and sale of PCP. Both defendants pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">On January 24, 1985, defendants moved to dismiss the charges of selling PCP on grounds that recent amendments to the Health and Safety Code repealed the proscription against sale of PCP and, therefore, that the proceedings against them on those charges abated as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The trial court denied the motion. Thereafter, defendant Pina was convicted of two counts of selling PCP and defendant Alexander was convicted of one count of possession for sale and one count of selling PCP. Both defendants received two 3-year prison terms, one for each count. The terms were made concurrent with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">On appeal, defendants reiterate their claim that the proceedings against them for selling PCP abated and, therefore, that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss these charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">I. Statutory &amp; Legislative Background</p>\n<p id=\"Aup\">A. <em>The California Uniform Controlled Substances Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">We recount briefly the history of PCP regulation because it provides a valuable context within which to view the alleged \u201crepeal\u201d of the sanctions against selling PCP and helps explain our analysis and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">In 1972, the California Legislature passed the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act (the Act), section 11000 et seq., which provides a pervasive and unified system to regulate legitimate uses and control unlawful traffic in and the abuse of prescription and nonprescription drugs, certain chemical compounds, and organic substances. (Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>p. 2987; see <em>Review of Selected 1972 California Legislation </em>(1973) 4 Pacific L.J. 211.) The Act comprised a new division 10 of the Health and Safety Code. In passing the Act, the Legislature repealed, inter alia, former division 10, which regulated \u201cNarcotics\u201d and division 10.5, which regulated \u201cRestricted Dangerous Drugs.\u201d (Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, pp. 2989, 3042; see generally, 40 West\u2019s Annot. Health &amp; Saf. Code (1975 ed.), pp. 156, 179; see also <em>Review of Selected 1972 California Legislation </em>(1973) 4 Pacific L.J. 211, 382-383.) The new division 10 established a single, general category called \u201cControlled Substances,\u201d which was broken down into five separate lists or \u201cschedules.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 11054-11058.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">For purposes of enumeration, the Act abandoned the distinction between \u201cNarcotics\u201d and \u201cRestricted Dangerous Drugs\u201d that had been embodied in former divisions 10 and 10.5. However, the Act indirectly maintained this distinction in setting forth the crimes involving controlled substances. Thus, article 1, chapter 6 of the Act (\u00a7\u00a7 11350-11356) is headed \u201cOffenses Involving Controlled Substances Formerly Classified as Narcotics\u201d; and article 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 11376-11382.5) is headed \u201cOffenses Involving Controlled Substances Formerly Classified as Restricted Dangerous Drugs.\u201d The sections in article 1 incorporate those controlled substances that were formerly called \u201cNarcotics\u201d by specific cross-reference to the five schedules. Similarly, the sections in article 5 incorporate those controlled substances that were formerly called \u201cRestricted Dangerous Drugs\u201d by specific cross-reference. (See \u00a7\u00a7 11350, 11351, 11352, 11353, 11355, 11377, 11378, 11378.5, 11379, 11379.5, 11380, 11380.5, 11382.) Both article 1 and article 5 contain sections that proscribe, among other things, possession, possession for sale, sale, use of minors by adults to commit proscribed acts, and sale of substances falsely represented as controlled substances. Read together, the two articles form a set of complementary statutes covering <em>all </em>controlled substances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">\n<em>B. Regulation of PCP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">In the original Act, the Legislature placed PCP on Schedule III, former section 11056, subdivision (b)(7). (See Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7 3, p. 2994.) At that time, PCP offenses were included in the general statutes proscribing acts involving substances formerly called \u201cRestricted Dangerous Drugs.\u201d (See former \u00a7\u00a7 11377-11380 (Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7 3, pp. 3021-3023, 3028).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>However, in 1978, in apparent reaction to the reported devastating effects of PCP, the Legislature changed this arrangement of PCP and PCP offenses in the Act. (See <em>Review of Selected 1978 California Legislation </em>(1979) 10 Pacific L.J. 247, 406-407.) The Legislature took PCP off Schedule III and placed it in a new subdivision (e) to Schedule II, section 11055.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Besides repositioning PCP, the Legislature deleted PCP from the general statutes proscribing possession for sale and sale and added sections 11378.5 and 11379.5. These sections specifically proscribed possession for sale and sale of PCP and increased the punishment for these offenses from 2, 3, or 4 years to 3, 4, or 5 years in state prison.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Stats. 1978, ch. 699, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, pp. 2212-2213; cf. former \u00a7\u00a7 11378 and 11379 (Stats. 1976, ch. 1035, \u00a7 4, p. 4635 and ch. 1139, \u00a7 83, p. 5084).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">At the same time, the Legislature increased the punishment for possession of certain precursors of PCP with intent to illegally manufacture PCP.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See former \u00a7 11383 (Stats. 1978, ch. 699, \u00a7 8, p. 2213 and Stats. 1976, ch. 1116, \u00a7 2, p. 5015).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">In 1981, the Legislature expanded section 11055, subdivision (e), (Schedule II) to include not only PCP, but also certain specified analogs of PCP. (See former \u00a7 11055, subds. (e)(l)-(e)(3) (Stats. 1981, ch. 948, \u00a7 1, pp. 3619-3620).) The new subdivision also authorized the State Attorney General to add additional analogs to Schedule II.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>In 1982, the Legislature continued its attack on PCP abuse. (See <em>Review of Selected 1982 California Legislation </em>(1982-1983) 14 Pacific L.J. 357, 610-612.) The Legislature amended the Penal Code to preclude the granting of probation to persons convicted of knowingly furnishing or giving away PCP except in \u201cunusual cases where the interests of justice would best be served.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203, subd. (e)(8); see Stats. 1982, ch. 1282, \u00a7 2, p. 4743.) The Legislature also prohibited the grant of probation to or the suspension of the sentence of persons convicted of (1) possessing for sale more than a half ounce of PCP; (2) offering, attempting, or actually importing, transporting, or administering PCP; (3) offering, selling, or manufacturing PCP or inducing a minor to commit such acts; and (4) possession of precursors of PCP with the intent to manufacture PCP. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.07, subds. (a)(4)-(a)(8); see Stats. 1982, ch. 1282, \u00a7 3, pp. 4746-4747.) Finally, the Legislature added the manufacturing, selling, or compounding of more than a half ounce of PCP to those offenses which, when committed by a minor 16 years old or older, raise a presumption that the minor is unfit for trial in juvenile court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subds. (b)(20) and (c); Stats. 1982, ch. 1282, \u00a7 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">C. <em>Chapter 1635 of the Statutes of 1984</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">One anomaly in the Act that existed until 1984 was that for all purposes <em>except </em>the regulation of prescriptions, \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d were those listed in the five schedules. However, the sections regulating prescriptions (\u00a7\u00a7 11150-11208) used the schedules set forth in the Federal Controlled Substances Act (Tit. II, Pub.L. 91-513, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812). (See former \u00a7 11150.5 (Stats. 1976, ch. 1305, \u00a7 7, pp. 4638-4639).) In chapter 1635 of the Statutes of 1984 (chapter 1635), the Legislature eliminated this dual schedule system and provided for the use of a single set of schedules for all purposes. (See Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., No. 14 West\u2019s Cal. Legis. Service (1984 ed.) p. 30; No. 8 Deering\u2019s Adv. Legis. Service (1984 ed.) p. 559.) The Legislature did this by repealing the California schedules and enacting new schedules which generally paralleled the federal ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Chapter 1635 made numerous changes in the schedules. Among them, it expanded the list in Schedule II, section 11055, of PCP related substances and reorganized their placement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The new schedules necessitated enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>ment of conforming amendments to update the internal cross-references in other sections of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">The conforming amendments to those sections relating to offenses involving controlled substances formerly called \u201cNarcotics\u201d reflected minor changes in cross-reference numbers, and caused no change in the substance of the law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">However, as to the sections which dealt with offenses involving substances formerly called \u201cRestricted Dangerous Drugs\u201d (and PCP precursors), sections 11377-11383, the conforming amendments did not fully integrate the schedule changes made as to PCP and related substances. As a result, these amendments created inconsistencies in the treatment of PCP offenses and opened up gaps in the scheme of complementary criminal statutes covering all controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">For example, in amending section 11377 (simple possession), the Legislature failed to include a cross-reference to the newly added subdivision (f) of Schedule II (containing PCP precursors). This omission made it appear that simple possession of certain controlled substances (i.e., PCP precursors) was legal, or at least not explicitly proscribed. Similarly, the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>ments to sections 11378 and 11378.5 (possession for sale) resulted in incongruous treatment of PCP and related substances. As noted above, the Legislature in 1978 isolated PCP in its own section 11378.5, to increase the punishment for possession of PCP for sale. In chapter 1635, the Legislature added a reference to PCP precursors (subdivision (f)) to section 11378.5, but removed PCP itself and returned it to section 11378. The net effect of these changes was to maintain stiff penalties for possessing PCP precursors for sale but to lower the penalties as to PCP itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">More incongruous, however, were the amendments to those sections proscribing the sale of controlled substances. As with possession of PCP for sale, actual sale of PCP had been separately proscribed in section 11379.5 to increase its punishment. In amending this section, the Legislature added a reference to the PCP precursors (subdivision (f)), but removed the reference to PCP itself. However, the Legislature failed to add a reference to PCP in section 11379, the more general section proscribing sale. The net effect was to remove entirely the proscription against selling PCP.1 *********<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Given chapter 1635\u2019s apparent legalization of sale of PCP, defendants quickly sought to have the charges of selling PCP dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">\n<em>D. Postscript: Chapter 3 of the Statutes of 1985</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">One day after the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and 29 days after chapter 1635 became effective, sale of PCP, among other things, was again explicitly proscribed. On January 29, 1985, chapter 3 of the Statutes of 1985 (chapter 3) became effective as urgency legislation. Chapter 3 closed the gaps and rectified the incongruities concerning PCP offenses that chapter 1635 had created. It reestablished the seamless scheme of complementary penal statutes which, prior to chapter 1635, had provided comprehensive control of <em>all </em>controlled substances. It also restored the scope of those sections which had been specially enacted to punish possession for sale and sale of PCP more harshly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>The Legislature explained the need for chapter 3 as follows: \u201cSEC. 16. The Legislature finds and declares that Chapter 1635 of the Statutes of 1984 was enacted solely to conform California\u2019s schedules to federal law wherever possible. Over 100 sections in nine separate codes were amended by the measure, which passed the Assembly on the consent calendar and the Senate by unanimous vote, [\u00b6] The Legislature further finds and declares that after enactment of the measure it was discovered that the bill contained drafting errors in technical cross-references inadvertently creating ambiguities regarding the applicability of a number of provisions of prior law regarding the manufacture, sale, or use of certain controlled substances. Accordingly, this measure was introduced at the earliest opportunity available to correct those errors and clarify the continued application of all previous provisions prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or use of controlled substances. It additionally adds provisions unanimously approved by the Legislature in Assembly Bill No. 3165 of the 1983-84 Regular Session of the Legislature regarding the manufacture of controlled substances, [\u00b6] The Legislature therefore expressly finds and declares that Chapter 1635 of the Statutes of 1984 was not intended to reduce or eliminate in any manner previously existing prohibitions against or penalties for the manufacture, sale, or use of controlled substances. . . . [\u00b6] SEC. 19. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessary [sic] are: [\u00b6] In order to prevent the further manufacture of controlled substances and to clarify other provisions of law relating to controlled substances at the earliest possible time, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">II. Applicability of the Common Law Rule of Abatement</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Both in the trial court and now on appeal, defendants contend that as soon as chapter 1635 removed the proscription against selling PCP, the common law rule of abatement applied and precluded further prosecution on such charges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">California has long followed the common law rule that when a criminal statute is repealed, all proceedings against an accused not reduced to final judgment are terminated unless there is a savings clause or legislative intent to the contrary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Spears </em>v. <em>County of Modoc </em>(1894) 101 Cal. 303, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>305 [35 P. 869]; <em>In Re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 746-747 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Babylon </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 719, 725 [216 Cal.Rptr. 123, 702 P.2d 205]; see 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 35, p. 39 and supp. 1985, pp. 62-64; 17 Cal.Jur.3d, Criminal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 7-8, pp. 32-34; 22 C.J.S., Criminal Law, \u00a7 27, p. 89; 73 Am.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The common law rule \u201cis based on presumed legislative intent, it being presumed that the repeal was intended as an implied legislative pardon for past acts.\u201d <em>(Sekt </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 297, 304 [159 P.2d 17, 167 A.L.R. 833].) \u201cWhere the Legislature has seen fit to repeal a statute making certain acts a crime it is reasonable to assume that in the absence of a saving clause the Legislature would not have desired that anyone should be punished for what, by the repeal, it has now determined is not a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 308.) This rationale applies even where, instead of repealing a criminal statute, the Legislature decreases the punishment for violating it. Thus, it is presumed that the Legislature intended that the benefits of such legislation apply immediately wherever possible. Hence, a defendant is entitled to be sentenced under the new statute, reducing the punishment for his offense. <em>(In Re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, 745-748; see, e.g., <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Mann </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 819 [135 Cal.Rptr. 526, 558 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Benefield </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 51 [136 Cal.Rptr. 465]; <em>Weissbuch </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 924 [116 Cal.Rptr. 479];, see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harmon </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 9, 27-33 [4 Cal.Rptr. 161, 351 P.2d 329] (dis. op. of Peters, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>However, because the rule is based on a presumed legislative intent, it does not apply automatically upon the repeal of a statute. \u201cWhere the reason for the rule ceases the rule should not apply.\u201d <em>(Sekt </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court, supra, </em>26 Cal.2d at p. 308.) That is, where the circumstances of the repeal do not reasonably give rise to the presumption of a legislative pardon and remission of crimes not reduced to final judgment, the rule is inapplicable and a prosecution may be maintained even in the absence of a savings clause. (See <em>Sekt </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court, supra, </em>26 Cal.2d at pp. 305-309; <em>Sobey </em>v. <em>Malony </em>(1940) 40 Cal.App.2d 381, 385 [104 P.2d 868].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Thus, for example, where the Legislature repeals a criminal statute but reenacts it in substantially the same form, with either an increased or decreased punishment, it is more reasonable to presume that the Legislature intended to punish people who committed crimes under the old statute than to presume an intent to let such persons go free. (See <em>Sekt </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court, supra; </em>see also <em>In Re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, 747; <em>Sobey </em>v. <em>Malony, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.2d 381, 385.) Indeed, the reenactment rebuts any presumed intent to pardon such persons. The same reasoning applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Clearly, in passing chapter 1635, the Legislature intended to change the Act. (Cf. <em>Loew\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Byram </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 746, 749 [82 P.2d 1].) However, it is absurd to presume that one of the intended changes was to legalize the sale of PCP, and there is ample evidence that the \u201crepeal\u201d was not intentional. Initially, we note that legalizing the sale of PCP would represent a dramatic divergence from the legislative history of the Act, which, as noted above, reveals the Legislature\u2019s increasing awareness of the dangerousness of PCP and ever-stronger measures to control it. (See Discussion, <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1253-1256.) However, in chapter 1635, the Legislature left PCP on the list of controlled substances and, in fact, expanded the list to include PCP precursors. This continued and expanded presence of PCP and related substances clearly indicates that the Legislature still considered PCP to be a dangerous drug with a high potential for abuse. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolden </em>(1978) 62 Ill.App.3d 1009 [20 Ill.Dec. 79; 379 N.E.2d 912, 915].) Moreover, as the People point out, the Legislature did not change Penal Code section 1203.07, subdivision (a)(6), which disqualifies sellers of PCP from receiving probation. (See Discussion, <em>ante, </em>at p. 1256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Chapter 1635\u2019s sudden inconsistent and incongruous treatment of PCP offenses (e.g., proscribing being under the influence of PCP precursors but not PCP; proscribing possession of PCP but not its sale; maintaining harsh penalties for possession for sale of PCP precursors but not PCP itself) strongly suggests confusion and errors in drafting the various amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>and reenacted statutes that made up the chapter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This suggestion is further strengthened when one considers the Act\u2019s complex scheme of interrelated complementary statutes, the complicated task of updating the cross-references to reflect the new schedules, and the fact that chapter 1635 involved the simultaneous amendment of dozens of other statutes in the Business and Professions, Education, Government, Penal, Vehicle, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Certainly such circumstances created a dangerous potential for drafting errors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">The lack of intent to legalize sale of PCP becomes even more evident in light of the absurd consequences such legalization would have. For example, although selling PCP might be legal, selling \u201cimitation\u201d PCP would not. (See \u00a7\u00a7 11680, 11681.) Although a conviction for possession of PCP for sale would continue to have a serious negative impact on the jobs and licenses of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, school administrators, teachers, public officials, and employees, such professionals and public officers could theoretically sell PCP with impunity and without risk to their careers. (See, generally, statutes referred to in fn. 16, <em>ante.) </em>Finally, in legalizing sale of PCP, the California Legislature would set California apart from the federal government, the 49 other states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, all of which have prohibited the sale of PCP since adopting, as California itself did, a version of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of 1970. (See 9 U. Laws Annot. (Master Ed. 1979) pp. 187-194 and Supp. (1985) pp. 117-118.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Common sense rebels against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>notion that our Legislature intended to take such an independent stand concerning sale of PCP or that it would do so without any acknowledgment or explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">A finding that the ostensible legalization of PCP sales resulted from a drafting error and was not an intended change in the law is corroborated implicitly by the speed and urgency with which the Legislature reproscribed, sale in chapter 3 and explicitly by the legislative declarations in chapter 3 concerning chapter 1635. (See pp. 1258-1259, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">In light of our discussion, we conclude that where, as here, it is obvious that the Legislature inadvertently deleted the sanctions against selling PCP because of a drafting error, such a \u201crepeal\u201d cannot and does not reflect an intent to pardon illegal sales that were committed prior to the error. Therefore, we hold that under such circumstances, the rule of abatement is inapplicable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our holding is supported by the fact that chapter 3 represents the substantial reenactment of the law against sale of PCP as it read prior to the passage of chapter 1635. (See <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d 721, 725.)  It is settled that given such reenactments of repealed or amended statutes, courts presume that the Legislature did not intend a remission of crimes not reduced to final judgment. <em>(In Re Dapper </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 184, 189 [77 Cal.Rptr. 897, 454 P.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Defendants claim that because chapter 1635 clearly and completely removed the sanctions against selling PCP, this court has no need to investigate the legislative intent behind or interpret chapter 1635. Indeed, defendants argue that under the circumstances, the legislative intent is irrelevant and their prosecutions for selling PCP abated as a matter of law. Defendants also argue that the Legislature\u2019s subsequent declarations in chapter 3 may not properly be deemed conclusive of its intent in passing chapter 1635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Although the fact of the deletions in chapter 1635 is clear, the applicability of the rule of abatement is not automatic, but depends on whether the presumption of a legislative pardon reasonably arises from (or is rebutted by) the particular legislation. Under the circumstances, we must discern the legislative intent to determine the propriety of applying the rule to avoid absurd consequences. In doing so, we may consider all factors which may give a clue to such intent, including legislative declarations in subsequent legislation. (See <em>Honey Springs Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1137 [203 Cal.Rptr. 886]; see also <em>Del Costello </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 887, 893, fn. 8 [185 Cal.Rptr. 582]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cuevas </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 189, 199-200 [168 Cal.Rptr. 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">III. Applicability of Government Code Section 9608</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">There is a second reason why the rule of abatement is inapplicable in this case. Under the rule, the repeal of a statute does not terminate the proceedings in prosecutions that began before the repeal if there is a saving clause preserving them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Chapter 1635 did not itself contain a special saving clause. However, California has a general saving clause in Government Code section 9608, and such a clause is just as effective as a specific one.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNulty </em>(1892) 93 Cal. 427, 437 [29 P. 61]; cf. <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(1931) 211 Cal. 461 [296 P. 291, 74 A.L.R. 187].) This clause provides: \u201cThe termination or suspension (by whatsoever means effected) of any law creating a criminal offense does not constitute a bar to the indictment or information and punishment of an act already committed in violation of the law so terminated or suspended, unless the intention to bar such indictment or information and punishment is expressly declared by an applicable provision of law.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 9608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">California courts initially viewed this general saving clause (and its predecessors, former Pol. Code, \u00a7 329 (enacted Mar. 12, 1872, amend. Stats. 1881, ch. 8, \u00a7 1, p. 6); and before that, Laws of California (1850-1853) p. 920 (Stats. 1853, ch. 138, \u00a7 1, p. 195)) as a legislative repudiation of the common law rule of abatement. <em>(Sekt </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court, supra, 26 </em>Cal.2d 297, 300; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harmon, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 9, 21, disapproved in <em>In Re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, 742; see cases cited in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rossi, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 295, 299, fn. 5; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Quinn </em>(1861) 18 Cal. 122, 125; <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>People </em>(1971) 174 Colo. 365 [484 P.2d 792]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number><em>People In Interest of M. K. A. </em>(1973) 182 Colo. 172 [511 P.2d 477], 479; <em>State </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1973) 131 Vt. 521 [310 A.2d 17].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">More recently, however, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rossi, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 295, 299-300, the California Supreme Court opined that this general saving clause was not meant to abrogate the common law rule, but only to prevent its mechanical application and forestall the \u201ctechnical abatement\u201d of prosecutions where the repeal of a statute was clearly not intended as a pardon for past conduct. Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>McNulty, supra, </em>93 Cal. 427, the court illustrat\u00e9d such \u201ctechnical abatement,\u201d explaining that where the Legislature repeals a penal statute and reenacts it increasing the punishment, a defendant who committed the proscribed act prior to the repeal \u201ccould not be punished under the old law because it no longer existed, and he could not be punished under the new law because its attempted application would render it an ex-post facto law.\u201d The general saving clause, however, prevents abatement and preserves the prosecution under the former law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">In <em>McNulty, </em>the court explained that general saving clauses were \u201cintended to prevent the miscarriage of justice in cases where the legislature should repeal or substantially change a penal statute, and neglect to put a special saving clause into the new enactment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNulty, supra, </em>93 Cal. at p. 437.) Quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barr 4 </em>Saw. 254, the <em>McNulty </em>court further explained that a general saving clause is a \u201c \u2018salutary provision, and if it, or something like it, had always been incorporated in the statutes . . ., it would have prevented many a lame and impotent conclusion in criminal cases, in which the defendant escaped punishment because the legislature, in the hurry and confusion of amending and enacting statutes, had forgotten to insert a clause to save offenses and liabilities already committed or incurred from the effect of express or implied repeals.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">This case presents circumstances analogous to those illustrated by the <em>Rossi </em>court that created the need for a general saving clause. Clearly, the purpose of the clause is served where, as here, in the \u201churry and confusion\u201d of major legislative activity involving changes in over 100 statutes, the Legislature, through an inadvertent drafting error, eliminated for a period of 29 days the sanctions against selling PCP. To treat such an error as if it were a formal, intentional repeal, triggering the common law rule of abatement, would permit the type of \u201ctechnical abatement\u201d that the general saving clause was designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>Given our analysis and conclusions, we hold that the trial court properly denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the charges of selling PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Agliano, Acting P.

During the pendency of their appeal, the state passed anti-discrimination laws, making it a crime for businesses to discriminate on the basis of race.
