We agree with the trial court that the proposed contract violated subdivision (a)(2) of section 19130. Consequently, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">General Services has historically supplied state civil service security guards to protect the state\u2019s Teale data processing center.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">In April 1985, pursuant to a statutory mandate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Board informed respondent California State Employees\u2019 Association (CSEA) that Teale in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tended to enter into a contract with Universal pursuant to which Universal\u2019s private sector employees would replace the state\u2019s security guards at the data center.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">CSEA submitted written objections to the Board. As relevant here, CSEA contended the proposed contract violated subdivision (a)(2) of section 19130, which provides: \u201cProposals to contract out work shall not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits. Proposals to contract out work shall be eligible for approval if the contractor\u2019s wages are at the industry\u2019s level and do not significantly undercut state pay rates.\u201d (All further nondescript references to \u201csubdivision (a)(2)\u201d are to this statute.) CSEA argued the contractor\u2019s wages \u201csignificantly undercut state pay rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The state\u2019s security guards were paid $6.94 per hour, exclusive of benefits. Universal\u2019s guards were paid $5 per hour, exclusive of benefits. It is undisputed that Universal\u2019s wages were at the industry\u2019s level. It is further undisputed in this action that the public and private security guards had the same training and qualifications and would perform the same duties at the data center.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The Board rejected CSEA\u2019s objections and approved the contract. However, the trial court concluded Universal\u2019s wages significantly undercut the state pay rate and issued the previously described writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The dispute between appellants and respondent CSEA concerns the proper interpretation of subdivision (a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The parties first focus on the word \u201cundercut.\u201d Appellants contend \u201cundercut\u201d requires an <em>intentional pricing down </em>to pay below the state pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>rate. Although not entirely clear, appellants apparently contend a contractor would \u201cundercut\u201d state pay rates only if the contractor intentionally dropped his wage rate below the prevailing rate in the industry to try to get a state contract. Thus, appellants argue that as long as the contractor pays the prevailing wage for the industry, the contractor does not \u201cundercut\u201d state pay rates. CSEA argues the trial court correctly concluded \u201cundercut\u201d means simply \u201clower than.\u201d By this view, a contractor\u2019s wages \u201csignificantly undercut\u201d state pay rates when they are \u201csignificantly lower than\u201d state pay rates. For reasons that follow, we believe the trial court correctly resolved this issue by adopting the construction urged by CSEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We first note that courts are bound to give effect to statutes according to the usual, ordinary import of their language. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].)  As pertinent here, Webster defines \u201cundercut\u201d as follows: \u201cto offer to sell at lower prices than or to work for lower wages or serve for lower fees than (a competitor).\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 2488.) The ordinary use of \u201cundercut\u201d does not include \u201cintentional pricing down.\u201d The trial court\u2019s interpretation thus gives the language its usual ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Moreover, in the absence of an absurd result, we are not free to disregard ordinary rules of grammar and syntax in the interpretation of a statute. (See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 53, 60 [100 Cal.Rptr. 684].)  In subdivision (a)(2), the operative noun is \u201cwages\u201d which \u201cdo not significantly undercut state pay rates.\u201d Unlike contractors, \u201cwages\u201d have no \u201cintention.\u201d They are simply higher or lower than some other number. Appellants\u2019 construction of the statute is thus at odds with its syntax.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We are also mindful that an interpretation which would render terms of a statute surplusage should be avoided, and every word should be given some significance, leaving no part useless or devoid of meaning. <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, 54 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935].)  Appellants expressly argue that, by their interpretation, a contractor paying the prevailing wage cannot \u201cundercut\u201d state pay rates. However, the statute imposes conjunctive conditions of eligibility for approval of a proposal: (1) the contractor\u2019s wages must be at the industry\u2019s level, <em>and (2) </em>the wages do not significantly undercut state pay rates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>By appellants\u2019 argument, condition (2) could not occur if condition (1) was satisfied. Since appellants\u2019 interpretation makes the second condition surplusage, the interpretation is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In support of their position, appellants cite <em>Curtiss-Wright Corporation </em>v. <em>McLucas </em>(D.N.J. 1973) 364 F.Supp. 750 and <em>Altemose Const. </em>v. <em>Bldg. &amp; Const. Trades Council </em>(E.D.Pa. 1977) 443 F.Supp 492. However, we fail to discern how these cases help appellants. In <em>Curtiss-Wright, </em>the court, in a footnote, simply cited remarks by a single senator respecting amendments to the federal Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. \u00a7 351 et seq.): \u201cDuring the hearings on the 1972 Amendments, Senator Gurney, for example, attacked service contractors who \u2018ruthlessly and unconscionably\u2019 undercut wages and fringe benefits by bidding low on contracts against a better paying incumbent.\u201d <em>(Curtiss-Wright, supra, </em>364 F.Supp. at p. 768, fn. 16.) We do not believe a snippet of legislative history respecting an amendment to an unrelated federal statute, which does not even contain language similar to that at issue here, sheds light on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Similarly, in <em>Altemose Const. </em>v. <em>Bldg. &amp; Const. Trades Council, supra, </em>the court held that defendants\u2019 counterclaims should survive summary judgment under the Sherman Act where defendants claimed plaintiffs had conspired to depress wages. (443 F.Supp. at p. 499.) We cannot see how this case aids appellants. Indeed, both <em>Curtiss-Wright </em>and <em>Altern\u00f3se </em>suggest the trial court properly construed the California statute at issue. In both cases, the intentional depression of wages was treated as unlawful and opprobrious. The statute at hand proscribes proposals where wages <em>\u201csignificantly </em>undercut\u201d state pay rates. It would be odd for the Legislature to proscribe opprobrious and possibly unlawful conduct only in the event its effects were \u201csignificant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Appellants also assert the trial court failed to give proper deference to a contemporaneous administrative construction of subdivision (a)(2). When an administrative agency is charged with enforcing a particular stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ute, its interpretation of the statute will be accorded great respect by the courts and will ordinarily be followed if not clearly erroneous. <em>(San Lorenzo Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 841, 850 [187 Cal.Rptr. 432, 654 P.2d 202].)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The rule is applied with most vigor to administrative regulations promulgated by an administrative body authorized to promote a statute\u2019s purposes. (See, e.g., <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 1, 8 [192 Cal.Rptr. 134, 663 P.2d 904]; <em>In re Kelly </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 267, 277 [188 Cal.Rptr. 447, 655 P.2d 1282].) Conversely, where an \u201cadministrative interpretation\u201d of a statute is found in an informal memorandum prepared for use in litigation, rather than in a regulation, the usual deference to administrative interpretation is inappropriate. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Tracy School Dist. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 99, 107 [165 Cal.Rptr. 100, 611 P.2d 441].) In the instant case, the \u201cadministrative interpretation\u201d cited by appellants is found in a declaration submitted in the trial court by the section manager in the Employment Services Division of the State Personnel Board who had responsibility for providing staff analysis for the review of the contract at issue here. The declarant asserts, \u201cThe contractor is not intentionally pricing down to undercut state pay rates.\u201d However, the declarant does not purport to speak for the Board itself. So far as the declaration indicates, the interpretation of the statute is that of the declarant, submitted in the instant litigation. As such, the usual deference given to a formal agency interpretation of a statute is inappropriate. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cIn any event, administrative construction of a statute, while entitled to weight, cannot prevail when a contrary legislative purpose is apparent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 101, 117 [172 Cal.Rptr. 194, 624 P.2d 244].) Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Appellants also argue we must disregard the apparent meaning of the language of the statute because the trial court\u2019s interpretation wrongfully \u201crenders [section 19130] a nullity.\u201d (See <em>Herbert Hawkins Realtors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milheiser </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 334, 338 [189 Cal.Rptr. 450].) Appellants contend the purpose of section 19130 is to achieve cost savings and that contracting out on a cost saving basis will rarely, if ever, be justified if a contractor\u2019s wages must be at or near state pay rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">We must disagree with appellants\u2019 argument at the threshold. When section 19130 is read in its entirety (see Appendix A, <em>post) </em>it is apparent the purpose of the statute is not simply to achieve cost savings but also to protect various employee policies including nondiscrimination (subd. (a)(8)), affir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>mative action (subds. (a)(4), (a)(8)), nondisplacement of civil service employees (subds. (a)(3), (b)), and maintenance of state pay rates (subd. (a)(2)). The statute is obviously a sausage produced by a legislative process that evidently stuffed interests of cost efficiency together with other interests, including those of state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">To be sure, cost efficiencies would be increased if private sector contractors could lower wages without limitation. However, no evidence suggests\u2014 and we are not prepared to assume\u2014that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statute will eliminate private sector cost savings and therefore render section 19130 \u201ca nullity\u201d as appellants claim. This is so for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The first is set forth in section 900 of the Board\u2019s Personnel Management Policy and Procedures Manual: \u201cThe cost advantages of contracting should typically result from efficiency-related factors, such as economies of scale, superior technology or lower overhead costs that cannot be offset by reasonable improvements in the State\u2019s equipment and operating procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The second is that contractors\u2019 wages may be lower than state pay rates; a proposal is disqualified only in the event of a \u201csignificant\u201d disparity. We therefore conclude the trial court\u2019s interpretation results in no absurdity allowing us to disregard the plain and ordinary meaning of the language of the statute. The trial court correctly concluded a contractor\u2019s wages \u201csignificantly undercut\u201d state pay rates under subdivision (a)(2) when the wages were \u201csignificantly lower than\u201d state pay rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The parties also dispute whether the comparison of wages and pay rates in subdivision (a)(2) should include or exclude fringe benefits. However, since the second sentence of subdivision (a)(2) requires a comparison of the contractor\u2019s \u201cwages\u201d and state \u201cpay rates,\u201d \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cpay rates\u201d must mean the same thing, because we will not assume the Legislature intended a comparison of apples and oranges. The parties agree with this truism. The first sentence of subdivision (a)(2) refers disjunctively to \u201cpay rates or benefits.\u201d Upon the assumption \u201cbenefits\u201d is not surplusage <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 54), then \u201cbenefits\u201d means something other than \u201cpay rates.\u201d (See <em>Gonzales &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 172, 178 [198 Cal.Rptr. 479].) Since \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cpay rates\u201d mean the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>thing, and since \u201cpay rates\u201d means something other than \u201cbenefits,\u201d the comparison of \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cpay rates\u201d in the second sentence of subdivision (a)(2) should be made by excluding fringe benefits from the computation. The trial court correctly performed the computation by excluding benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The trial court determined that Universal\u2019s wage (exclusive of benefits) of $5 per hour significantly undercut the state pay rate for state security guards of $6.94 per hour because the contractor\u2019s wages were approximately 28 percent lower that the state hourly pay rate. We are not called upon in this case to draw a precise line for all cases with respect to whether disparities will or will not be considered significant. Appellants concede that if the trial court\u2019s interpretation of subdivision (a)(2) is correct, 28 percent constitutes a \u201csignificant\u201d disparity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Therefore, the contract did not comply with subdivision (a)(2) and it was the duty of the Board to disapprove the contract. (See Pub. Contract Code \u00a7 10337, subd. (a).)  The trial court properly issued its writ.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The judgment is affirmed.

However, at oral argument, the attorney general conceded that the instant record does not show the elimination of a civil service class by the Board but rather only the reassignment of persons within a class. The power of the Board to adopt and eliminate civil service classes (see Cal. Const., art. VII, \u00a7 3, subd. (a); \u00a7 18800) is therefore not implicated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Article VII, section 1 of the California Constitution provides: \u201c(a) The civil service includes every officer and employee of the state except as otherwise provided in this Constitution.

The dissent argues the contract merits approval because most conditions imposed by section 19130 are satisfied by the contract proposal. With respect, we believe the dissent duplicates the error of the Board. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The Board concluded subdivision (a)(2) was not violated because, \u201cAlthough the proposed contractor\u2019s wage is lower than the State\u2019s wage, savings from this lower wage is not the sole basis for approval of the contract.\u201d By this view, subdivision (a)(2) excuses wage undercutting if the lower wage is not the sole basis for approval of the contract. We think the Board and the dissent turn subdivision (a)(2) upside down. Subdivision (a)(2) clearly provides that a necessary condition of approval of a proposal is that wages do not undercut state pay rates. If that condition is unsatisfied, the proposal is ineligible for approval regardless of compliance with other provisions of section 19130. The statute contains no exemption from the eligibility requirement where savings from the lower wage are not the sole basis of contract approval. Rather, the statute simply provides an additional ground of disqualification: \u201cProposals to contract out work shall not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits.\u201d (Subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In 1975, the Board assumed the responsibility of reviewing contracts for personal services in order to determine whether the contracts were lawful. (See Assem. Office of Research, Government Operations Review Contracting for Services (Mar. 1982) pp. 6-7) In 1979, the Board adopted section 900 of its Personnel Management Policy and Procedure Manual describing the conditions under which the Board believed contracts for services could be let with private firms because of substantial cost savings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Defendant and respondent Universal did not appeal from the judgment. Nonetheless, as a respondent, Universal has filed a brief in this court urging us to reverse the judgment on various grounds. However, \u201cAlthough it is the appellant\u2019s task to show error, there is a corresponding obligation on the part of the respondent to aid the appellate court in sustaining the judgment.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 492, p. 481.) Thus, it is the general rule that a respondent who has not appealed from the judgment may not urge error on appeal. (See, e.g., <em>Puritan Leasing Co. </em>v. <em>August </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 451, 463 [128 Cal.Rptr. 175, 546 P.2d 679]; <em>Henigson </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 240, 244 [195 P.2d 777]; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 275, 282 [101 P.2d 665]; <em>California C.P. Growers </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 233, 238 [78 P.2d 1161].) A limited exception to this rule is provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 906, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe respondent. . . may, without appealing from the judgment, request the reviewing court to and it may review any of the foregoing [described orders or rulings] <em>for the purpose of determining whether or not the appellant was prejudiced by the error or errors upon which he relies for reversal or modification of the judgment from which the appeal is taken. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) The purpose of the statutory exception is to allow a respondent to assert a legal theory which may result in affirmance of the judgment. (See <em>Central Manufacturing District, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1960) 176 Cal.App.2d 850, 857 [1 Cal.Rptr. 733]; 9 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 249, pp. 255-256.) Here, without appealing, respondent seeks not to save the judgment but to overthrow it. This cannot be done; we will not review Universal\u2019s contentions of error. (Code Civ.

Teale Data Center in Sacramento. Prior to that date, the State Personnel Board had been advised by General Services of its decision to phase out use of the security guard class of personnel. As a result, all appropriate agencies were notified that by virtue of General Services\u2019 decision, Teale Data Center had elected to contract for its needed security services, and that defendant Universal Service Contractors had been the low responsible bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">As required by section 19130, defendant State Personnel Board (SPB or board) made an analysis of the circumstances and the contract, in which it applied and considered each of the elements (11) required to be met by section 19130. SPB communicated its decision to approve the cost-based contract with Universal Service Contractors and advised plaintiff, California State Employees\u2019 Association (CSEA), that the decision to contract was predicated upon General Services\u2019 decision to no longer provide security guards and furnished CSEA a copy of its detailed analysis of the contract. The board\u2019s detailed analysis of the contract was not factually challenged in the trial court nor here, and is fundamental to a proper resolution of the controversy; I accordingly set forth that analysis in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u201cThe following is an analysis of the standards that must be met in a cost-based contract, as required by Government Code Section 19130:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">\u201c1. \u2018The proposed contract will result in an actual overall cost savings to State Government. \u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(1).] The proposed contractor will provide the required service for a cost to the department of $127,020 per year, for three years. For Teale Data Center to hire its own security staff, it would cost $183,944.60 per year (see Chart A below). The savings from contracting out to the proposed vendor would be $56,924.60 per year, or $170,773.80 over the three-year period of the contract. This is a 31% savings. (See Chart B.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-16\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-19\">\u201c2. \u2018The savings must be large enough to ensure that they will not be eliminated by private sector and State cost fluctuations that could normally be expected during the contracting period.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(5).] The State Personnel Board policy on review of cost-based contracts indicates that a savings margin of at least 10% annually will meet this criteria. The proposed contract represents an annual savings of 31%, so this criteria is met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-20\">\u201c3. \u2018The potential for future economic risk to the State from potential contractor rate increases must be minimal.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(9).] The proposed contractor has agreed to a set rate for the full three-year period covered by the proposed contract. Since there will be no rate increases during the life of the contract, the risk of rate increase is \u2018minimal\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201c4. \u2018The amount of savings must clearly justify the size and duration of the contracting agreement.!\u2019] !\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(6).] This criteria is met as the savings are not \u2018temporary\u2019 or \u2018spot\u2019 as defined by State Personnel Board policy. The savings are substantial and long term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">\u201c5. \u2018The contract may not cause the displacement of civil service employees.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(3).] No State employees will be laid off, demoted, involuntarily transferred to a new class, or reduced in time base. The Department of General Services plans to place all Security Guards who are currently at Teale Data Center in other classes and locations on a voluntary basis. General Services has obtained special permission from the Department of Personnel Administration to place their Security Guards on SROA lists to assist in the voluntary placement of their employees. Employees who do not want a change in classification will be retained in the State Police Division as Security Guards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201c6. \u2018Proposals to contract out work will not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits. Proposals to contract out work shall be eligible for approval if the contractor\u2019s wages are at the industry\u2019s level and do not significantly undercut State pay rates.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(2).] The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 report of December 1984 shows that security guards in the Sacramento area are paid an average of $5.58 per hour in wages. This study did not differentiate between armed and unarmed guards; however, in past years, the difference between armed and unarmed guard salaries was $.50 per hour more for armed guards. Therefore, the average wage for unarmed guards in the Sacramento area is assumed to be approximately $5.08 per hour. The wage under the proposed contract is $5.00 per hour and considered to be at industry\u2019s level. The State\u2019s second step pay rate for Security Guards is $6.94 per hour. (The second step would be approximately the average salary during the three-year period of the contract.) Although the proposed contractor\u2019s wage is lower than the State\u2019s wage, savings from this lower wage is not the sole basis for approval of this contract. Approval of the proposed contract is warranted by: (a) the inability of the department to continue to obtain service from the State Police after May 24, 1985; (b) the overall cost savings of 31% to the State by contracting out to the proposed vendor; (c) the proposed vendor\u2019s wage being at industry\u2019s level; and (d) the ability of the proposed vendor to provide more efficient service than the department could provide. Should any of the proposed vendor\u2019s security staff be unable to work, coverage can be provided from the pool of reserve staff. On the other hand, if a State employee cannot come to work, there is no reserve staff to cover; other Security Guards must cover at the overtime rate of pay. In addition, the proposed vendor can provide supervision more efficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>because the supervisor is not permanently assigned onsite on a full-time basis but circulates among several of the contractor\u2019s client businesses. Supervision is available 24 hours a day as needed. Chart C below shows a comparison of the proposed vendor\u2019s cost of supervision per hour of service provided and the State\u2019s cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-17\">\u201c7. \u2018The contract must not adversely impact the State\u2019s affirmative action efforts.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(4).] Since no employees will be displaced and General Services will no longer be hiring Security Guards, there will be no adverse impact on protected groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-18\">\u201c8. \u2018All contracts approved based on cost savings must be with firms; contracting with individuals based on cost savings is not permissible. \u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(10).] The proposed contractor is a firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-19\">\u201c9. \u2018Cost-based contracts must be awarded through a well-publicized, competitive bidding process.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(7).] The request for bids was advertised through the State Contract register. Bids were received from eight firms, four of which submitted all the required information. The proposed contractor is the low bidder of the four responsive bidders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-20\">\u201c10. \u2018Cost-based contracts shall include specific provisions pertaining to the qualifications of the staff that will perform the work under the contract, as well as assurances that the contractor\u2019s hiring practices meet applicable nondiscrimination/affirmative action standards.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(8).] The proposed contract contains provisions concerning both the qualifications of staff and equal employment opportunity practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u201c11. \u2018Cost-based contracting shall not occur where the public\u2019s interest in having a particular function performed directly by State Government outweighs the potential economic advantage of contracting.\u2019 [\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(11).] Security guard service is not the type of service the public inherently expects to be performed by the government. The security guards under the proposed contract are unarmed and will not be performing law enforcement or emergency services functions. Law enforcement and emergency services will continue to be provided by qualified State Police Officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">With this background, the statute may be examined pursuant to existing judicial standards for construing statutes and their application. \u201cThe fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(California Toll Bridge Authority </em>v. <em>Kuchel, </em>40 Cal.2d 43, 53 [251 P.2d 4]; <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Kuchel, </em>32 Cal.2d 193, 199 [195 P.2d 17]; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Raisin Proration Zone No. 1, </em>24 Cal.2d 796, 802 [151 P.2d 505, 157 A.L.R. 324]; 82 C.J.S., Statutes, \u00a7 321, p. 560; 45 Cal.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 126, p. 634.) Moreover, \u2018every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.\u2019 <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Retirement Board, </em>42 Cal.2d 795, 799 [270 P.2d 12].) If possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 638 [268 P.2d 723].) Such purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the act. ...\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As I apply these principles to the facts presented, I. am forced to the conclusion that the trial court was wrong. Its decision was apparently the result of judicial tunnel vision. It focused on but one part of one of the eleven factual criteria and gave that one fact more than a literal construction. As a consequence, the trial court effectually rendered nugatory the total purpose of the statutory enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Just as importantly, the trial court totally ignored the administrative analysis of the factual circumstances, the purpose of the statute, and the board\u2019s interpretation of each. I recognize that while an administrative construction of a statute does not acquire legal sanction merely by reason of usage, it should be accorded great respect by the courts and upheld if not obviously erroneous. <em>(Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 707, 712 [112 P.2d 10]; see also <em>Los Angeles City School Dist. </em>v. <em>Simpson </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 70, 75 [245 P.2d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>From the record presented, I conclude the trial court did not accord the board\u2019s administrative analysis any deference or consideration; more importantly, the court\u2019s resolution did not address all of the issues tendered, but rather, at the insistence of plaintiffs, focused on the single element of a comparison of the contractor\u2019s wage level to that of General Services\u2019, without consideration of any of the other criteria or the resolution of obviously conflicting statutory provisions relative to wages. Such a judicial interpretation does a disservice to all of the parties and sound judicial practice. The court had before it evidence of the factual context, the administrative agency\u2019s analysis of the wage problem, as well as the agency\u2019s overall interpretation and harmonization of those elements. The court obviously did not give the agency\u2019s decision any consideration. In <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Perluss </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 824 [27 Cal.Rptr. 19, 377 P.2d 83], the Supreme Court articulated the proper legal consideration the court should give to administrative determinations and stated that parties and court should recognize the intricate and technical nature of the subject matter as well as the expertise and full technical knowledge which its administration requires. It would be presumptive of a court to claim such skill; it should not therefore superimpose its policy judgment upon the agency in the absence of an arbitrary and capricious decision. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 832.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The administrative decision in this instance was thorough, thoughtful, factual, and reasonable, not capricious or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Another fundamental rule of statutory interpretation requires that where a statute is susceptible of different interpretations, the one that leads to the more reasonable result should be followed. <em>(Metropolitan Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 620, 630 [197 P.2d 543].) In addition to all of the factual criteria which precipitated the need to contract for security services, the agency carefully analyzed the wage differential in the total factual environment; the trial court did not do so. The SPB on the facts concluded the wage differential did not warrant rejection of the contract. Its conclusion was that the salaries to be paid by the successful bidder met the industry level and although the contractor\u2019s wage rate was lower than the state\u2019s wage, that fact did not warrant rejection of the contract and concluded \u201cApproval of the proposed contract is warranted by: (a) the inability of the department to continue to obtain service from the State Police after May 24, 1985; (b) the overall cost savings of 31% to the State by contracting out to the proposed vendor; (c) the proposed vendor\u2019s wage being at industry\u2019s level; and (d) the ability of the proposed vendor to provide more efficient service than the department could provide. Should any of the proposed vendor\u2019s security staff be unable to work, coverage can be provided from the pool of reserve staff. On the other hand, if a State employee cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>come to work, there is no reserve staff to cover; other Security Guards must cover at the overtime rate of pay. In addition, the proposed vendor can provide supervision more efficiently because the supervisor is not permanently assigned onsite on a full-time basis but circulates among several of the contractor\u2019s client businesses. Supervision is available 24 hours a day as needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Such an interpretation and application obviously carries out the intent and purpose of the Legislature and effectuates the purpose of the law. <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 645.) It is fundamental in such cases that a statutory construction which sensibly resolves an apparent controversy is preferred to one which renders statutory purpose or language meaningless. <em>(Wells </em>v. <em>Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 788 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In the context of the needs presented by virtue of General Services\u2019 decision and Teale Data Center\u2019s requirement of security service, the statute required a broad rather than literal interpretation in order to uphold the usefulness of the statute and give its purpose meaning and effect and avoid an absurd result. <em>(Herbert Hawkins Realtors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milheiser </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 334, 338 [189 Cal.Rptr. 450].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Moreover, I consider the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cundercut\u201d as used in section 19130, subdivision (a)(2), to have effectually rendered the statute meaningless and purposeless. The statutory language which requires the contractor\u2019s pay scale to be at the industry level, which Universal Service Contractor\u2019s was, but at the same time virtually meet the state pay level, creates a conflict and results in a language surplusage in the statute. (\u00a7 19130, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The trial court decision seems to ignore the semantics involved in the consideration of the term \u201cundercut\u201d as used in section 19130, subdivision (a)(2). The definition of the term in this context is to accept or offer to accept a lower wage than is standard or general. The definition implies a deliberate act to abridge or depress a wage level. Such evidence is not demonstrated by the record; rather, the contrary appears to clearly be the case. The question then becomes which of the conflicting provisions must yield. I am firmly convinced that to achieve the overall legislative purpose, the administrative decision correctly resolved that problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Government Code section 19130 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cThe purpose of this article is to establish standards for the use of personal services contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201c(a) Personal services contracting is permissible to achieve cost savings when all the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201c(1) The contracting agency clearly demonstrates that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the state, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201c(A) In comparing costs, there shall be included the state\u2019s additional cost of providing the same service as proposed by a contractor.
