Continental does not contest its liability for general damages nor the amount thereof, but appeals only on the ground that the punitive damages are inappropriate and excessive. Underwriters contends it is not subject to section 790.03, and has no liability thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We emphasize that we are confronted with a finding of liability based only on a violation of a statutory duty. Therefore, it is unnecessary to discuss Underwriters\u2019 theories which exonerate it due to the lack of a contractual relationship with respondents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 790.03 is part of the Unfair Practices Act. (\u00a7 790 et seq.) Underwriters contends that the Unfair Practices Act applies only to persons and entities engaged in the business of insurance, that independent insurance adjusters are not so engaged, and thereby reasons that it cannot be subject to liability for violation of a statute which was not designed to regulate its activities.  It further contends that independent insurance adjusters are regulated solely by the Insurance Adjusters Act (\u00a7 14000 et seq.), to the exclusion of section 790.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Addressing this latter contention first, we note at least two reasons for its rejection. First, the mere fact that adjusters are regulated under one area of the Insurance Code does not preclude them from being governed by other portions. (See, e.g., restrictions on compensation of insurance adjusters in \u00a7\u00a7 815-816.) No provision of the Insurance Adjusters Act can be construed as insulating adjusters from liability for conduct prohibited by other regulatory acts in the Insurance Code. Second, the Insurance Adjusters Act is principally concerned with licensing. Its regulatory provisions primarily govern the adjusters\u2019 relationship with their clients, rather than with the insured party or the claimant, as contrasted with subdivision (h) of section 790.03, which is designed to protect insureds, claimants and the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">To determine who is governed by the Unfair Practices Act we look first to its language, which specifically defines and prohibits various \u201cunfair claims settlement practices\u201d as \u201cunfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance.\u201d (\u00a7 790.03.) Hence, the Act clearly recognizes that the settlement of insurance claims is part and parcel of the business of insurance. Section 790.01 states: \u201cThis article applies to reciprocal and interinsurance exchanges, Lloyds Insurers, fraternal benefit societies, fraternal fire insurers, grants and annuities societies, insurers holding certificates of exemptions, motor clubs, nonprofit hospital associations, agents, brokers, solicitors, surplus line brokers and special lines surplus line brokers as well as <em>all other persons engaged in the business of insurance.\" </em>(\u00a7 790.01, italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The mere fact that adjusters are not specifically delineated in the statute does not operate to exclude them from its coverage. It appears clear that the Legislature\u2019s reference in section 790.01 to \u201call other persons engaged in the business of insurance\u201d is not meaningless surplusage, a construction which should be avoided, if possible. <em>(California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836].) Rather, in this context the <em>ejusdem generis </em>doctrine of statutory construction applies. It provides \u201cthat where general words follow specific words in an enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace things similar in nature to those things enumerated by the preceding specific words. [Fn.] [Citations.] [\u00b6] <em>Ejusdem generis </em>applies under the following circumstances: A statute contains an enumeration by specific words; the members of the enumeration constitute a class; the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; a general reference supplements the enumeration, usually following it; and there is no clearly manifested intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the rule requires. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1978) 90 Cal.App.3d 309, 315 [155 Cal.Rptr. 1].) Hence, Underwriters is encompassed by section 790.03 if, at the time of its conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>giving rise to the cause of action herein, it was engaged in the business of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The Insurance Code contains a statutory definition of \u201cinsurance,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but not of the phrase \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d However, our review of the Insurance Code and relevant decisions of our Supreme Court leads us to conclude that independent insurance adjusters retained to investigate and settle insurance claims are engaged in the business of insurance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 785 [183 Cal.Rptr. 810, 647 P.2d 86], an insurance company (Colonial), its independent claims adjuster (Equifax, Inc.) and the adjuster\u2019s employee (J. T. Sharkey) were sued for damages resulting from alleged unfair practices in violation of section 790.03. Equifax had been ordered by the trial court to produce records concerning other cases handled by Sharkey. Colonial petitioned for a writ of mandate to bar the plaintiff from discovering the identities of other Colonial claimants, or to restrict the plaintiff\u2019s use thereof. The Supreme Court affirmed and denied relief, emphasizing that although the insurance company was also being sued under contractual theories, the adjusters were being charged only with the violation of section 790.03 <em>(id., </em>at p. 788, fn. 1), and that \u201cevidence regarding Sharkey\u2019s previous dealings may be relevant to prove ratification or authorization by Equifax and Colonial of his alleged unfair acts. This proof may also be relevant to the issue of punitive damages.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 792, fn. 9.) Thus, even though the issue presented by the instant case was not squarely before it in <em>Colonial Life, </em>the Supreme Court clearly recognized the implication of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Shortly following its decision in <em>Colonial Life, </em>the Supreme Court was asked in <em>Illinois Commercial Men\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 839 [196 Cal.Rptr. 198, 671 P.2d 349] to determine whether California could tax the gross premiums collected by foreign insurance companies who solicited business here by mail and used local independent insurance adjusters to investigate and settle claims. \u201cThe significant element in making this determination is whether the contacts between the insurers and the state justify imposition of the tax under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 843.) The court held that the foreign insurers were subject to California tax, and that within that context \u201cthe investigation and settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>of claims is an integral and crucial aspect of the business of insurance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 849.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">This observation by our Supreme Court in the <em>Illinois Commercial </em>decision is equally appropriate within the context of the instant case. The readiness and ability to cover losses is the very <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of insurance, and most of the regulatory features of the Insurance Code are designed to protect the insured parties, claimants and the public, by attempting to guarantee that insured losses will be covered when they occur. (See, e.g., requirements for reserve accounts in \u00a7 923.5, and membership in the California Insurance Guarantee Association required by \u00a7 1063.) From the perspective of the policyholders who have faithfully paid their premiums, the most essential part of the business of insurance is the prompt and forthright investigation and payment of their claims. It is common knowledge, that a substantial portion of the insurance claims which are annually investigated and negotiated through to settlement in California are handled by independent insurance adjusters, many of whom are representing foreign insurers. (See, e.g., <em>Illinois Commercial Men\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 839.) To absolve adjusters from liability for engaging in conduct prohibited by the Unfair Practices Act is to deny the protection of that Act to the persons it was designed to benefit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 880 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329].) Underwriters was engaged in the business of insurance as defined by the Unfair Practices Act, and subject to the proscriptions of section 790.03, subdivisions (h)(1) through (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Low, P.
