Writ dated April 12, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-13\">The declaration contained two counts. The first count, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>was at common law, concluded as follows: \u201cAnd the plaintiff says that the said intestate was taken to a hospital after her injuries, during which time she endured conscious suffering, until the time of her death. And the plaintiff claims damages for conscious suffering of the said Nabeha Battany from the time of said accident until the time of her death.\u201d The second count was for causing the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hardy, </em>J. The testimony in regard to conscious suffering, referred to in the opinion, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">Mary Battany, the mother of the intestate, testified that she heard that the intestate was at the City Hospital and went to see her there, and that she died at about twelve o\u2019clock that night. She was asked, \u201cDid you say anything to her?\u201d and answered, \u201cI called to her and she says, 'Oh, momma!\u201d\u2019 She then was asked, \u201cDid she say anything else?\u201d and answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Her cross-examination was as follows: \u201cQ. When was that, when you first saw her that night? A. Yes. Q. And that is the only thing she said that night? A. That is all she said that night. Q. Were you with her until she died? A. Yes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-7\">The plaintiff, the father of the intestate, testified as follows: \u201cQ. Now, did you see your little girl at the hospital? A. Yes. Q. Did you speak to her at the hospital? A. No, I didn\u2019t. Q. Did your wife speak to her at the hospital? A. Mother spoke to her once. All she said, 'Oh, momma! \u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">The bill of exceptions .contained the following statement: \u201cThere was sufficient evidence on the question of the due care of the intestate and the negligence of the defendant to warrant the submission of the case to the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-9\">At the close of the evidence the counsel for the defendant made an oral motion that the judge direct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant on the first count. The judge granted this motion, and ordered the jury to return a verdict for the defendant on the first count of the declaration, \u201cupon the ground that there was not sufficient evidence of conscious suffering to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff under said count.\u201d The plaintiff excepted. No other motion was made nor was anything else said. The judge submitted the case to the jury on the second count of the declaration, and the jury found for the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>on the second count. The plaintiff alleged exceptions, which after the death of <em>Hardy, </em>J., were allowed by <em>Wait, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">The case was argued at the bar in November, 1918, before <em>Rugg, </em>C. J., <em>Loring, Braley, Pierce, &amp; Carroll, </em>JJ., and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-6\"><em>J.

M. on March 16, 1915, and thereafter lived until midnight. A right of action simultaneous with the injury accrued to the intestate, \u201cas a person in <em>esse, </em>and . . . [her] subsequent death does not defeat it, but, by operation of the statute, vests it in the personal representative.\u201d <em>Hollenbeck </em>v. <em>Berkshire Railroad, </em>9 Cush. 478. \u201cThe continuance of life after the accident, and not insensibility or want of consciousness, is the test by which it is determined whether a cause of action survives.\u201d <em>Mulchahey </em>v. <em>Washburn Car Wheel Co. </em>145 Mass. 281, 285, 286. <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>9 Cush. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The direction of the verdict for the defendant was error, because the plaintiff as matter of law was entitled to a verdict for nominal damages should the jury find the injury resulted from the negligence of the defendant without the contributing negligence of the intestate. <em>Mulchahey </em>v. <em>Washburn Car Wheel Co. supra. </em>St. 1914, c. 553. As there was no evidence of injury to property or property rights of the intestate, the plaintiff to recover actual damages must show the intestate suffered conscious pain or suffering. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Standard Sugar Refinery, </em>125 Mass. 90. The only evidence to indicate consciousness of the intestate between the moment of her injury and death was the testimony of the mother, corroborated by that of the father, that, at the hospital, the child in answer to her mother\u2019s call said \u201cOh, momma,\u201d and \u201cThat was all she said that night.\u201d Upon this testimony the question presented is, did the response \u201cOh, momma\u201d warrant a finding by the jury of conscious pain or suffering? The answer to this question may depend largely upon testimony which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>record cannot reproduce, which discloses to the jury that the words \u201cOh, momma\u201d were uttered by the child with an inflection and intonation which indicated conscious pain or suffering or merely a subconscious recognition of the voice and presence of the mother and a reflex struggle to show it. In the silence of the record we cannot say there was no issue of fact to warrant a jury in finding conscious suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In the opinion of a majority of the court the exceptions must be sustained, the new trial to be confined to the first count of the declaration; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
