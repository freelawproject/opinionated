It was an encyclopedia as the term is to be construed with reference to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of what the book was to contain.

The plates were executed, proof submitted and approved by the plaintiff, inserted in the book and the plates and prints delivered to the plaintiff. She paid the amount of the contract by check; unsuccessfully attempted to stop payment thereof, and brought this suit to recover the amount, on the ground that she was induced to enter into the contract by various false representations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">\u201cI find that no false representations were made; that the defendant performed all the terms of the contract; that the book conformed to all the guarantees legally binding upon the defendant, for the reasons given in the cross action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">\u201cI find for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">The request for rulings made by Elizabeth H.

The court excluded the evidence and the subscriber excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">In accordance with the above stated findings and rulings and refusals to rule the judge made general findings, in the first case for the plaintiff in the sum of $353.21 and in the second case for the defendant. In each case the subscriber alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-5\"><em>R. S. Warner, </em>for Elizabeth H.

The subscriber rests her right to reclamation, as well as her denial of liability, on the common ground shown by her requests for rulings and findings, which comprise all the material averments of the answer and allegations of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The trial judge was requested to rule and find, that the book delivered, but which she declined to accept, was not in conformity with the contract because it was not in <em>de luxe </em>binding, or reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was intended, or an encyclopedia, or edited by Cutter, and that the contract for the book was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentations of its character, of the editorial supervision, and of the society in relation to the Massachusetts Historical Society. The contract expressly provides, that \u201cNo representations or guaranties have been made which are not herein expressed. I base this order on what is promised in this contract, and it is also understood by me that this contract is not subject to countermand. I also agree to correct the personal sketch when presented to me for that purpose.\u201d The trial judge, having found, on evidence warranting the findings, that the binding was of the quality understood by the parties and that the work was an encyclopedia in such sense as the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>scriber well understood and knew, \u201cthat it was to contain only relatively few of the lives of those whom the publishers deemed to be representative men and accepted their standards without inquiries or objection,\u201d and that, after the \u201carticle as to her father was read to her\u201d and a full opportunity given to read it over and correct it, she \u201c signed her approval of it without reading,\u201d and that \u201cthe plates were executed, proof submitted and approved by the \u00a1^subscriber], inserted in the book and the plates and prints delivered to\u201d her for which she gave her check and that throughout all the transactions no fraudulent misrepresentations were made by the society, the subscriber\u2019s second, third and fourth requests, and subsections \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d of the first request were denied rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad1\">It is argued in support of subsections \"b\u201d and \u201c d\u201d that the work contained biographical sketches of persons who, although they may have been men of integrity, of good character, of average mental ability and successful in their various callings, which were reputable, yet they were not sufficiently illustrious either in birth or in academic or political honors to merit their inclusion by the society. But, whatever the standard which in the opinion of the subscriber should have been adopted in the selection and classification of those deemed worthy of remembrance by their fellow men, the contract under which the rights of the parties are to be determined not having contained any limitations or provisions of this character, or that Cutter personally should oversee its composition and preparation, no implied warranty of fitness of the book either in the choice of persons to be commemorated, or of editorial supervision, or of typographical perfection, or of literary finish and excellence is to be read in by implication. A buyer can contract for books with the understanding that in many particulars they may prove to be imperfect, just as the parties may contract for the sale of unmerchantable goods. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>118 Mass. 242. <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Consolidated Manuf. Co. </em>196 Mass. 257, It all depends upon the terms of the agreement. <em>Inter-State Grocer Co. </em>v. <em>George William Bentley Co. </em>214 Mass. 227, 231. The subscriber engaged to take the book and rested her order on the. terms of an unambiguous contract which cannot be enlarged by paroi evidence. And the only material representation or affirmation is that the work is to be entitled \u201cMemorial Encyclopedia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of the State of Massachusetts,\u201d which is \u201c to be issued in special De Luxe binding lettered in gold.\u201d The contract accordingly is to be construed as meaning that, if the book corresponded with the conditions therein named, the subscriber upon delivery must pay the price. <em>Curwen </em>v. <em>Quill, </em>165 Mass. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">More briefly stated the present case comes within the general rule, that where there is an express warranty in a written contract of sale, an implied warranty inconsistent with it is necessarily excluded. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>118 Mass. 242. <em>Peoria Grape Sugar Co. </em>v. <em>Turney, </em>175 Ill. 631. <em>Detroit Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Engel, </em>192 Mich. 62. <em>York </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>21 Mont. 515, 518. <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Lombard, Ayres &amp; Co. </em>149 N.

S. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The judge also properly excluded evidence of the Storer genealogy which had been prepared by Cutter for use by another company and contained statements that differed from the sketch appearing in the book in question. It was wholly irrelevant to any undertaking of the society.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The society being entitled to recover, the subscriber cannot prevail, and, perceiving no error of law in any of the rulings, her exceptions in each case should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
