Writ dated January 25, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>White, </em>J., at the same time with another case against Chase Langmaid, the owner of the building. The plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that the accident occurred on December 29, 1914, on the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the basement of a building on the northwest corner of Etna Street and North Beacon Street, Brighton; that, the entrance led to a store in the basement occupied by the defendant Freshman; that the building was owned by Chase Langmaid, who held the legal title to it in trust for Webster C. Langmaid; that the building was of brick, two and one half stories high with a somewhat flat roof, which pitched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>slightly from, the ridgepole in the centre toward North Beacon Street and from the same point toward the rear wall of the house; that the entire basement was adapted for and used as a store with an entrance on Etna Street, in front of which entrance the accident occurred; that the side wall of the building on Etna Street was topped by a brick parapet about eight inches wide and extending over the entire length of the wall. The plaintiff also offered evidence tending to prove that at the time of the accident the defendant was the lessee and occupant of the entire building including the basement store under a lease, which was introduced in evidence, and which contained the following covenant: \u201cThe lessee is to pay all the water rates, and also to do all the necessary repairs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anq\">f The plaintiff also introduced evidence tending to prove that Webster C. Langmaid was duly authorized to execute the lease in behalf of Chase Langmaid; that during the occupation by the defendant under the lease a wooden canopy or hood was maintained over the doorway or entrance to the basement \u00a1 store on Etna Street; that such canopy or hood was as long : as the doorway was wide, that is, about five feet, and projected out from the side of the building into Etna Street about eighiteen inches and sloped at an angle of about forty-five degrees from the side wall of the building downward toward the sidewalk; that the outer edge of this canopy or hood projected slightly beyond and was parallel with the outside edge of a step which was let down into the Etna Street sidewalk and was built below its surface so as to afford easy access to the basement store; that the canopy was constructed to protect the store entrance from rain and snow and that there was no gutter or <em>i </em>conductor on the outside edge of the canopy nor connected with it in any way to carry off drippings. It was admitted that Etna Street at the place where the accident occurred was a public street and that the sidewalk at the place in question was made of dirt and gravel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afp\">The plaintiff also offered evidence tending to prove that on January 11,1915, two copies of a notice of the time, place and cause of the accident were delivered to the defendant Freshman in the basement store on Etna Street and that on the same day the defendant handed one copy of the notice to Webster C. Lang-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>maid who was duly authorized to receive it in behalf of the owner Chase Langmaid</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-3\">The notices were identical in form.

He refused to order a verdict for the defendant Freshman.

The jury having returned a verdict for her, the case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission of evidence, and to the refusal of the presiding judge to rule that the action could not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The evidence warranted a finding, that the accumulation of ice was caused by the freezing of water dripping from a wooden canopy or hood which projected over the sidewalk and formed part of a building abutting on the street, occupied by the defendant as a tenant of one Langmaid the lessor. It is argued that, if the plaintiff can recover, the lessor alone is liable under the rule of <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>206 Mass. 1, and <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>209 Mass. 552. But by the terms of the lease the entire building was demised, and, having covenanted \u201cto do all the necessary repairs,\u201d the defendant as between himself and the public was required to keep the building in such a state of repair that the sidewalk of the adjoining street would be reasonably safe for the plaintiff\u2019s use. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>101 Mass. 251. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Storer, </em>115 Mass. 86. <em>Coman </em>v. <em>Alles, </em>198 Mass. 99, 102. The lessee\u2019s possession and control of the building included the canopy over the doorway or entrance to the basement store, which the jury on evidence properly admitted could find had been put up and maintained by him without a gutter or conductor whereby the water might have been diverted from the street and the formation of ice thereon prevented. The building under such conditions imperilled the safety of travellers, and was a nuisance to which the jury could say the plaintiff\u2019s injury was attributable. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>101 Mass. 251, 253</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">But under St. 1908, c. 305, as amended, the plaintiff cannot prevail unless the defendant was given notice of the time, place and cause of the injury. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Taintor, </em>229 Mass. 174. It was contended at the trial that the notice \u201cwas not properly addressed to either defendant and . . . the cause of the accident was not properly explained,\u201d and it was urged at the argument, that no cause of action is described in the notice because the \u201ctime, place and cause of accident\u201d are not specified. The defendant, however, duly received the notice, which under St. 1908, c. 305, as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>is sufficient not only in form but in substance for reasons stated in <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>229 Mass. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">The plaintiff having been entitled to go to the jury, the ruling requested was refused rightly, and, no error of law appearing in the admission of evidence, the exceptions should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
