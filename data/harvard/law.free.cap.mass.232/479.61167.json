Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated July 19, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-10\">The declaration was in two counts. The first count contained allegations that on June 14, 1917, the plaintiff became lessee of the premises in question under a lease in writing, that at that time the defendants were in possession unlawfully and without right, that the plaintiff immediately gave to the defendants a notice of his lease and demanded possession of the premises, that the defendants continued to occupy to and including the date of the writ, and owed the plaintiff the fair valu\u00e9 of the premises for that period, which was $121.87. The second count was upon an account annexed for use and occupation of the premises for the period named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-11\">The defendants\u2019 answer, besides a general denial, alleged in substance that they had occupied the premises under a sublease in writing from the McNeil Corporation, who held a lease in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>writing from the owner; that on March 16, 1917, \u201cby reason of a failure on the part of the McNeil Corporation to pay its rent in accordance with the stipulation in its written lease,\u201d the owner \u201cmade an entry of said premises and took possession of same and notified the defendants to pay their rent to\u201d him; that the defendants refused to recognize the title of the owner and entered into an agreement in writing with him whereby he \u201cagreed to recognize the lease as valid which the defendants had entered into with the said McNeil Corporation, and further agreed to receive the rent from the defendants as agent for the said McNeil Corporation and further agreed to protect the defendants in case the McNeil Corporation should attempt 'to break the defendants\u2019 lease by reason of their failure to pay the rent direct to the McNeil Corporation;\u201d that the defendants paid their rent as it became due; that on June 15, 1917, they sent a check for the .rent to the owner, who returned it, notifying them of the lease to the plaintiff and of his demanding the premises; that they also received such notice and demand in writing from the plaintiff; that they notified the plaintiff that they held the premises under a lease in writing as above set out; that on June 26,1917, they by their attorney made an agreement in writing with the plaintiff by his attorney, by a letter hereinafter quoted, and that, excepting as stated in that letter, they never admitted the plaintiff\u2019s title and that they never have agreed to pay the plaintiff any rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">At the trial in the Municipal Court, the evidence was introduced which is described in the opini\u00f3n. The letter of June 26, 1917, from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to the defendants\u2019 attorney followed a conference between one of the defendants and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">\u201cThis letter is to confirm the oral understanding reached between us on Saturday last in relation to ejectment proceedings brought by Albion K.

This agreement, however, did not contemplate any compromise with respect to the payment for use and occupation of the premises by-Messrs.

The lease was admitted in evidence.

The judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston before whom the case was tried found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The premises in question were leased by the owner, one Sawyer, to the plaintiff on June 14, 1917, by a written lease for the term of one year; and the plaintiff immediately gave to the defendants notice to quit, and thereafter commenced ejectment proceedings against them under R. L. c. 181. There was evidence that the defendants agreed with the plaintiff that they would not contest the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, but if given until August 1 would vacate the premises. The defendants moved out on July 21, and this action is brought to recover rent from June 14 to July 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">There was also evidence that the \u201cMcNeil Corporation\u201d, held a written lease of the entire building for a term of years, and had sublet by a written lease three floors in the building to the defendants, being the same floors described in the lease to the plaintiff; that before the execution of the lease to the plaintiff the owner went to the premises for the purpose of taking possession thereof for breach of the conditions of the lease held by the McNeil Corporation; and that at that time three months\u2019 rent was due from that lessee. The defendants contended that, by an agreement with the owner, the latter agreed to receive as agent for the McNeil Corporation the rent due from the defendants which might accrue; and to protect them from any claim for rent which that corporation might make.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">It is the contention of the defendants that an action for use and occupation will not lie against them as tenants at sufferance, upon the ground that they denied the plaintiff\u2019s title and claimed to occupy under a title adverse to that of the plaintiff; and that they neither expressly nor impliedly promised to pay rent to the plaintiff. There was evidence from which it could have been found that the defendants, after receiving notice to quit, did not occupy the premises under the lease which they held from the McNeil Corporation and that they did not claim so to occupy; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>but that after the ejectment proceedings were brought one of the defendants stated to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that it would be impossible for them to vacate immediately and that they desired further time \u2014 until August 1 \u2014 which was given. If the trial judge found that the defendants at their request were permitted to remain in possession until August 1, they are liable to pay rent for the time they so remained. R. L. c. 129, \u00a7 3. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Magorty, </em>156 Mass. 209. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Mass. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">There was also evidence that, before the owner leased to the plaintiff, the defendants attorned to the owner by paying him a month\u2019s rent, and took a receipt on March 16, 1917, in which the owner recited: \u201cI hereby guarantee said company [the defendants] against any claim that McNeil Corporation may make for such rent.\u201d It also appeared that the defendants sent to the owner a check for rent due from June 15,1917, to July 15,1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Upon all the evidence the court was warranted in finding that the defendants did not claim to occupy under any adverse title, but treated the owner as entitled to possession as against the McNeil Corporation before the lease to the plaintiff was given, and afterwards admitted the right of the plaintiff to possession under his lease and impliedly promised to pay rent for the time which they occupied after receiving notice to quit until they moved out on July 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Upon such findings the defendants were liable whether the lease to the McNeil Corporation had been legally terminated or not; and the plaintiff\u2019s rights are not affected by the fact that he did not notify the defendants, when he agreed to allow them to remain in possession until August 1, that they would be required to pay rent for the time they so occupied. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Peaslee, </em>3 Allen, 235. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Bullock, </em>105 Mass. 486. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Williams, supra. Garin </em>v. <em>Durden Coleman Lumber Co. </em>229 Mass. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The questions put to the defendant Kolilcof in his direct examination were inadmissible and were properly excluded. The evidence offered by the plaintiff, that at the time Sawyer went to take possession of the premises three months\u2019 rent was due from the McNeil Corporation, was competent as tending to show that the owner was entitled to terminate its lease. The admission in evidence of the execution issued in the ejectment proceedings did not harm the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>All the requests for rulings not given, except the first, were properly refused because not in accordance with the facts found.
