At the close of the evidence the judge instructed the jury on the question of liability (to which no exceptions were taken), and submitted to them the question: \u201cOn June 8, 1916, was the plaintiff on a car of the defendant which left the rail at the corner of Dorchester Avenue and Savin Hill Avenue, Dorchester?\u201d The jury answered in the negative; whereupon the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The issue raised by the pleadings was whether the plaintiff was a passenger on a car of the defendant, which by reason of the defendant\u2019s negligence was derailed. The finding of the jury that she was not on the car which \u201cleft the rail,\u201d disposes of the plaintiff\u2019s case. If she was not a passenger on the car on the day alleged, when it was derailed, she cannot recover under her declaration. The only negligence set out in the declaration, and the only negligence for which she could recover, was the negligence of the defendant in the maintenance and construction of its tracks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>and its operation of its car, by which negligence the car left the rails; as the. jury found that she was not a passenger on the car, she cannot on the pleadings recover. See in this connection <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>217 Mass. 312, 314, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The case was argued on the assumption that the finding of the jury did not mean that the plaintiff was not a passenger on the car which was derailed, but meant that the car did not leave the rails. It is plain from the question submitted to the jury and their answer, that the plaintiff was not on the car which left the rails. But, even if the assumption that the car was not derailed were correct, then the plaintiff cannot recover: she based her claim entirely on the negligence of the defendant in causing the car to leave the rails. This is the only allegation of fault; and, if the car remained on the rails, she has not shown the defendant to have been negligent. By the plain meaning of the finding of the jury the plaintiff cannot recover; and, as no negligence other than the derailment is set out in the pleadings, there is no liability, even if the car was not derailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
