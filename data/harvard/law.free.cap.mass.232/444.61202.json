The alleged custom was, in substance, that where a real estate broker, employed for the purpose of getting an increased rent, secures a <em>bona fide </em>offer from a responsible person, if the owner takes such offer to the present tenant and thereafter that tenant\u2019s lease is extended at the figure of the new offer, the broker is entitled to a full commission on the gross rent. It appeared that the plaintiff was employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>under a contract in writing, which provided that he should get a commission, only if he secured a tenant acceptable to the defendant and \u201cproviding they will pay what I [the defendant] consider to be a fair rental and providing other conditions are satisfactory to me.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, even if the custom alleged had been proved by the evidence and was applicable to the facts of the case, it could not be used to contradict the plain provisions of the express contract which the parties had made and to substitute another contract which they had not made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJO\">In the same case the plaintiff also contended that the defendant acted in bad faith, especially by negotiating with his present tenant without notifying the plaintiff and by quoting to such tenant the amount of the rent offered by the prospective tenant alleged to have been procured by the plaintiff without disclosing by whom the offer was made. It appeared that the plaintiff never had approached the defendant\u2019s present tenant and that that tenant was not induced to take a new lease of the premises by any efforts of the plaintiff, and that the defendant only had sought to induce his present tenant to continue as lessee at an increased rent when it appeared doubtful whether the defendant and the prospective tenant alleged to have been procured by the plaintiff could come to terms. <em>Held, </em>that the mere fact that the defendant quoted to his present tenant the amount of rent offered by the plaintiff\u2019s alleged customer was not evidence of bad faith or of a purpose to, defraud the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b469-5\">In the same case the plaintiff also contended that he was entitled to a commission on the ground that by his agreement with the defendant he had the exclusive right to lease the real estate in question at the time that the defendant gave the new lease to his present lessee. The plaintiff testified that shortly before the new lease was made the defendant said to him \u201cthat he was not negotiating with anybody for that property, that I knew that I was the only one that was handling the matter.\u201d If this and other evidence of the plaintiff was believed, it could have been found that the defendant had agreed that no other broker or agent should be employed to lease the premises and that the procurement of the new lease to the old tenant at the increased rent by another broker employed by the defendant was a breach of this agreement. The question of exclusive agency appeared to have been presented fully by the evidence at the trial, but the plaintiff\u2019s declaration contained no allegation of exclusive agency. The judge ordered a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that the ordering of the verdict by the judge was right on the pleadings before him, but that, if within thirty days the Superior Court should permit the plaintiff to amend his declaration by adding one or more counts to cover the issue of exclusive agency, the exceptions should be sustained, and that otherwise they should be overruled.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">Contract by a real estate broker to recover a commission of $5,123.66, amounting to one per cent on the gross rent of real estate of the defendant numbered 633 on Washington Street in Boston payable by the W.

L. Douglas Shoe Company, with which he had been connected for eighteen or nineteen years, and that his duties included the leasing of property for the occupation of stores by the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company. On his cross-examination this witness was asked by the defendant, \u201cWhat influence, Mr. Packard, did any of the quotations that were ever made to you have on your finally agreeing to take a lease of these premises on the terms at which you did take them? \u201d The question was objected to and the judge permitted the witness to answer it subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.

Negotiations with the plaintiff were conducted by the defendant\u2019s husband, Herbert S. Johnson, and it is agreed that he acted as her duly authorized agent. In May, 1914, when the plaintiff\u2019s services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>began, the premises were occupied by the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company, at a yearly net rent of $13,000, under a lease which would expire on January 1, 1917. The plaintiff\u2019s efforts were mainly exercised in endeavoring to secure Messrs. Sallinger and Mitchell (referred to hereafter as Sallinger) as tenants; and he had many consultations and considerable correspondence, especially with their broker Fishel and with Johnson, endeavoring to bring about, that result. About the middle of January, 1915, Johnson\u2019s agent or attorney began negotiations with the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company; and these resulted in a new lease to that company on April 15, 1915, for a term of twenty years and six months from the expiration of the existing lease, and at a net yearly rent of approximately $19,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">1. We find no error in the admission or exclusion of evidence. In view of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the lease to the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company resulted from his efforts, it was competent for the defendant to ask that company\u2019s agent, on cross-examination, \"What influence . . . did any of the quotations-that were ever made to you have on your finally agreeing to take a lease of these premises on the terms at which you did take them?\u201d and \u201cWhat did influence you in taking this lease on the terms on which you took it? \u201d The contents of the written application made for a loan on the premises, by the defendant\u2019s agent, were immaterial. The plaintiff did not claim any commission for securing a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">2. The plaintiff contends that he was entitled to go to the jury on the ground that he procured a customer ready, able and willing to take a lease; and further that an offer submitted by Sallinger was accepted by the defendant. But Sallinger\u2019s final offer, made by his broker Fishel on January 11, 1915, left still undetermined the location, kind and quality of the alterations, not to exceed $30,000, which were to be (as the offer expressly recited) \"subject to the approval of the owners and the prospective lessees.\u201d After-wards alteration sketches and specifications were submitted back and forth, but nothing definite had been agreed upon when Johnson wrote to the plaintiff, February 26, 1915, enclosing a statement of the necessary improvements suggested by his architect, to be forwarded to Sallinger for approval or additions; nor when the plaintiff wrote to Johnson, April 29, 1915, that Sallinger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>was dissatisfied \u201cand would not continue to negotiate any further.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In apparent support of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the Sal-linger offer was accepted by the defendant, we are referred to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in cross-examination, that it was accepted \u201cWhen Dr. Johnson called at my office, January 13.\u201d But he subsequently explained this by testifying \u201cOnly the money and solvency of the tenants was settled then; the repairs were never settled; no, sir, we never came to definite terms on the whole lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">An examination of all the evidence discloses that the jury would not have been warranted in finding that the prospective tenant and the landowner ever agreed on the final terms of a lease, or that there was an acceptance by Johnson of a definite offer submitted by Sallinger. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>224 Mass. 577, 585. <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Mesene, </em>228 Mass. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">3. The plaintiff further contends that he proved a custom or usage under which he was entitled to charge the usual commission. The alleged custom was, in substance, that when a real estate agent, employed for the purpose of getting an increased rent, secures a <em>hona fide </em>offer from a responsible person, if the owner takes such offer to the present tenant, and thereafter that tenant\u2019s lease is extended at the figure of the new offer, the agent is entitled to a full commission on the gross rent. Without considering other objections, the alleged usage could not apply in this case, where the plaintiff was employed under a contract providing that he should get a commission only if he secured a tenant acceptable to the owner, and \u201cproviding they will pay what I [Johnson] consider to be a fair rental and providing other conditions are satisfactory to me.\u201d Even if the evidence should be interpreted as proving the existence of a custom applicable to the facts of this case, it could not be used to contradict the plain express contract which the parties made, and to substitute therefor a new contract which they had not made. <em>Menage </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>175 Mass. 358. <em>Boruszewski </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>186 Mass. 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">4. Another contention of the plaintiff is that Johnson acted in bad faith, especially by negotiating with the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company without notifying the plaintiff, by quoting to that company the rents offered by Sallinger, and by continuing to avail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>himself of the plaintiff\u2019s continued negotiations with Sallinger and his services in getting out plans, specifications and bids on suggested alterations, even after he (Johnson) had given an option to the Douglas company. The difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s legal claim is that he never had approached the Douglas company, and that it was not induced to lease the premises through any efforts of his. This is not a case where the owner in bad faith revokes the broker\u2019s authority and himself leases the property to the broker\u2019s customer. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>206 Mass. 520. When, after prolonged negotiations, it appeared doubtful whether Sallinger and the defendant would agree upon terms, Johnson\u2019s agent or attorney sought to induce the Douglas company to continue as tenant, at an increased rent. The mere fact that the rent already offered was quoted to that company, (without disclosing by whom it was made,) did not in itself constitute evidence of bad faith and a purpose to defraud the plaintiff. <em>Bowes </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>228 Mass. 341, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">5. The plaintiff further argues that he is entitled to a commission on the ground that he had the exclusive right to lease the premises at the time the lease was made to the W. L. Douglas Shoe Company. See <em>Viking Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>226 Mass. 10. On this issue there was evidence tending to prove the following facts: On May 8,1914, the plaintiff wrote to Herbert S. Johnson about some property on Huntington Avenue, and Johnson replied: \"... You can approach Thomas F. Reddy about it. He is our attorney and has handled our real estate transactions for us.\u201d In response to this, and a letter from Mr. Reddy, he conferred with the latter about different properties he (Reddy) had for sale, including a lease of 633 Washington Street. The plaintiff said he would give Reddy a percentage of the commission. In subsequent letters and conversations the plaintiff insisted that he would not undertake to get a tenant unless the matter was placed exclusively in his hands. On May 23 the plaintiff wrote to Johnson that as he might have to pay one half of the commission to a broker for the lessee, he could not pay an additional thirty per cent to Mr. Reddy; and was then informed by Mr. Reddy that he could not have the exclusive letting of the property. Later, on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, Johnson orally agreed to \u201cleave Mr. Reddy out entirely,\u201d and allowed the plaintiff \u201cto make this rental.\u201d Sometimes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>language they used was \u201cthe exclusive right to lease the premises,\u201d and at other times \u201cthe exclusive agency.\u201d As late as December, according to the plaintiff, Johnson said to him \u201cthat he was not negotiating with anybody for that property, that I knew that I was the only one that was handling the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">There also was evidence that at the beginning, when the plaintiff suggested the advisability of his seeing Mr. Douglas or the present tenant, Johnson said that he had tried to interest them, that they would not pay an increased rent nor renew the lease, and \u201cit was not any use to see them.\u201d The evidence was uncontradicted that Mr. Reddy opened negotiations with the Douglas company in January, 1915, for a new lease, and the negotiations were carried on and concluded by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">If the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was believed the jury could find that Johnson at least had agreed that no other broker or agent should be employed to lease the premises; and that the procurement of a lessee by Mr. Reddy was a breach of such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">This question of exclusive agency apparently was fully tried out in the trial court, and has been argued before us. It is now urged by the defendant that there was no allegation of exclusive agency in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration; and that the direction of a verdict should stand as the judge acted under the pleadings before him. <em>Granara </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>212 Mass. 271, 275. For this reason, if within thirty days the Superior Court shall permit the plaintiff to amend his declaration by adding one or more counts to cover this issue, then the exceptions are to be sustained; otherwise, they are tobe overruled. See <em>Day </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>213 Mass. 585, 587, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
