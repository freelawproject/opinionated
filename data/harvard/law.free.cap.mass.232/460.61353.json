Writ dated October 17, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., together with actions respectively against the owner of the other car and O\u2019Brien, its driver. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence a verdict for the defendant owner of the other car was ordered by agreement, and the trial proceeded in the cases against O\u2019Brien and Sewall. The material evidence is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-11\">The defendant Sewall asked the judge to rule that, if O\u2019Brien was negligent and his negligence contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, there could be no recovery against the defendant Sewall. The judge refused to make this ruling. The defendant Sewall then asked the judge upon all the evidence to order a verdict for him. The judge refused to do this and submitted to the jury the cases against the defendant Sewall and the defendant O\u2019Brien. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant O\u2019Brien, and, in the action against the defendant Sewall, returned a verdict for the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>in the sum of $7,150. At the request of the defendant Sewall the judge reported the case for determination by this court. If the judge\u2019s refusal to order a verdict for the defendant was wrong, final judgment was to be entered for the defendant; otherwise, final judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in the amount of the verdict with interest from April 22, 1918, and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-6\"><em>F.

The weight of the evidence was wholly for the jury. The testimony of the driver of the other car that he momentarily accelerated its speed to twenty-two miles an hour in a vain effort to escape collision with the defendant, did not require the direction of a verdict in favor of the defendant. The jury found that the driver of the other car was not negligent. Even if the negligence of the driver of the other car contributed to the injury of the plaintiff, that would not exonerate the defendant from the direct result of his own negligence operating in concurrence with that of the other driver. <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, </em>224 Mass. 352, 361. The judge refused rightly to direct a verdict for the defendant and accordingly, by the terms of the report, judgment is to be now entered for the plaintiff in the amount of the verdict with interest from April 22, 1918, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
