The defendant contended that this finding must be wrong, because, considering the condition of the labor market at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, there should have been a deduction for what the plaintiff could have earned during the period for which he sought damages, but it was <em>held, </em>that this was a matter of fact which was disposed of by the finding of the judge, and, moreover, that one who has been employed in a special service is not bound to reduce damages for his wrongful discharge by engaging in a business that is not of the same general character.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Contract, for $160 alleged to be due to the plaintiff under a contract in writing by which the plaintiff agreed for one year from April 9, 1917, \u201cto devote his entire time, energy and skill to the selling of the products of\u201d the defendant \u201cin the various forms as manufactured and quarried by them, especially cemetery work in all its details,\u201d alleging that the plaintiff at all times was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract but was prevented from doing so by the defendant, its agents and servants.

In support of the defendant\u2019s request for a ruling that on all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, the defendant now urges that the plaintiff \u201cmisrepresented both his occupation and his earning capacity\u201d and represented that \u201che was qualified\u201d \u201cto perform efficiently the work for which he applied.\u201d In its \u201csubstitute answer\u201d the defendant alleged that the contract sued on \u201cwas based on the false and fraudulent representation of the plaintiff, upon which the defendant relied, that the plaintiff had theretofore been earning more than $50 a week\u201d and \u201cupon the following false and fraudulent representations of the plaintiff to the defendant, upon which the defendant relied, namely: first, that he was competent and capable of discharging the duties required of him, particularly in connection with the sale by him of the products of. the defendant, in reference to which he alleged himself to be especially qualified; second, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>he had sold from $25,000 to $30,000 worth of work during the previous year.\u201d The finding of the judge who heard the case is in these words: \u201cI find that the plaintiff and the defendant company entered into the contract set out in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration; that the contract was signed on April 3, 1917, but dated April 9, under the agreement that work was to begin on April 9, 1917; that on April 4, 1917, the plaintiff resigned employment with an automobile concern in preparation of entering the defendant\u2019s employ under this contract; that on April 9,1917, according to the contract of employment with the defendant he started to work; that the next day (April 10) the defendant company discharged him, giving no reason except that it wished to terminate the contract. The case was tried before me solely on the ground of fraudulent statements, inducing the contract. I find that no fraudulent statements were made by the plaintiff to the defendant company or to their agents to induce the contract.\u201d In connection with the requests for rulings the judge made the following additional findings: \u201cI find as a fact that the statement made by the plaintiff was that he \u2018was doing better than $50 per week,\u2019 and that the statement was true. ... I find as a fact . . . that what the plaintiff said was that \u2018with the defendant\u2019s'house behind him he ought to be able to do $25,000 to $30,000 worth of business.\u2019 \u201d The evidence warranted the findings. What the defendant is now asking us to do is to review the findings of fact and come to opposite conclusions upon the evidence. That is something which we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">2. The defendant\u2019s next contention is that the judge \u201cerred in assessing damages.\u201d The judge ruled that \u201cIf the plaintiff is entitled to recover, such recovery must be limited to the amount claimed in each suit less such sum as he has earned, or by the exercise of honest, earnest and intelligent efforts could have earned during the respective periods for which the claims are made.\u201d Acting under that rule of law the judge found that the plaintiff was entitled to the wages specified in the contract. The defendant\u2019s complaint is that on the evidence, and in view of what it is common knowledge that the condition of the labor market was from April to October, 1917, the judge must have been wrong in finding that nothing was to be deducted from the wages to which the plaintiff was entitled under the contract. This is open to the objection stated as to the contentions made by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>which we have just dealt with and is disposed of by what we have said in connection with them. In addition it was decided in <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>217 Mass. 100, that, \u201cwhile it was her [the plaintiff\u2019s^ duty to use reasonable diligence to secure other employment and thereby lessen her loss, it has generally been held that where, as in this case, a plaintiff was employed in a special service, she is not obliged to engage in a business that is not of the same general character, in order to mitigate the defendant\u2019s damages,\u201d under the rule of <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co. </em>200 Mass. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">What we have said disposes of the contentions made by the defendant in support of the rulings asked for by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">We have examined all the cases cited by the defendant and find nothing in them requiring notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
