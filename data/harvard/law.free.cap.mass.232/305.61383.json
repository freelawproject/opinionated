It appeared that by the fall of the plaintiff when knocked down two bones of the plaintiff were broken, one of her teeth was broken off, another was fractured and two others were cracked. The extent of the injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s teeth was in controversy. Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception the presiding judge permitted a witness for the plaintiff to testify that the speed of the motorcycle at the time it struck the plaintiff was approximately thirty miles an hour. This testimony was offered solely for the purpose of showing \u201cthe amount of force applied to her body.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was admissible, as the severity of the impact was a material fact proper for the consideration of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-4\">In the same case it appeared that there was a compound fracture of the lower third of the tibia of the plaintiff\u2019s left leg. There was evidence that about a month after the accident the leg became septic and discharged pus at the seat of the break and that this continued about three months longer and that then the plaintiff\u2019s condition improved rapidly and in.another month she was allowed to go to school, that about six weeks later as she was \u201cstarting to come down stairs in her own home, and had stepped from one stair to another with her left foot . . . her left leg \u2018crumpled\u2019 or gave way under her and it was found that the leg had again been broken at or near the site of the first break.\u201d There also was expert testimony to show that the second break occurred at the exact place of the first fracture. The jury found in answer to a special question put to them by the presiding judge that the second break was \u201cthe result of the accident without the intervention of any negligence on her part or any independent cause.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the finding of the jury in answer to the special question was not unwarranted, and that, whether the second injury was the result of a separate and independent cause, was a question of fact which had been determined by the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-5\">It is not open to an excepting party to contend that certain testimony was incompetent and should have been excluded if he did not except to its admission at the trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">Two actions of tort, the first for personal injuries sustained on August 8,1916, when the plaintiff, a girl about ten years of age, was alighting from a street railway car on North Main Street in Brockton and was knocked down by a motorcycle ridden by an employee of the defendant acting within the scope of his employment, and the second by the father of the plaintiff in the first case for consequential damages. Writs dated July 16, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Chase, </em>J. \u201cThe defendant admitted liability and filed an answer to that effect, and the case proceeded on the question of damages only.\u201d The material evidence and also an exception to the admission of certain evidence are described in the opinion. At the close of all the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff is not entitled to recover for any injuries resulting from her fall on March 5,1917.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-3\">The judge refused to make this ruling and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\">Under instructions to which no exceptions were taken the judge submitted to the jury the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">\u201c1. Was the second breaking of the plaintiff\u2019s leg the result of the accident without the intervention of any negligence on her part, or any independent cause?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If your answer to the preceding question is in the affirmative, what sum have you allowed in your verdict as damages for the second breaking of the leg? \u201d The jury answered, \"$500.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the first case in the sum of $6,050, and a verdict for the plaintiff in the second case in the sum of $480. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">The cases were submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-9\"><em>H.

The second action is for consequential damages. The defendant admitted liability and the case was tried on the question of damages only. The plaintiff in the first action will hereafter be referred to as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">There was evidence to show that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries consisted of a compound fracture of the lower third of the tibia of the left leg, a fracture of the right collar bone, an extensive abrasion over the right forehead, the breaking of one front upper tooth, the cracking of the left incisor, a fracture of the second bicuspid, a crack of the upper tooth next the one broken off, and nervous shock.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">1. A witness called by the plaintiff was permitted to testify, subject to the exception of the defendant, that the speed of the motorcycle at the time it struck the plaintiff was approximately thirty miles an hour. This testimony was offered solely for the purpose of showing \u201cthe amount of force applied to her body,\u201d and counsel so stated. While the only issue was that of damages and the defendant admitted that the plaintiff was injured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>collision, the extent of such injuries was not admitted but was in controversy, at least so far as the plaintiff sustained injuries to her teeth. The jury might reasonably have believed that the injuries to her teeth would have been likely to be much more severe if the motorcycle was running at a rate of speed of thirty miles an hour than if it was proceeding slowly. In the opinion of the majority of the court the severity of the impact was a material fact proper for the consideration of the jury. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>223 Mass. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\">2. The evidence that the plaintiff suffered a second fracture of the bone of her leg at the same point as the original fracture was properly admitted. There was evidence that about a month after the first break the leg became septic and discharged pus at the seat of the break which continued until the following December, when her condition rapidly improved and she was able to go to school in January, 1917, although her leg was still weak; that on March 5, 1917, as she was \u201c starting to come down stairs in her own home, and had stepped from one stair to another with her left foot . . . her left leg \u2018crumpled\u2019 or gave way under her and it was found that the leg had again been broken at or near the site of the first break.\u201d There also was medical testimony to show that the second' break occurred at the exact place of the first fracture; and the jury found in answer to a special question that the second break was \u201cthe result of the accident without the intervention of any negligence on her part or any independent cause.\u201d We are of opinion that this finding was not unwarranted. It could have been found that the second injury was received while the bone was weak and had not recovered its normal strength owing to the septic condition which developed after the original fracture; and from this the jury also could have found that the second fracture was a natural and proximate result of the first injury. The act of the plaintiff in attempting to walk down stairs was not negligent as matter of law. Whether the second injury was the result of a separate and independent cause was a question of fact. Upon this issue the instructions of the presiding judge were sufficiently favorable to the defendant. The' case is governed by the decision in <em>Hartnett </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>231 Mass. 382, recently decided by this court, and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">3. A dentist called by the plaintiff testified on direct examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>that \u201cin thirty years she would have to have false teeth, owing to loss of structure.\u201d The defendant contends that this testimony was incompetent and should have been excluded. We need not decide this question as the record shows that no exception was taken to its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
