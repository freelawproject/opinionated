M. at a place three feet from the edge of the sidewalk on the right hand side of Columbia Hoad in Dochester, leading from Upham\u2019s Corner to Franklin Park, in front of a small grocery store; that at the time of the accident a servant of the defendant, in the prosecution of the business of the defendant, was driving a two-ton motor truck with a load of furniture upon it in the direction of Franklin Park; that the truck had crossed Devon Street, distant from the place of the accident \u201cabout twice the length of the court room,\u201d had then proceeded over that distance until it came to the rear of a \u201ccracker wagon\u201d which was standing next to the curbing in front of the small grocery store, with the horse headed in the direction of Franklin Park; that the truck was turned to the left to pass the \u201ccracker wagon\u201d to about the centre of the street; that the driver went by the \u201ccracker wagon as close as he could\u201d and then, \u201cgoing at a moderate speed\u201d without blowing the horn in front of the horse, turned toward the sidewalk on the right side; that at this moment the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, eight years and four months old and \"a very bright boy indeed,\u201d left the sidewalk near the horse\u2019s head and walked or ran into the street five or six steps before he was hit by the \u201cright side\u201d of the front fender or by the \u201cright hand side of the automobile.\u201d In these circumstances no one could reasonably foresee the sudden presence of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate in the path of the automobile, or prevent a collision with him. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Northeastern Street Railway, </em>222 Mass., 233. <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>226 Mass. 418. <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 397, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In the opinion of a majority of the court the direction of the verdict for the defendant was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
