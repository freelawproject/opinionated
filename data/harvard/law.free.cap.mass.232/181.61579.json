Frier, while in the employ of the town of Randolph as janitor of a school building, was injured on two occasions. His first injury occurred on May 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>1916, and the second on December 4, 1916. The member of the Industrial Accident Board who heard the cases found that no claim for compensation was ever filed for the first injury. The statute requires that proceedings under the act shall not be maintained unless a claim therefor has been made in writing in accordance with St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 23, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">As to the second injury the member of the board found that it arose out of and in the course of the claimant\u2019s employment; that a claim was filed within the statutory period; that while no notice of the injury was given as provided by St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 15-18, the town had knowledge of the injury and \u201ctherefore, the fact that the employee failed to give notice in writing ... is not a bar to these proceedings.\u201d \u00a7 18. This finding is based upon the fact that the chairman of the school committee of the town filed with the board reports of the employee\u2019s injuries, copies of which are annexed to the record. The report of the injury of May 19, 1916, was filed on May 9, 1917, and that of the injury of December 4, 1916, was filed on May 7, 1917. Both reports are dated May 7, 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">No new evidence being presented, the report of the member containing all the material evidence, the board on review found \u201cthat the employee is not entitled to maintain these proceedings [as to either injury] because notice of the injuries was not given, as required by Part II, \u00a7 15, and that, in lieu thereof, the subscribers or their agent, did not have knowledge of such injuries as soon as practicable after their occurrence. Therefore, the employee is not entitled to compensation under the act.\u201d While it is plain that the reports, filed would well warrant a finding that the town had knowledge of the injuries at least as early as May 9, 1917, it does not follow that \u201cthe association, subscriber, or agent\u201d had such knowledge as takes the place of want of notice under \u00a7 18 of the act. The written notice of the injury which the statute requires under \u00a7 15 must be given \u201cas soon as practicable after the happening thereof.\u201d The knowledge which the subscriber has under \u00a7 18 must have been acquired within the time limited for the giving of notice under \u00a7 15; in other words, such knowledge must be had as soon as practicable after the employee is injured. In <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 31, it was said at page 37: \u201cKnowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>on the part of the employer is a substitute for the written notice required by St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 15, and the employer must have knowledge within the time when written notice should have been given, namely, \u2018as soon as practicable after the happening\u2019 of the injury. <em>Jeremiah Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 60.\u201d The fact that the subscriber did not give notice to the employee that it was insured under the act (Part IV, \u00a7 21), and that he did not have knowledge of that fact until on or about February 27, 1917, has no effect upon his rights or upon the finding of the board. <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">It cannot be said the finding that the subscriber or its agent \u201cdid not have knowledge of such injuries as soon as practicable after their occurrence,\u201d was unwarranted as matter of law; accordingly, it must stand. The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\n<em>Decree\u25a0 affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
