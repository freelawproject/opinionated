There was evidence that the defendant had continued to work at the place of business after he had given a bill of sale of the business to his alleged successor, who was a minor, and it might have been found that the transaction with such alleged successor was a sham and that the defendant in fact was conducting the business. <em>Held, </em>that the judge rightly refused to order a verdict for the defendant and that the case was one for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Contract for a balance alleged to be due on an account for goods sold and delivered to the defendant doing business under the name Reed Auto Supply Company.

The goods were charged to the Reed Auto Supply Company, a designation under which the defendant formerly did business. The defence was that the defendant before the delivery of the goods in question had transferred his business by bill of sale to one Derry, who thereafter had filed a certificate in conformity to St. 1907, c. 539, that he was conducting the business under 'the name of Reed Auto Supply. It appeared that Derry was a minor. There was evidence that Reed continued to work at the place of business after the bill of sale. It was open to the jury to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the transactions with and by Derry were a sham, and that Reed was in fact conducting the business. Hence there was no error in denying the motion for a directed verdict and all the requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
