Waiver.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b594-11\">A police officer of a city appointed under the civil service laws and rules of the Commonwealth gave to the city marshal his resignation in writing addressed to the mayor and aldermen to take effect on a certain day. Later the city marshal suspended the officer by a written order, wherein he was charged with drunkenness. After this the officer wrote to the mayor and aldermen that he withdrew his resignation and asked for a public hearing on the charges upon which the marshal had suspended him. At the next meeting of the board of aldermen it was voted to give the officer a hearing on a day named. On that day the officer said to the city solicitor and to the president of the board of aldermen that \u201che wanted to get away from the police department with a clear record,\u201d and this was reported to the board of aldermen. Thereupon the board passed the following order: \u201cOrdered, that the resignation of [the officer] as a member of the police force of .the City be and is hereby accepted as requested by him in his communication of April 24,1916. Be it further ordered that if any charges have been preferred against him by any one in authority said charges be withdrawn and expunged from any record, if the same have been recorded, thereby making said record clear. Be it further ordered that [the officer] be given a copy of this order.\u201d The officer was given a copy and neither he nor his counsel objected to it, and, in answer to a question from the city solicitor, the officer said, <em>\u201c </em>I have just what I wanted. I don\u2019t want anything to do with the police force, and I have got away with a clear record, and there is nothing against me.\u201d Immediately thereafter the mayor made a nomination in writing of a person to succeed the officer and the nomination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>was confirmed at a public meeting of the aldermen without any protest being made against the appointment of a successor to the officer. Later, the officer brought an action against the city for his services during the remainder of the time for which he had been appointed, alleging that he had been discharged unlawfully. A trial judge found and ruled that the plaintiff had waived all rights to a hearing and had acquiesced in all that had been done by the board of aldermen, and gave judgment for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that the finding was warranted and that the ruling was right.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-5\">Contract against the city of Newburyport to recover compensation for services alleged to have been performed by the plaintiff after his alleged unlawful discharge by the defendant.

Ladd as a member of the police force of the City be and is hereby accepted as requested by him in his communication of April 24, 1916. Be it further ordered that if any charges have been preferred against him by any one in authority said charges be withdrawn and expunged from any record, if same have been recorded, thereby making said record clear. Be it further ordered that George G.

I don\u2019t want anything to do with the police force, and I have got away with a clear record, and there is nothing against me; \u201d that thereupon and immediately thereafter the mayor made a nomination in writing of a person to.succeed the plaintiff, the nomination was confirmed at a public- meeting and no protest was made against the appointment of a successor to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Upon the foregoing facts, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, the presiding judge was warranted in finding and ruling, as he did, that the plaintiff waived all rights to a hearing and acquiesced in all that was done by the board of aldermen at the meeting of the board, May 8, 1916. This finding disposes of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for salary, and required a ruling in favor of the defendant. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>150 Mass. 491. <em>Malcolm </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>173 Mass. 312, 318. There was no error in admitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>testimony of Nelson, and, if so, it was not prejudicial to the plaintiff. <em>Old Colony Railroad </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>189 Mass. 116, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\">In accordance with the stipulation contained in the report, judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
