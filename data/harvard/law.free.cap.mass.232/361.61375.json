Writ dated March 16, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>J. F. Brown, </em>J. At the close of the evidence, which is described in the opinion, the judge excluded certain evidence offered by the plaintiff as there described and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-7\"><em>H.

It does not appear that the guard had been given authority to promulgate any general order relating to the use of the station by passengers, and at most what had been said on a former occasion did not amount to a present invitation to use the platform. <em>West </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>196 Mass. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The verdict for the defendant having been rightly ordered, the exceptions should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
