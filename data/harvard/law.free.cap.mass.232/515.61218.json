The findings of the Industrial Accident Board warranted by the evidence are stated in the \u25a0opinion.

The finding was (1) that the statutory notice required by the act had not been given, (2) that it had not been shown that either the association, the subscribers or their agent had notice of the injury, (3) that the claim for compensation had not been filed as required by the act, (4) that the failure to file the claim was not due to mistake or other reasonable cause, and (5) that the employee had failed to prove that he received a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment. Any one of these findings is fatal to the employee\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>These all were questions of fact. No law is involved. It has been held from the very first under the workmen\u2019s compensation act that the findings of fact of the Industrial Accident Board stand if there is any evidence to support them. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It is as futile for parties to appeal from a decision'of the board on questions of fact as it would be to except to an adverse verdict of a jury or an unfavorable finding by a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">It is enough to say that the board was at liberty to refuse to give credit to any part of the evidence not in their opinion entitled to credit. The case is within the authority of numerous recent decisions. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 473. <em>Moran\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 500. <em>Knight\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 142. <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 259. <em>Berman\u2019s Case, ante, </em>453.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
