Homans, described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">The cases were heard together by <em>Corbett, </em>J. The petitioner offered in evidence testimony of C. B. Terry, Esquire, that he knew Francis W. Homans in his lifetime; that he was consulted professionally by Homans after the death of his wife, Rebecca E., concerning the provisions of her will; that Homans in these consultations was angry and nervous about the way the will was drawn and over the difficulty he might have in disposing of the property described in these petitions; that at a subsequent similar conference Homans informed the witness that in the meantime he had consulted F. P. Cabot, Esquire, on the same subject matter, and that Homans was relieved of anxiety and was pleased after that conference with Mr. Cabot. This evidence was admitted <em>de bene, </em>and ultimately was ruled out by the judge as immaterial, subject to an exception by the petitioner. The petitioner also offered to prove by the witness Terry that as a part of the last mentioned conversation Francis W. Homans said to him that Mr. Cabot had stated to him (Homans) that he (Homans) did have the right to dispose by will of the property in question. This testimony was excluded subject to an exception by the petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">In each case the judge ruled that the petitioner did not take title to the premises, and that the petitions should be dismissed; and the petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-8\"><em>L.

Rebecca E. Homans at the time of her death, May 17, 1905, was the owner of the real estate in question and by her will dated January 7, 1904, devised all of her estate to her husband, Francis W. Homans, \"for and during the term of his natural life with the full power to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>pose of the whole or any part of said property by deed or otherwise if he may deem it conducive to his comfort so to do.\u201d On his death the property undisposed of by him was to go to Angie A. Fernald for life and at her decease it was to \u201c descend and be distributed according to law.\u201d On December 23, 1907, Francis W. Homans married the petitioner. By his will of December 19, 1911, after several bequests of money he gave all of his estate, including \u201cany over which I have any power of appointment and including all and whatever share, right or interest to which I or my estate may be entitled in any manner whatsoever under the will of my first wife, Rebecca E. Homans,\u201d to Harriett M. Homans, the petitioner. Angie A. Fernald, mentioned in the will of Rebecca, died before Francis W. Homans. The petitioner claims title to the two parcels of land, under the will of her husband. The respondents claim five undivided sixth parts of the property as heirs at law of Rebecca E. Homans, and assert that the other one undivided sixth part is now owned by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">By the will of Rebecca E. Homans the land given to her husband was not devised to him in fee. He was given simply a life estate with the power to dispose of the same \u201cif he may deem it conducive to his comfort so to do.\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Kitchen, </em>225 Mass. 331. <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>223 Mass. 32. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>213 Mass. 276. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>185 Mass. 156. <em>Stocker </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>178 Mass. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Assuming that the power authorized the husband to dispose of the property by will, this authority was limited to its disposition when conducive to his own comfort. He was not empowered to part with the property for every purpose, nor was he permitted to convey the estate for the comfort of any one except himself. In making the devise the testatrix had in mind the physical welfare and comfort of her husband and he was given full control over the estate and could dispose of it and secure his comfort by the application of the proceeds to his physical wants; but the testatrix did not intend that her husband should have this right to dispose of it merely for his own peace of mind, or for the comfort and support of another person. In <em>Stocker </em>v. <em>Foster, supra, </em>the devise was to the husband for life with power \u201cto sell and dispose of [the estate] . . . whenever in his judgment he may deem it conducive to his comfort.\u201d In the opinion it was said, pages 599, 600, \u201cthe language used by the testatrix seems clearly to refer to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>comfort as can be attained by the application of the proceeds of the property to the reasonable needs of the life of the donee of the power, and not to that peace of mind which arises from a knowledge that the property has been so disposed of as to contribute to the enjoyment and support of others.\u201d See also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>213 Mass. 276. In <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>161 Mass. 490, relied on by the petitioner, the language was not limited in terms to the support and comfort of the devisee. The property was devised to the testator\u2019s wife \u201cto dispose of as she may deem expedient.\u201d It was held that the testator intended to give her the power of disposing of the property under this provision of the will as she might deem expedient, following the language of the power. There is nothing in <em>American Baptist Publication Society </em>v. <em>Lufkin, </em>197 Mass. 221, in conflict with what is here decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\">The evidence excluded was not admissible. The fact that the testator was informed that he had the right to dispose of the property by will, and seemed pleased, at this information, was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">In each case the exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
