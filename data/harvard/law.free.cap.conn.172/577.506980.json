Attached to the application was the plaintiff\u2019s proposed unsigned writ, summons and complaint, and an affidavit purporting to show that there was probable cause that judgment would be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff. In its complaint, the plaintiff alleged misrepresentation and false representation in the declarations of condominium, breaches of express and implied warranties, and negligence. The plaintiff applied for various prejudgment remedies to secure the sum of $1,000,000. Specifically, it sought an order attaching the recreational facility owned by the Ledgebrook Corporation and an order garnishing the rent paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Ledgebrook Corporation for use of the facility. The application contains an allegation that \u201cthere is probable cause that a judgment will be rendered in such matter in favor of the applicant and to secure such judgment, the applicant seeks an order from the Court directing that the following prejudgment remedies be issued to secure the sum of $1,000,000.00 . . . .\u201d Upon presentation of the application to the court, it was ordered that a hearing be held and that notice be given to the defendants. After hearing, the court found that there was probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, and it ordered granted an attachment in the sum of $225,000 of the interest of the defendant Ledgebrook Corporation in certain described real property. The defendant Ledgebrook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Corporation has appealed from that judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assigning as error the action of the court in finding facts without evidence, in refusing to find facts which are claimed to be material and either admitted or undisputed, in concluding that there was probable cause to support an attachment in the amount of $225,000 when the facts set forth in the finding do not support that conclusion, and in not requiring the plaintiff to establish probable cause both as to the validity of its claim and as to the amount of its claim by adducing evidence as to such probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The defendant concedes that it rests this appeal on its contention that there was no evidence to support the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and has briefed only its attack upon one paragraph of the finding of facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This paragraph recites that \u201c[t]he plaintiff obtained an estimate from a roofing firm that the repairs for the water leakage would cost about $9,900 per building, or about $230,000.\u201d The defendant claims that this paragraph was found without evidence. A finding of material fact may be attacked as not supported by the evidence. The validity of such a claim is tested by the evidence printed in the appendices to the briefs.

The disputed paragraph is not supported by the evidence presented in the plaintiff\u2019s appendix and must be stricken.

Such a stricken finding cannot be considered in reviewing the court\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and that an attachment in the amount of $225,000 should be granted. See <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Constitution National Bank, </em>167 Conn. 478, 492, 356 A.2d 117; <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>151 Conn. 21, 25, 27, 193 A.2d 487. As the plaintiff virtually admits, the only evidence before the court to support the plaintiff\u2019s application for prejudgment remedies consisted of the facts contained in the supporting affidavit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and certain concessions made by the defendant\u2019s attorney at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States forbids states from depriving persons of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Similarly, the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, and it is an established principle that these provisions \u201chave the same meaning and impose similar limitations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>169 Conn. 438, 442, 363 A.2d 97; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Brandon, </em>156 Conn. 521, 537, 245 A.2d 579. In several relatively recent cases, the United States Supreme Court prescribed standards of due process in certain creditor proceedings affecting property rights. <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.

See <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>167 Conn. 623, 624, 356 A.2d 893. (This act has subsequently been amended by Public Acts 1975, Nos. 75- 459, 75-530, and Public Acts 1976, Nos. 76-21, 76- 401.) At the time of the hearing in this case in August, 1975, a \u201cprejudgment remedy\u201d included an attachment of property prior to final judgment. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a (d) (Rev. to 1975). One of the documents required in support of and with an application for a prejudgment remedy is an \u201caffidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or some competent affiant setting forth a statement of facts sufficient to show that there is probable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c (A) (b) (Rev. to 1975). Except in exceptional circumstances; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278e and 52-278f (Rev. to 1975); a preliminary hearing is mandated. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d (Rev. to 1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The remedy of attaching and securing a defendant\u2019s property to satisfy a judgment which the plaintiff may recover is unknown to the common law and is founded on and regulated by our statutory law. <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>supra, 628; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Barone, </em>147 Conn. 233, 234, 158 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>855; <em>Chapel-High Corporation </em>v. <em>Cavallaro, </em>141 Conn. 407, 410, 106 A.2d 720; <em>Loewe </em>v. <em>Savings Bank of Danbury, </em>236 F. 444, 448 (2d Cir.); <em>Penoyar </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>150 N.Y. 77, 44 N.E. 788. It follows that a party seeking an attachment must comply with the requirements of the statutes allowing such attachment as may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Thus, in Connecticut the general rule under \u00a7 52-278c is that all prejudgment remedies, including attachment, must be granted by a court upon notice to the defendant and a prior hearing. The language of our statutes requires that the court determine \u201cwhether or not there is <em>probable cause </em>to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d (emphasis added); \u00a752-278d; that is to say, \u201cprobable cause that judgment will be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d \u00a7 52-278c (A) (b); see, generally, Levine, \u201cDue Process of Law in PreJudgment Attachment and the Filing of Mechanics\u2019 Liens,\u201d 50 Conn. B.J., No. 3, pp. 335, 350-58. \u201c[Prejudgment remedy proceedings] are not involved with the adjudication of the merits of the action brought by the plaintiff .... They are only concerned with whether and to what extent the plaintiff is entitled to have property of the defendant held in the custody of the law pending adjudication of the merits of that action.\u201d <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>supra, 629-30. The purpose of a hearing is to satisfy the constitutional due process right that parties whose property rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S. Ct. 1187, 14 L. Ed. 2d 62; see <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>168 Conn. 371, 376-77, 362 A.2d 778. \u201cThis effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>opportunity to be heard is the gravamen of the currently accepted standards of procedural due process in the area of property rights as now prescribed in the United States Supreme Court landmark cases of . . . <em>[Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>supra; <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Household Finance Corporation, </em>supra; and <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corporation, </em>supra].\u201d <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>supra, 377. A hearing permits both sides to be heard. A full scale trial on the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s claim is not contemplated. The plaintiff does not have to establish that he will prevail, only that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim. 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed., 1975 Sup.) \u00a7 55C (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Proof of probable cause as a condition of obtaining a prejudgment remedy is not as demanding as proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence. \u201cThe legal idea of probable cause is a bona fide belief in the existence of facts essential under the law for the action and such as would warrant a man of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment, under the circumstances, in entertaining it.\u201d <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Toomey, </em>52 Conn. 35, 36; see 6 Am. Jur. 2d, Attachment and Garnishment, \u00a7 599. In criminal proceedings, probable cause has been defined as \u201cthe knowledge of facts sufficient to justify a reasonable man in the belief that he has reasonable grounds for prosecuting an action.\u201d <em>Paranto </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>132 Conn. 568, 571, 46 A.2d 6; <em>McGann </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>105 Conn. 177, 186, 134 A. 810; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>153 Conn. 39, 41, 42, 212 A.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Prejudgment attachment, although a useful and efficient remedy, can be harsh in its operation and liable to oppressive use because it is summary in its effects. Consequently, its application has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>confined within the limits set by statute. See annot., 86 A.L.R. 588. Generally, when an attachment affidavit is required by statute, the affidavit must state the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and the amount of the indebtedness. Annot., 86 A.L.R., op. cit.; 6 Am. Jur. 2d, op. cit., \u00a7264; see <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Kirtley, </em>269 U.S. 163, 166, 46 S. Ct. 50, 70 L. Ed. 213. And in actions for unliquidated damages, the affidavit should state facts sufficient to enable the court to determine the probable amount of the damages involved. 7 C.J.S., Attachment, \u00a7125 (b) (2). As a matter of general experience, a determination of a claim\u2019s probable validity normally will entail at least some consideration of the amount of damages which may be found upon a full trial. This implication is consistent with the teachings that a due process opportunity to be heard must be granted not only at a meaningful time but also in a meaningful manner; <em>Armstrong </em>v. Manso, supra; and that \u201c[s]ince the essential reason for the requirement of a prior hearing is to prevent unfair and mistaken deprivations of property ... it is axiomatic that the hearing must provide a <em>real test.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>supra, 97. This is true notwithstanding the fact that at the time of the hearing in this case General Statutes \u00a7 52-302 (Rev. to 1975) providing for the discharge of excessive attachments had not been repealed. See Public Acts 1976, No. 76-401, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 6, repealing \u00a7 52-302 and providing for the modification of a prejudgment remedy. In this case, the only reference to the amount of damages in the plaintiff\u2019s supporting affidavit is a statement that the applicant \u201cwill be required to expend great sums of money.\u201d In practice, if there is an uncontradicted statement in an affidavit that the affiant believes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that it is prohable that a stated sum may be recovered upon a trial, and such belief is founded on reasonable subordinate facts, this will ordinarily be sufficient to support probable cause for an attachment. See annot., 86 A.L.R., op. cit. Although the plaintiff claims in its brief that certain concessions pertaining to the amount of probable damages were made at the hearing by the defendant\u2019s attorney; see <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Pezenik, </em>137 Conn. 442, 448, 78 A.2d 546; the finding as corrected does not support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The conclusion of the court that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and that an attachment in the amount of $225,000 should be granted is not supported by the affidavit or the corrected finding. It cannot stand. <em>Terrace Estates </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>166 Conn. 469, 471, 352 A.2d 303; <em>Cecio Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Feldmann, </em>161 Conn. 265, 271, 287 A.2d 374; Maltbie, Conn.
