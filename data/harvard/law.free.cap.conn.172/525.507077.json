The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $20,000. The defendant has appealed from the judgment rendered on the verdict, assigning as error the refusal of the trial court to grant a mistrial on the basis of allegedly improper arguments by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel relating to damages, the failure of the court to instruct the jury to disregard the allegedly improper arguments, and the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict or to issue a remittitur on the ground that the verdict was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>It appears from the transcript that in his closing argument to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued, in part, as follows: \u201cShe [the plaintiff] is entitled to something here. She is entitled to a substantial amount of damages for what she has been going through, and I think she is entitled to something for the kind of defense\u2014it isn\u2019t necessary that the insurance company put people up\u2014all kinds of witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defense counsel excepted to the argument and moved for a mistrial, claiming that there was a definite request made to the jury by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to make an award based not on injuries suffered by the plaintiff but on the manner in which the defense was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The trial court in its memorandum of decision on the motion to set aside the verdict decided that the defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff made inflammatory, prejudicial, improper and unfair remarks to the jury during his argument lacked merit. We do not agree. The comment that the plaintiff was entitled to something for the manner in which the defense was conducted and the injection of the insurance company\u2019s attorney\u2019s ability to call witnesses because of unlimited funds were grossly improper and highly prejudicial. The court did not specially instruct the jury to disregard the plaintiff\u2019s comments, but charged the jury as follows: \u201cNow, in a ease of this sort, the fair rule of damages is that a plaintiff is entitled to fair, reasonable and just compensation for injuries and damages proximately caused by the wrongful conduct of the defendant. . . . Now the plaintiff is only entitled to recover for such damages as are alleged in her com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plaint. . . . And you don\u2019t award damages for the way the defense tries their case, or the way the plaintiff tries their case. That has nothing to do with it.\u201d While the plaintiff\u2019s comments to the \u00a1jury were clearly improper and prejudicial and the court erred in concluding otherwise, the impact of the improper arguments was nullified by the court\u2019s charge to the jury. It must be presumed that the jury carried out the instructions of the court. <em>State v. Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 314, 294 A.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The defendant contends that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in his argument to the jury, placed undue emphasis on the plaintiff\u2019s poverty, widowhood and retarded child. Ordinarily, \u201c [c] onsiderations appealing to sympathy, such as the poverty of the plaintiff, [are] obviously foreign to the cause and improper subjects of emphasis or comment in argument.\u201d Fro<em>hlich </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>116 Conn. 74, 77, 163 A. 463; <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>74 Conn. 699, 52 A. 490. Although the references to the plaintiff\u2019s economic situation, the size of her family, and the reference to her retarded child may have approached the threshold of unfair argument, we find that the court obviated any prejudicial effect by specifically cautioning the jury to disregard considerations of sympathy arising from causes other than the accident in assessing damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Finally, we find that the defendant\u2019s claims that the verdict was excessive and ought to have been set aside or that a remittitur should have been ordered are without merit. The' primary function of this court in reviewing the refusal of the trial court to set aside the verdict is to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Pinto, </em>147 Conn. 109,110,157 A.2d 596. In denying the motion, the court stated in its memorandum of decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the verdict could he classified as liberal but not excessive and was not \u201cone that \u2018so shocks the sense of justice as to compel a conclusion that the jury were swayed by partiality, prejudice, corruption or mistake.\u2019 \u201d Denial by the trial court of a motion to set aside a verdict claimed to be excessive is entitled to weighty consideration. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Garneau, </em>163 Conn. 610, 611, 316 A.2d 511; <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>160 Conn. 10, 273 A.2d 714. The fact that the court and the jury, who were both present to hear and evaluate the testimony, concurred in their determination is a persuasive argument for sustaining the action of the court on the motion. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Halay, </em>156 Conn. 633, 634, 242 A.2d 730. The record before ns fails to indicate that the court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> Defense counsel first mentioned that the defendant had insurance and both counsel thereafter, during the trial and in arguments to the jury, referred to insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
