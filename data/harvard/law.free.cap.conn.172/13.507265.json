We have done so to allow all parties to present their arguments. After considering the arguments, we affirm our decision of October 15, 1976, on the motion to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The issue before us was a narrow one: Did the trial court abuse its discretion in terminating the stay? On a motion by the defendants for reargument of their motion for a review, we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, and we pointed out that neither our decision nor that of the trial court contained any direction concerning the action the public utilities control authority (PUCA) is to take with regard to the 1974 rate application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We stated: \u201cThe effect of terminating the stay of execution was to give immediate effect to the trial court\u2019s decision sustaining the appeal and holding the 1974 rate schedule invalid, thus pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>venting the named defendants from charging their customers under that invalidated schedule, pending a review of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d We did not then,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and do not now, indicate what rates should he charged. These matters are not properly before this court but, in the present posture of this case, are matters for the PUCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The merits of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas that the 1974 rates are illegal are not yet before this court. Until we have decided the appeal from that judgment, any inference that our rulings require refunds to users is unfounded and inappropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\"> By the following decision, dated November 12, 1976, we denied the motion by the named defendants for reargument of their previous motion for a review of the order of the trial court dated May 25, 1976, terminating a stay of execution in the appeal from the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County, which motion for a review was granted and the relief sought therein denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u201cPee Cdeiam. The motion for reargument represents that the public utilities control authority (PUCA) is interpreting the trial court\u2019s decision to mean that the PUCA is under a court mandate to act promptly on the trial court\u2019s remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u201cNeither the trial court\u2019s remand nor its order terminating the stay of execution contains any direction concerning the action the PUCA is to take with regard to the 1974 application. The phrase 'for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion\u2019 merely summarizes the consequences of the trial court\u2019s decision sustaining the appeal, i.e., that, the appeal having been sustained, it is the duty of the administrative agency to proceed according to law. See <em>Bogue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>165 Conn. 749, 756, 345 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>9. That rescript contains no direction concerning when or how the PUCA is to hold its hearings. Indeed, a remand to the administrative agency with such a directive would be \u2018to impose the judicial will upon an administrative board\u2019 and would be invalid. See <em>Watson v. Howard, </em>138 Conn. 464, 469, 86 A.2d 67; see also <em>Norwalk Street Ry. Co.\u2019s Appeal, </em>69 Conn. 576, 37 A. 1080 (administrative functions cannot constitutionally be vested in the courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u201cSince the trial court\u2019s rescript did not purport to order the PUCA to hold hearings forthwith on the 1974 application, the termination of the stay under Practice Book \u00a7 661 did not have the effect of ordering such hearings. The effect of terminating the stay of execution was to give immediate effect to tho trial court\u2019s decision sustaining the appeal and holding the 1974 rate schedule invalid, thus preventing tho named defendants from charging their customers under that invalidated schedule, pending a review of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u201cThe motion for reargument is denied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> In the decision on the motion for reargument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
