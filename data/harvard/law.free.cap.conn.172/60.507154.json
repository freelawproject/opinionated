Tucciarone, from converting certain property into a public street. After a trial, the court rendered judgment in favor of the Association against the Corporation but in favor of the defendant Tucciarone. Prom that judgment the Corporation has appealed, assigning error in the court\u2019s refusal to find material facts; in its finding facts without evidence; in its reaching conclusions not supported by the finding; and in its overruling of the Corporation\u2019s claims of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">On December 18, 1973, the defendant Tucciarone filed an application with the Milford planning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>zoning board for approval of a subdivision concerning lot No. 6 and the easterly ten feet of lot No. 7 as shown on a map entitled \u201cYale Land Co. Map of Morningside Property Pond Point Milford, Conn., 1912,\u201d and certain other property adjacent thereto. Part of the proposed subdivision, containing nine building lots, lay outside the limits of \u201cMorning-side.\u201d The property comprising the nine lots is landlocked except for the proposed access street over lot No. 6 and the easterly ten feet of lot No. 7 which would connect it with an existing street in \u201cMorningside,\u201d Hilldale Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The plaintiff, a specially chartered association empowered to perform certain functions within the limits of \u201cMorningside,\u201d was incorporated in 1921. Subsequent to its incorporation, the Association relinquished to the city of Milford its responsibilities for all governmental functions within \u201cMorningside,\u201d including the maintenance of the streets contained therein. In fact, the Association\u2019s functions are presently limited only to the maintenance and control of certain social and recreational facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">At the time of the application, the Corporation had an option to purchase the described property. After the planning and zoning board approved the subdivision application, the Corporation purchased the property and began construction on it. The construction work was halted when the Corporation was served -with a temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The trial court concluded that the subdivision constituted a resubdivision as defined by \u00a7 8-18 of the General Statutes, as it involved a change affecting a street layout shown on an approved map, and that the failure of the board to meet the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 invalidated its approval. The court further found that the 1972 amendment to the special charter of the Association was validlv adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Home Rule Act, \u00a7 7-187\u20147-201 of the General Statutes. The Corporation contends that the trial court erred in arriving at those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Corporation has challenged the court\u2019s finding and its conclusions. Numerous paragraphs of the finding are attacked as having been found without evidence. Those findings, which are crucial to the Association\u2019s case, relate to the trial court\u2019s finding (a) that the Association\u2019s original charter of January, 1921, was amended effectively on July 15, 1972, and (b) that the approval of the subdivision without a public hearing, newspaper notices, or any notice to the Association, was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">A finding of a material fact may be attacked as not supported by the evidence. The validity of such a claim is tested by the evidence printed in the appendices to the briefs. Practice Book \u00a7 628M; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vars, </em>154 Conn. 255, 258, 224 A.2d 744; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a77 330, 331. This court will not look beyond the appendices to the briefs in order to find supporting evidence. Practice Book \u00a7 628Q; <em>Grodzicki </em>v. <em>Grodzicki, </em>154 Conn. 456, 459, 226 A.2d 656. \u201cIt is the duty of the parties to print all material evidence in the appendices to their briefs.\u201d <em>Pass </em>v. <em>Pass, </em>152 Conn. 508, 511, 208 A.2d 753; <em>Solari </em>v. <em>Seperak, </em>154 Conn. 179, 183, 224 A.2d 529; <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>148 Conn. 631, 632, 173 A.2d 543; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pundy, </em>147 Conn. 7, 9, 156 A.2d 193. \u201c[T'Jhe testimony printed in the appendices shall be deemed to embrace all testimony produced at the trial material to the issues on the appeal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>. . . the court may, if sufficient cause appears, consult the transcript of evidence on file to supplement or explain that printed. The court will not, however, ordinarily do this .... It is the duty of counsel to see that all necessary evidence is before the court.\u201d Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 331. Findings of material fact not supported by the evidence or not based upon inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence must be stricken; Practice Book \u00a7 627; <em>Grodzicki </em>v. <em>Grodzicki, </em>supra, 460; and as the trial court\u2019s conclusions are tested by the finding; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Chatfield, </em>166 Conn. 76, 81, 347 A.2d 58; conclusions based on a stricken finding cannot stand. <em>Grodzicki </em>v. <em>Grodzicki, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In the present ease, the Association filed no appendix setting forth evidence to support the attacked findings, and the Corporation\u2019s appendix recites no such evidence. As no supporting evidence was submitted, a reference by us to the transcript would be of no avail since there is no printed evidence to supplement or explain. We have no alternative but to conclude that the court\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence and must therefore be stricken. <em>Grodzicki </em>v. <em>Grodzicki, </em>supra, 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case remanded with direction to render judgment for the named defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
