He was dismissed from his employment in the department and appealed to the Court of Common Pleas claiming eighte\u00e9n errors in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>board\u2019s conduct of the hearing. The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the appeal, filing a lengthy memorandum of decision discussing each of the plaintiff\u2019s contentions. Prom that judgment the plaintiff brought the present appeal, assigning forty errors on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We have carefully examined the record of the board\u2019s hearing and the proceedings in the trial court. The conduct of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel before the board can best be described as not professional. While in our decisions on most appeals we attempt to discuss in some detail the merits of the appellant\u2019s claims and assignments of error, in this case their sheer number and total lack of merit coupled with the contents of the trial court\u2019s carefully analyzed and reasoned opinion prompt a deviation from that practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
