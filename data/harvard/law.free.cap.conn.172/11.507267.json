The order increased the amount of weekly alimony which the defendant was required to pay to the plaintiff. The Superior Court has jurisdiction to modify alimony orders when there has been a change in the circumstances of the parties. The language of the statutory authorization for such modification has been changed in recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>years but a condition precedent to any modification bas been a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d or, as now, \u201ca substantial change in the circumstances of either party.\u201d See General Statutes (Rev. 1958) \u00a746-21; General Statutes (Rev. 1975) \u00a746-54; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>165 Conn. 735, 737, 345 A.2d 48; <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>161 Conn. 452, 459, 289 A.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The court made no finding in the present case, and it does not appear that it was requested to do so. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 609, 613 (now Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 612B, 613). In the absence of a finding, it is impossible for this court to determine the facts upon which the Superior Court predicated its order or whether it committed any error. The burden rests upon an appellant to show that there was error in the judgment from which the appeal is taken. \u201cIn the absence of a finding and on the record before us, it cannot be said that as a matter of law the award made in this case constituted an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Tworek </em>v. <em>Tworek, </em>170 Conn. 159, 365 A.2d 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
