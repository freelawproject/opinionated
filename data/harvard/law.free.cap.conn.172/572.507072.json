On that day, the appellants filed a motion to intervene- as parties defendant, alleging that they were owners and occupants of nearby premises whose property would be specially and adversely affected by the development of the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed subdivision and whose right of appeal prescribed by \u00a7 8-28 of the General Statutes would be denied by the issuance of the certificate of approval sought by the plaintiffs in their mandamus action. The movants were heard through their counsel by oral argument. No claim was made in their motion or in oral argument that the town attorney was not adequately representing the town or the members of the commission nor was any claim made of collusion or fraud. After a hearing the motion was denied. The show cause hearing was continued to January 28, 1976, when the parties to the action filed a stipulation that the plaintiffs\u2019 subdivision plan \u201cshall be considered as approved,\u201d and judgment was rendered approving the stipulation. The movants have appealed \u201cfrom the decision of the Court denying the motion to be made party defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">When the movants filed their appeal, on the day that final judgment was rendered, they also filed a motion for stay of execution of the mandamus order. The trial court denied the motion, holding that the movants were not parties to the action and could not avail themselves of the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 661 relating to a stay of execution, and further holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to immediate relief in accordance with the final judgment. Subsequently, this court denied the movants\u2019 motion for review of the trial court\u2019s decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>their motion for a stay. This court also denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal, hut without prejudice to full argument of the issue of jurisdiction at the time of hearing the appeal on its merits. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>170 Conn. 731, 355 A.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The plaintiffs have raised two threshold issues which must he resolved before reaching the basic assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying the movants\u2019 motion to he made parties defendant. The plaintiffs not only contend that the appeal should he dismissed as moot because no practical benefit to the movants will result from a determination of the questions sought to be raised on appeal hut have also pursued the jurisdictional issue of whether an order denying a motion to intervene is one from which an appeal can he taken.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">This appeal seeks to have us determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the movants\u2019 motion to intervene in the mandamus action. A mandamus proceeding is properly directed against the officer, body, corporation, or person whose duty it is to perform the act sought to he enforced, and, as a general rule, that party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the only necessary defendant. 52 Am. Jur. 2d, Mandamus, \u00a7397; 55 C.J.S., Mandamus, \u00a7252 (a). In the present case, the trial court concluded that the movants were afforded a right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to \u00a7 8-28 of the General Statutes, from the claimed approval of the subdivision plan;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that they were not indispensable or necessary parties to the mandamus action; that the due administration of justice did not require that they be made parties-defendant; and that their intervention would only serve to delay the action. The court not only denied intervention but also denied a motion by the movants, who were not parties, for a stay of execution of the mandamus order. The mandamus action is no longer pending, and the only relief sought by the plaintiffs in this action has been granted and executed. What relief the movants might have in a proper independent action is not for this court to determine in these proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow.\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Vroom, </em>130 Conn. 512, 515, 36 A.2d 22; <em>Phaneuf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>166 Conn. 449, 452, 352 A.2d 291; <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Panuzio, </em>166 Conn. 1, 3, 347 A.2d 78; Maltbie, Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 21, 339. Because no practical relief could follow the determination of the other issues raised, we do not decide them.
