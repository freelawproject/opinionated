The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>defendant has made four assignments of error which together essentially raise bnt one issue: Did the committee of state referees err in rendering judgment awarding the plaintiffs interest for the period December <em>7, </em>1971, to June 15, 1972, when the committee had previously determined that the \u201ctrue taking date\u201d used in calculating the compensation awarded to the plaintiffs was June 15, 1972?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Before discussing the merits of the appeal, it is important to note the manner in which it has been presented to us. The defendant\u2019s assignments of error are all predicated on claims of error apparent on the face of the record. \u201cIf error appears on the face of the record no finding is necessary\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 612B; and it appears that neither party requested<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a finding for appeal and the committee made none. Notwithstanding the absence of a finding, the plaintiffs printed in the appendix to their brief several excerpts from a certified transcript of proceedings before the committee. Presumably this was done pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 628H (d) of the Practice Book. In addition, the plaintiffs included in the appendix to their brief copies of letters exchanged by counsel. The defendant moved pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 692 of the Practice Book that the entire appendix to the plaintiffs\u2019 brief be stricken. This motion was heard immediately before the argument on the appeal and was denied. Notwithstanding this ruling, it now appearing that the merits of this appeal must be determined solely on the record, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>do not consider the contents of the appendix to the plaintiffs\u2019 brief. Not only does it appear that none of the letters printed in the appendix was admitted as an exhibit for the consideration of the committee but \u201c[t]he transcript of testimony cannot take the place of a finding because we are without power to find facts.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 228, 278 A.2d 771; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In the absence of a finding for appeal what is properly before us as a record are the pleadings, the motions made at the trial and the judgments. <em>City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>163 Conn. 149, 152, 302 A.2d 252; <em>Gitlitz </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>146 Conn. 280, 310, 150 A.2d 213. The only question before us, then, is whether, as the defendant claims, error appears on the face of the record. Maltbie, loc. cit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The record discloses the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in five counts alleging that on December 7, 1971, the defendant filed with the clerk of the Superior Court in Fairfield County an assessment of $716,000 damages for the taking of property for highway purposes and that the plaintiffs were aggrieved by that assessment as it was inadequate. The fifth count contained an allegation that \u201cthe purported condemnation by the Defendant of the Plaintiffs\u2019 property previously referred to was ineffective for the reason that said purported taking failed to take into consideration that said property was in condominium ownership form.\u201d By way of relief, the plaintiffs requested the appointment of a referee to reassess the damages, $5,000,000 damages, and \u201c[a]n order declaring that the original taking of December 7, 1971 was improper and invalid and . . . [requiring] the Defendant to withdraw said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>taking and compensate the Plaintiffs for damages.\u201d Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed in the Superior Court a motion entitled \u201cMotion for Determination of True Taking Date\u201d in which they recited the filing on December 7, 1971, of the original notice of condemnation and certificate of taking and the filing on June 9,1972, of an amended notice. Their motion further recited: \u201cIt is the claim of the plaintiffs that the taking was not effective, at least until the date of the Amendment, and accordingly . . . [the plaintiffs move] the Court to either determine that the actual date of taking was other than December 7, 1971, or in the alternative to refer said question to a panel of three referees to be determined at the time of the trial of said appeal.\u201d The court granted the motion and subsequently amended its order to direct that \u201c[t]he \u2018taking\u2019 is to be determined by the referee or three referees before trial.\u201d The plaintiffs amended their appeal to one seeking a reassessment of the damages for the taking and for damages caused by the delay in effectuating the taking. As amended, the appeal recited the December 7, 1971, filing \u201cpurportedly pursuant to the . . . [s]tatutes\u201d and the filing on June 15, 1972, of an amended notice of condemnation. The court, on September 11, 1973, ordered the appointment of three referees pursuant to \u00a7 52-434a (b) of the General Statutes to reassess the damages for the taking and further ordered \u201cthat within ninety (90) days after the finding of a true taking date by said three (3) State Referees\u201d the parties should exchange copies of all appraisal reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">On July 30, 1974, the committee of three referees filed the following \u201cMemorandum on Determination of Taking Date\u201d: \u201cThe taking date in the above-entitled matter is determined to be June 15, 1972, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the date of the filing of the Amended Certificate of Condemnation with the Clerk of the Superior Court for Fairfield County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On September 25, 1975, the committee rendered its judgment finding that there was $1,046,500 due to the plaintiffs as damages for the taking, that $716,000 had been deposited by the defendant and that, accordingly, the defendant should pay to the plaintiffs \u201cthe sum of $330,500, interest to the date of payment, and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On October 28, 1975, the plaintiffs filed with the committee a motion entitled \u201cMotion for Determination re Interest Computation\u201d in which they asked the committee to \u201cdetermine that said interest runs from December 7,1971 to the date of payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">On January 13, 1976, the committee rendered judgment reciting its prior determination that the \u201ctrue taking date\u201d was June 15, 1972, and its judgment that the defendant pay to the plaintiffs $330,500 with \u201cinterest to the date of payment,\u201d and further reciting that the parties had stipulated that that judgment be \u201creopened for the limited purpose of determining: a. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to interest from December 7, 1971 (the date of the filing of the certificate of taking and assessment of damages) to June 15, 1972 (the date determined to be the true taking date); and b. The amount of such interest.\u201d The judgment then recites several specific findings. The first is that \u201c[o]n December 7, 1971, the Commissioner of Transportation took and acquired the subject property, and entered upon, took possession, and exercised dominion and all rights of ownership over the property.\u201d The second is that \u201c[t] hereafter it was determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that the true taking date for the purpose of the ascertainment of damages was June 15, 1972, and damages were assessed to the plaintiffs as of that date in the amount of $1,046,500.00.\u201d The third is that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs are entitled to interest from December 7, 1971 to June 15, 1972, upon the difference between the sum of $716,000.00, deposited by the Commissioner, and the sum found by the State Referees to he the damages computed as of December 7, 1971.\u201d This interest was computed to be $8,688.21. It is the order for the payment of this $8,688.21 which the defendant contests and has assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u201cThe damages sustained in a taking by eminent domain are to be measured as of the date of the taking. <em>Colaluca </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>150 Conn. 521, 531, 191 A.2d 340; <em>DelVeccio </em>v. <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>147 Conn. 362, 365, 161 A.2d 190.\u201d <em>Research Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>152 Conn. 137, 139, 204 A.2d 833. The record does not disclose why the plaintiffs contended that the taking date was June 15,1972, when the amended certificate of condemnation was filed, rather than December 7, 1971, when the original certificate was filed. A suggestion is contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief on their original appeal in which they sought an order \u201cthat the original taking of December 7, 1971 was improper and invalid.\u201d In any event, it was the plaintiffs who sought a judicial determination as to what was the actual date of taking, stating in their motion: \u201cIt is the claim of the plaintiffs that the taking was not effective, at least until the date of the Amendment.\u201d It was as a result of their motion that the committee expressly concluded that \u201c[t]he taking date in the above-entitled matter is deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>mined to be June 15, 1972, the date of the filing of the Amended Certificate of Condemnation with the Clerk of the Superior Court for Fairfield County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">There is merit to the following contention briefed by the defendant: \u201cWhat transpired prior to June 15, 1972 is not at issue in the present appeal taken pursuant to Sec. 13a-76 of the General Statutes, as amended. An independent proceeding or claim against the State could have been brought to determine what rights were created or extinguished by the action of the Commissioner prior to June 15, 1972. Sec.,13a-76 of the General Statutes sets forth the limited scope of the instant appeal, namely, the reassessment of damages resulting from the taking, which the Court determined took place on June 15, 1972. *. . . a condemnation proceeding is limited under \u00a7 13a-76 of the General Statutes to a reassessment of damages <em>caused by the taking. . . .\u2019 Plunske </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>171 Conn. 280, 370 A.2d 920 (emphasis added).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On the record before us, it must be concluded that, as claimed by the defendant, the committee erred in awarding the plaintiffs interest for the period from December 7, 1971, to June 15, 1972, when the date of taking was expressly determined by the committee to be June 15, 1972, as stated in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">There is error with respect to the award of interest for the period December 7,1971, to and through June 15, 1972, and the ease is remanded with direction to recompute the interest and award it on the damages from the date of the taking on June 15, 1972, to the date of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> \u201cEven where there is no occasion to find the faets, the claims made at the hearing or the conclusions of the court may be material upon the appeal, and in such a situation a party can request the court to find and it may properly find such claims and conclusions.\u201d Maltbie, Conn.
