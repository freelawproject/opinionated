The defendant interposed a counterclaim for the reasonable value of a curtain drain thereafter installed on the premises. The jury returned a general verdict of $6000 in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed from the judgment rendered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">In this court the defendant raises for the first time the question of the jurisdiction of the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of Common Pleas to entertain this action on the ground that \u00a7\u00a7 52-6 and 52-28 of the General Statutes, which give that court concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court of civil actions wherein the matter in demand exceeds $7500 hut does not exceed $15,000, result in a material detraction from the essential characteristics of the Superior Court in derogation of article fifth, \u00a7 1, of our constitution. See <em>Walkinshaw </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 Conn. 122, 140, 32 A.2d 547. The defendant, on the record before us, has failed to sustain its heavy burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt the constitutional invalidity of the statutory jurisdiction exercised by the trial court. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Product Development Corporation, </em>167 Conn. 111, 114, 355 A.2d 72; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 152-53, 251 A.2d 49; <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 470, 217 A.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The defendant further claims error in admitting into evidence, as an exhibit, a pamphlet purportedly containing certain sections of the Connecticut state department of health public health code regulations (hereinafter the code) to which the defendant objected and took exception on the grounds, inter alia, that the pamphlet was not a certified copy and that the pamphlet was immaterial. Since the circumstances attending the court\u2019s ruling admitting this pamphlet are important we set them out initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The plaintiffs introduced this pamphlet into evidence as a foundation for the testimony of George Frigon, sanitarian for the town of Ridgefield at the time of trial in 1974, who was prepared to testify that his examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 septic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>system revealed three violations of the code. During the plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary questioning and cross-examination Frigon stated that in 1968, the pertinent code year, he was a college student, that prior to 1971 he had been a state employee for one year, and that he had become Ridgefield\u2019s sanitarian in 1971. The pamphlet the plaintiffs introduced as an exhibit had the notation \u201cIn effect 1969\u201d typed on the face sheet. Testimony in the case indicated that the plaintiffs\u2019 septic system had been constructed prior to December 17, 1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection that the pamphlet was not certified<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the remark: \u201cWell, that goes to the weight.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-166 provides: \u201cAny order or regulation made by any state official in the performance of his duties may be proved in any court by a copy of such order or regulation certified by the person having the legal custody of the same.\u201d For the pamphlet to be admissible without compliance with the statutory certification procedure, the plaintiffs were required to authenticate it properly. \u201cThe admission of an unauthenticated unofficial purported copy of . . . [a state regulation] is patent error.\u201d <em>Masti-Kure Products Co. </em>v. <em>Appel, </em>161 Conn. 108, 116, 285 A.2d 346. Additionally, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a \u201cproper attempt to obtain the best evidence of the . . . [regulation], which in this case would have been either the original . . . [regulation] or a duly-certified copy of it, there was no right to introduce secondary evidence of any sort in proof of it.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 290, 296, 141 A.2d 634; see McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 241. Under the circumstances of this case we cannot say that Frigon\u2019s testimony satisfied the criteria of the <em>Masti-Kure </em>or the <em>Brown </em>cases, or the statutes, for admission of this pamphlet. The court therefore erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The notation \u201cIn effect 1969\u201d appearing on the exhibit was apparently typed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 19-13, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe public health council shall establish a public health code and, from time to time, amend the same. . . . Each regulation adopted by said council shall state the date on which it shall take effect, and a copy thereof, signed by the commissioner of health, shall be filed in the office of the secretary of the state and a copy sent by said commissioner to each director of health, and such regulation shall be published in such manner as said council may determine.\u201d Since the relevance of the pamphlet rested on its containing the 1968 code provisions, with which the plaintiffs claimed the defendant was required to comply in constructing the plaintiffs\u2019 septic system, its admission was erroneous under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The proper admissibility of this pamphlet was of crucial significance to a recovery in this action since one of the plaintiffs\u2019 theories upon which they relied was that the defendant had failed to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the requirements of the code in constructing the septic system. After the court admitted the pamphlet into evidence, Frigon testified from it that his examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 septic system revealed three violations of the code, and thereafter, in the course of its instructions to the jury, the court charged that such violations would be negligence per se.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances the court\u2019s error in admitting the pamphlet into evidence was harmful. <em>Lubenow </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>137 Conn. 611, 615-16, 79 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">At the conclusion of the evidence and prior to the summations by counsel, the defendant filed a motion for submission of interrogatories and a motion for separate verdicts. The former motion was denied summarily; the latter motion was also denied, hut after some consideration. Exceptions were taken by the defendant with respect to both rulings. It was the duty of the court to grant the defendant\u2019s request for separate verdicts and for proper interrogatories where the complaint contained two counts since the defendant had the right to save itself from the implication of a general verdict by seeking from the jury separate verdicts and answers to proper interrogatories; its failure to do so was erroneous. <em>Sheeler </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>138 Conn. 111, 114, 82 A.2d 359; <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>125 Conn. 150, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>157,158, 3 A.2d 855; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 55. Since the court erred in admitting the plaintiffs\u2019 pamphlet into evidence as an exhibit, its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for separate verdicts prejudiced the defendant in that that denial would, under our normal practice, have prevented the defendant from presenting its claim of error in the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. <em>Reid </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>133 Conn. 446, 447, 52 A.2d 140; <em>Belchak </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>119 Conn. 630, 632, 179 A. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">It is unnecessary to discuss the defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-5\"> Under questioning by the court Frigon stated: \u201cThat particular eopy is one of a few very rare copies of that code. And that was obtained from the state in relationship to another case. And it was accompanied by a letter from Doctor Foote, and that was \u201969 it was in effect. The state typed that 'In effect 1969.\u2019 Nobody else did.\u201d He went on to state that: \u201cI know that that is the code that was in effect at that time, yes, sir,\u201d without any other supporting qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> The defendant objected as follows: \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s no certification of . . . [the pamphlet] which is required by the statutes as I read them, so I have no way of verifying that what Mr. Frigon says is, in fact, true.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-5\"> The court charged the jury in part: \u201cNow, in addition to the common law negligence which has been alleged, there\u2019s also been reference made to certain statutes of the State of Connecticut, and also to regulations of the State Board of Health. Now, insofar as this is concerned, under our law we refer to this as statutory negligence. And statutory negligence consists of a violation of a statute which sets up or prescribes a rule of conduct to be followed by a person in a given situation. The violation of such an applicable statute by one in a situation governed by it, of course, is negligence per se. That is, it must be found to be negligence as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
