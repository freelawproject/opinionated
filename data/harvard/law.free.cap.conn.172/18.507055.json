This appeal is from the denial of a petition for a new trial. The law in this state relative to new trials has been well established and recently summarized in <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 349, 355 A.2d 324. In <em>Taborsky </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 619, 623, 116 A.2d 433, we stated: \u201c [T]he primary test is whether an injustice was done and whether it is probable that on a new trial a different result would be reached. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>141 Conn. 202, 208, 104 A.2d 761; <em>Dortch </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 18, 21, 110 A.2d 471. The burden of proving the probability of a different result is upon the plaintiff, and in determining that issue the trial court exercises a discretion which cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>be reviewed unless its discretionary power has been abused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldberger, </em>118 Conn. 444, 457, 173 A. 216.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">On the record in this case, there is no evidence of an abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
