We have thus provided in Rule 9. The application should have been made at the same term of the Court in order to be disposed of before adjournment <em>sine die.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The application for a rehearing, in this instance, comes too late, and is consequently denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
