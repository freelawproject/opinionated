Another person was in the passenger\u2019s seat. It was 4:15 a.m., the radio was playing, and the key was in the ignition. The Blazer\u2019s engine was not running. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Sanchez was asked to produce his driver\u2019s license, he pulled out several hundred dollar bills and held them out toward the officer. The officer asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d Sanchez replied, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to do the right thing.\u201d After Sanchez passed his driver\u2019s license several times, the officer pointed it out to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\">Appellant raises two issues on appeal. The first is whether Sanchez was in actual physical control of the vehicle. We find that he was. <em>Baltrus v State, </em>15 F.L.W. 2979 (4th DCA December 12, 1990). Compare with <em>Fieselman v State, </em>537 So.2d 603 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988) where driver was laying down in the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The second issue is whether the trial court improperly allowed testimony about Sanchez offering money to the officer. The court properly allowed this testimony as evidence of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">McNEAL, R., BOOTH, J., SINGELTARY, G., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
