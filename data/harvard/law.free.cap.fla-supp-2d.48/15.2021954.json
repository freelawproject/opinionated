The officer replied, \u201cthey weren\u2019t confessing what they had done, so I did not write it down.\u201d The defense attorney then made a Motion for Mistrial claiming the officer had improperly commented on defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. Because the comment on defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>privilege was invited by the defendant, he cannot seek reversal based on that comment. <em>Clark v State, </em>363 So.2d 331, 335 (Fla. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">AFFIRMED.
