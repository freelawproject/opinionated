The only issue was whether appellant was driving. The order was violated by a state\u2019s witness. Both the witness and the prosecutor should have known that the testimony would have been objectionable even without a motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">Nevertheless, based on the record before us, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial. Therefore, the decision is AFFIRMED. McNEAL, R., BOOTH, J., SINGELTARY, G., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
