BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1321-22\">Jozsef Tibor Wiga was convicted in district court of two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (felon transporting firearm in interstate commerce), and two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00c1pp. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (ex-felon in possession of firearm). The district court vacated Wiga\u2019s convictions on three of the four counts, and sentenced Wiga to serve two years in prison on a single count of possession under \u00a7 1202(a)(1). In No. 80-1635, the government appeals the vacating of the three additional counts. In No. 80-1724, Wiga appeals his conviction, claiming the denial of his motion to suppress the two firearms which formed the basis of his conviction was erroneous. We affirm the conviction and the denial of the motion to suppress in No. 80-1724. We reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Count II for a separate violation of 18 U.S.C. Appendix \u00a7 1202(a)(1) in No. 80-1635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">On December 21, 1978, Special Agents Charles Barry and Kenneth T\u2019Kindt of the FBI in Nevada received word from the FBI office in Spokane, Washington, that Wiga, a federal parole violator, would be traveling to Las Vegas in the company of one Alice Moody, and that Moody was expected to pick up some money from a particular branch of the Bank of Nevada.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agents went to the branch and arranged for one of the tellers to give a hand signal when Moody arrived. At approximately two o\u2019clock that afternoon, Moody arrived at the bank and transacted her business. The agents observed her walk to a shopping center parking lot, where a motor home bearing Colorado license plates eventually pulled up. The plates indicated issuance of a vehicle license to a handicapped owner. The officers knew Wiga was not handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">After following the motor home for roughly 15 minutes, Barry pulled alongside in an attempt to identify the driver. Barry determined that the driver closely resembled Wiga. At about the time that Barry pulled alongside, the driver pulled down the left-hand sun screen in what Barry surmised was an attempt to hide his face. Barry then pulled the motor home over to the side of the road. Barry and T\u2019Kindt, after identifying themselves, ordered the driver to step out. They concluded upon closer inspection that the driver indeed was Wiga.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">After arresting and handcuffing Wiga, Barry asked if anyone else was in the motor home. Wiga replied that no one else was inside, a statement the agents knew was untrue because they had seen Moody enter earlier. T\u2019Kindt called for Moody to come out, which she did via the rear door. Moody had not been visible to the agents since she had entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">After Moody complied, T\u2019Kindt entered the rear door of the motor home to see if any confederates of Wiga might still be inside. T\u2019Kindt briefly walked toward the front of the 20-foot vehicle, checking both the bathroom and the closet for possible occupants. As he neared the front, he noticed lying on the floor to the rear of the driver\u2019s seat a .357 magnum revolver, and also saw a shotgun in an overhead bunk section above the driver\u2019s compartment. He took custody of both weapons, each of which was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">Wiga moved to suppress the weapons on fourth amendment grounds in a pretrial motion. The district court denied the motion and upheld the search of the motor home as a valid search of a vehicle contemporaneous with the arrest of the operator, the weapons being in plain view. Wiga renewed the motion at trial, where it was again denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AfCr\">A. <em>No. 80-1724</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-12\">Wiga does not dispute the validity of the initial stop of the motor home, nor does he argue that his arrest was improper. He does attack Agent T\u2019Kindt\u2019s search of the motor home after Moody had stepped outside as being unreasonable. The government does not contend that Agent T\u2019Kindt had probable cause to search for weapons or contraband, but instead justifies his inspection of the interior of the motor home as a search incident to arrest, and also invokes the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d and \u201cplain view\u201d doctrines. In addition, the government has cited our recent decision in <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>627 F.2d 906 (9th Cir. 1980), which we take as an argument that the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d doctrine applies in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>this case. Upon resubmission,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the government now also asserts that <em>New York v. Belton, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981) controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">1. <em>The Automobile Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">We recently held that the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d is inapplicable to a motor home. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>630 F.2d 1322 (9th Cir. 1980). In <em>Williams, </em>we noted certain differences between a motor home and more conventional street vehicles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-9\">\u201cWhatever expectations of privacy those travelling in an ordinary car have, those travelling in a motor home have expectations that are significantly greater. People typically do not remain in an auto unless it is going somewhere. The same is not true of a motor home, in which people can actually live. In the ordinary motor home, the glass is tinted or shades can be drawn so that passers-by cannot peer in. Moreover, many, like the one in this case, have beds and fully equipped baths, making them in some senses more akin to a house than a car. In light of both these factors, we cannot uphold this search merely because it was of a search of a motor home. . . . \u201d (Citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">630 F.2d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">The motor home which Wiga was driving appears to be substantially similar to the vehicle considered in <em>Williams. </em>The agents testified that the rear of the Wiga motor home was completely shielded from their view so that Moody was not visible until she stepped outside under their orders. Wiga pulled down a sun screen which effectively blocked his face from Agent Barry\u2019s view prior to the vehicle being pulled over. Agent T\u2019Kindt testified that the vehicle contained both a closed bathroom and a closet. Under the authority of <em>Williams, </em>therefore, we cannot sanction the search at issue here merely on the basis of the \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-19\">2. <em>Protective Sweep Incident to Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-20\">While a motor home may afford its occupants a higher expectation of privacy than does an ordinary passenger automobile, it also raises the possibility of certain exigencies which are not present in the case of the ordinary automobile stop. A motor home may shield from the view of officers unknown occupants who could either present a threat to the officers\u2019 safety or destroy or secrete contraband while the driver is being interrogated. In that sense, a motor home is very much akin to a private dwelling. Therefore, search and seizure doctrines normally applicable to a stationary dwelling or business may in some instances also be applicable to a motor home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-21\">The government invokes one such doctrine here. In <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>627 F.2d 906 (9th Cir. 1980), we had occasion to comment extensively upon what is known in this circuit as the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d doctrine. In <em>Gardner, </em>we stated the doctrine thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-22\">\u201cWhen officers have arrested a person inside his residence, the exigent circumstances exception permits a protective search of part or all of the residence when the officers reasonably believe that there might be other persons on the premises who could pose some danger to them.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-23\">627 F.2d at 909, 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-24\">In <em>Gardner, </em>officers posing as drug purchasers had observed certain items of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>traband and dangerous weapons in plain view within the residence of Gardner. Even though the residence had remained under surveillance from the outside, it was constructed in such a manner that a person could enter or exit undetected, and the agents were aware that at least one person had departed during their surveillance without being seen. When Gardner returned from a trip to purchase methamphetamine, he was arrested on the sidewalk outside of the residence, while a codefend-ant was arrested inside the residence. The arresting officers immediately engaged in a \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the residence to determine whether any other occupants remained. We there held that the agents could reasonably assume that other persons might have entered the premises undetected, and that weapons which had earlier been observed could be used. Applying the standards of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), we held that the officers in <em>Gardner </em>had reasonable cause to suspect that other potentially dangerous persons might be on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">The \u201creasonable cause\u201d element of <em>Gardner </em>is not susceptible of clear definition. Under the analogous <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-5\">\u201c. . . [T]he issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger . . . And in determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience. . . . \u201d (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909. Pre- <em>Gardner </em>decisions in our circuit which have upheld warrantless premises searches under the rationale of assuring officer safety have generally arisen in the context of circumstances wherein suspicion of the presence of others could rationally be based upon something more concrete than the mere physical capacity of a structure to harbor unseen occupants. <em>See United States v. Blalock, </em>578 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1978) (search behind counter of auto shop during business hours); <em>United States v. Hobson, </em>519 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 931, 96 S.Ct. 283, 46 L.Ed.2d 261 (1975) (weapons known to be in residence where others were likely to be staying); <em>cf. United States v. Mulligan, </em>488 F.2d 732 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 930, 94 S.Ct. 2640, 41 L.Ed.2d 233 (1974) (brief inspection of closet toward which the arrestee had made two \u201csudden\u201d moves). Somewhat analogous are decisions which have upheld the right of officers to check for individuals who might destroy evidence. <em>See United States v. Spanier, </em>597 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fulton, </em>549 F.2d 1325 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. McLaughlin, </em>525 F.2d 517 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>427 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 3190, 49 L.Ed.2d 1198 (1976); <em>United States v. Curran, </em>498 F.2d 30 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Basurto, </em>497 F.2d 781 (9th Cir. 1974), we held that a protective search was unreasonable where the only indication of potential harm to the arresting officers was that the arrestee, while being placed in custody in front of his house, turned toward the house and yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s the police.\u201d While the vitality of <em>Ba-surto </em>has been drawn at least partially into question after <em>Gardner, see </em>627 F.2d at 911, 912, n.6, it nonetheless is consistent with the premise that bare suspicion unsupported by articulable facts will not justify a protective search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">While nearly all of our fellow circuits have endorsed the principle of a protective search in one form or another, there is considerable disagreement over the degree of reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a sweep of the premises. Some decisions appear to require a fairly detailed showing of reasonable suspicion. <em>E. g., United States v. Carter, </em>173 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 522 F.2d 666 (1975); <em>United States v. Gamble, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>473 F.2d 1274 (7th Cir. 1973). Others appear to be more sympathetic to the suspicions of the arresting officers. <em>E. g., United States </em>v. <em>Bowdach, </em>561 F.2d 1160 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\">Striking a proper balance in this area is particularly difficult, and overstatement is particularly inappropriate. The Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to address the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d concept. An overly-restrictive view of the doctrine might expose arresting officers to unnecessary dangers without providing any greater protection to legitimate Fourth Amendment interests. An overly-deferential attitude toward officers\u2019 suspicions, on the other hand, could seriously infringe upon the right to be free from unreasonable searches. We necessarily proceed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the oft-stated presumption that a warrantless search is inherently unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Turning to the specific facts of this case, we acknowledge that our inquiry must focus upon the facts that would lead Agents T\u2019Kindt and Barry to form a reasonable suspicion that the motor home housed additional occupants that could impose a threat to the officers\u2019 safety. To this end, the government cites several factors that militate in favor of the reasonableness of the search.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The agents had not been keeping the motor home under surveillance very long when they pulled it over. They therefore could not determine with any certainty whether other occupants aside from Wiga and Moody were present. After the stop, Wiga lied to the agents when he told them that no one else was present in the motor home. The agents not only knew that Wiga was lying, but their inability to observe Moody from the outside of the motor home confirmed that it was possible for someone to occupy the vehicle without being detected except by an inspection of the interior. Moreover, the vehicle was licensed to a handicapped person, and the agents knew that Wiga was not handicapped. It is not disputed that Agent T\u2019Kindt confined himself to a quick and cursory inspection which could not be characterized as over-broad in light of its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">The record reflects facts and circumstances which would support a reasonable belief that other persons may have been inside the motor home who may have been likely to endanger Agents Barry and T\u2019Kindt. We must conclude, therefore, that the cursory inspection of the motor home was justified by the protective sweep doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since Agent T\u2019Kindt was performing a legitimate sweep of the motor home incident to the lawful arrest of Wiga, the weapons were lawfully seized since they were discovered in plain view. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">The district court denied Wiga\u2019s motion to suppress and found the warrantless search constitutionally valid as a search incident to Wiga\u2019s lawful arrest, citing <em>United States v. Berryhill, </em>445 F.2d 1189 (9th Cir. 1971), with no mention of <em>Gardner. </em>In <em>Berryhill, </em>the defendant driver of a car and his wife, a front seat passenger, were patted down and his wife\u2019s handbag was searched incident to the lawful arrest of <em>Berryhill </em>for unlawful possession of the contents of stolen mail. Although the court in <em>Berryhill </em>did not apply <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), to the facts of <em>Berryhill, </em>because to have done so would have been an impermissible retroactive application of <em>Chimel (see Williams v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 646, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971)), the court felt, in any event, that the <em>Chimel </em>rule of limiting the scope of searches incident to arrest in a defendant\u2019s home was of only slight relevance to the contemporaneous search of a vehicle incident to the arrest of its operator. This court in <em>Berryhill </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-4\">\u201c[W]hen the driver of a motor vehicle is lawfully arrested in the vehicle, the arresting officer has the right to search the vehicle contemporaneously with and as an incident to the lawful arrest, the vehicle being a thing \u2018under the accused\u2019s immediate control.\u2019 <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 364, 367, 84 S.Ct. 881, [883,] 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1963).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\"><em>Id., </em>445 F.2d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">Whether the above sweeping statement in <em>Berryhill </em>has survived the years of developing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence may be questionable; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent determination that \u201cwhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile,\u201d <em>New York v. Belton, </em>- U.S. -, -, 101 5. Ct. 2860, 2864, 69 L.Ed.2d 768, 775 (1981) (footnotes omitted), the statement from <em>Berryhill </em>is now correct to the extent that officers may search the \u201cpassenger compartment\u201d of an automobile incident to the arrest of one of its occupants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">Thus, the district court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Berryhill </em>(at a time prior to the announcement of Belton) is not misplaced in light of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Belton, </em>nor is it contradictory to a finding that the search was a lawful protective sweep incident to an arrest. The justification for the limited sweep of the interior of the motor home in this case is directly related to the same fundamental justifications which dictate the results in both <em>Berryhill </em>and <em>Belton, i. e., </em>the preservation of evidence and the discovery of weapons that the arrestee may use to escape or harm the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">In the present case, the officers could justifiably suspect that Wiga and Moody were not the sole occupants of the motor home. While the specific facts have already been discussed above, it deserves reiteration here that officers engaged in the lawful arrest of an operator of a vehicle have a legitimate interest in seeing that the other occupants of a vehicle do not impose any danger to them while executing the arrest of the operator.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court in <em>Berryhill </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-16\">\u201cIt is inconceivable that a peace officer effecting a lawful arrest of an occupant of a vehicle must expose himself to a shot in the back from defendant\u2019s associate because he cannot, on the spot, make the nice distinction between whether the other is a companion in crime or a social acquaintance. All companions of the ar-restee within the immediate vicinity, capable of accomplishing a harmful assault on the officer, are constitutionally subjected to the cursory \u2018pat-down\u2019 reasonably necessary to give assurance that they are unarmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-17\"><em>Id., </em>445 F.2d at 1193. Occupants of a lawfully detained motor vehicle may be rou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>tinely ordered out of the vehicle, <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977), and with reasonable suspicion that the occupants are carrying weapons, arresting officers may lawfully subject such occupants to a pat-down search. <em>United States v. Berryhill, </em>445 F.2d 1189 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1967). It follows that arresting officers should be allowed to initially determine the number and identity of the occupants of a lawfully detained motor home where, as in this case, the enclosed nature of the vehicle prevents the arresting officers from determining how many occupants are traveling in the vehicle, and where the arrested operator, a fugitive felon, lied about the number of his traveling companions. The concern for the arresting officers\u2019 safety in this ease dictates that the officers be allowed to make the initial determination of the number and identity of all the occupants. Such was the narrow purpose of Agent T\u2019Kindt\u2019s sweep of the motor home when he discovered the shotgun and revolver in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">The facts of this case support the district court\u2019s determination that Agent T\u2019Kindt\u2019s sweep of the motor home was a reasonable search incident to Wiga\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that the cursory inspection was the product of the agents\u2019 legitimate concern that other occupants may have been concealed within the motor home. We are not inclined to disturb that finding, <em>United States v. Flickinger, </em>573 F.2d 1349, 1357 (9th Cir. 1978), and thus affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wiga\u2019s motion to suppress the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">B. <em>No. 80-1685</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">The superseding indictment in this case charged Wiga under two statutes for a total of four counts: Counts I and II, the possession counts, charged Wiga with violations of 18 U.S.C. Appendix \u00a7 1202(a)(1),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> allowing maximum potential sentences of two years per violation; Counts III and IV, the transportation counts, charged Wiga for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> allowing maximum potential sentences of five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>per violation. Counts I and III involved the revolver found incident to Wiga\u2019s arrest; Counts II and IV involved the shotgun. Although a verdict of guilty on all four counts was rendered by the jury, the district court sentenced Wiga to two years\u2019 imprisonment under Count I only. Counts III and IV were dismissed by the district court in response to Wiga\u2019s Rule 29(c) motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis of a multiplicitous indictment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Count II was dismissed by the district court on its own initiative, concluding that \u201cthe government may not treat each of several firearms simultaneously possessed as a separate unit of prosecution under 18 U.S.C. Appendix \u00a7 1202(a)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">While the government concedes that Wiga cannot be convicted simultaneously for both transportation and possession of the same firearms, and that Wiga cannot be convicted and sentenced for simultaneous transportation of multiple weapons,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it now argues for reinstatement of various alternative combinations of counts on three theories: (1) that the district court should have sentenced Wiga for a \u00a7 1202(a) possession violation involving one firearm and a \u00a7 922(g) transportation violation as to the other for a potential consecutive sentence of seven years; (2) alternatively, that the district court should reinstate a single \u00a7 922(g) transportation count in lieu of the court\u2019s dismissal of both such counts in favor of a single \u00a7 1202(a) possession count for a maximum potential sentence of five years; or (3) alternatively, the district court should reinstate the dismissed \u00a7 1202(a) possession count for a potential maximum sentence for two possession counts of four years. We shall discuss each theory in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">1. <em>One Possession Count, One Transportation Count</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">The government argues that, on the basis of the evidence and the jury\u2019s verdicts in this case, the district court could have at least sentenced Wiga for transportation of one weapon and possession of the other; thus allowing a possible maximum sentence of seven years \u2014 five years for the \u00a7 922(g) count (pursuant to the \u00a7 924 sentencing provision) and two years under the \u00a7 1202(a) count. In support of this contention, the government asserts that <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979), dictates that the district court was not required to sentence Wiga only under the more lenient \u00a7 1202(a) count, dismissing the potentially longer sentences under \u00a7 922(g). In <em>Batch-elder, </em>the government had indicted the defendant under \u00a7 922(h) (receipt by an ex-felon of a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce), and the defendant argued that the conduct proscribed under \u00a7 922(h) was the same conduct proscribed under \u00a7 1202(a), thus asserting his right to a lesser sentence under the rule of lenity. The Court held that it was proper for the government, in using its prosecutorial discretion, to charge under either statute and the district court was not required to sentence the defendant under the more lenient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>\u00a7 1202(a) because there was no ambiguity created by the two sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Wiga argues that at the most, <em>Batchelder </em>allows an indictment under either statute, but not both; and that it does not settle the question as to which charges should be dropped in a multiplicitous indictment. For that proposition, Wiga cites <em>United States v. Larson, </em>625 F.2d 67 (5th Cir. 1980). In <em>Larson, </em>the defendant, a previously-convicted felon, was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) and 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) for unlawfully carrying a single pistol. Larson argued that it was improper to be sentenced under both statutes. The court held that the United States Attorney may not proceed under both statutes and remanded the case to the district court to decide which conviction to vacate, noting that the district court was not compelled to vacate the convictions under \u00a7 922(h), carrying the longer sentence maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">A case perhaps more on point is <em>United States v. Girst, </em>636 F.2d 316 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>modified on rehearing, </em>645 F.2d 1014 (D.C. Cir.1979). Girst, like Wiga, was sentenced under both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). On the first appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the two statutes proscribed the same conduct and vacated Girst\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922, applying the rule of lenity in favor of a shorter sentence under \u00a7 1202. Upon rehearing, the court discussed the effect of <em>United States v. Batchelder, supra, </em>on the disposition of <em>Girst. </em>The court reasoned that <em>Batchelder </em>precluded it from applying the rule of lenity since the Supreme Court had decided that the two statutes were not ambiguous. However, the D.C. Circuit read <em>Batchelder </em>to also state that the government may prosecute under either \u00a7 922 or \u00a7 1202, but not both; therefore, the circuit court remanded the case to the district court to determine, within its discretion, which conviction to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">We agree with the government that the district court was not precluded by law from sentencing Wiga under \u00a7 922(g) (pursuant to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 924) for one firearm and \u00a7 1202(a) for the other.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, we also agree with the Fifth Circuit in <em>Larson </em>and with the D.C. Circuit in <em>Girst </em>that if the prosecution fails to elect under which statute to proceed, and if convictions are rendered under both statutes, that the district court may exercise its discretion in deciding which conviction to vacate. As Wiga correctly asserts, <em>Batch-elder </em>decided only that the prosecution may proceed under either statute. In the instant ease, as in <em>Larson </em>and <em>Girst, </em>the government decided to proceed under both statutes which proscribe essentially the same conduct. In such a case as this, the district court, in its discretion, must solve the multiplicity problem; and toward that end, the district court below concluded that \u201csection 1202(a) is the more appropriate statute.\u201d We feel the government\u2019s sug-. gesti\u00f3n that it, not the court, now be allowed to choose under which counts the defendant should be sentenced is fundamentally inappropriate. The United States Attorney, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, may choose under which statute it prefers to proceed, provided it does not discriminate against any class, <em>United States v. Batchelder, supra, </em>but if it chooses to proceed under both \u00a7 922(g) and \u00a7 1202(a), it indicts the defendant twice for essentially the same conduct. In such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>case, the government\u2019s review in this court of the district court\u2019s discretionary dismissal of some charges is limited to a determination of whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Larson, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Girst, supra. </em>We find no such abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">2. <em>One Count Under \u00a7 922(g)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">The government next argues that even if the district court was correct in dismissing all but one count, it incorrectly chose to sentence Wiga with one violation of \u00a7 1202(a) possession, rather than \u00a7 922(g) transportation. This argument essentially states the same argument discussed immediately above. The government once again asserts that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the transportation counts in favor of the possession counts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For the same reasons discussed above, we find no evidence in the record that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the transportation counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">3. <em>One Possession Count for Each Weapon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">The district court dismissed Count II, the possession count involving the shotgun, because it concluded from its reading of the applicable case law that \u201cthe government may not treat each of several firearms simultaneously possessed as a separate unit of prosecution under 18 U.S.C. Appendix \u00a7 1202(a)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">The government now alternatively argues that the district court should reinstate Count II because it reads the case law to provide authority for multiple convictions and sentences for simultaneous possession of weapons separately acquired. The government\u2019s third contention here presents a different issue from what is presented by its first two arguments. While the first two arguments were premised on principles of multiplicity involving multiple convictions and sentences under two statutes proscribing essentially the same conduct, the question presented by the government\u2019s third argument involves a determination, as a matter of law, of the appropriate unit of prosecution under one statute, \u00a7 1202(a)(1), of the simultaneous possession of more than one weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-20\">The general rule, as stated in the cases relied upon by the district court below, is that \u201conly one offense is charged under terms of \u00a7 1202(a)(1) regardless of the number of firearms involved, absent a showing that the firearms were stored or acquired at different times and places.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosenbarger, </em>536 F.2d 715, 721 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Bullock, </em>615 F.2d 1082 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 957, 101 S.Ct. 367, 66 L.Ed.2d 223 (1980); <em>see also United States v. Calhoun, </em>510 F.2d 861 (7th Cir. 1975), and <em>United States v. Kinsley, </em>518 F.2d 665 (8th Cir. 1975). The courts in each case concluded that \u00a7 1202(a)(1) was ambiguous as to the appropriate unit of prosecution and, under the principles of lenity expressed in <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955), they were compelled to find only one conviction for simultaneous possession of multiple weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-21\">While stating the general rule of only one unit of prosecution for simultaneous possession, the district court below apparently overlooked the qualifying exception embodied in the phrase \u201cabsent a showing that the firearms were stored or acquired at different times and places.\u201d The government argues on appeal that this exception applies to the facts of this case since the evidence demonstrates that Wiga purchased the two weapons at different times and in different places. We agree. Of the cases cited above which state the general rule of only one unit of prosecution for simultaneous possession, the only case to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>exception \u2014 finding separate units of prosecution under \u00a7 1202(a)(1) for each weapon separately acquired \u2014 is <em>United States v. Bullock, supra. </em>In the other cases, the courts found only one violation because the facts did not demonstrate separate storage or acquisition. The <em>Bullock </em>court (Goldberg, J., dissenting) applied the exception since Bullock had received the weapons at different times and places.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">We take our place in line with the other circuits in espousing the rule and its exception as stated in the cases cited above. We also note that Wiga\u2019s multiple transgressions dictate an even more compelling set of facts for the application of the exception than was present in <em>Bullock. </em>The uncontro-verted evidence demonstrates that the revolver was acquired (i. e., received and possessed) in Nebraska on December 18, 1978, and the shotgun was acquired in Iowa on April 14, 1978. The indictments allege the separate and distinct acts of acquisition in Nebraska and Iowa with particularity as to time and place. The jury was correctly and adequately instructed as to the essential elements of each offense in Counts I and II. Further, correct instructions were given defining possession, the interstate commerce requirement and the inferences that might be properly drawn from the uncon-troverted sequence of events. Wiga does not quarrel with any of these instructions. The separate and distinct acquisitions were argued to the jury without interference or objection. The mere fact that these separately acquired weapons ended up simultaneously in the possession of Wiga in Nevada does not preclude separate prosecutions for possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">We believe the court in <em>Bullock </em>correctly interpreted the intent of Congress in a statement that deserves reiteration here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8q\">\u201cCommon sense and logic, however, will not support a holding that the receipt of firearms at separate times must merge into one possession, thus, one offense. In addressing this evil, could Congress have intended to deter receipt as well as possession of firearms by convicted felons and yet design the statute to only allow one punishment no matter how many separate receipts and possessions occurred? We think not. Any other determination would allow convicted felons and terrorists to establish armories where all of their weapons would be kept. The person in custody of the armory would then be subject to only a single charge of possession, although thousands of illegal and dangerous weapons were received and stockpiled at different times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">615 F.2d at 1085-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">4. <em>Conclusion as to 80-1685</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Counts III and IV under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We find, however, that Wiga was properly convicted of Count II and should have been sentenced for both Counts I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">We REVERSE and REMAND as to Count II with directions that the guilty verdict be reinstated and that the defendant be sentenced thereunder.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">. The government asserts in its brief in No. 80 -1724 that Agents Barry and T\u2019Kindt also received information that Wiga was \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d This assertion finds no support in the record transmitted on appeal, other than the bare assertions which appear in the government\u2019s brief in response to the motion to suppress. We do not, therefore, give any consideration to the claim that the agents knew Wiga to be armed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">.

This determination does not contradict our disposition in this case that the agents\u2019 actions constituted a valid warrantless sweep search incident to the lawful arrest of an occupant of a motor vehicle.

Wiga, however, was under suspicion of being a parole violator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">. The limited scope of the motor home search that we condone here is one in which the arresting officers have legitimate concerns that occupants not visible to them may imperil their safety. We leave for another day the determination of the constitutional validity of a war-rantless sweep search that strays beyond the limited purpose of searching for other occupants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">. Compartments of an automobile, other than the passenger compartment, may not be considered to he within the permissible scope of a warrantless search incident to the arrest of an automobile\u2019s occupant. <em>See Robbins v.

We do not purport to ignore the physical differences between typical passenger automobiles and motor homes, nor do we credit such differences with much weight for purposes of applying <em>Berryhill </em>or <em>Belton </em>to the facts of this case. Agent T\u2019Kindt\u2019s limited search of the passenger areas of the motor home in the instant case does not stray significantly from the \u201cbright line\u201d rule enunciated in <em>Belton. </em>Nor is such reliance upon <em>Belton </em>inconsistent with our prior holding in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>630 F.2d 1322 (9th Cir. 1980). <em>See </em>n.3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1326-19\">. Such is also the prudent course of action. <em>See United States v. Spanier, </em>597 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1977), and <em>United States v.

It should also be noted that additional justification for the district court\u2019s denial of Wiga\u2019s suppression motion can be found in cases espousing the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d doctrine. The agents in this case most certainly would have impounded the motor home after the arrest and an inventory would have been conducted. The weapons, in admitted plain view, would have been discovered at one of two points: First, when a driver lawfully entered to drive the vehicle to the impoundment area or, second, during the actual inventory. The most likely is the first since the weapons were in such close proximity to the driver\u2019s seat and in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">A number of cases have alluded to the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule. <em>See South Dakota v.
