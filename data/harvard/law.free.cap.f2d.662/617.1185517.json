The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Appellant filed suit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cERISA\u201d) (all subsequent statutory references are to ERISA, as codified in 29 U.S.C.), seeking a declaration that she is entitled to receive her husband, Mario Hernandez\u2019, pension benefits under the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which is administered by the Trust, and to recover statutory damages under \u00a7 1132(c) for appellee\u2019s alleged failure to provide an accounting as required by \u00a7 1025 and for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1132(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The district court found, on uncontrovert-ed facts, that appellant was not entitled to her deceased husband\u2019s retirement benefits because Mario Hernandez (\u201cHernandez\u201d) himself never became eligible to receive benefits under the Plan. The court held that although Hernandez\u2019 accrued benefits had become 100% vested, \u201cthis vested right is not an immediate right\u201d and, since Hernandez died before attaining normal retirement age, the right never \u201cripened into a pension.\u201d It also determined that since Hernandez had no right to pension benefits, his widow had no right to the information required to be furnished by \u00a7 1025. We agree with the decision of the district court and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">Appellant is the widow of Hernandez who died on October 16, 1977, at the age of 61 years 9 months. Hernandez was a participant in the Plan and had elected a \u201cjoint and survivor option,\u201d naming appellant as his joint beneficiary. At the time of his death, he had a 100% vested interest in his accrued pension benefits, as defined by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">Upon her husband\u2019s death, appellant submitted a claim for pension benefits under the Plan as her husband\u2019s beneficiary under his \u201cjoint and survivor annuity benefit.\u201d The claim was denied by appellee on the ground that Hernandez never became eligible for benefits under the Plan because he failed to attain the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d of 62. Appellee also refused to supply appellant with an accounting of the pension benefits earned by Hernandez, although she requested the information on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">The Plan (Art. Ill, \u00a7 1) provides that an employee shall be eligible to retire on a \u201cregular pension\u201d if he has attained age 62 and has at least 10 years of \u201cpension credit.\u201d It is undisputed that under the vesting provisions of the Plan (Art. IV, \u00a7 \u25a0 5), Hernandez\u2019 \u201cpension credits\u201d had become 100% vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">With respect to the \u201cjoint and survivor annuity benefit,\u201d the Plan (Art. VI, \u00a7 1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-19\">\u201cAn Employee eligible for a Regular Retirement Pension shall receive a monthly benefit for life. Should an Employee predecease his spouse, his spouse will continue to receive 50% of the amount, payable to the Employee for the lifetime of the spouse. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ACS\">I. <em>Standard of Review </em>Our role in reviewing the grant of summary judgment is to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>there is any genuine issue of material fact and, if there is none, to determine whether the substantive law was correctly applied. <em>E. g., Program Engineering, Inc. v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>634 F.2d 1188, 1192-93 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Yazzie v. Olney, Levy, Kaplan &amp; Tenner, </em>593 F.2d 100, 102 (9th Cir. 1979). Here, the facts are not in dispute; the questions on appeal are purely legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The primary issue presented is whether, under ERISA, the widow, of an employee who has elected a \u201cjoint and survivor annuity option\u201d and whose right to receive \u201caccrued benefits\u201d has become vested is entitled to receive those benefits after his death, even though the employee died prior to reaching the normal retirement age under the Plan and, thus, never commenced receiving any benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">II. <em>Appellant\u2019s Entitlement to \u201cAccrued Benefits\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Appellant contends that ERISA contains different minimum vesting standards for \u201caccrued retirement benefits\u201d than for \u201cnormal retirement benefits\u201d. Although she concedes that the right to \u201cnormal retirement benefits\u201d does not become \u201cnon-forfeitable\u201d until the employee-participant satisfies both a 10-year service requirement and attains normal retirement age (in this case 62), appellant claims that \u201caccrued retirement benefits\u201d vest and become non-forfeitable as soon as a participant in the Plan has performed the required years of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">ERISA\u2019s minimum vesting standards are contained in \u00a7 1053(a), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">\u201cEach pension plan shall provide that an employee\u2019s right to his <em>normal retirement benefit </em>is nonforfeitable upon attainment of normal retirement age and in addition ... an employee who has at least 10 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of his <em>accrued benefit </em>derived from employer contributions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cthe greater of the early retirement benefit under the plan, or the benefit under the plan commencing at normal retirement age....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">\u201cNormal Retirement Benefit\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1002(22) as</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">\u201cAccrued Benefit\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1002(23) to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">\u201cin the case of a defined benefit plan, the individual\u2019s accrued benefit determined under the plan and, . . . expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Appellant is correct in stating that ERISA\u2019s minimum vesting provisions require that the Plan provide that an employee-participant\u2019s right to receive his \u201caccrued retirement benefit\u201d become \u201cvested\u201d and \u201cnon-forfeitable\u201d when he satisfies its 10-year service requirement. <em>See Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 449-50 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Hepple v. Roberts &amp; Dybdahl, </em>622 F.2d 962, 964-965 (8th Cir. 1980). However, she misconceives the nature of the right which becomes vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">In claiming that she is entitled to receive her deceased husband\u2019s benefits as his beneficiary, even though he never attained \u201cnormal retirement age,\u201d appellant implicitly argues that Hernandez had a right to receive his accrued retirement benefits at anytime after he satisfied the 10-year service requirement and before he reached 62, the normal retirement age. However, ERISA gives an employee-participant no vested right <em>to receive </em>pension benefits until he reaches normal retirement age. \u00a7 1053(a); <em>Hurn v. Retirement Fund Trust of Plumbing, etc., </em>648 F.2d 1252, 1253-54 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Spitzler v. New York Post Corp., </em>476 F.Supp. 386, 389-90 (S.D.N.Y.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>620 F.2d 19 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>Riley v. MEBA Pension Trust, </em>452 F.Supp. 117, 120 (S.D.N.Y.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>586 F.2d 968 (2d Cir. 1978); see <em>Capocci v. General Motors Corp., </em>444 F.Supp. 1306, 1307-OS (D.Haw.1978). Moreover, other provisions of ERISA and its legislative history indicate that Congress never intended to impose upon a plan a requirement that any benefits be payable before age 65. <em>Riley v. MEBA Pension Trust, supra, </em>452 F.Supp. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>120; <em>see </em>\u00a7 1056(a); H.R.Conf.Rep.No.93-1280, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>3 [1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5038, 5062. Accordingly, we hold that ERISA\u2019s minimum vesting provisions require only that, once an employee-participant satisfies his pension plan\u2019s length of service requirement, his right to receive his vested pension benefits mature on his reaching the normal retirement age contained in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Moreover, the fact that her husband elected the \u201cjoint and survivor annuity benefit\u201d is of no help to appellant. As the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s right, if any, to receive funds under the Joint and Survivor Option is a derivative right only and does not arise unless and until the employee-participant becomes eligible for a pension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The Plan merely allows an employee who is entitled to benefits to elect to receive payment of those benefits in the form of a joint and survivor annuity. The provisions of the joint and survivor option of the Plan (Art. VI) are in accord with the applicable provisions of ERISA, which require only that if a plan provides for benefits to be paid as annuities, it must also provide the option for payment of such benefits in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. \u00a7 1055(a). No independent, vested rights for a non-participating spouse are created by election of the joint and survivor option. See <em>Carpenters Pension Trust, etc. v. Kronschnabel, </em>460 F.Supp. 978, 981-82 (C.D.Cal.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>632 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument, that she is entitled, as Hernandez\u2019 joint and survivor beneficiary, to receive his pension benefits even though he never reached normal retirement age, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">III. <em>There Has Been No Impermissible Forfeiture</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Appellant contends that appellee\u2019s refusal to pay her her joint and survivor benefits has resulted in a forfeiture prohibited by \u00a7 1053(a)(3)(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">\u201cA right to an accrued benefit d\u00e9rived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that it is not payable if the participant dies . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">Appellant would have us interpret this provision so as to make it applicable only if a pension plan contains an express provision stating that vested accrued benefits are not payable if the participant dies before reaching normal retirement age. The Plan contains no such specific, negative provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">As pointed out above, however, the Plan (Art. Ill, \u00a7 1) clearly requires a participant to reach age 62 before any benefits are payable. The Plan (Art. V, \u00a7 1) further provides, \u201cBenefit payment shall be payable commencing with the first day of the first month which follows the date on which the employee has fulfilled all of the conditions for entitlement to benefits.\u201d These provisions are sufficient to meet the requirement of \u00a7 1053(a)(3)(A), <em>i. </em>e., the Plan \u201cprovides that it [accrued benefits] is not payable if the participant dies\u201d before normal retirement age. The purpose of this statute is not to require specific, mandatory language in pension plans, but to permit such plans to provide for non-payment in the described circumstance. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">IV. <em>Appeliant\u2019s Right to an Accounting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">Appellant contends that as the beneficiary of Hernandez, she was entitled to a statement from the administrators of the Plan of the total benefits which Hernandez had accrued and the non-forfeitable pension benefits, if any, which had accrued, because \u00a7 1025 requires that such information be furnished to a \u201cplan participant or beneficiary.\u201d She argues that since her claim had not been denied at the time she made the demand for information, she was a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d entitled to an accounting under \u00a7 1025, since \u201cbeneficiary\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1002(8) as \u201ca person designated by a participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit plan, who is or <em>may become </em>entitled to a benefit thereunder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The district court ruled that as a result of the failure of Hernandez to qualify as a recipient of pension benefits, appellant was not a beneficiary as defined in \u00a7 1002(8). We agree. Appellee had no duty to provide information to appellant because she was not entitled to benefits and would never in the future become entitled to benefits; therefore, she was not one who \u201cmay become entitled to a benefit\u201d under \u00a7 1002(8). <em>Cf. Nugent v. Jesuit High School, </em>625 F.2d 1285, 1285-86 (5th Cir. 1980) (former employee, terminated without vested benefits, not a \u201cparticipant\u201d in pension plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
