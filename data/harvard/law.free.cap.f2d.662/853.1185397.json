The Commission\u2019s decision exempts companies operating exclusively as \u201cdesignated operators\u201d from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11343 and 11347 (Supp. Ill 1979) (formerly section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act) and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11322(a) (Supp. Ill 1979) (formerly section 20a(12) of the Act). Authority to issue the exemption rests on section 207 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (the \u201c4-R Act\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505 (Supp. Ill' 1979) (amended 1980). As originally enacted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the exemption authorization read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-9\">Whenever the Commission determines, upon petition by the Secretary or an' interested party or upon its own initiative, in matters relating to a common carrier by railroad subject to this part, after notice and reasonable opportunity for a hearing, that the application of the provisions of this part (i) to any person or class of persons, or (ii) to any services or transactions by reason of the limited scope of such services or transactions, is not necessary to effectuate the national transportation policy declared in this Act, would be an undue burden on such person or class of persons or on interstate and foreign commerce, and would serve little or no useful public purpose, it shall, by order, exempt such persons, class of persons, services, or transactions from such provisions to the extent and for such period of time as may be specified in such order. The Commission may, by order, revoke any such exemption whenever it finds, after notice and reasonable opportunity for a hearing, that the application of the provisions of this part to the exempted person, class of persons, services, or transactions, to the extent specified in such order, is necessary to effectuate the national transportation policy declared in this Act and to achieve effective regulation by the Commission, and would serve a useful public purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">\u201cDesignated operators\u201d are rail carriers conducting operations pursuant to section 304(d) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (the \u201c3-R Act\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 744(d) (1976);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they provide service over minor segments of track. The ICC\u2019s decision exempts these operators from provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>sions that (1) require Commission approval for mergers and similar transactions, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11343,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) require carriers to protect the interests of their employees when they enter into mergers and similar transactions, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347, and (3) prohibit interlocking directorates among carriers without prior Commission approval, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11322(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">John W. McGinness, acting on behalf of the Illinois Legislative Board of the United Transportation Union, submitted comments to the Commission in opposition to the proposed exemption. When the ICC published its decision, McGinness, the Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Association, and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers unsuccessfully petitioned for reconsideration; thereafter, they petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Petitioners raise two issues. First, they contend that the 4-R Act authority to grant exemptions is confined to certain statutory sections governing rates and does not extend to any of the sections addressed in the ICC\u2019s designated operators exemption decision. Second, they urge that even if the 4-R Act\u2019s exemption authority encompasses the merger (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11343) and interlocking directorate (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11322(a)) provisions, the ICC may not exempt any carrier, including designated operators, from the statutory labor protection requirement (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347). While we find petitioner\u2019s first contention insubstantial, we hold that the Commission lacks authority to relieve any carrier, even a designated operator, of the obligations imposed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347 to protect the interests of employees. Accordingly, we remand this case to the Commission for modification of its exemption decision, so that designated operators will not be released from the labor protection requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Petitioners, in support of their contention that the 4-R Act\u2019s exemption authority applies only to certain railroad rate adjustments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> point out that the exemption provision, when enacted in 1976, appeared in a title captioned \u201cRailroad Rates.\u201d This argument is unpersuasive. Rather than creating an entirely new statutory scheme, the 4-R Act worked within the framework of the existing Interstate Commerce Act. The intended placement of the exemption provision in the Interstate Commerce Act, therefore, is a more reliable indication of the congressional design than the location of the provision in the amending public law. The exemption provision was an amendment to section 12 of the Interstate Commerce Act, a section 'headlined \u201cAuthority and duties of Commission.\u201d Nothing in section 12\u2019s caption suggests, confinement of the ICC\u2019s exemption authority to rate</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Moreover, in plain language, the exemption provision empowers the Commission to grant exemptions from \u201cthe application of <em>this part.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The word \u201cpart\u201d evidently refers to part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, the part of that Act in which the exemption provision was to be inserted. (The 4-R Act was organized by sections and titles, not by parts.) The second conference report on the 4 \u2014 R Act confirms this view. It states that the House version of the provision \u2014 the version the conferees adopted \u2014 permits the ICC \u201cto grant exemptions from Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.781, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 152-53 (1976). Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act was not confined to rates; it contained most of the provisions relating to railroad regulation, including the provisions at issue in this case. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-27 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Furthermore, the 4-R Act legislative history is consistent with a straightforward reading of the language of the exemption provision. The House Report, for example, states that \u201c[t]he Committee has given the Commission [the exemption] power to study and review those areas of its <em>regulation </em>so as to eliminate from <em>regulation </em>those <em>areas </em>where regulation is not required.\u201d H.R. Rep.No.725, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 75 (1975) (emphasis added). Similarly, the Senate Report declared that the exemption provision \u201cwould grant the Commission authority ... to exempt regulated carrier services from <em>all or part of the regulations </em>provided under the Act.\u201d S.Rep.No.499, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 53 (1975) (emphasis added). Use of the general terms \u201cregulation\u201d and \u201careas\u201d is hardly indicative of an intent to limit exemption authority to railroad rate deregulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Petitioners urge that the Secretary of Transportation sought an exemption provision so that the Commission could try out deregulation for railroads of \u201ccertain commodities not regulated for trucks and barges.\u201d <em>Railroad Revitalization: Hearings on H.R.6351 &amp; H.R.7681 before the Sub-comm. on Transportation and Commerce of the House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, </em>94th Cong., 1st Sess. 153, 191 (1975). The House Report cites the Secretary\u2019s rate-related concern as one, but not the exclusive, reason for the exemption provision: \u201cThe provision is <em>also </em>addressed to the present inequity of the Interstate Commerce Act which regulates certain commodities for the railroad, but exempts them from other modes.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.94-725, at 75 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Finally, we note that when Congress reorganized the Interstate Commerce Act in 1978, it placed the exemption provision in a chapter titled \u201cJurisdiction.\u201d While petitioners correctly point out that the reorganizing statute specifically provided both that the reorganization effected no substantive change in the law and that inferences of legislative intent should not be drawn from the new location or caption of a provision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress\u2019 treatment of the exemption provision in 1978 fully accords with the original language and legislative history of the provision. Furthermore, in 1980 Congress considerably revised the exemption provision. Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.L.No.96-448, \u00a7 213, 94 Stat. 1895, 1912-13<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Despite several ICC proceedings such as this one applying the exemption provision to non-rate matters,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Congress did not include in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the revision any stipulation indicating that it intended to restrict the Commission\u2019s exemption authority to railroad rates. In light of all these considerations, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s reading of the exemption to extend beyond rail rate matters is reasonable and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\"> Two further challenges to the legality and reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s designated operators exemption decision may be quickly dispatched. First, petitioners complain that the ICC should have included a termination date in its exemption order. While the statute provides that the Commission may set an expiration date in an exemption order, it does not mandate such a stipulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, petitioners argue that under the 4-R Act exemption provision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the ICC may exempt only \u201cservices or transactions\u201d because of their \u201climited scope\u201d but, in this case, the Commission issued the exemption because it found the class of carriers (designated operators), not the services or transactions, limited in scope. As the Commission notes, the \u201climited scope\u201d language in the 4-R Act exemption provision is directed to Commission proposals to exempt a \u201cservice or transaction,\u201d not to Commission exemptions of a \u201cperson or class of persons\u201d from regulation. At any rate, transactions among designated operators are necessarily \u201climited in scope,\u201d for those operators comprise a slender part of the national rail system. At the time of the Commission\u2019s exemption decision, there were 26 designated operators, providing service over only 1,341.2 miles of track in 11 states (J.A. 28, 37-50).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">Petitioners maintain that the ICC unlawfully exempted designated operators from the section 11347 labor protection requirement applicable when a rail carrier merges or otherwise coordinates or consolidates its activities in a manner identified in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11343. Section 11347 requires rail carriers involved in a section 11343 transaction to provide a fair arrangement protective of the interests of employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>ICC counters that Congress intended, when it passed the 3-R Act in 1973,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cto encourage continued rail service over lines which would otherwise be discontinued or abandoned.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Imposition of labor protection obligations in section 11343 transactions among designated operators, the ICC argues, would conflict with this broad legislative objective; it would render more costly, and therefore deter, efforts by designated operators to improve their efficiency through coordination and consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">After the ICC\u2019s decision, and the initial briefing in this court, Congress enacted the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That Act, we conclude, is dispositive of the labor protection controversy. The Staggers Act revised 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505, the provision authorizing the ICC to grant exemptions from regulation. Section 10505(g), a subsection added by the 1980 Act, states explicitly that \u201c[t]he Commission may not exercise its authority [to grant exemptions] . . . to relieve a carrier of its obligation to protect the interests of employees as required by this subtitle.\u201d The Conference Report on the Staggers Act states a general expectation that exemption orders issued prior to the effective date of the Act (October 1, 1980) would remain in full force and effect, unless revoked by the Commission. However, the conferees excepted, <em>inter alia, </em>the section 10505(g) prohibition against relieving a carrier of its obligation to protect the interests of employees. The Report indicates that existing as well as future exemptions would be subject to the section 10505(g) prohibition. Specifically, the conferees stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">[W]e also expect that <em>except to the extent necessary to comply with subsections (e) and (g) </em>of section 10505 [(g) bars exemption from the labor protection requirement] . . ., an exemption order issued by the Commission prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 shall remain in full force and effect unless revoked pursuant to subsection (d) of section 10505 of title 49 U.S.C. as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">H. R.Rep.No.1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 105 (1980) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">We need not dwell on the ICC\u2019s argument that, despite the Conference Report, no provision newly introduced in the Staggers Act is retroactive. Nor need we address petitioners\u2019 argument that the Report confirms a constant congressional intent that labor protection must attend all section 11343 transactions. The ICC concedes that its rulemaking decision has future effect;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is designed for application to post-October I, 1980, merger transactions between designated operators. Thus there is plainly no warrant in this case for departing from the well-established principle that \u201ccourts are obligated to apply law (otherwise valid) as they find it at the time of final judgment, including, when a case is on review, the time of the appellate judgment.\u201d P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and The Federal System 316 n.4 (2d ed. 1973); <em>see Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974) (\u201c[A] court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is a statutory direction or legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>history to the contrary.\u201d); <em>Thorpe v. Housing Authority, </em>393 U.S. 268, 281-82, 89 S.Ct. 518, 525-26, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969); <em>Eiken-berry v. Callahan, </em>653 F.2d 632 (D.C.Cir. 1981); <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. FTC, </em>642 F.2d 1387, 1389-90 (D.C.Cir.1981) (court set aside an FTC order that was inconsistent with a federal statute enacted during pendency of the appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Although the ICC acknowledges that the decision under review has prospective thrust, it asks us not to apply the Staggers Act at this time because petitioners, in a new petition, can invite the Commission to reconsider the matter in light of that Act and can return to this court after Commission reconsideration. We do not agree with the ICC that the proposed course would serve the interests of \u201cjudicial economy and the sound administration of justice.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We see only delay, unnecessary expense,- and inefficiency in the suggestion that we remit petitioners to the Commission to start over with a fresh petition. The ICC\u2019s position in this regard is all the more puzzling because it has presented to this court a decided view: the Commission asserts that the Staggers Act effects no relevant change in the law. Now, as before, the ICC maintains, it has authority to exempt designated operators from the labor protection obligation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">On that dispositive question, whether the Staggers Act affords the Commission discretion to allow designated operators to merge free from section 11347 labor protection strictures, the ICC refers to \u201cthe unique characteristics of [such] operators.\u201d They \u201care not the functional equivalent of rail common carriers,\u201d the Commission underscores.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But in the very decision on review, the ICC quoted from its 1976 notice, in implementation of the 3-R Act:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"a9v-dedup-0\">Although the Designated Operator will not be required to seek and obtain authority from the Commission pursuant to section la and 1(18) of the [Interstate Commerce Act] for either commencement or termination of operations, <em>the Designated Operator will be subject to all other provisions of the Act </em>... <em>as a common carrier by railroad. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap1Z\">In 1976, evidently, the Commission recognized that designated operators were \u201crail carriers\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and, except with respect to commencement and termination, were subject to generally applicable rail carrier regulation. Nor has the Commission retracted that published position. The Commission points to no statutory text that gives it leeway to treat designated operators as anything other than a rail carrier for the purpose at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">It is not within the ICC\u2019s province, nor is it within this court\u2019s, to decide whether it is wise policy to saddle designated operators with the section 11347 labor protection requirement. We cannot indulge the Commission\u2019s plea that we read exceptions into unqualified statutory texts and thus presume to decide how Congress would respond if the exceptions were put to a vote. To summarize what Congress did instruct: (1) the Commission \u201cshall require\u201d a rail carrier involved in a section 11343 transaction \u201cto provide a fair arrangement\u201d to protect the interests of rail employees who may be affected, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347; (2) the Commission may not relieve a carrier of the section 11347 labor protection requirement, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505(g).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Since section 11347, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>as Congress wrote it, does not afford the Commission discretion to narrow the term \u201crail carrier\u201d by nonstatutory definition,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and section 10505(g), as Congress wrote it, affords the Commission no leeway to create exceptions,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we must reject the ICC\u2019s endeavor to release designated operators from the employee protection burden.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">For the reasons stated above we remand the order under review for modification to assure that, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505(g), designated operators are not relieved of the obligation imposed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347 to protect the interest of employees. In all other respects, the Commission\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and remanded for modification consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\">. 4- R Act Pub.L.No.94-210, \u00a7 207, 90 Stat. 31, 42 (1976). Section 207 was originally codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 12(l)(b) (1976). In 1978 Congress revised and reenacted the Interstate Commerce Act as subtitle IV of title 49 of the United States Code. The exemption provision quoted in the text was then codified, in somewhat different form, at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505. Congress specifically provided that the 1978 reenactment may not be construed to effect any substantive change in the law and that inferences of legislative intent should not be drawn from the position of a provision in the reenacted statute or from captions or catch-lines in the new statute. Act of Oct. 17, 1978, Pub.L.No.95-473, \u00a7 3(a), (e), 92 Stat. 1337, 1466. We therefore set out the language of the exemption prior to reenactment. In 1980, Congress amended the exemption provision to alter the findings necessary to support exemption orders and, in a new subsection relevant to one of the issues in this case, provided that the Commission could not relieve a carrier of the obligation to protect the interests of employees affected by mergers and similar transactions.

While the 1978 alteration was not intended to work any substantive change and the 1980 revision, in this particular, does not have a retrospective thrust, the clearer language used in 1978 and 1980 may serve to resolve any ambiguity in the 1976 version. <em>Cf.

In <em>Illinois Commerce Commission v.

As our affirmance in <em>Illinois Commerce Commission </em>indicates, we agree with the ICC that the exemption issued in that case \u201ccomplies with the requirement of the exemption provision [49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505] as amended by the Staggers Act to prohibit exemptions which relieve a carrier of labor protection obligations required by provisions of the Act governing rail carriers.\u201d Supplemental Memorandum of Interstate Commerce Commission at 1 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. While the ICC argues in this case that designated operators \u201care more like contract carriers than rail carriers,\u201d Supplemental Memorandum of Interstate Commerce Commission at 7, the Commission does not deny that designated operators are embraced by the statutory definition of the term \u201crail carrier.\u201d <em>See </em>note 21 <em>supra. </em>The statute defines \u201ccontract carrier\u201d to mean \u201ca motor contract carrier and a water contract carrier.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(5). Of course, if designated operators were something other than rail carriers, they would not be subject to the requirements of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11343-11347 in the first place, and there would be no need to exempt them from any of those requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. We therefore cannot agree with the ICC that since Commission approval is not required when a designated operator abandons operations, \"it follows that the merger transactions should not be treated differently.\u201d Supplemental Memorandum of Interstate Commerce Commission at 8.

The ICC cites Tennessee Central Ry. Abandonment, 334 I.C.C. 235, 246 (1969), and Okmulgee Northern Ry. Abandonment, 320 I.C.C. 637, 641 (1964), cases in which it \u201cfound that the need for rail service outweighs the interest of former employees especially where the continuation of operations might provide employment opportunities that otherwise might not exist.\u201d Supplemental Memorandum of Interstate Commerce Commission at 9 n.5. The Commission neglects to mention, however, that those decisions issued at a time when, in some types of cases, the Interstate Commerce Act did not mandate the Commission to impose employee protections. Since the Commission had discretion to decide whether to impose those protections, it sometimes decided not to do so when the need for rail service was strong and the imposition of employee protections would have discouraged the railroad from undertaking the service. But decisions relating to the exercise of discretion, when the Act permitted the Commission to use discretion, are not instructive here, where Congress has mandated employee protection and has explicitly withheld from the Commission authority to exempt any rail carrier from according that protection. However \u201creasonable\u201d the Commission\u2019s action, we cannot defer to a disposition unauthorized by statute. <em>See, e.g., Zuber v.

The Commission has consistently taken the position that Congress did not intend the labor protective provisions to apply to designated operators. Thus, when, in the course of exempting designated operators from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>requirement of obtaining Commission approval for mergers and similar transactions, the Commission stated that the labor protective provisions would not apply, the Commission was not exercising its exemption authority. It was merely construing the statute. Hence, the Staggers Act provision stating that \u201c[t]he Commission may not exercise its authority [to grant exemptions] ... to relieve a carrier of its obligations to protect the interests of employees as <em>required by this subtitle </em>\u201d has no effect here, for the Commission was not exercising its exemption authority and designated operators are not required by section 11347 to protect the interests of employees in mergers and similar transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Designated operators provide rail service pursuant to section 304(d) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (3R Act), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 744. Under the 3R Act the United States Railway Association promulgated a final system plan that determined which of the lines of the numerous Northeast railroads in reorganization would be transferred to the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Those lines not included in the final system plan were subject to automatic discontinuance. Service over these lines, however, could continue if a subsidizer guaranteed payment to a designated operator of the difference between the revenues attributable to its rail service operations and its avoidable costs, together with a reasonable management fee. <em>In re Exemption of Certain Designated Operators from Section 11343, </em>361 I.C.C. 379, 380, 383 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The Commission has treated designated operators differently from other rail carriers in a number of respects. Rather than require them to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101, the Commission has set up an independent procedure whereby designated operators need only obtain a \u201cCertificate of Designated Operator\u201d before commencing service. 361 I.C.C. at 380. Likewise, the Commission has not required designated operators who wish to abandon or discontinue service to obtain prior Commission approval under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903 before terminating operations. When a rail carrier that must comply with section 10903 obtains Commission approval to abandon or discontinue service it receives a certificate describing the discontinuance that must \u201ccontain provisions to protect the interests of employees.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, when a designated operator abandons or discontinues service, it is not required to comply with the employee protective provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The Commission supported its position that labor protective provisions would not apply to mergers between designated operators by noting that although designated operators may include labor <em>costs </em>as part of their avoidable costs, labor <em>protection </em>cannot be so included. 361 I.C.C. at 383. The Commission thus concluded that Congress did not intend the labor protective provisions to apply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APl\">in section 11343 transactions between companies operating exclusively as Designated Operators .... [T]he intent of the 3R Act is to encourage continued rail service over lines which would otherwise be discontinued or abandoned; imposition of labor protection in section 11343 transactions might encourage these Designated Operators and their corresponding subsidizers to discontinue inefficient and costly Designated Operator operations rather than to use section 11343 transactions to achieve a more efficient and less costly continued operation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Since the Commission\u2019s action with respect to labor protection was not an exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>cise of its exemption authority, but instead an interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act, it is entitled to \u201cgreat weight and respect.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In my opinion the Commission has properly interpreted the statute that it is charged to implement and enforce.
