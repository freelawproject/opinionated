It involves the permissible methods by which hospital employees may solicit union membership. In particular, the questions raised are whether the Baylor University Medical Center\u2019s \u201cno-solicitation\u201d rule may properly forbid union solicitation by hospital employees in the hospital\u2019s vending areas and cafeteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">In the 1974 Health Care Amendments the reach of the nation\u2019s labor laws was extended to include hospitals. Act of July 26, 1974, Pub.L.No.93-360, 88 Stat. 395. The strong need for tranquility in hospitals posed problems with respect to the manner and areas where union solicitation should be permitted. In the typical industrial setting, an employer ban on union solicitation by employees during nonworking time is presumptively invalid. <em>Republic Aviation Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945). Likewise, employer bans on distribution of literature are presumptively invalid during nonworking time in nonworking areas. <em>E. g., Stoddard-Quirk Manufacturing Co., </em>138 N.L.R.B. 615 (1962). Exceptions have been recognized for department stores and restaurants \u2014 an employer in such a retail setting may prohibit union solicitation in areas where the public is invited even during an employee\u2019s nonworking time. <em>Bankers Club, Inc., </em>218 N.L. R.B. 22, 27 (1975) (restaurant); <em>Marshall Field &amp; Co., </em>98 N.L.R.B. 88 (1952) (department store), <em>enf\u2019d, </em>200 F.2d 375 (7th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">The Board devised a special presumption for health care institutions in <em>St. John\u2019s Hospital &amp; School of Nursing, Inc., </em>222 N.L. R.B. 1150 (1976), <em>enforcement granted in part and denied in part, </em>557 F.2d 1368 (10th Cir. 1977). This rule made a solicitation ban presumptively invalid in all areas of a hospital other than \u201cimmediate patient care areas.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After receiving less than universal acceptance by the courts of appeals, the presumption came before the Supreme Court in <em>Beth Israel Hospital </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>437 U.S. 483, 98 S.Ct. 2463, 57 L.Ed.2d 370 (1978). That opinion by Justice Brennan upheld</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-20\">the Board\u2019s policy \u2014 which requires that absent [a showing of a substantial threat of harm to patients] solicitation and distribution be permitted in the hospital except in areas where patient care is likely to be disrupted \u2014 [as a permissible] construction of the Act\u2019s policies as applied to the health-care industry by the 1974 amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-21\">437 U.S. at 500,98 S.Ct. at 2473. The Court also upheld the application of the presumption in <em>Beth Israel, </em>as the Court later described it, \u201cto a hospital cafeteria maintained and operated primarily for employees and rarely used by patients or their families.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Baylor University </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Medical Center, </em>439 U.S. 9, 10, 99 S.Ct. 299, 58 L.Ed.2d 202 (1978) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In 1979 the Court had another opportunity to consider the Board\u2019s application of its presumption. <em>NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., </em>442 U.S. 773, 99 S.Ct. 2598, 61 L.Ed.2d 251 (1979), involved a hospital rule that prohibited solicitation by employees \u201cin any area of the Hospital which is accessible to or utilized by the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775, 99 S.Ct. at 2600. The Court agreed with the Sixth Circuit that there was no substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s order forbidding the hospital from prohibiting solicitation in its corridors and sitting rooms that adjoined or were accessible to patients\u2019 rooms and operating and treatment rooms. The Court also held, however, that the Board had properly ruled that the hospital had not overcome the presumption of invalidity of the \u201cno-solicitation\u201d rule with respect to the hospital\u2019s cafeteria, gift shop, and lobbies on the first floor of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The Court noted a number of factors that led to its decision regarding the cafeteria and other public areas located on the first floor. First, the hospital presented \u201cno clear evidence\u201d of the frequency of use of the first floor areas by patients. The evidence indicated only occasional patient visits to the public areas of the first floor. This determination was underscored by evidence that indicated that, to eat in the cafeteria, a patient must have \u201cspecial permission.\u201d From this evidence, the Court noted it would be reasonable to conclude \u201cthat only those patients who are judged fit to withstand the activities of the public areas on the first floor are allowed to visit those parts of the Hospital.\u201d 422 U.S. at 786, 99 S.Ct. at 2605. The Court also noted that two officials of the hospital testified that \u201cat least some kinds of solicitation in public areas such as the cafeteria would be unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on patients or patient care.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Baylor University Medical Center (\u201cBaylor\u201d) is a five-hospital complex located in Dallas, Texas. In June of 1975 it issued a new interpretation of its long-standing no-solicitation rule. The rule as interpreted stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">Solicitation of employees of Baylor University Medical Center by other employees or distribution of literature between employees is prohibited during work time and/or in work areas. The term \u201cwork areas\u201d includes patient care floors, hallways, elevators or any other area, such as laboratories, surgery or treatment centers, where any type of service is being administered to or on behalf of patients and also includes any areas where persons visiting patients are likely to be disturbed. Service to our patients and their visitors includes not only primary' and acute medical care, but food service and psychological support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>Baylor University Medical Center, </em>225 N.L. R. B. 771, 772-73 (1976), <em>enforcement denied and remanded, </em>578 F.2d 351 (D.C.Cir.), vacated <em>in part and remanded, </em>439 U.S. 9, 99 S. Ct. 299, 58 L.Ed.2d 202 (1978), <em>remanded, </em>593 F.2d 1290 (D.C.Cir.1979). Local 648 of the Laborers International Union of North America (AFL-CIO), which had begun an organizing campaign at Baylor in the fall of 1974, complained to the Regional Director of the General Counsel that Baylor\u2019s no-solicitation policies violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The Board\u2019s original decision in this case consisted of the adoption of the recommended order of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), and the affirmation of his rulings, findings and conclusions. <em>Baylor University Medical Center, 225 </em>N.L.R.B. 771 (1976). The AU, relying on minimal factual findings, disposed of the case by mechanically invoking the <em>St. John\u2019s </em>presumption, holding the solicitation ban invalid in all areas of the hospital other than \u201cimmediate patient care areas.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">On petition for review and cross-application for enforcement, this court denied enforcement of the Board\u2019s invalidation of Baylor\u2019s no-solicitation rule. <em>Baylor University Medical Center v. NLRB, </em>578 F.2d 351 (D.C.Cir.) <em>(\u201cBaylor </em>I\u201d), <em>vacated in part and remanded, </em>439 U.S. 9, 99 S.Ct. 299, 58 L.Ed.2d 202 (1978). The opinion focused on three non-immediate patient care areas\u2014 the corridors, the cafeteria and the vending areas. With respect to the corridors, we held that the \u201cimportance of preventing crowding and disruption in the hospital corridors\u201d justified the solicitation ban. <em>Id. </em>at 354-57. The opinion treated the cafeteria and vending areas together and reasoned that, in judging the validity of solicitation bans, they should be treated like retail stores and restaurants. Since these last-mentioned establishments are permitted to ban solicitation in areas open to the public, we concluded that Baylor could enforce its ban in its cafeteria and vending areas. <em>Id. </em>at 357-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">The Court disposed of the NLRB\u2019s petition for certiorari in <em>Baylor I </em>by relying on its then-recent decision in <em>Beth Israel. </em>In\u2019a <em>per curiam </em>opinion the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-15\">As the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beth Israel </em>is relevant to the cafeteria issue in this case, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Beth Israel </em>only on that issue. Insofar as the petition for certiorari seeks review of the corridor issue, the petition is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM69\"><em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Baylor University Medical Center, </em>439 U.S. 9, 10, 99 S.Ct. 299, 58 L.Ed.2d 202 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Our second opinion in this case followed the Supreme Court\u2019s remand. After recounting the Court\u2019s opinion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1q\"><em>Beth Israel </em>decidedly does not hold that a prohibition on solicitation in a cafeteria used by employees is unlawful. The lawfulness of the ban, instead, is determined on the evidence offered in each case; in <em>Beth Israel, </em>evidence that the cafeteria was a natural and well-established gathering place for employees, rarely used by others, was regarded as dispositive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax2\"><em>Baylor University Medical Center v. NLRB, </em>593 F.2d 1290, 1293 (D.C.Cir.1979) <em>(\u201cBaylor II\u201d). </em>After listing the significant differences between Beth Israel Hospital and Baylor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we concluded that our task was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAS\">to determine only whether the Board\u2019s decision to strike a balance against Baylor\u2019s interests is supported by the evidence. To say that it is is to say that Baylor failed to meet its burden of overcoming the <em>Republic Aviation </em>presumption with evidence justifying the prohibitions as necessary to avoid disruption of patient care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We concluded that, on the record as it then stood, \u201cimmediate enforcement of the Board\u2019s order would be ill-advised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We instructed the Board to consider on remand</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">the availability of alternative areas in and especially around the facility for solicitation. That consideration is important, for while Baylor\u2019s evidence may not justify a no-solicitation/no-distribution rule applicable to the entire operating schedule of the cafeteria (6:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M.) it does justify, in our view, a continuation of the ban during some periods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\"><em>Id. </em>We noted the evidence in the record that indicated that the ratio of employees to patients and visitors during the cafeteria\u2019s evening meal (4:30 to 6:30 p.m.) was almost one-to-one. We also pointed out the evidence that showed that the \u201clandscaped and concrete terrace areas around the hospital are designed for and heavily used by the employees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">On remand the Board adhered to its earlier position that the solicitation ban could not be applied in the vending areas and cafeteria. <em>Baylor University Medical Center, </em>247 N.L.R.B. No. 178,103 L.R.R.M. 1311 (Feb. 22, 1980). It received no additional evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The availability of the outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>grounds as a suitable alternative area for solicitation was summarily rejected by the Board \u2014 \u201cAttempting to contact 3,700 employees located throughout various buildings on the sprawling grounds of the medical center complex would be a herculean task.\u201d Slip op. at 7, 103 L.R.R.M. at 1313. The opinion is silent on the advisability or desirability of permitting Baylor to ban solicitation in the cafeteria during those times when the concentration of patients and visitors is highest. Because we still believe that a consideration of these factors is important and because there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s complete disapproval of the solicitation ban in the cafeteria and vending areas, we must again remand to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In our view the Board\u2019s decision in this case is flawed both by mischaracterization and by the absence of substantial evidence in the record to support many of its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The Board lists as Baylor\u2019s only justification for its rule a belief that it is necessary to ensure a tranquil atmosphere. The Board posits that union solicitation is not uniquely capable of disrupting tranquility, and then notes that \u201cthere is no rule prohibiting any topic of conversation, save that of union solicitation.\u201d Slip op. at 5, 103 L.R. R.M. at 1313. Reiterating this point, the Board adds: \u201cNor would it appear that discussion of medical matters, disease, and death would be particularly reassuring to patients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 103 L.R.R.M. at 1313. The Board here confounds the difference between solicitation and conversation. As we noted in <em>Baylor I, </em>\u201csolicitation has a disruptive force quite apart from its contribution to noise level and overcrowding. There was evidence at the hearing that witnessing solicitation tends to undermine both patients\u2019 and visitors\u2019 confidence in the hospital.\u201d 578 F.2d at 356 (citing App. at 343 (testimony of Dr. A. D. Sears) and App. at 209 (testimony of Dr. John Goodson)). Solicitation differs from conversation. Baylor does not permit all forms of communication except union solicitation \u2014 its ban extends to <em>all </em>forms of solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">The Board implies that Baylor does not uniformly enforce its solicitation ban, and in so doing discriminates against union solicitation: \u201cThe Respondent ... engages in and permits various forms of solicitation, e. g., weddings, retirements, bake sales, and a \u2018benefit fair\u2019 .... \u201d Slip op. at 6, 103 L.R. R.M. at 1313. There is no record support for a claim of discriminatory enforcement of Baylor\u2019s solicitation ban and no eviden-tiary support for these other forms of solicitation being as disruptive or extensive as union solicitation. The General Counsel acknowledged at the hearing that the NLRB had not \u201calleged any discriminatory application, of the rule,\u201d App. at 55, and we noted in <em>Baylor I </em>that \u201cthere is no indication that [Baylor\u2019s] no-solicitation rule was in any way discriminatory or directed against efforts at unionization.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Board has improperly suggested that Baylor has singled out union solicitation for eradication.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The Board relies on slim evidence to support its claim that union solicitation in the cafeteria would not disrupt patients and visitors. \u201cEmployees Goolsby and Mosely testified without factual contradiction that they solicited authorization cards in the cafeteria without disruption.\u201d Slip op. at 6, 103 L.R.R.M. at 1313. True, there was testimony that employees had engaged in isolated instances of solicitation in the cafeteria without creating a \u201cfight,\u201d \u201ccommotion,\u201d or \u201cargument\u201d among the employees solicited. App. at 64. They did not testify, however, that no disruption of patients and visitors occurred, and it would be unreasonable to expect Baylor to produce evidence of disruption given that the incidents were isolated and prohibited. Baylor did produce the testimony of several witnesses who testified that solicitation in the cafeteria <em>would </em>disrupt patients and visitors. App. at 231-32 (statement of Robert Wooldridge, Director of Central Food Services); <em>id. </em>at 209-12 (statement of James Goodson, gynecologist physician and surgeon); <em>id. </em>at 157-58 (statement of Howard Chase, Associate Executive Director).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The Board states that \u201c[p]atients who eat in the cafeteria must obtain permission from their attending physician and consequently it may be assumed that they have been \u2018judged fit to withstand the activities of the public areas ....\u2019\u201d Slip op. at 6, 103 L.R.R.M. at 1313 (quoting <em>Baptist Hospital, </em>442 U.S. at 786, 99 S.Ct. at 2605). This assumption finds no support in the record. The General Counsel points to the following testimony to support the Board\u2019s finding that patients may only eat in the cafeteria with their doctor\u2019s permission: Q. Now, we have also had testimony several times during this hearing that patients come into your cafeteria, but I want to make sure the record is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">In-patients get fed on the floor and in their rooms. That\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">A. [by Robert Wooldridge, Director of Central Food Services] No, that\u2019s not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">That is normally correct, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">JUDGE VON ROHR: I think that\u2019s the answer. That\u2019s normally correct. There are exceptions. I\u2019m sure we all realize that.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">Q. ... And if they wish to visit with their family, and they\u2019re well enough, as a matter of their own personal desire they may go into the cafeteria for a snack or meal?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">A. They may eat all their meals in the cafeteria if their doctor allows them. App. at 447-48. Although this testimony indicates that a patient must have his doctor\u2019s permission if he wishes to eat <em>a 11 </em>his meals in the cafeteria, it does not suggest whether or not the doctor\u2019s permission is required for an occasional meal there. This evidence that a patient may need his doctor\u2019s permission to eat in the cafeteria is too slim to support the conclusion, drawn by the Board, that patients who eat in the cafeteria can \u201cwithstand the activities of the public areas.\u201d Additionally, visitors, of course, do not need a doctor\u2019s permission to eat in the cafeteria. Yet, the Baylor position all along has been its solicitation ban protects <em>both </em>patients <em>and </em>visitors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>no support for the Board\u2019s conclusion that the non-employee customers of the cafeteria will not be disturbed by union solicitation, while there is evidentiary support for the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In non-hospital cases the availability of alternative areas for solicitation is irrelevant to the determination of whether a ban on solicitation is valid. The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that different considerations in the health care context make proper an inquiry into the availability of alternative areas.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the Board had not considered the availability of alternative areas in its original decision, we instructed it to consider \u201cthe availability of alternative areas in and especially around the facility for solicitation.\u201d 593 F.2d at 1295. The Board\u2019s consideration of the issue consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">While it may be true, as Respondent contends, that the moderate climate of Dallas is helpful to outdoor solicitation that is no more than a mitigating factor in considering its rule which, as a practical matter, makes the workplace off limits to employee discussion of workrelated matters. Attempting to contact 3,700 employees located throughout various buildings on sprawling grounds of the medical center complex would be a herculean task.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Slip. op-, at 7, 103 L.R.R.M. at 1313. We believe the Board has jumped to a conclusion here, with little or no evidentiary support. To the extent the record contains evidence of the use of the grounds by the employees, it suggests that solicitation there would be convenient.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The Board attempts to lessen the appeal of the alternative areas by extolling the attractiveness of the cafeteria as a place for solicitation. It states that the cafeteria \u201cis the only area where employees from the five hospitals and medical support departments congregate on a regular basis.\u201d Slip op. at 6, 103 L.R.R.M. at 1313. This suggests that all employees use the cafeteria for their meals or breaks. The evidence is to the contrary. One hospital official testified that less than half of the employees take their break in the cafeteria and that a \u201cmajority\u201d eat their one major meal there. App. at 420-21 (statement of Howard Chase, Associate Executive Director).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We also find the Board\u2019s resolution of the vending areas issue unsatisfactory. In <em>Baylor II </em>we noted that it was not clear whether the Supreme Court\u2019s remand included the vending machine areas.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We interpreted the remand not to \u201cinclude the areas where vending machines are located throughout the hospital. Many of these areas are small and for the convenience of staff, patients, and visitors and are off the corridors. [App.] at 127, 153, 200, 216, 265, 292, 316, 322.\u201d 593 F.2d at 1296 n.9. We made it possible, however, for the Board to reconsider the vending areas question: \u201cIf the Board considers that any of these areas should be open to solicitation it should make separate findings .... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">On remand, the Board acknowledged that Baylor presented evidence \u201cthat as part of physical training some patients use the vending machines ... and occasionally ambulatory patients and visitors use the machines.\u201d Slip op. at 8,103 L.R.R.M. at 1314. The Board did not find this evidence sufficient to justify the ban on solicitation, however, since \u201cthis evidence falls far short of that necessary to establish that the vending areas are areas of immediate patient care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not believe that this should be the end of the inquiry. Under the Board\u2019s <em>St. John\u2019s </em>presumption, a solicitation ban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>outside of an immediate patient care area should be upheld if the hospital makes a showing that , the ban is necessary to prevent a disruption of patient care. It does not appear that the Board considered this question, but instead terminated the inquiry after deciding that the vending areas were not immediate patient care areas. The Board\u2019s decision on the vending issue is additionally flawed by its misguided view of the absence of alternative areas for solicitation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We thus must reject the Board\u2019s ruling on the vending areas. On remand the Board should consider whether the evidence submitted by Baylor is sufficient to overcome the <em>St. John\u2019s </em>presumption. It would appear difficult for Baylor to establish the necessity of preventing solicitation in the vending areas after the cafeteria closes and when darkness makes the grounds unsuitable for solicitation. Conversely, the evidence in the record as it now stands \u2014 showing the location of the vending areas as \u201coff the corridors\u201d and indicating they are regularly used by patients and their visitors\u2014 suggests that a ban during the daytime hours would probably be permissible. The Court in <em>Baptist Hospital </em>refused to set aside the ban on solicitation in \u201cthe corridors and sitting rooms on patients\u2019 floors.\u201d 442 U.S. at 785, 99 S.Ct. at 2605. In any event, the record as presently constituted does not support the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">The record does not support the Board\u2019s total invalidation of Baylor\u2019s solicitation ban in its cafeteria and vending areas. Two factors are involved in such a ruling. First, the evidence indicates that approximately 40% of the cafeteria\u2019s patrons are non-employees. Second, the evidence shows that the exterior grounds of the hospital complex are a convenient place for solicitation, and that they are widely used by employees. This is the evidence that we held required an earlier remand, and our disapproval of the Board\u2019s method of dealing with that evidence requires another remand. The record as it now stands may support an order by the Board preventing Baylor from enforcing its ban in the vending areas from 6:30 p. m. to 6:30 a. m., when the cafeteria is closed and the use of the grounds is not feasible, and in the cafeteria during non-meal times, when the proportion of employees to non-employees is relatively high.

In view of the historical success hospitals have had in overcoming the Board\u2019s presumption in this regard, the Regions should not argue that the <em>St. John\u2019s </em>areas are the only ones that can be treated as patient care areas.

It is important to note that, although <em>Beth Israel </em>upheld the invalidity of the ban insofar as it covered the cafeteria in that case, it did not establish the broad principle that a solicitation ban in cafeterias or similar public places would <em>ipso facto </em>be unprivileged. On the contrary, with the benefit of the guidance provided by the <em>Baptist Hospital </em>opinion, courts will undoubtedly take a closer look, on a case-by-case basis, at the evidence and arguments relied upon by hospitals to justify solicitation bans in each of these areas. It is imperative, therefore, that a complete investigation be conducted and a full record be established in the remanded cases as to the relative use of each public access area by employees, as compared to the use by patients and/or their visitors; the time periods when employees would be most likely to congregate in each area; the physical layout of each area and its relationship to other areas; whether the area in question is a \u201cnatural gathering place\u201d for employees; and the physical and/or mental and emotional condition of patients who would be likely to use the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 15,937-38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-11\">. \u201cIt shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer ... to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title . ... \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).

Obvious among the differences are: (1) The survey of cafeteria patrons in <em>Baylor </em>indicated that 42% of its customers were nonemployees, J.A. at 224, whereas the comparable figure in <em>Beth Israel </em>was 11.56%. (2) The <em>Baylor </em>cafeteria is apparently \u201cvery, very crowded,\u201d at least at certain times of the day, J.A. at 225, whereas there was evidence in <em>Beth Israel </em>that the hospital regarded its eating facilities as \u201ccommodious.\u201d (3) The eating arrangement in the <em>Baylor </em>cafeteria was structured in such a way that there was of necessity substantial intermingling of visitors, patients, and employees, J.A. at 225, whereas the <em>Beth Israel </em>Court found the cafeteria there a \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d gathering place for employees.

(5) There is no indication of an official bulletin board located in the Baylor cafeteria \u2014 official notices were apparently posted on boards near the nurses\u2019 stations, J.A. at 63, and there was mention of a board outside the cafeteria, J.A. at 174 \u2014 whereas there was an \u201cofficial\u201d board and an \u201cunofficial\u201d board in <em>Beth Israel\u2019s. </em>(6) The <em>Baylor </em>hospital is situated on a large campus with extensive outside areas that have seating facilities in attractive surroundings around the principal buildings that are used at meal and break times by employees, J.A. at 324-25, 328-29, 332-33, and with an employees-only parking area, J.A. at 119, whereas the <em>Beth Israel </em>hospital was situated in a congested area of Boston.

As Dr. James Goodson, a gynecologist physician and surgeon who maintained an office in a plaza attached to the medical center, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Age\">I feel like a Hospital\u2019s only function is patient care. And I feel like since that\u2019s its only function, it needs to do the very best it can in this area, which includes not just the mechanics of excellent patient care but also concern for the feelings that the patient has and the patient\u2019s relatives have. I think the patients are in a unique position as far as customer of the Hospital, if you could use that term in that they don\u2019t enter voluntarily; they may come involuntarily, but they come because they\u2019ve got to. I don\u2019t think anybody wants to be confined to a hospital and just walks in for a rest. Maybe there\u2019s a few cases, but they\u2019re very few. So, they\u2019re there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>because they\u2019re apprehensive, something wrong with them or more than likely, something really is wrong with them. And they\u2019re a bundle of nerves because they\u2019re not at all sure what\u2019s wrong with them and not sure the doctor knows what\u2019s wrong with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiB\">They\u2019re not sure anybody really cares totally for their well being. And anything that disrupts this, just fortifies their fears tremendously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALq\">Q. Would the same thing be applicable to loved ones of the patients and visitors of the patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ad-dedup-0\">A. Yes, sir. I think many times they\u2019re more of a problem because the patient may very well have confidence in the doctor. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the family does. I think probably half of our value in the medical profession is treating relatives. You don\u2019t treat them physically, you treat them emotionally because they\u2019re so concerned for their loved one who is sick.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">App. at 208-09. <em>Accord, id. </em>at 163 (\u201canytime a person is hospitalized, ... the patient ... and family members are under unusual stress\u201d) (statement of Howard Chase, Associate Executive Director of Baylor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">. <em>Beth Israel Hospital </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>437 U.S. at 505, 98 S.Ct. at 2475:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">While outside of the health-care context, the availability of alternative means of communication is not, with respect to employee organizational activity, a necessary inquiry, see <em>[N.L.R.B. v.] Babcock &amp; Wilcox, </em>[351 U.S. 105, 112-13, 76 S.Ct. 679, 684, 100 L.Ed. 975 (1956)], it may be that the importance of the employer\u2019s interest here demands use of a more finely calibrated scale.

There is an aggregate and concrete terrace from the area just above the nuclear medicine department all the way over to what is shown as Adair Street in the top portion of this exhibit and to the left. That probably goes two hundred feet in length with a number of benches, a fountain area there, with an area to sit around it, and also with landscaping. There are steps that lead down from that terrace to Junius Street, which are points where many employees would go out and sit on the steps at break time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae-\">... And there are a number of areas, kind of rock walls where terraced gardens have been established, that are just used to sit on break periods, and we have numerous people outside during that time.

People go into vending rooms, get cold drinks and things and bring them out and sit in this area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am7\">A. Yes.

They\u2019re too small.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aod\">What we\u2019d like to have now, and many people do take their food items and drinks and get them and go out to another area.

Several references have been made to the vending room that is adjacent to the nuclear medicine department ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3K\">Employees from the offices and departments throughout this portion of the building will go to that vending room to get a Coke or whatever, Coke or coffee, and go out through this lobby which is maybe a hundred feet away from steps in front of the Veal Hospital, and then there is a substantial area there before you get to Junius Street that is a lawn area and will have \u2014 and well, we\u2019ll have fifty people on many days at this time of year just out there sitting having their lunch in that period, sitting on the grass.
