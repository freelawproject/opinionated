In granting the petition, we asked counsel to submit briefs addressing the applicability of <em>INS v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam), to the instant case. After considering those briefs, we have concluded that the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals [\u201cthe Board\u201d], which denied the Prapavats\u2019 applications for suspension of deportation, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The facts giving rise to the Prapavats\u2019 petition for review were set out in our previous opinion, <em>Prapavat v. INS, </em>638 F.2d 87 (9th Cir. 1980), and need not be repeated here. We held that the Board had abused its discretion by concluding that the facts adduced by the Prapavats did not constitute extreme hardship, and remanded solely for determination of the other prerequisites on which 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) conditions eligibility for suspension of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>Wang, </em>however, the Supreme Court emphasized the broad discretion that the immigration authorities enjoy in interpreting \u201cextreme hardship,\u201d 101 S.Ct. at 1031, and \u201cthe limited nature of our function\u201d in reviewing their interpretation. <em>Phinpathya v. INS, </em>657 F.2d 1083, 1086 (9th Cir. 1981). We therefore \u201cdo not question [the Board\u2019s] finding on the basis of our own view of what constitutes extreme hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we cannot affirm the Board\u2019s decision, because we believe the Board did not properly consider all the factors relevant to the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Aside from a conclusory statement that it could not \u201cfind a sufficient number of adverse factors to conclude that deportation will result in the degree of hardship\u201d properly labelled \u201cextreme,\u201d the Board made only two specific pronouncements on the points raised by the Prapavats. First, it dismissed their allegations of financial hardship by arguing that the high living standard in the United States ensured that \u201cmost deported aliens will likely suffer some degree of financial hardship\u201d and that Congress did not intend to suspend the deportation of all such aliens. Second, it observed that \u201cthe possibility of inconvenience to a citizen child is not in itself sufficient to constitute extreme hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">These laconic statements do not discharge the Board\u2019s duty, when it denies suspension of deportation, to \u201cgive reasons which show that it has properly considered the facts which bear on its decision.\u201d <em>Mejia-Carrillo v. INS, </em>656 F.2d 520, 522 (9th Cir. 1981). For example, the cursory reference to the citizen child\u2019s possible \u201cinconvenience\u201d does not tell us what weight the Board gave to the evidence that the medical problems of the Prapavats\u2019 daughter could worsen in the Thai climate \u2014 nor even whether it considered that evidence at all. Similarly, the Board\u2019s summary treatment of the financial hardship claim gave no individualized consideration to the particulars of the Prapa-vats\u2019 situation. Instead, the Board tacitly invoked a floodgates argument by simply assuming that \u201cmost deported aliens\u201d would experience the same degree of hardship as the Prapavats. This approach ignores the rule that each hardship case \u201cmust be decided on its own facts.\u201d <em>Banks v. INS, </em>594 F.2d 760, 762- (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">There is a second respect in which the Board has failed to \u201cproperly conside[r] the facts which bear on its decision.\u201d This court has reiterated that the adverse consequences of deportation are to be considered <em>cumulatively </em>in determining whether \u201cextreme hardship\u201d exists. <em>Villena v. INS, </em>622 F.2d 1352, 1357, 1359 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Jong Shik Choe v. INS, </em>597 F.2d 168, 170 (9th Cir. 1979). Yet in denying the Prapavats\u2019 applications, the Board evidently weighed each relevant factor in <em>isolation, </em>observing that hardship to a citizen child \u201cis not in itself sufficient\u201d and that financial loss \u201cin the absence of substantial additional equities\u201d is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This approach is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>incorrect. The existence of a citizen child, deportation to an underdeveloped country that offers minimal opportunities for suitable employment, the child\u2019s lack of knowledge of that country\u2019s language, her health problems, and the economic loss from the forced liquidation of the Prapavats\u2019 assets must all be assessed in combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Board\u2019s disposition of this case does not exhibit a proper consideration of the relevant factors. Failure to properly consider those factors is an abuse of discretion. <em>Phinpathya v. INS, </em>667 F.2d at 1086 (9th Cir. 1981). Accordingly, we must reverse the Board\u2019s order as to both petitioners and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> The instant case differs from <em>Hee Yung Ahn v. INS, </em>651 F.2d 1285 (9th Cir. 1981), where the panel rejected the argument that the Board had considered each relevant factor in isolation. There the court found that \u201c[t]he opinion read as a whole . . . makes clear that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>found little substance to any of [petitioners\u2019] arguments, considered separately or together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287. Here, by contrast, there is no evidence that the Board ever considered the Prapavats\u2019 arguments together.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
