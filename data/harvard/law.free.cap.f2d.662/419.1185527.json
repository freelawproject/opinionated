RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b475-20\">Denied disability and disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act in 1976, Jo Ann Ellis did not appeal. In 1979, she filed a second application for the same benefits for the same period, alleging the same disability arising on the same date. After this application was denied, Ms. Ellis requested a hearing. The Administrative Law Judge again found her not to have been disabled. On review, the Appeals Council reopened the decision of the ALS and dismissed the request for a hearing on the basis of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-21\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192, that neither \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706, nor \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), grants the district courts jurisdiction to review a decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare not to reopen a previously adjudicated claim for Social Security benefits. The petition for benefits was not explicitly a petition to reopen the prior hearing but it was in effect exactly such a request. As the Court said in <em>Sanders,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOv\">We also agree that section 205(g) cannot be read to authorize judicial review of alleged abuses of agency discretion in refusing to reopen claims for social security benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-22\">430 U.S. at 109, 97 S.Ct. at 986, 51 L.Ed.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-23\">We have ourselves applied this rule in a case in which the Secretary denied benefits on grounds of res judicata and simultaneously refused to reopen an earlier claim. <em>Hensley v. Califano, </em>601 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>1979). That decision is the law of the circuit, and we would be obliged to adhere to it, even were we not convinced, as indeed we are, that <em>Sanders </em>is dispositive. <em>Williams v. Blazer Financial Services, </em>598 F.2d 1371 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Cargill Inc. v. Offshore Logistics, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 212 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Accordingly, the decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
