We dismiss this action as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">The unchallenged facts are as follows: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 9, 1981, the bankruptcy court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> entered an order confirming the Plan of Reorganization submitted by Information Dialogues, Inc. (IDI). Metro Property Management Company (Metro) appealed to the district court but did not attempt to obtain a stay of the confirmation order from either the bankruptcy or district court and did not apply for or obtain a supersedeas bond. The confirmation order remains in effect at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">IDI has taken substantial steps to implement the reorganization plan in reliance on the confirmation order. Specifically, IDI has (1) paid in full all priority wage claims; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) paid in full all claims allowed in Class 3; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (3) issued 566,019 shares of its common stock to Class 4 creditors and debenture holders in satisfaction of debts totaling approximately $2,465,944 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (only disputed Class 4 claims await resolution and payment by the issuance of common stock); (4) obtained an investment of $400,000 by four new investors based on confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization; and (5) filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q with the SEC reflecting the changes in its financial and equity positions resulting from implementation of the Plan of Reorganization. On April 20, 1981, the district court dismissed Metro\u2019s appeal, apparently for lack of diligent prosecution. Metro appeals that dismissal to this Court and IDI has moved to dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-20\">The mootness concern arises when, as here, it may be impossible for a court to grant effective relief because the disputed assets have been transferred pursuant to the reorganization plan. Bankruptcy Rule 805 addresses this concern with a procedure for creditors to request a stay pending appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. Rule 805 also provides that, absent a stay, court-approved transfers are final in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>transferees are protected against subsequent reversal. In this situation, the mootness doctrine promotes an important policy of bankruptcy law \u2014 that court-approved reorganizations be able to go forward in reliance on such approval\u201dunless a stay has been obtained. <em>Accord In Re Roberts Farms, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 793 (9th Cir. 1981). 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">A strong competing policy is the equitable interest of a creditor in securing review of a bankruptcy court order which adversely affects the creditor. This interest, for example, mandates that bankruptcy courts and district courts give careful attention to stay applications with full appreciation of the possibility that meaningful appeal may be foreclosed if the reorganization plan is substantially implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Competing policies of mootness and equity may present difficult decisions in some circumstances. Here, however, their application is clear. IDI has implemented substantial elements of the reorganization plan and it is very doubtful that effective relief could be afforded even if Metro prevailed on the merits. Moreover, Metro presents no equitable claim because it has not at any stage requested a stay of the confirmation order pursuant to which the transfers have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We, therefore, dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-13\">.
