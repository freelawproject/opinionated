The government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6). The district court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, 494 F.Supp. 883, dismissed the complaint \u201cfor failure to state a cause of action\u201d (R. 83), and the Loges appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">I..</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">In testing the sufficiency of the Loges\u2019 amended complaint, the district court was constrained to accept all material allegations as true and to eonstrue them liberally in favor of plaintiffs. <em>Park View Heights Corp. v. City of Black Jack, et al., </em>467 F.2d 1208, 1212 n.3 (8th Cir. 1972). Only if \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief\u201d should the complaint be dismissed. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). The material allegations in this case indicate the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">In June 1963, the Secretary of HEW licensed Lederle Laboratories to manufacture Orimune \u2014 a trivalent, live, oral poliovi-rus vaccine. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(a); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10(a). Orimune is composed of all three Sabin strains of live poliovirus corresponding to the three different types of polio (known as Types 1, 2, and 3), thus the designation\u2019\u201ctrivalent.\u201d A characteristic of live Sabin polio vaccines such as Ori-mune is that not only is the vaccine\u2019s recipient immunized from polio, but unimmun-ized persons who come into close contact with the recipient also are immunized through a shed virus which spreads from the recipient to the \u201ccontact.\u201d Because Sabin strains contain the live polio virus, there is a risk that either a recipient or a contact could develop polio. Accordingly, the Secretary has promulgated regulations pertaining to the safety and potency of these strains which serve to protect susceptible persons from contracting the disease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Drug manufacturers must prove their product\u2019s conformity to these regulations before the Secretary will issue a license to manufacture. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">A risk-free alternative to inoculation with the live Sabin vaccine is the Salk vaccine in which the virus is killed so that the recipient cannot contract polio nor can the recipient shed a live virus to unimmunized contacts. But the Secretary has promoted the use of risk-bearing live vaccines because they are able to effect total immunization of the public through transmission of the shed virus with less than total inoculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-13\">Mrs. Loge was exposed to the shed virus in 1976 after a doctor inoculated her infant son Todd with Orimune. Within one month after her son\u2019s inoculation, Mrs. Loge was stricken with a vaccine-associated case of poliomyelitis, Type 2. As a result, she is now a paraplegic. The Loges brought suit in the United' States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against the United States and unknown employees of the Department of HEW. The district court liberally construed their amended complaint to state the following claims against the United States under the FTCA based on the Secretary of HEW\u2019s negligence in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-14\">(1) licensing all spread virus vaccines including Orimune, without requiring the manufacturer to produce the information required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10(b)(2);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>(2) licensing all live oral poliovirus vaccines without testing their safety for persons in close proximity to those inoculated, but who themselves have not received the vaccine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-4\">(3) licensing all live oral poliomyelitis vaccines when the Secretary knew that the viruses reproduced within the inoculated person would not pass the safety requirements applicable to the viruses contained within the inoculant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-5\">(4) licensing Types 1, 2, and 3 of the Sabin poliomyelitis live vaccine without establishing that it was free from harmful effect on individuals who had been determined to be particularly susceptible to the disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-6\">(5) licensing Orimune without issuing regulations designed to insure its continued safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-7\">(6) failing to apply the review procedures set forth in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.25;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-8\">(7) failing to enact regulations which would assure the safety of trivalent oral polio vaccine as defined in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.3(p);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-9\">(8) subjecting Mrs. Loge to shed virus inoculation without her knowledge or consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-10\">(9) failing to approve a stronger package insert warning about adverse reactions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-11\">(10) failing to use due care in approving Lederle Lot No. 451 \u2014 162\u2014the vaccine lot from which Todd Loge received his inoculation \u2014 of the trivalent, live, oral polio vaccine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">R. 73-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">Additionally the Loges pleaded that under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1973) and <em>Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980), they have a cause of action for damages directly under the Constitution for deprivation of Mrs. Loge\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment and her right of privacy. They claim that the government knowingly deprived Mrs. Loge of these rights in pursuing a national policy to vaccinate everyone against polio, including persons such as Mrs. Loge who did not voluntarily submit to the immunization program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">A. Before a cause of action against the United States can be stated, the hurdle of sovereign immunity must be overcome. This is the purpose of the FTCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-17\">The Federal Tort Claims Act is not a federal remedial scheme at all, but a waiver of sovereign immunity that permits an injured claimant to recover damages against the United States where a private person \u201cwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-18\"><em>Carlson v. Green, supra </em>at 28 n.l, 100 S.Ct. at 1477 n.l (Powell, J. concurring). The district court construed the Loges\u2019 amended complaint to state several causes of action which failed to overcome this initial hurdle because they attacked acts or omissions by the Secretary of HEW that were \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d The FTCA does not waive sovereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim ... based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a). Insofar as the Loges\u2019 amended complaint alleged that the government was negligent in promulgating or failing to promulgate regulations that would ensure the safety of live, oral poliovirus vaccines and properly protect susceptible persons such as Mrs. Loge, the district court correctly found that such actions by the government were discretionary functions and therefore immune from suit under FTCA. <em>Cf. Dalehite v. United States, </em>346 U.S. 15, 27, 73 S.Ct. 956, 963, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953) (\u201cIt was not \u2018intended that the constitutionality of legislation, the legality of regulations, or the propriety of a discretionary administrative act, should be tested through the medium of a damage suit for tort.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>On appeal the Loges challenge this finding in only one respect: the district court found that the regulations do not require the shed virus to be tested for safety, concluded that the Loges were essentially attacking the government for its failure to promulgate such regulations, and held that a non-actionable discretionary function was therefore implicated. The Loges claim that the regulations do require testing of the shed virus. They contend the shed virus is an \u201canalogous product\u201d to a virus; therefore it is within the definition of \u201cbiological products\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which are subject to licensing regulations. Title 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.-3(h)(5)(i) states that a product is analogous to a virus <em>\u201cif prepared from or with a virus or agent </em>actually or potentially infectious, without regard to the degree of virulence or toxicogenicity of the specific strain used.\u201d (emphasis added). The \u201canalogous product\u201d obviously being referred to is a vaccine, which is prepared from a virus. Thus the live, oral polio vaccine is an analogous product to the Sabin viral strains because it is prepared from those strains. The same cannot be said for the shed virus. It is not a product analogous to a virus because it is not \u201cprepared from or with a virus or agent;\u201d it is itself a virus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Nor is the shed virus, as the Loges further contend, a \u201crecommended dosage\u201d of a poliovirus strain. The regulations require that data must be submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs \u201cwhich establish that each such strain is free of harmful effect upon administration in the recommended dosage to at least 1 million people susceptible to poliomyelitis ...\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10(b)(2). The recommended dosage to which this regulation refers is the dosage of poliovirus strains \u201cused in the manufacture of poliovirus vaccine.\u201d <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10(b)(2). The shed virus clearly is not a strain used in the manufacture of poliovi-rus vaccine. In short, the regulations are plainly designed to ensure the safety of live, oral poliovirus vaccine upon its direct recipients. No regulations require data showing the safety of the shed virus on contacts. To the extent that the Loges\u2019 amended complaint may be construed to state a claim attacking the government for this regulatory omission, the district court was correct in concluding that a discretionary function is implicated, thus immunizing the government from suit. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of this cause of action or any of the other causes of action to which the discretionary function exception was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">B. The district court did find that two causes of action under the FTCA were hot barred by the discretionary function exception: the negligent failure of the government to require the mandatory tests of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when Lederle was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>licensed to manufacture Orimune in 1963 and the negligent failure to follow mandatory tests when Lederle\u2019s Lot 451-162 was approved. The Secretary has no discretion to disregard the mandatory regulatory commands pertaining to criteria a vaccine must meet before licensing its manufacture or releasing a particular lot of vaccine for distribution to the public. <em>See Griffin v. United States, </em>500 F.2d 1059, 1063-69 (3d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Nevertheless the district court concluded that the Loges had still failed to state a claim under FTCA because no circumstances were alleged \u201cwhere the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). This section has been construed to require that the entire law of the place where the act or omission occurred must be applied, including its choice of law principles. <em>Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962). Without deciding which venue\u2019s law applied, the district court concluded that neither the law of the District of Columbia \u2014 the place of the negligent acts and omissions \u2014 nor the law of Arkansas \u2014 the place of the harmful impact \u2014 imposes a duty of due care on a person for activity similar to the government\u2019s in this case. We find, however, that under the applicable choice of law principles, Arkansas law applies and further that a cause of action has been stated under the law of Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">The allegations in the complaint indicate that the negligent acts and omissions by the government occurred in the District of Columbia, thus, under <em>Richards, supra, </em>the District\u2019s choice of law principles apply. The District of Columbia applies an interest analysis under which we must identify the state policies underlying each law in conflict and decide which state\u2019s policy would be advanced by having its law applied to the facts at bar. <em>Gelley v. Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., </em>610 F.2d 558, 561 (8th Cir. 1979), <em>quoting Semler </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Institute of Washington, D. C., </em>575 F. 2d 922, 924 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>see generally, </em>G. L. Milhollin, <em>The New Choice of Law in the District of Columbia, </em>24 Cath.U.L.Rev. 448 (1975). The law of the District of Columbia as construed by the Eighth Circuit in <em>Gelley </em>prohibits recovery by an injured party against the government under the circumstances as alleged in this case. It therefore seems that the underlying policy is to protect the government/defendant from liability for negligence in regulating drug safety. The Arkansas courts have not addressed this issue, but the district court predicted they would apply principles set out in the Restatement (Second) of Torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>\u00a7 324A (1971), which governs liability to third persons for the negligent performance of an undertaking.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, presumably the government could be found liable under the theory that it failed to exercise reasonable care in undertaking to ensure the safety of live, oral poliovirus vaccine. The underlying policy goal of this tort rule would appear to be to compensate the injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Because the policies of the tort rules of the two jurisdictions conflict, we must determine whether Arkansas\u2019s interest in the application of its rule outweighs the countervailing interest of the District of Columbia. Key factors in making this determination include the place where the injury occurred, the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, and the residence of the parties. <em>Gelley, supra, </em>at 561 n.4; <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145 (1971). Since plaintiffs are residents of Arkansas and the injury occurred in this state, we find applicable the Arkansas rule in favor of protecting its citizens from injuries under such circumstances as are alleged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">We also find that the district court erred in concluding that despite the prevailing rule in Arkansas, the Loges failed to allege circumstances under which relief could be granted. The district court summarily concluded that under Restatement \u00a7 324A <em>(supra </em>n.7), \u201cthe government could not be said to have increased the risk which was inherent in the drug,\u201d the government undertook no duty owed by the drug manufacturer to the Loges, and Mrs. Loge could not be said to have relied on the government to ensure the vaccine met established safety and potency requirements. In making these determinations, the district court failed to give proper deference to the Loges\u2019 claims: \u201cThe question ... is whether in the light most favorable to plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief.\u201d 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1357 at 601 (1969) (footnotes omitted). Such deference is particularly important where, as here, the plaintiffs are first put on notice of the applicable rule of law in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion ruling on the motion to dismiss. Construing the Loges\u2019 allegations in their favor, we find that claims have been stated under any one of the three alternative grounds for liability stated in Restatement \u00a7 324A. It can be said that the government increased the risk of harm to the Loges by licensing an allegedly untested product, Orimune, and by releasing to the public an allegedly untested or negligently tested lot of that vaccine: if either the product itself or a particular lot of that product failed to conform to standards established by the regulations, then proper testing or proof of testing would have revealed the nonconformity and the vaccine would never have been disseminated to Todd Loge. Likewise, it can be said that the government undertook a duty owed by the drug manufacturer to the Loges when it required that proof of the drug\u2019s safety be demonstrated to the government before releasing it to the public. Finally, the Loges alleged they relied on the government\u2019s use of due care in approving for release the particular vaccine lot that was eventually administered to Todd Loge. Therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the Loges had failed to state a claim under the law of Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">We turn now to the Loges\u2019 claims said to arise under the Constitution of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>States. The Loges seek redress under the authority of <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics </em>Agents,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>from various unknown government agents and employees. They alleged that through their policy decisions to promote the use of live, oral poliovirus vaccine over killed virus vaccine, government officials intentionally and recklessly sacrificed Mrs. Loge\u2019s good health for the benefit of the health and welfare of the public, constituting: (a) an uncompensated taking of her private property (\u201cto wit, Mrs. Loge\u2019s body\u201d) for public use; (b) a deprivation of her life, liberty and property without due process of law; and (c) an invasion of her right of privacy. The district court held that these allegations failed to state a cause of action because \u201c[t]he Constitution does not include a guarantee to be free from personal injury under the circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">Not even the most general clauses of the Constitution, such as the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, should be read as conferring upon the courts the right to superintend every action of government that may adversely affect some citizen. While we recognize our duty to condemn forthrightly any governmental action that contravenes the Constitution, we are also aware that this function must be kept within bounds. To find that the Loges\u2019 allegations state causes of action under the Constitution would be to overstep these bounds. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of these constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of dismissal in all respects except for the dismissal of the Loges\u2019 two claims under the FTCA alleging the government\u2019s violation of its own regulations. As to these claims, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">.
