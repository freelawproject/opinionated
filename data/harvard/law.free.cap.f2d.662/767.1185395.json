ATCMU argued centrally that the Postal Service\u2019s request was procedurally defective because, at the time of the Board\u2019s approval, it did not have the specific rates before it, as allegedly was required by the Board\u2019s bylaws, and that temporary charges based upon that request could not legally be implemented.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The District Court agreed with ATCMU and enjoined operation of the temporary rates until such time as a valid request might be sent to the Commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, we stayed the injunction,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the temporary charges thus went into effect. Later, utilizing procedures unquestionably lawful, the Board authorized resubmission of the request and, that being done, the injunction expired by its own terms. Some months thereafter, the Commission announced its recommended decision, whereupon the Postal Service made the changes permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Subsequently, we issued our decision affirming the District Court\u2019s injunction, essentially on the theory advanced by ATCMU.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Postal Service petitioned for rehearing and suggested rehearing <em>en banc; </em>those efforts failing,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, and after rendition of our decision, the Board commenced rulemaking proceedings which culminated in revision of the operating procedures found violated. As amended, the Board\u2019s bylaws now provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-13\">The following matters are reserved for decision by the Board of Governors: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-14\">(h) Authorization of the Postal Service to request the Postal Rate Commission to submit a recommended decision on changes in postal rates, including specific authorization of the amount of revenue estimated to be required so that total estimated income and appropriations will equal total estimated costs as nearly as practicable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">With that, the Supreme Court granted cer-tiorari, vacated our judgment and remanded the case for our \u201cfurther consideration in light of the . . . amended provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Board of Governors\u2019 internal operating procedures.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The question initially confronting us is whether the litigation became moot when the Board of Governors adopted this provision. As a federal court we may decide only an actual case or controversy;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in every instance, we must be presented with a \u201cdefinite and concrete\u201d problem that \u201ctouch[es] the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> So, when the subject of previous dispute has disappeared, we normally lose jurisdiction to act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That, we find, is largely the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">When this case was first before us, we examined it to determine whether even then it was moot. As we have indicated, after the District Court held the temporary increases invalid the Board concluded a detailed review of the sought-after rates and submitted a new request therefor to the Commission.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Additionally, the District Court\u2019s injunction \u2014 the object of the Postal Service\u2019s appeal \u2014 automatically expired upon that resubmission.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There are, however, exceptions to the mootness doctrine, and we refused to dismiss the appeal as moot for two well established reasons. In the first place, although the Postal Service had conformed its ratemaking effort to the District Court\u2019s directives,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we saw its corrective action as merely a response thereto under protest and in expectation of appeal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For that reason, we adhered to the principle that \u201c \u2018voluntary cessation of alleged illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case, /. e., does not make the case moot.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We realized, too, that with ATCMU\u2019s continuing interest in lawful charges, and the Postal Service\u2019s insistence that the District Court\u2019s order was erroneous, there was \u201c \u2018a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That, coupled with the short-lived nature of the District Court\u2019s injunction, we held, brought the case within the mootness exception for conduct \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">These conditions no longer obtain. By amendment of its bylaws, the Board has now modified its operating procedures to legitimatize the rate-requesting methodology found improper under the prior bylaws. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The current bylaws make it ever so plain that the particular rates to be requested need not be brought before the Board.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus repetition of the challenged conduct could not afford ground for relief, and the mootness exceptions previously applicable are now unavailing.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">ATCMU urges, however, that a controversy continues over restitution of postal charges to the extent that for a while they were excessive. It will be recalled that the District Court\u2019s injunction, which would have restrained implementation \u00f3f the temporary rates and fees, was stayed pending appeal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Resultantly, for a short period<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> mail users incurred postage expense higher than they would have encountered had the injunction \u2014 which we ultimately affirmed \u2014 remained in effect. On the original appeal, ATCMU asserted a claim for restitution on this ground, but neither in our opinion nor our judgment did we honor it.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We are unable to reconsider the question now. ATCMU did not seek rehearing by this court or review by the Supreme Court on the restitution issue, and of course no question concerning it was raised in the Postal Service\u2019s petition for certiorari.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is well-settled that on an adversary\u2019s appeal a party may not challenge or seek to enlarge a judgment to which he did not himself object.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It follows that ATCMU cannot resurrect the restitution issue on the remand precipitated by the Postal Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">There is, however, a final point remaining alive. When this case was last before us, we expressly reserved the question whether \u2014 aside from the Board\u2019s bylaws \u2014 the Postal Act itself \u201cmandate[d] the Board\u2019s thorough involvement in the process of submitting rate requests\u201d;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> there was no need to reach the issue, we found, because the Board had in any event violated its internal operating procedures.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Since those procedures have now dropped out of the case, we must determine whether by statutory command a request for particular rates need be brought before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-16\">It is true that we noted, during our first exposure to this litigation, that \u201cit is the Board \u2018which exercises the power of the Postal Service to set temporary rates.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> That does not mean, however, that a repetition of the challenged conduct would run afoul of the statute. Congress unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ously declared that <em>\u201cthe Postal Service </em>shall request the Postal Rate Commission to submit a recommended decision in a rate or rates of postage or in a fee or fees for postal service . <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> That, of course, was precisely the action taken by the Postal Service and attacked by ATCMU in round one of this litigation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> And while the Act also requires that \u201cexercise of the power of the Postal Service shall be directed by [the] Board of Governors,\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> this legislative mandate was, again, met in the instant ease: the Board authorized the Service to submit what proved to be its controversial request for rate increases.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Equally telling, the Act, unlike the Board\u2019s old bylaws, does not suggest that the Board must approve in advance the particular rates or fees to be requested. There is, then, no potential statutory violation to justify injunctive relief, and no statutory reed to which ' ATCMU may cling in its attempt to keep this Methu-selahan litigation alive any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">For the reasons stated, we remand this case to the District Court for vacatur of its judgment<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and dismissal of ATCMU\u2019s action as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-16\">. <em>United States Postal Serv. v.
