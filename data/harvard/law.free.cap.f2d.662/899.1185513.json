CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Bernard Lamoureux, an activist in the Teamsters\u2019 two unsuccessful campaigns to organize Wright Line\u2019s employees, was discharged from his job as a shop inspector, ostensibly because he submitted an inaccurate record of the times at which he performed inspections on December 29, 1977. Upon Lamoureux\u2019s complaint, the Board found that Wright Line had discharged him because of his union activity, in violation of section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Board ordered Wright Line to reinstate Lamoureux with back pay. We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Wright Line manufactures computer storage products to the specifications of customers, including government agencies. Lamoureux began working for Wright Line in 1966 and, with the exception of a period between 1971 and 1973, was employed there continuously until his discharge on December 30, 1977. The Board found, with substantial record support, that Lamoureux\u2019s work, throughout this period until December 29,1977 was satisfactory or better. For the last two years of his employment, he worked in the company\u2019s Inspection Department, inspecting completed parts for quality and conformity to specifications. This position required that he keep records on two forms: the Inspection Report, which stayed with the blueprint for the inspected part, and the Daily Activity Sheet, on which he recorded the time of each inspection and which he submitted to his supervisor after each day\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">In 1976, Lamoureux contacted Teamsters Local 170 and initiated an organizational drive among Wright Line\u2019s employees. The Board supportably found that Lamoureux was visibly active in the union campaign. An election was held on August 27, 1976, and Lamoureux served as an alternative observer for the union, which lost the election. A second campaign was conducted in the fall of 1977, and Lamoureux was again active. An election was held on October 20, 1977; the union lost again. The Board supportably found that Wright Line management conducted an aggressive (although not necessarily unlawful) campaign against the union, and that management was well aware of Lamoureux\u2019s activism, certain supervisors having made \u201cgratuitous remarks\u201d to him about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">The Board found, on the basis of substantial evidence, that Lamoureux\u2019s discharge occurred as follows: on the morning of December 29, 1977, Plant Superintendent Southard asked Supervisor Forte to check on Lamoureux, reporting that he had seen Lamoureux entering the men\u2019s room carrying a newspaper. Forte went to Lamour-eux\u2019s two assigned departments and walked between them until Lamoureux appeared some 35 minutes later. Forte then returned to his office, saying nothing to Lamoureux, and noted the times of Lamoureux\u2019s absence. Forte had made no attempt to locate Lamoureux, neither looking in the men\u2019s room nor using the plant\u2019s page system, although Lamoureux\u2019s job included several tasks which would require him to leave his departments for short periods. Later the same day, Forte had occasion to be in Lamoureux\u2019s department and did not find him there. About 30 minutes later he found Lamoureux at a workbench inspecting a part. Forte again made a record of the incident but did not ask Lamoureux to explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The next morning, Forte checked Lam-oureux\u2019s Daily Activity Sheet and noted Lamoureux\u2019s report that he had made sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>eral inspections during the time when Forte had failed to find him in his departments. Forte presented this information to his own supervisor, who stated that this indicated a \u201cdischargeable offense.\u201d The two consulted higher officials, who told them that they \u201ccould discharge\u201d Lamoureux if his account substantiated the charge. Forte prepared a written report of the incident, had Lamour-eux\u2019s final paycheck prepared, and then summoned Lamoureux to a meeting with himself and two others. Confronted with the charge, Lamoureux admitted that \u201cthe times weren\u2019t accurate and they never were,\u201d stating that \u201cif you want them right to the second, I can put them right to the second,\u201d and asserting that the real reason for the confrontation was his union activity. The supervisors denied this charge and discharged Lamoureux, .saying that they no longer considered him trustworthy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), provides that,</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">This provision is supplemented by section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), which authorizes the Board to take remedial action, with the following limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any backpay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Section 8(a)(3) imposes a prohibition on employers which is simple to state but often difficult to apply in practice: they may not discharge an employee because of his union activity; but they may and should apply their usual rules and disciplinary standards to a union activist just as they would to any other employee. Hence, in a given discharge case it must be decided whether the employer acted because of the employee\u2019s union affiliation, or whether he acted because of some factor unrelated to the employee\u2019s union status. <em>Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. NLRB, </em>365 U.S. 667, 675, 81 S.Ct. 835, 839, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961) (test is \u201ctrue purpose\u201d or \u201creal motive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Often, of course, there are competing explanations of why an employee was fired. Board counsel will point to evidence of anti-union motivation. The employer will cite some instance of misconduct and will deny having been motivated by any other consideration. In such a situation, the Board needs to determine not only whether the asserted misconduct occurred, but whether, even so, it effectively produced the discharge. The employer will doubtless lose if the asserted misconduct is shown not to have occurred. But suppose it occurred? In such event, Board counsel will argue that it was insufficient cause for discharge\u2014 that a non-activist would have been retained notwithstanding the offense. The employer, on the other hand, will deny this, and will insist, moreover, on his right, as the employer, to determine what conduct is or is not acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">The Board\u2019s approach to these cases\u2014 sometimes, although without complete accuracy, termed \u201cmixed motive\u201d cases \u2014 has been the source of a continuing controversy among the circuits and between the Board and this court. In the present case, the Board has taken a new approach. Relying on <em>Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), and precedent from this circuit, the Board announced the following rule: general counsel must first \u201cmake a <em>prima facie </em>showing sufficient to support the inference that [the employer\u2019s opposition to] protected conduct was a \u2018mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>tivating factor\u2019 in the employer\u2019s [discharge] decision. Once this is established, the burden will shift to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d 251 NLRB No. 150, at 20-21. Applying that test here, the Board found that the prima facie case had been made and that Wright Line failed to prove that it would have taken the same action regardless of Lamoureux\u2019s union activity. Wright Line challenges the Board\u2019s new approach and its application here as contrary to the provisions of the statute and beyond the powers of the Board in that it places the burden of persuasion on the employer. We are thus called upon to pass on the validity of the Board\u2019s new rule as well as on its application to this record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We start by observing that the Board\u2019s new rule seems better than its old one. Previously the Board would find a violation of section 8(a)(3) and order reinstatement whenever it concluded that the discharge was even partially motivated by opposition to union membership. Under this approach, a discharge was improper even if it would have occurred absent the illegal motivation, e. <em>g., </em>the employee may have committed an infraction so serious that any employee\u2014 union or non-union \u2014 would have been fired. This partial motivation test \u2014 as the Board now acknowledges \u2014 placed \u201cthe union activist in an almost impregnable position once [anti-]union animus has been established.\u201d Activists could not be discharged for conduct that would be unforgivable in the case of another employee. The result was to immunize union activists against legitimate discipline for genuine offenses and to deprive employers of the freedom to apply their own rules uniformly to all their employees. <em>See NLRB v. Wilson Freight Co., </em>604 F.2d 712 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>592 F.2d 595 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Hubbard Regional Hospital v. NLRB, </em>579 F.2d 1251 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>NLRB v. Rich\u2019s of Plymouth, Inc., </em>578 F.2d 880 (1st. Cir. 1978); <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Co. v. NLRB, </em>536 F.2d 461 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>NLRB v. Fibers International Corp., </em>439 F.2d 1311 (1st Cir. 1971); <em>NLRB v. Billen Shoe Co., </em>397 F.2d 801 (1st Cir. 1968); <em>NLRB v. Lowell Sun Publishing Co., </em>320 F.2d 835 (1st Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">In response to the Board\u2019s handling of these cases, we have repeatedly urged the Board to go beyond the employer\u2019s obvious wish to be rid of an activist and to inquire into the question of actual cause, giving serious consideration to the employer\u2019s legitimate business reasons for discharging the employee. <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Lowell Sun, </em>320 F.2d at 841 (Aldrich, J., concurring) (employer\u2019s knowledge that discharge will have pleasing result not to be confused with actuating motive). We have expressed this concern by insisting that the Board find the protected activity to be the \u201cdominant motive\u201d for the discharge. <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Fibers International, </em>439 F.2d 1311; <em>NLRB v. Lowell Sun, </em>320 F.2d 835 (Aldrich, J., concurring); <em>NLRB v. Whitin Machine Works, </em>204 F.2d 883, 885 (1st Cir. 1953) (reinstatement warranted if protected activity \u201cweighed more heavily\u201d than other factors); and cases cited in these opinions. Elaborating on the meaning of this test, we have held that the Board may order reinstatement only after finding that the discharge would not have occurred in the absence of the protected activity. <em>NLRB v. Fibers International, </em>439 F.2d at 1312 n.1 &amp; 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mt. Healthy v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471, followed by <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979), seemed to us to lend strong support to our analysis in the <em>Fibers International </em>case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>In cases since <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>we have relied on its expression of the \u201cbut for\u201d standard, abandoning our earlier \u201cdominant motive\u201d language. <em>Statler Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>644 F.2d 902 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666, 671 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>Coletti\u2019s Furniture, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>550 F.2d 1292 (1st Cir. 1977). We came to recognize that the existence or not of a causal link between union activity and the employee\u2019s injury \u2014 or, as section 8(a)(3) puts it, the existence of anti-union \u201cdiscrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment\u201d \u2014 was most accurately determined by asking whether the discharge would have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the protected activity. If the discharge would have occurred <em>absent </em>the protected activity, it is clear no unfair practice existed since a bad motive without effect is no more an unfair labor practice than an unex-ecuted evil intent is a crime. While <em>Mt. Healthy </em>involved employee activity protected by the Constitution rather than by the NLRA, it presented issues of causation, harm and remedy very similar to those raised in the labor context, and the Court expressed the same concerns that we have voiced in labor cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The lower court in <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>like the Board in past labor cases, had ordered reinstatement on a finding that the protected activity was one of two reasons for the decision to discharge the employee. The Court\u2019s dissatisfaction with this result was exactly what ours had been: that the employee who engaged in protected conduct would thereby be placed in a better position than he would have held if he had not done so, and his employer\u2019s freedom to apply legitimate performance standards would be impaired by the activist\u2019s favored position. <em>Id., </em>429 U.S. at 285-87, 97 S.Ct. at 575-76. To avoid these results while protecting the employee\u2019s rights, the Court ruled that reinstatement should be ordered only upon a finding that the employee would not have been discharged but for the protected conduct. In labor cases, as in constitutional cases, we think the \u201cbut for\u201d test is the correct substantive standard for evaluating the propriety of a reinstatement order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Wright Line does not appear to quarrel with this substantive test. Its challenge is to the Board\u2019s apparent adoption of <em>Mt. Healthy\u2019s </em>allocation of the burdens of proof. <em>Mt. Healthy </em>held that once the plaintiff had shown his protected activity to have been a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmotivating\u201d factor, \u201cthe court should have gone on to determine whether the Board [of Education] had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent\u2019s reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576. <em>See also Givhan v. Western Line, </em>439 U.S. at 416, 99 S.Ct. at 697. Wright Line contends, citing section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Board\u2019s regulation 101.-10(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the Board lacks authority to place any burden of proof on the employer. Wright Line argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>these provisions require the Board to prove the employer\u2019s guilt by a preponderance of the evidence, and that the Board\u2019s burden-shifting approach instead requires the employer to prove his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We have no difficulty accepting the Board\u2019s formulation that <em>some </em>kind of a \u201cburden\u201d devolves upon the employer once the general counsel has made a prima facie showing that protected conduct was a motivating or substantial factor in the discharge decision. 251 NLRB No. 150, at 20-21. Indeed, in <em>Statler Industries v. NLRB, </em>this court approved the general causation analysis expressed in the Board\u2019s Wright Line opinion. 644 F.2d at 905. On further reflection, however, we disagree with the Board on the narrow issue of defining the exact nature of the burden which the employer thus acquires. Section 10(c), as well as the Board\u2019s own regulation, make clear that the general counsel must prove the employer\u2019s guilt by a preponderance of the evidence to warrant a finding that an unfair labor practice has occurred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think the only burden which may be acceptably placed on the employer is a \u201cburden of production,\u201d that is a burden of coming forward with credible evidence to rebut or meet the general counsel\u2019s prima facie case. This, in effect,, is the position we took recently in other cases although without actually characterizing the employer\u2019s burden as one of \u201cproduction\u201d rather than \u201cpersuasion.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Amber Delivery Service, </em>651 F.2d 57 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1981). We said in those cases that once the general counsel has established a basis for finding an improper motive, the employer must merely, \u201ccome forward with enough evidence to convince the trier of fact that, under the circumstances, there is no longer a preponderance of evidence establishing a violation.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Amber Delivery Service, </em>651 F.2d at 69; <em>NLRB v. Cable Vision, </em>660 F.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Professor Wigmore distinguishes between the burden of rebutting a prima facie case and the burden of persuading the trier of fact on the ultimate issue in a case by a preponderance of the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaQ\">\u201c[A] \u2018prima facie\u2019 case . . . need not be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, or by evidence of greater weight; but the evidence needs only to be balanced, put in equipoise, by some evidence worthy of credence; and, if this be done, the burden of the evidence is met and the duty of producing further evidence shifts back to the party having the burden of proof .. . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">9 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2487, at 282 (3d ed. 1940), <em>quoting Speas v. Merchants' Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>188 N.C. 524, 125 S.E. 398 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Put another way, the general counsel\u2019s initial, prima facie showing creates a kind of presumption that an unfair labor practice has been committed. At this point, the employer risks losing his case unless he rebuts the presumption with evidence of his own. The Board may properly recognize this by stating that the employer (who alone has access both to the reason he discharged the employee and any corroborative evidence) now comes under a \u201cburden\u201d to produce evidence of a \u201cgood\u201d reason for the discharge. The imposition of this limited burden, however, does not shift to the employer the burden of proving that an unfair labor practice has not occurred. Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence very aptly describes the scope of the duty involved in rebutting presumptions in civil cases as \u201cthe burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption,\u201d and distinguishes this duty from \u201cthe burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 301. Thus, the employer in a section 8(a)(3) discharge case has no more than the limited duty of producing evidence to balance, not to outweigh, the evidence produced by the general counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The Board may properly provide, therefore, that \u201cOnce [a prima facie showing] is established, the burden will shift to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d 251 NLRB No. 150, at 20-21 (footnote omitted). The \u201cburden\u201d referred to, however, is a burden of going forward to meet a prima facie case, not a burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue of the existence of a violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">We recognize that the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Mt. Healthy </em>appeared to place an affirmative burden of persuasion on the .employer. We further recognize that this court\u2019s acceptance of <em>Mt. Healthy </em>in some previous cases may have suggested that we, too, saw the burden upon the employer as, in all situations, a burden of persuasion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A closer look at <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>however, indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>cates a critical difference between that case and most labor cases. This difference does not affect the substantive utility of the \u201cbut for\u201d analysis there employed, but does affect the nature of the employer\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In <em>Mt. </em>Healthy, the employer conceded that he had fired the employee for speech activity which was later found to be fully protected under the first amendment. Thus, the \u201cbut for\u201d test was not used, as it is in the typical labor case, as a part of the process of deciding whether a violation of protected rights had occurred. Rather, the \u201cbut for\u201d test applied only <em>after </em>such a violation had been proven by the employer\u2019s own admission. The employer\u2019s claim, then, was a true affirmative defense to a rehiring order \u2014 i. e., the employer contended that notwithstanding his violation of the Constitution reinstatement was improper as a remedy because the employee had also been involved in an altercation with another teacher, an argument with cafeteria employees, and an incident in which he made obscene gestures to female students. The employer argued that these incidents, which were totally independent of the protected speech activity, justified the employee\u2019s dismissal <em>notwithstanding </em>the fact that the employer had violated the employee\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The employer\u2019s claim was thus a true affirmative defense which went to the appropriateness of the remedy being applied rather than to the existence of a violation in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">By contrast, in the typical labor case (and in the present case), the employer vigorously disputes the determining reason for the discharge. These cases therefore do not involve true affirmative defenses going to the appropriateness of the remedy, nor would the \u201cbut for\u201d analysis be employed to determine the existence of such an affirmative defense. Rather, the \u201cbut for\u201d test is in such cases a convenient formula for deciding whether or not an unfair labor practice has actually <em>occurred </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>for deciding if the determining motive of the discharge was anti-union animus or some valid business reason. The \u201cbut for\u201d standard requires a determination by the Board, based on all the evidence, that, wholly apart from an alleged illegal motive, the employer would (or would not) have discharged the employee for the conduct ascribed to him by the employer. If the discharge would have taken place irrespective of the anti-union motive, no unfair labor practice took place: if the discharge would not have taken place, it is clear that the determining reason for the discharge was the protected activity, not the reason given by the employer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With respect to this ultimate question of a determining causal link between the bad motive and the discharge, the burden of persuasion remains always with the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>counsel. In the course of its inquiry, however, the Board and the ALJ are entitled to place a burden of production on the employer in the manner already described once a sufficient prima facie showing of illegal motive is made by the general counsel. <em>Cf. Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (stating that burden of persuasion on the issue of discriminatory intent in Title VII cases remains always with the plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">It may be said by way of concluding our discussion on this point that labels concerning burdens of \u201cpersuasion\u201d and \u201cproduction\u201d are not, as a practical matter, likely to be very important in most of these cases. Decision will usually turn on a weighing of all the evidence. But this weighing, under the Board\u2019s new formulation, will include a careful consideration of the employer\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d reason as well as of the general counsel\u2019s evidence of improper motive. This approach will assure that due consideration is given to all facets of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Applying these principles to Wright Line\u2019s discharge of Bernard Lamoureux, we find substantial evidence to support a conclusion by the Board, on the preponderance of the evidence, that Lamoureux was discharged because of his union activity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s finding that Wright Line violated the Act in discharging Lamoureux, and that Lamoureux is entitled to reinstatement with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">As background to the discharge, the general counsel presented evidence that Lam-oureux was a leading union advocate and that Wright Line management was aware of Lamoureux\u2019s role. The evidence showed that management was aggressive in its opposition to the union and that management\u2019s hostility was on occasion directed at Lamoureux in particular.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The general counsel also presented evidence of the circumstances surrounding the discharge itself. These circumstances, taken together and in the light of this background, support the Board\u2019s inference that the company was watching Lamoureux for any transgression that might provide an opportunity for discharge, and that it seized on Lamoureux\u2019s otherwise trivial offense to effectuate its true purpose of getting rid of an activist.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>The evidence showed that Southard asked Forte to check on Lamoureux, who was entering the men\u2019s room with a newspaper, even though this conduct violated no company rule and even though Lamoureux had no history of laxity to warrant suspicion. Forte\u2019s \u201cchecking\u201d consisted of measuring and documenting Lamoureux\u2019s absence; it did not include looking in the men\u2019s room or paging Lamoureux, even though Lamour-eux\u2019s job was such that he might have been absent for a legitimate purpose. When Forte found Lamoureux after another absence later in the day, he did not ask for an explanation, although he apparently considered the absence significant enough to merit recording. From these facts, the Board could reasonably infer that Southard and Forte were primarily interested in building a case against Lamoureux rather than simply assuring that he attend properly to his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The events following Forte\u2019s review of Lamoureux\u2019s time report also support the inference of impropriety. Rather than confronting Lamoureux directly, as might be expected of a supervisor who discovers an apparent transgression by an otherwise satisfactory long term employee, Forte immediately consulted higher officials. These managers\u2019 first response was that the offense was \u201cdischargeable\u201d; they made the decision to discharge Lamoureux even before discussing the matter with him. By the time Lamoureux was called in, Forte had prepared his final paycheck and drafted a memorandum for the file. When Lam-oureux finally received a chance to explain, his defense apparently fell on deaf ears. He conveyed no inability or unwillingness to make accurate time reports; rather his response suggested that he had not done so because he had not considered it important, and that he would do so if desired. Nevertheless, he was not warned or reprimanded, but discharged. From this and other evidence, mentioned hereinafter, the Board could' reasonably infer that the inaccurate time report was seized upon to justify action taken for another reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">This inference might have been overcome had there been evidence establishing that Wright Line would have fired employees in Lamoureux\u2019s position (whether or not union activists) for this sort of infraction. For example, it might have been proven that Wright Line was a consistently strict employer who commonly fired employees for rule violations no more serious than this, or else that this was in fact a violation very detrimental to its business which warranted discharge. Had this been done \u2014 had it been established that apart from union activity, Lamoureux would have been discharged for making such a time report \u2014 a finding for the employer would have been indicated.- But no such conclusion was required on this record. Wright Line relies on its rule against \u201cknowingly altering or falsifying production time reports.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It emphasizes its use of Daily Activity Reports to verify performance of inspections, to evaluate individual inspectors, and to monitor staffing levels. But the Board concluded, with ample support in the record, that the time of each inspection, as opposed to the fact that each was done and the number done in a day, had no bearing on any of these calculations and received no notice from management. Lamoureux testified, and the Board was entitled to believe, that he had never been instructed to record times exactly, that he had never heard of any employee being criticized for inaccurate reporting of times, and that the general practice among inspectors was to record times in \u201cround figures.\u201d The Board could conclude from the evidence that Lamour-eux\u2019s offense affected no significant inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>est of his employer, and no interest that Wright Line had treated as significant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Wright Line asserts that Lamoureux\u2019s \u201cfalsehood\u201d proved him untrustworthy, and therefore unworthy of the reliance it must place on its inspectors. Clearly a showing of dishonesty would cause most employers to discharge an employee. The Board could reasonably doubt, however, that an employer would lose its trust in such a long term, satisfactory employee on the basis of an inaccuracy that cost the employer nothing and gained the employee nothing. Lamour-eux\u2019s time report, under these circumstances, suggests no intention to falsify; at worst it demonstrates carelessness on a matter of little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Further, the evidence showed that Wright Line\u2019s past practice in handling similar offenses had been quite different. The Administrative Law Judge found, based on testimony regarding the time required to perform inspections, that reports submitted by other inspectors contained \u201ceasily discernible\u201d inaccuracies; yet no other inspector was ever disciplined in any way for inaccurate time reports. There was also evidence of an incident in which Wright Line\u2019s Chief Inspector had another employee punch her time card, a violation of the same rule. <em>See </em>note 15, <em>supra. </em>Even though such conduct strongly suggests deliberate falsification to cover an unexcused absence at the employer\u2019s expense, the Chief Inspector received only a warning; she was not discharged. There was evidence that Wright Line had discharged two employees for dishonesty, but both instances involved conduct amounting to outright theft from the company. One of these employees, an accountant, had embezzled funds, while the other, a salesman, had falsified his reports so as to collect unearned commissions. On this evidence, the Board was warranted in perceiving a difference between Wright Line\u2019s responses to Lam-oureux\u2019s offense and its handling of comparable incidents of misconduct. The Board could reasonably infer from this that some other factor was involved in Lamoureux\u2019s case; and the background of Lamoureux\u2019s activism and the company\u2019s animus could be thought to supply the missing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Further support for the Board\u2019s conclusion as to Wright Line\u2019s motivation comes from the ALJ\u2019s credibility judgments. To rebut the inference of improper motive, Wright Line presented the testimony of three of the officials involved in the discharge. Each related his own view of the incident, denying any concern for Lamour-eux\u2019s \u201cuntrustworthiness,\u201d as shown by his false time report. The AU stated that, from the demeanor of the witnesses as well as from \u201cthe record as a whole ... I do not believe that they were truthful in revealing the \u2018real reason\u2019 for Lamoureux\u2019s discharge.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Forte\u2019s testimony is particularly specific. He found that Forte appeared generally honest, until questioned about Lamoureux\u2019s discharge. \u201cHere, being a generally truthful man, he showed physical signs of disassembling.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s credibility judgments must stand unless they are unreasonable, which these are not. Under these circumstances, the witnesses\u2019 untruthfulness strengthens the inference of unlawful motive. <em>Shattuck Denn Mining Corp. v. NLRB, </em>362 F.2d 466, 470 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">On this record, the Board was justified in finding that the general counsel had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Wright Line discharged Lamoureux because of his union activity in violation of section 8(a)(3) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">\n<em>The petition for enforcement is granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">.

The Board relied on <em>NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, </em>388 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1967), in which the Court held that \u201conce it has been proved that the employer engaged in discriminatory conduct which would have adversely affected employee rights to some extent, the burden is upon the employer to establish that he was motivated by legitimate objectives since proof of motivation is most accessible to him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 34, 87 S.Ct. at 1797. <em>Great Dane, </em>which involved a challenge to an overall policy of the employer rather than to a single discharge, is inapposite here. Where an overall policy concededly does discriminate against protected activity, the Board must balance the employer\u2019s justification against the employee\u2019s interest, and it may fairly require the employer to demonstrate the genuineness and strength of its asserted business reason. But here the issue is whether the discharge was in fact discriminatory \u2014 whether it was caused by protected activity or whether some other factor was operative. <em>Great Dane </em>has no application. <em>See </em>L. Janofsky, \u201cNew Concepts in Interference and Discrimination under the NLRA,\u201d 70 Colum.L.Rev. 81, 96 (1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">The Board also invokes the portion of section 10(c) quoted at the beginning of this section, regarding discharges for cause, citing Congress\u2019 rejection, in drafting this provision, of proposed language barring reinstatement unless the \u201cweight of the evidence shows that such individual was not suspended or discharged for cause.\u201d H.R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 10 (1947). Quoting passages from debate on this provision, the Board argues that Congress intended to keep the burden of showing cause where Congress understood that it had been \u2014 on the employer. 93 Cong..Rec. 6518-19 (remarks of Senator Taft); 93 Cong. Rec. 7529 (remarks of Senator Ball). Wright Line argues, citing other passages of debate and quoting the Conference Report on the bill, that Congress did indeed intend to keep the burden where it was \u2014 on the Board. H.R.Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 55 (1947); 93 Cong.Rec. 6518-19 (colloquy between Senators Taft and Pepper). We find the legislative history as well as the statutory language inconclusive on the question of burden of proof. This provision of section 10(c) served to reaffirm the substantive standard that was already implicit in section 8(a)(3) and that we have repeatedly urged on the Board: reinstatement is not warranted if the discharge was actually the result of \u201ccause\u201d rather than of unlawful discrimination, even though \u201ccause\u201d might coincide with union activity to which the employer is hostile. <em>See NLRB v. Eastern Massachusetts Street Ry. Co., </em>235 F.2d 700, 709 (1st Cir. 1956) (\u201cThe purpose of this provision is to make it abundantly clear that the Board is not to interfere with the exercise by employers of their traditional right to discharge employees for adequate cause.\u201d). The question of burden of proof is addressed only in the \u201cpreponderance\u201d language of the preceding sentence of section 10(c); that provision requires the general counsel to prove the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b899-10\">. The Board appears to recognize that the general counsel must always establish the existence of an unfair labor practice by a preponderance of the evidence, but then confuses the issue by mislabeling the employer\u2019s burden as an \u201caffirmative defense.\" 251 NLRB No. 150, at 18 n.ll. The employer\u2019s duty, however, is merely a burden of producing rebuttal evidence and thus in no way resembles a true affirmative defense. Moreover, the Board\u2019s reference to its own \u201cprima facie case\u201d may suggest that the general counsel should prevail upon a showing of something less than a preponderance of evidence that the counsel\u2019s version of disputed facts is the true one. Let there be no mistake here either. The burden of persuasion on all issues of disputed fact rests at all times with the general counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">. <em>Statler Industries, </em>644 F.2d 902 (1st Cir. 1981), for example, suggested that an employer in a section 8(a)(3) discharge case bears the burden of persuasion in proving that there would have been no discharge but for an employee\u2019s protected activity. <em>Id., </em>at 905 n.4. On this narrow issue regarding the burden of proof, we disaffirm our previous ruling and adopt the analysis set forth in this opinion. Also, to the extent that <em>NLRB v. Eastern Smelting &amp; Refining Corp., </em>598 F.2d 666 (1st Cir. 1979), can be read to impose a burden of proof on the employer, it, too, is hereby overruled. Nevertheless, we do hold that the Board is justified, after a prima facie showing by the general counsel, in requiring the employer to produce evidence showing \u201cthat it had a good reason, sufficient in itself, to produce the discharge.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 671.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b900-5\">. A similar claim might, on rare occasions, be raised in some labor cases. For example, where an employer fires a person for union activity, in clear violation of section 8(a)(3), but a few days later discovers the employee had, unknown to anyone, been embezzling money, the employer may be justifiably required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a reinstatement order for his unfair labor practice is inappropriate. The employer there is not defending on the ground that the discharge was properly motivated, but rather on the theory that, notwithstanding the commission of an unfair labor practice, he should not have to take the particular person back. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Savin Business Machines Corp., </em>649 F.2d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 1981) (employee\u2019s participation in robbery after unlawfully motivated discharge would have great bearing on right to reinstatement). It should be emphasized, however, that this is the rare case. Typically, employers and the general counsel point to the same or to related evidence and ascribe different inferences of motivation. In this more normal situation, the general counsel must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer had an illegal motivation <em>and </em>that the employer would not have fired the employee anyway for a valid business reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">. Our disagreement with the Board may reduce to this: the Board apparently feels that the Act is violated by a showing of anti-union sentiment in connection with a discharge. It would then impose an affirmative defense upon the employer to negate the violation. In our view, by contrast, the Act is violated only when an employer with anti-union animus discharges an employee he would not have fired \u201cbut for\u201d the employee\u2019s union activity. We think that even employers who do not particularly like unions nevertheless comply with the law so long as they treat all their employees \u2014 union and non-union \u2014 alike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. Although the Board arrived at its conclusion by the use of a standard with which, in some respects, we disagree, we see no reason to remand this case for new findings. The ALJ in this case conclusively found that the company\u2019s alleged legitimate reason for discharging Lamoureux \u201chas no validity at all\u201d and \u201cwas false.\u201d There is substantial evidence to support these findings. Moreover, the company here, unlike the school boards in <em>Mt. Healthy </em>and <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 693 (1979), did not allege a series of wholly distinct events, some of which were unrelated to protected activity and which might \u201cadmit of the argument\u201d that the employer would have discharged Lamoureux despite his union activity. <em>Id., </em>at 417 n.5, 99 S.Ct. at 697 n.5. Thus, no remand is necessary in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b901-8\">. There was testimony that the company distributed reproductions of newspaper articles derogatory to the Teamsters Union, including one article relating the murder indictment of an official of another Teamsters local. There was also evidence of a letter to employees in which the company president stated that Wright Line\u2019s \u201cchances for survival and growth would be seriously hurt by the presence of a union,\u201d and evidence of three incidents during the 1977 campaign involving Lamoureux. On one such occasion, Supervisor Forte called Lamoureux to his office and charged him with \u201cpressuring someone to vote union\u201d; Forte later retracted the statement. On another occasion, Forte saw Lamoureux counting his pay and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Union campaign funds?\u201d In a third incident, a foreman told Lamoureux that \u201cEverybody knows you\u2019re the union kingpin.\u201d Wright Line contends that the Board\u2019s reliance on these incidents is improper, since the Board has not alleged that any of them involved an unfair labor practice by the company, and since some may involve expression protected by the first amendment. We have held, however, that anti-union statements \u201cplainly within [management\u2019s] rights ... do lend a significance to otherwise ambiguous events when the question is whether a given course of conduct was actuated by anti-union animus.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Lowell Sun, </em>320 F.2d at 840. The incidents cited, whether lawful or not, do not prove that Lam-oureux was discharged because of his union activity. But they do show that the company knew of his activity and was displeased by it; they thus provide a relevant background for analyzing the circumstances of the discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b902-5\">. The rule, which also prohibits falsifying \u201cpayroll records, or punching another employee\u2019s timecard without supervisory approval,\u201d provides that a first infraction \u201cmay\u201d be punished by discharge or by any lesser disciplinary infraction, such as suspension or a warning. Of course, where an employer enforces a valid rule in an even-handed manner, there is usually no violation of the Act. <em>See Texas Instruments </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>637 F.2d 822 (1st Cir. 1981) (finding that employee violation of valid rule prohibiting disclosure of confidential information justified discharge because such activity is not protected by section 7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\">. It is, of course, the employer\u2019s judgment of the importance of time records, and not the Board\u2019s judgment or our own, that matters. An employer is entitled to make and enforce his own rules, however foolish they may appear to the Board, as long as he does not base personnel decisions on union status. <em>See, e. g., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. NLRB, </em>592 F.2d at 603. Nevertheless, where the issue is what motivated a decision to discharge, the apparent insignificance of a particular rule, along with the employer\u2019s history of treating it as unimportant, support an inference that something more was involved than just a breach of that rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
