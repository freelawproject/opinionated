The clear answer is that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Alice Bobo, a black woman, brought this action against her former employer ITT, Continental Baking Company (ITT). She alleged that ITT discharged her because she had refused to wear a hat that co-employees allegedly were not required to wear. She also averred that prior to her firing, she had been the victim of other discriminatory employment conditions because of her race and sex. Bobo sought relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Upon motion by ITT, partial summary judgment was entered against Bobo by the district court. The court ruled that Bobo\u2019s Title VII claim was barred because of her failure to sue within 90 days of receipt of her right to sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f). The court also held that since \u00a7 1981 did not reach claims of sex discrimination, Bobo was entitled to a trial only on the issue of whether she had been subjected to racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-20\">At trial the court, sitting without a jury, heard accounts of Bobo\u2019s tumultuous employment history with ITT. Bobo was originally hired as a bread sales representative, requiring that she drive a company truck to retail outlets to sell and stock ITT\u2019s baked goods. While serving in this capacity, she was reprimanded by her superiors for unauthorized absence from work and for failure to remove stale products from store shelves. She also was compelled to reimburse ITT for shortages in the proceeds she collected from bread sales. After ninety days as a sales representative, Bobo requested a transfer to a job inside ITT\u2019s plant. She testified that her request was prompted by racially discriminatory remarks made by supervisory personnel. The district court chose not to credit this testimony, since it contradicted a deposition she had given three years earlier disclaiming the notion that her supervisors\u2019 attitudes toward her were influenced by a racial animus. Although Bobo also claimed that fellow em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ployees harassed her with pranks, the court found that ITT had neither known of nor condoned such employee conduct. The court also observed that the evidence suggested that even Bobo believed the pranks were directed at her sex, not her race.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Bobo\u2019s request was honored and she was transferred to a position as a sanitation worker inside ITT\u2019s plant. Here she was reprimanded for tardiness, interference with a fellow employee\u2019s work, and use of a work area during break time. Ultimately, when she refused to wear a hard-shelled safety hat to protect her from objects that might fall from overhead conveyor belts, she was discharged for insubordination. Although she contended that other employees were not compelled to wear the safety hats, she admitted that some of these employees were black. The court in addition found that only employees who worked in areas with a risk of falling objects were forced to wear safety hats. The court found that ITT\u2019s policy was to dismiss insubordinate employees and that this policy was evenly applied. Concluding that Bobo\u2019s unacceptable behavior, not ITT\u2019s racial discrimination led to her dismissal, the court entered judgment for ITT.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On appeal, Bobo attacks the district court\u2019s findings of fact as well as its determination that sex discrimination is not cognizable under \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>Sex Discrimination Under \u00a7 1981</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">Section 1981 generally forbids racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts, including private employment contracts, whether the aggrieved party is black or white. <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); <em>McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., </em>427 U.S. 273, 295, 96 S.Ct. 2574, 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 493 (1976); <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, </em>421 U.S. 454, 459-60, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1719-20, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). The statute also reaches claims of racial discrimination in admission to private institutions, at least where such institutions purport to be open to the public. <em>Runyon v. McCrary, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 172-73, 96 S.Ct. at 2595-96; <em>Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., </em>410 U.S. 431, 440-41, 93 S.Ct. 1090, 1095, 35 L.Ed.2d 403 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Although \u00a7 1981 strikes at many forms of racial discrimination, no court has held that allegations of gender based discrimination fall within its purview. Courts at every level of the federal judiciary have considered the question and reached the opposite result. The Supreme Court, in framing the question for decision in <em>Runyon, </em>explained that the case did not involve \u201cthe right of a private school to limit its student body to boys, to girls, or to adherents of a particular religious faith, since 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 is in no way addressed to such categories of selectivity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>427 U.S. at 167, 96 S.Ct. at 2593. Even if we were to heed Bobo\u2019s invitation to regard this statement as dictum and therefore not dispositive of the issue, we could not ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent emphasis on the racial character of \u00a7 1981, as indicated by the law\u2019s language and legislative history. The Court has interpreted the phrase \u201cas is enjoyed by white citizens ...\u201d in \u00a7 1981 as reflecting its drafters\u2019 intention that the statute ban racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The Court\u2019s view of the 1866 Act\u2019s purpose was expressed in <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966), which construed its removal provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In examining the legislative history, the Court noted that the \u201cwhite citizens\u201d language was not a part of the original Senate bill, but was added later \u201capparently to emphasize the racial character of the rights being protected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, 86 S.Ct. at 1789. The Court considered the legislative history of the 1866 Act and concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that it \u201cclearly indicates that Congress intended to protect a limited category of rights, specifically defined in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two terms later, while determining the breadth of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in <em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968), the Court repeatedly referred to the 1866 Act\u2019s aim of eliminating racial discrimination. The Court observed that unlike the Fair Housing Title (Title VIII) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, \u00a7 1982 was addressed only to racial discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 88 S.Ct. at 2189. \u2022 Finally, in perhaps its most extensive discussion of the legislative history of the 1866 Act, the Court reaffirmed the limits on \u00a7 1981 in <em>McDonald. </em>Though extending the statute\u2019s protection to claims of racial discrimination by whites, the Court ruled that the 1866 Act\u2019s goal was to promote equality among the races by precluding discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts either for or against any particular race. <em>McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., supra, </em>427 U.S. at 295, 96 S.Ct. at 2586.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Bobo nevertheless argues that the term \u201cwhite citizens\u201d should be deemed synonymous with \u201cmost favored group,\u201d thereby permitting those who find themselves somehow less favored to advance discrimination charges under \u00a7 1981. A sweeping interpretation of this sort, however, would thwart the statute\u2019s evident meaning and purpose. As the Supreme Court has explained, Congress enacted \u00a7 1 of the 1866 Act with the ambitious goal of ensuring equal citizenship for the newly freed slaves. Statements in the legislative history, carefully reviewed in <em>McDonald, </em>reflect this objective and confirm that the \u201cwhite citizens\u201d language was added specifically to preclude a construction that might expand the statute\u2019s coverage to other groups. Representative Wilson, who proposed amending the original bill to add the \u201cwhite citizens\u201d language, stated that \u201cthe reason for offering [the amendment] was this: it was thought by some persons that unless these qualifying words were incorporated in the bill, those rights might be extended to all citizens, whether male or female, majors or minors.\u201d Cong. Globe, 39th Congress., 1st Sess., App. 157. (1866). A supporter of the bill, Representative Shallabarger, expressed the sentiments of his colleagues when he remarked that \u201c[i]ts whole effect is to require that whatever rights . . . the States may confer upon one race or color of the citizens shall be held by all races in equality. Your State may deprive women of the right to sue or contract or testify, and children from doing the same. But if you do so, or do not so as to one race, you shall treat the other likewise .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Bobo further contends that since women obviously lacked equal legal rights during the Reconstruction era, \u201cwhite citizens\u201d should be read as \u201cwhite men.\u201d But as the legislative history quoted above indicates, Congress meant precisely what it said. The drafters of \u00a7 1981 had no intention to disturb public or private authority to discriminate against women.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Outlawing such discrimination in the United States in 1866 would have signaled an extraordinary social transformation, a result clearly not desired by Congress. Public sensitivity to the ills of gender discrimination is of more recent origin. <em>See, e. g., </em>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq.; </em>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.; Equal Pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d). We cannot ascribe contemporary attitudes to a Congress acting over a century ago when its views to the contrary are so plainly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The question before us has been frequently considered by courts, but never resolved in the manner sought by Bobo herein. A panel of this court in <em>Willingham </em>v. <em>Macon Telegraph Publishing Co., </em>482 F.2d 535, 537 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1973) ruled that sex discrimination was not cognizable under \u00a7 1981. The panel opinion was vacated en banc, however, a majority of the court viewing the case as not involving sex discrimination, but discrimination based upon grooming standards. Thus, there is no direct holding by this court that gender based discrimination is not within the acts forbidden by \u00a7 1981. At least two other circuits, however, have so held. <em>Movement for Opportunity and Equality v. General Motors Corp., </em>622 F.2d 1235, 1278 (7th Cir. 1980) (adopting district court opinion); <em>DeGraf-fenreid v. General Motors Assembly Div., St. Louis, </em>558 F.2d 480, 486 n. 2 (8th Cir. 1977). A procession of district court opinions is in agreement with this view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In cases not presenting sex discrimination complaints, this court also has stated that \u00a7 1981 applies only to race. <em>Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1196 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Campbell v. Gadsden County District School Board, </em>534 F.2d 650, 653-54 n. 8 (5th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Bobo cites <em>Guerra v. Manchester Terminal Corp., </em>498 F.2d 641 (5th Cir. 1974) in support of a broader reading of \u00a7 1981. In <em>Guerra </em>a Mexican citizen lawfully residing in the United States complained that he was the victim of discrimination as a result of a collective bargaining agreement which targeted American citizens for more desirable jobs. The court held that \u00a7 1981 reached charges of discrimination based on alienage by private employers. In light of <em>Runyon </em>and <em>McDonald, </em>discussed above, we have previously characterized <em>Guerra </em>as a broad construction of \u00a7 1981 in a case with \u201cstrong racial overtones.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Gadsden County District School Board, supra, </em>534 F.2d at 653-54 n. 8. Whatever vitality it may retain, <em>Guerra </em>did not propose extending \u00a7 1981 to sex discrimination, and thus lends no support to Bobo\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>In the face of seemingly unambiguous statutory language, emphatic contemporaneous statements by legislators and an unbroken tide of case law rejecting Bobo\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the district court properly held that sex discrimination is not cognizable under \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>Bobo\u2019s Other Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In her pro se brief, Bobo generally asserts error in the district court\u2019s findings of fact. As outlined above, the court found neither disparate racial impact nor discriminatory purpose in ITT\u2019s actions. The court further found that ITT terminated Bobo because of her repeated failure to abide by company rules. With ample support in the record, these findings readily pass muster as not clearly erroneous. <em>Grigsby v. North Mississippi Medical Center, Inc., </em>586 F.2d 457, 461 (5th Cir. 1978); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-17\">. Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-18\">\"All persons within the jurisdiction of.the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-21\">This section was adapted chiefly from \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27. Similar language is found in \u00a7 16 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 144. Section 18 of the 1870 Act also reenacted the 1866 Act. The present version is the product of the 1874 codification of federal statutory law. <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 168 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593 n. 8, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">.
