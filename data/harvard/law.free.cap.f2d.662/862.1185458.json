The matter is before this court on cross motion for summary judgment, with the diversity jurisdiction of this court invoked. The district court found for the defendant; we reverse and remand for the district court to enforce the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">The essential facts in this case are straightforward and uncontroverted. Plaintiff Chamis Tahan operates a travel agency in Jerusalem which acted as agent for the travel agency of defendant Sir John G. Hodgson until a dispute arose and the relationship ended. Plaintiff claimed that defendant owed him a sum of money for past services, but defendant denied the debt. Mediation failed and plaintiff filed suit in Israel. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney served defendant personally in Jerusalem, but defendant refused to acknowledge service on the grounds that the papers were drawn in Hebrew, a language he did not read. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney later left the complaint with defendant, who subsequently returned the papers to the attorney\u2019s office, stating that he would submit the matter to his attorney and defend the claims once he had received a \u201ccomplete translation and documentation in English.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff then obtained a default judgment against defendant in the amount of $54,114,40 plus legal fees in the amount of $3,870.00. It is this default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>judgment in Israel which plaintiff now seeks to have enforced by the courts of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">II. LEGAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Aao\">The seminal case in the area of enforcement of foreign judgments is <em>Hilton v. Guyot</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Hilton </em>found that \u201cthe merits of the case should not, in an action brought in this country upon the judgment, be tried afresh, as on a new trial or on appeal, upon the mere assertion of the party that the judgment was erroneous in law or in fact\u201d if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction, conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after <em>due citation </em>or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those of other countries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it was sitting, or fraud in procuring the judgment, or any other special reason why the comity of this nation should not allow it full effect <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Thus, requirements for enforcement of a foreign judgment expressed in <em>Hilton </em>are that there be \u201cdue citation\u201d and that the original claim not violate American public policy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that is, in the language of the <em>Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws, </em>that it not be \u201crepugnant to fundamental notions of what is decent and just in the State where enforcement is sought.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Hilton </em>also established the principle of \u201creciprocity,\u201d which requires a judgment rendered in a foreign nation to be subjected by the federal courts in this country to a reexamination on the merits if an American judgment would be given similar treatment in the foreign nation involved. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">It is not alleged that the Israeli court lacked competent jurisdiction, nor is the general integrity of the Israeli judicial system questioned, nor is it alleged that the judgment rendered in this case was fraudulent. Therefore, the legal issues raised in this case reduce to three. First, was there \u201cdue citation\u201d of defendant? That is, was there effective service of process? Second, would enforcement of this default judgment be \u201crepugnant to fundamental notions of what is decent and just\u201d in the United States? And, third, what applicability does the doctrine of reciprocity have to this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">We shall consider each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">A. <em>Effective Service of Process </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">In a default judgment, it is essential that there have been effective service of process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>That requirement seems clearly to have been met here. While the effectiveness of some forms of process is debatable, personal service is almost always acceptable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Even if defendant were unable to read Hebrew, he should have surmised that the papers being served upon him were legal in nature, and that he could ignore them only at his peril. In fact, it is certain that he was cognizant of the fact that the papers served upon him were legal in nature. The parties had, after all, been involved in a heated legal dispute for several months, making charges and countercharges against one another and rendering accounts and counteraccounts. Defendant acknowledges in his brief that when he was served these legal papers in October 1979, the gentleman presenting him the papers \u201cclaim[ed] to be an attorney.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further reflecting the official or legal nature of the papers were the facts that the attorney serving them, Mr. Levy, sought to have defendant affix his signature to them and that the papers themselves were printed forms. Defendant at the time requested Mr. Levy to meet with him instead at the United States Consulate, \u201cwhere matters might be more appropriately handled.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Again, this request seems consistent only with a recognition of the legal nature of the dispute, of Mr. Levy\u2019s visit, and \u2014 therefore\u2014of the papers Mr. Levy had given defendant. Prior to the default judgment, defendant sent a letter to the person who had presented himself as an attorney, addressed to Mr. Levy\u2019s \u201cLaw Office,\u201d and stating that \u201con receipt of complete translation and documentation in English sent to this address, they [the papers] will be turned over to our <em>attorneys </em>who, in turn, will respond to whatever <em>complaints </em>are detailed therein.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A letter a week earlier, similarly addressed to Mr. Levy\u2019s \u201cLaw Office,\u201d read that \u201cas soon as we receive the necessary papers with English translations in Washington DC our <em>attorneys </em>will respond.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is, moreover, inconsistent for defendant to claim, as he does on the one hand, that he had been denied effective service of process while on the other hand claiming that \u201c[t]here can be no doubt that [defendant] Appellee had every intention to defend the Israeli action, and that such intention was conveyed to [plaintiff] Appellant.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Therefore, we conclude that defendant had indeed received effective service of process. As a man who had done business in Israel for some years, he seems to have been singularly insensitive to the problem he faced by means of his having been personally served with process in Israel. He showed bad judgment in not putting the matter in the hands of an Israeli lawyer. It would be insulting were we to require that the Israeli legal machinery adapt itself by translating the official language of that country, Hebrew, into any defendant\u2019s language.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>B. <em>Public Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The district court\u2019s memorandum opinion <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> found for the defendant in the case at hand because, it reasoned, enforcement of the Israeli default judgment would violate American public policy in two ways. First, it would be inconsistent with Rule 55(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that under certain circumstances a so-called \u201csecond\u201d notice must be given at least three days prior to hearing and application for entry of default. Second, insofar as the Israeli judgment was entered against defendant <em>personally </em>rather than upon defendant\u2019s <em>corporation, </em>it would violate American public policy against piercing the corporate veil in the absence of \u201ccompelling justification.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While these arguments are by no means unreasonable, we believe that plaintiff should prevail here in the enforcement of the Israeli judgment. We believe that for the reasons outlined below, American public policy will not be violated by enforcement of the Israeli judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">With respect to the fact that Israeli procedure was inconsistent with Rule 55(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we think that it would be a mistake to find failure to follow the Federal Rules by a foreign nation to be <em>ipso facto </em>a violation of American public policy. It would be unrealistic for the United States to require all foreign judicial systems to adhere to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Obviously, all foreign judgments will be inconsistent to some extent with the Federal Rules; many state court judgments are, for that matter. Surely a more important discrepancy than this is necessary to create a violation of public policy. We do not find the Israeli court\u2019s failure to provide second notice three days prior to hearing an application for entry of default to be so \u201crepugnant to fundamental notions of what is decent and just\u201d that American public policy requires non-enforcement of the subsequent judgment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>With respect to the argument that enforcement of this judgment would violate the American policy against holding corporate officers personally liable for corporate debts, it should be pointed out that Israel also has a policy against lightly piercing the corporate veil.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s arguments against holding him, rather than his corporation, liable could have and should have been made in Israel. He cannot fail to contest the Israeli plaintiff and then declare that he would have won. Our examination of the record, moreover, convinces us that the Israeli court\u2019s decision to pierce the corporate veil is not \u201crepugnant\u201d under the facts of this case, particularly when it is borne in mind that defendant did not present a case at all.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7BV\">C. <em>The Reciprocity Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"ap7-dedup-0\">It is unlikely that reciprocity is any longer a federally mandated requirement for enforcement of foreign judgments<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>that the District of Columbia itself has such a requirement that this court is obliged to follow.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The logical rule would seem to be that, in the absence of an action by the legislature, the courts should refrain from creating or resurrecting a reciprocity doctrine. The issue of how best to respond to a foreign nation\u2019s scrutinization of an American judgment is, after all, a political one. Moreover, notwithstanding <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the issue seems to be national rather than state.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Even assuming that reciprocity is required by either the federal government or the District of Columbia, we would still enforce the Israeli judgment since Israel in all probability <em>would </em>enforce a similar American judgment and thus meets the reciprocity criterion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Israel provides for enforcement of foreign judgments by a statute, which reads in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">in dealing with and for the purposes of a matter within its jurisdiction, a court or tribunal in Israel may recognize a foreign judgment even if subsection (a) [providing for recognition of foreign judgments where an agreement with a foreign state specifically so mandates] does not apply to it, if it considers it lawful and just to do so.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Israeli courts have indeed ruled that a party with a foreign judgment may, if it wishes, bring a suit on the foreign judgment in a local Israeli court and obtain an Israeli judgment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">As commerce becomes increasingly international in character, it is essential that businessmen recognize and respect the laws of those foreign nations in which they do business. They cannot expect foreign tribunals to have one set of laws for their own citizens and another, more favorable, set for the citizens of other countries. It is also essential that American courts recognize and respect the judgments entered by foreign courts to the greatest extent consistent with our own ideals of justice and fair play. Unfettered trade, good will among nations, and a vigorous and stable international\u2014 and national \u2014 economy demand no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">We find enforcement of the Israeli judgment to be required by these goals and American precedent. The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-13\">. Letter from John G.

Nor is it violative of American public policy to enforce a judgment which includes the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiff. There are of course many countries which do not follow the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d and, instead, require that the losing side in a lawsuit pay the attorneys\u2019 fees of the winner. Given the fact that this practice is followed in many civilized and advanced foreign judicial systems, and the fact that even the American judicial system occasionally awards attorneys\u2019 fees, we think that enforcement of this part of the Israeli court\u2019s judgment is appropriate.

Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), to apply the rule of the state in which they sit as to the measure of respect that should \u2018be accorded the judgment of a foreign nation. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 98, Comment e (1971). It is certainly true that some state courts, notably those of New York, have expressly rejected the <em>Hilton </em>requirement of reciprocity and extended recognition to judgments of foreign nations without regard to any question of reciprocity. Cases and statutes rejecting or undermining the doctrine of federally mandated reciprocity include: <em>Somportex Ltd. v. Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corp., </em>453 F.2d 435 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. <em>denied, </em>405 U.S. 1017, 92 S.Ct. 1294, 31 L.Ed.2d 479 (1972); <em>Svenska Handelsbanken v.
