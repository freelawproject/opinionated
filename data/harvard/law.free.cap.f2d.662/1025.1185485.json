He maintains that to eat anything other than raw foods would be a violation of his \u201creligion.\u201d After a careful consideration of the record in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-26\">On July 15, 1981, Frank Africa was convicted of various state offenses by a Pennsylvania court and was sentenced to serve a term of up to seven years at the State Correctional Institution at Graterford, Pennsylvania. Prior to his sentence, Africa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>had been incarcerated in Holmesburg Prison, a facility under the jurisdiction of Philadelphia County. While at Holmesburg, Africa requested and received a special diet of uncooked vegetables and fruits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Africa filed a motion for a temporary restraining order in federal district court on July 16, 1981, seeking an order either that he remain in Holmesburg for the duration of his sentence or that Graterford, upon his transfer there, be required to provide him with his dietary needs. In his pleading for relief, Africa averred that, as a Naturalist Minister for MOVE, \u201cI eat an all raw food diet in accordance with my Religious principle. To eat anything else . . . would be a direct violation of my Religion and I will not violate my Religion for anyone.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Africa\u2019s motion was assigned to Judge Hannum, who classified the matter as a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">State authorities transferred Africa from Holmesburg to Graterford on July 17, 1981. Later that same day, at Judge Hannum\u2019s request, the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia entered an order directing that Africa be returned to Holmesburg pending resolution of his request for injunctive relief. Pursuant to that order, Africa was sent back to Holmesburg on July 20 and his special diet was restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">On July 27, 1981, the district court conducted a hearing on Africa\u2019s motion, which was treated as an application for a permanent injunction, and received testimony from Africa himself, Ramona Johnson, a \u201csupporter\u201d of MOVE, and Julius T. Cuyler, the superintendent of Graterford. At the hearing, Africa acted pro se and was questioned directly by the court. Judge Han-num sought to determine, among other things, whether Africa\u2019s diet was mandated by his \u201creligion,\u201d and, if so, whether the Commonwealth could demonstrate a compelling interest sufficient to infringe upon Africa\u2019s dietary practices. Because our disposition of Africa\u2019s appeal depends so heavily upon the particular facts of this case, it will be necessary to set forth in some detail the evidence introduced in the proceeding below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Based on Africa\u2019s testimony and on materials he provided the district court, MOVE is a \u201crevolutionary\u201d organization \u201cabsolutely opposed to all that is wrong.\u201d MOVE was founded, although the record does not reveal when, by John Africa, who serves as the group\u2019s revered . \u201ccoordinator\u201d and whose teachings Frank Africa and his fellow \u201cfamily\u201d members follow. MOVE has no governing body or official hierarchy; instead, because \u201ceverything is level\u201d and \u201cthere are no ups or downs,\u201d all MOVE members, including John Africa, occupy an equivalent position within the organization. In fact, MOVE really has only \u201cone member, one family, one body\u201d since, according to Frank Africa, to talk to an individual MOVE \u201cdisciple\u201d is to \u201ctalk to everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"afc-dedup-0\">Africa also summarized what he believed to be the tenets that defined the MOVE organization. MOVE\u2019S goals, he asserted, are \u201cto bring about absolute peace, ... to stop violence altogether, to put a stop to all that is corrupt.\u201d Toward this end, Africa and other MOVE adherents are committed to a \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201cmoving,\u201d \u201cactive,\u201d and \u201cgenerating\u201d way of life. By contrast, what they alternatively refer to as \u201cthis system\u201d or \u201ccivilization\u201d is \u201cdegenerating\u201d: its air and water are \u201cperverted\u201d; its food, education, and governments are \u201cartificial\u201d; its words are \u201cgibberish.\u201d Members of MOVE shun matters \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201chazardous\u201d; they believe in \u201cusing things [but] not misusing things.\u201d Thus, according to Africa:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-10\">the air is first, but pollution is second. Water is first, but poison is second. The food is first, but the chemicals that hurt the food are second. . . . We believe in the first education, the first government, the first law. . . . This is the perception that <em>John Africa </em>has given us. The water\u2019s existence is to be drunk and <em>not </em>poisoned, the air\u2019s presence is to be breathed and <em>not </em>polluted, the food\u2019s purpose is to be eaten and <em>not </em>distorted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>The abuse that life suffers MOVE suffers the <em>same.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">MOVE endorses no existing regime or lifestyle; it yields to none in its uncompromising condemnation of a society that it views as \u201cimpure,\u201d \u201cunoriginal,\u201d and \u201cblemished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am-\">According to Africa, MOVE is a religion. In fact, he insists that \u201cjust as there is no comparison between the sun\u2019s perfection and the lightbulb\u2019s failure, there is no comparison between the absolute necessity of our belief and this system\u2019s interpretation of religion.\u201d Africa testified that MOVE members participate in no distinct \u201cceremonies\u201d or \u201crituals\u201d; instead, every act of life itself is invested with religious meaning and significance. In his words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-6\">We are practicing our religious beliefs all the time: when I run, when I put information out like I am doing now, when I eat, when I breathe. All of these things are in accordance to our religious belief. ... We don\u2019t take a date out of the week to practice our religion and leave the other days and say that we are not going to practice our religion ... It is not a one-day thing or a once-a-week thing or a monthly thing. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with time. Our religion is constant. It is as constant as breathing. . .. Every time a MOVE person opens their mouth, according to the way we believe, according to the way we do things, we are holding church.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Similarly, Africa contends that, since no one day is any more special than another, for MOVE members every day of the year can be considered a religious \u201choliday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Africa did not provide the district court with any purportedly official guidelines setting forth MOVE\u2019S religious credo. He did submit, however, a document, which he apparently authored, entitled <em>Brief to Define the Importance of MOVE\u2019S Religious Diet. </em>That document, which Africa asserts is wholly consonant with the teachings of John Africa, sets forth an elaborate explanation of the MOVE philosophical framework and consequently constitutes extremely pertinent evidence for purposes of assessing the nature of the organization. In the <em>Brief, </em>Africa contends that \u201cwhile religion is seen as a way of life, our religion is simply <em>the </em>way of life, as our religion in fact <em>is </em>life.\u201d Individuals who subscribe to the MOVE ideology must live in harmony with what is natural, or untainted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-12\">Water is <em>raw, </em>which makes it <em>pure, </em>which means it is <em>innocent, trustworthy, </em>and <em>safe, </em>which is the same as <em>God.. . . </em>Our religion is raw, our belief is pure as original, reliable as chemical <em>free </em>water, . . . nourishing as the earth\u2019s soil that connects us to food, satisfying as the air that gives breath to all life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">By rejecting the \u201cpolluted\u201d and the \u201cfraudulent,\u201d and by concentrating instead on the \u201chealthy\u201d and the \u201coriginal,\u201d men and women are put \u201cin touch with life\u2019s vibration.\u201d Africa asserts that, \u201cwhen flowing, moving along with the activity of life, . . . the less you resist the power that commands this flow the more you become forceful <em>as </em>the flow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">Central to this conception of an unadulterated existence is what Africa refers to as MOVE\u2019S \u201creligious diet.\u201d That diet is'comprised largely of raw vegetables and fruits; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MOVE members who fully adhere to the diet<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> decline to eat any foods that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>have been processed or cooked. \u201cThere is nothing unusual or special about our diet,\u201d Africa declares in his <em>Brief; </em>rather, \u201cour religious diet is common and uncomplicated because our diet is provided by <em>God </em>and already <em>done.\u201d </em>Failure to follow the diet constitutes deviation from the \u201cdirect, straight, and true\u201d and results in \u201cconfusion and disease.\u201d In part, Africa\u2019s total commitment to specific provisions appears prudently based, since he asserts that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for an individual\u2019s body to adjust to more traditional fare after it has become accustomed to natural foods. But Africa also insists that he is obligated to follow his diet:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">To take away our diet is to leave me to eat nothing, for I have <em>no </em>choice, because when given a choice between eating poison and eating nothing, I have no choice but to eat nothing, for I <em>can\u2019t </em>eat other than raw. This would be <em>suicidal </em>and suicide is against life\u2019s ministry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Africa contends that the diet, in conjunction with \u201cour founder\u2019s wisdom,\u201d transformed him from a weak, timid, and ailing being to a strong, confident, and healthy individual. \u201cOur religious diet is work, hard work, simple consistent unmechanized unscientific self-dependent work,\u201d he concludes; \u201cour religious diet is family, unity, consistency, [and] uncompromising togetherness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Dietary considerations excepted, Africa shed little light upon what, if any, ethical commandments are part and parcel of the MOVE philosophy. In response to specific questioning by the district court, Africa testified that MOVE members would be unable to serve in the armed forces, since \u201cit is impossible for us to defend this system.\u201d At the same time, though, he stressed that, from his point of view, there was nothing inconsistent in seeking judicial intervention to prevent his transfer to Graterford:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">We are taught to use anything, anything that is necessary to bring about our purpose .... I have to do whatever is necessary to get my point across, to teach people.... I am using this system as a bridge to get my purpose to people [and to get] the poor people on my side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aoot-dedup-0\">\u201cWhen you are right, you are deserving of protection,\u201d Africa declared, \u201cand everything that is in our interest is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARSn\">Africa\u2019s discussion of the MOVE organization and its dietary precepts was corroborated by the testimony of Ramona Johnson, a self-labeled \u201cMOVE supporter.\u201d Johnson testified that her \u201cbrother\u201d was \u201cordained\u201d as a naturalist minister of MOVE by John Africa, and that he is an ardent follower of his religion and its mandates. Johnson confirmed, but added little to Africa\u2019s description of the concerns that lie at the heart of the MOVE ideology. She contended that the MOVE \u201creligion is total; it encompasses every aspect of MOVE members\u2019 lives; there is nothing that is left out.\u201d And she stressed that Africa\u2019s raw food diet is both a necessary \u201cpart of\u201d and a sincere \u201creflection of\u201d his religious commitment. In support of this last observation, Johnson testified that Africa in fact had gone without food for the four day period in July when he was imprisoned at Graterford.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The final witness at the hearing in the district court was Julius T. Cuyler, the superintendent of Graterford. Cuyler testified that his institution was unwilling to meet the dietary needs of Frank Africa. He expressed concern about the possibility of \u201ca proliferation of other groups surfacing in our prison requesting special diets\u201d and warned that, were a court to grant Africa\u2019s desired relief, MOVE would attract new \u201csympathizers.\u201d Cuyler contended that the prison\u2019s cafeteria already made available to inmates a number of raw foods, such as bananas, apples, and oranges. There were practical reasons, he explained, why Graterford could not be any more accommodating in this regard: it would be \u201cquite a major problem to buy the items that are listed on this diet in the retail market\u201d; the prison\u2019s accounting system would be unable to handle such a \u201cmajor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>deviation\u201d in the procurement process; some of the foods asked for by Africa, particularly the potatoes, rice, corn, and berries, if \u201cnot kept under strict security, . . . would probably be stolen and used for other purposes,\u201d such as to \u201cmake homemade booze\u201d; accumulation of raw food might lead to a \u201crodent problem\u201d; and furnishing special diets might delay the prison\u2019s feeding process, with the result that \u201cour entire population will be deprived of just that much of recreation [time].\u201d In short, according to Cuyler, providing Africa with a raw food diet \u201ccould be the straw that could break the camel\u2019s back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">On August 21, 1981, the district court denied Africa\u2019s application for injunctive relief. <em>Africa v. State of Pennsylvania, </em>520 F.Supp. 967 (E.D.Pa.1981). In an opinion accompanying his order, Judge Hannum concluded that, because Africa\u2019s sentence was for a period of at least five years, it was not possible, under Pennsylvania law, to grant his request to serve the remainder of his term at Holmesburg.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, Africa had failed to establish that MOVE is \u201ca religion within the purview and definition of the first amendment.\u201d On the contrary, according to the district court, \u201cMOVE is merely a quasi-back-to-nature social movement of limited proportion and with an admittedly revolutionary design.\u201d As an organization, it is concerned solely with \u201cconcepts of health and a return to simplistic living.\u201d This the district court found to be more akin to a \u201csocial philosophy\u201d than to a religion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">While MOVE members may respect and respond to religious concepts, these concepts are not subsumed by the MOVE ideology. Rather MOVE exists, as do virtually all other organizations in our society, independent of religion and with separate and distinct purposes while still respecting and abiding by external religious principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Consequently, the district court concluded that both Frank Africa and MOVE itself \u201care not entitled to the first amendment protections and rights respecting the exercise of religion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Africa immediately appealed the district court\u2019s decision to this Court. On August 28, 1981, we ordered that Africa\u2019s transfer to Graterford be stayed pending determination of his appeal, which we expedited. In addition, we directed that Albert John Snite, Jr. of the Defender Association of Philadelphia be appointed counsel for Africa for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">The relevant case law in the free exercise area suggests that two threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>requirements must be met before particular beliefs, alleged to be religious in nature, are accorded first amendment protection. A court\u2019s task is to decide whether the beliefs avowed are (1) sincerely held, and (2) religious in nature, in the claimant\u2019s scheme of things. <em>United States v. Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 863, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965); <em>Callahan v. Woods, </em>658 F.2d 679 (9th Cir. Oct. 5, 1981). If either of these two requirements is not satisfied, the court need not reach the question, often quite difficult in the penological setting,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> whether a legitimate and reasonably exercised state interest outweighs the proffered first amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">It is inappropriate for a reviewing court to attempt to assess the truth or falsity of an announced article of faith. Judges are not oracles of theological verity, and the Founders did not intend for them to be declarants of religious orthodoxy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 78, 85-88, 64 S.Ct. 882, 885-87, 88 L.Ed. 1148 (1944). The Supreme Court has emphasized, however, that \u201cwhile the \u2018truth\u2019 of a belief is not open to question, there remains the significant question whether it is \u2018truly held.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at 185, 85 S.Ct. at 863.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Without some sort of required showing of sincerity on the part of the individual or organization seeking judicial protection of its beliefs, the first amendment would become \u201ca limitless excuse for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">The requirement of sincerity poses no obstacle to Africa in this case. Although the district court made no specific findings in this regard, the Commonwealth never intimated, either at the hearing below or on this appeal, that Africa\u2019s convictions, however they might be denominated, were other than deeply held and sincerely advanced. Moreover, we are persuaded from our review of the record that Africa\u2019s opinions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>especially those having to do with his diet, are \u201ctruly held\u201d within the meaning of <em>Ballard </em>and <em>Seeger.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We turn, therefore, to the second issue: whether Africa\u2019s beliefs, however sincerely possessed, are religious in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">New tasks that confront a court require more circumspection than that of determining whether a particular set of ideas constitutes a religion within the meaning of the first amendment. Judges are ill-equipped to examine the breadth and content of an avowed religion; we must avoid any predisposition toward conventional religions so that unfamiliar faiths are not branded mere secular beliefs. \u201cReligions now accepted were persecuted, unpopular and condemned at their inception.\u201d <em>United States v. Kuch, </em>288 F.Supp. 439, 443 (D.D.C.1968). Nonetheless, when an individual invokes the first amendment to shield himself or herself from otherwise legitimate state regulation, we are required to make such uneasy differentiations. In considering this appeal, then, we acknowledge that a determination whether MOVE\u2019S beliefs are religious and entitled to constitutional protection \u201cpresent[s] a most delicate question\u201d; at the same time, we recognize that \u201cthe very concept of ordered liberty precludes allowing\u201d Africa, or any other person, a blanket privilege \u201cto make his own standards on matters of conduct in which society as a whole has important interests.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 215-16, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The Supreme Court has never announced a comprehensive definition of religion for use in cases such as the present one.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There can be no doubt, however, that the Court has moved considerably beyond the wholly theistic interpretation of that term expressed in cases such as <em>Davis v. Beason, </em>133 U.S. 333, 342, 10 S.Ct. 299, 300, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890) (\u201c \u2018religion\u2019 has reference to one\u2019s views of his relations to his Creator\u201d). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), the Court recognized as religious for purposes of the Universal Military Service and Training Act an individual\u2019s \u201csincere religious beliefs,\u201d even though not theistic in nature, if \u201cbased upon a power or being, or upon a faith, to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent.\u201d 380 U.S. at 176, 85 S.Ct. at 859. A similar \u201cparalleF\u2019-belief approach was employed in <em>Welsh v. United States, </em>398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), where conscientious objector status was extended to a military conscript even though he declined to profess belief in a Supreme Being. The four Justices in <em>Welsh </em>who considered the constitutional question, in addition to the statutory issue, either expressly or implicitly defined religion to include non-theistic ideologies. <em>Id. </em>398 U.S. at 356, 90 S.Ct. at 1804 (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>398 U.S. at 367-74, 90 S.Ct. at 1810-14 (White, J., dissenting, joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart, J.); <em>see Malnak v. Yogi, </em>592 F.2d 197, 205 (3d Cir. 1979) (Adams, J., concurring). And in <em>Torcaso v. Watkins, </em>367 U.S. 488, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961), the Court struck down as a violation of the establishment clause a Maryland statute requiring public officials to declare their belief in God before taking office. Justice Black, writing for a unanimous Court, concluded that a state could not favor \u201cthose religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs\u201d; in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>footnote, he observed that a number of religious groups within the United States do not hold to theistic doctrines. <em>Id. </em>367 U.S. at 495 &amp; n.ll, 81 S.Ct. 1684 &amp; n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Drawing upon these Supreme Court cases, a number of \u2022 lower federal courts have adopted a broad, non-theistic approach to the definition-of-religion question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In considering a first amendment claim arising from a non-traditional \u201creligious\u201d belief or practice, the courts have \u201clook[ed] to the familiar religions as models in order to ascertain, by comparison, whether the new set of ideas or beliefs is confronting the same concerns, or serving the same purposes, as unquestioned and accepted \u2018religions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Malnak, supra, </em>592 F.2d at 207 (concurring opinion). In essence, the modern analysis consists of a \u201cdefinition by analogy\u201d approach. It is at once a refinement and an extension of the \u201cparallel\u201d-belief course first charged by the Supreme Court in <em>Seeger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">In conducting its inquiry in the case at bar, the district court employed what it referred to as the \u201cinherently vague definitional approach\u201d enunciated in the coneur-ring opinion in <em>Malnak, supra. Africa </em>v. <em>State of Pennsylvania, </em>520 F.Supp. 967, 970 (E.D.Pa.1981). In the <em>Malnak </em>opinion, which explicitly adopted the \u201cdefinition by analogy\u201d process, three \u201cuseful indicia\u201d to determine the existence of a religion were identified and discussed. First, a religion addresses fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters. Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching. Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Applying these three factors, the concurring opinion in <em>Malnak </em>concluded that the Science of Creative Intelligence-Transcendental Meditation constituted a religion under the first amendment despite the contentions of its leaders to the contrary. After considering Africa\u2019s testimony in light of these guideposts, we reach the obverse result: in spite of his protestations, we conclude that MOVE, at least as described by Africa, is not a \u201creligion,\u201d in the sense that that term is used in the first amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number><em>Fundamental and ultimate questions. </em>Traditional religions consider and attempt to come to terms with what could best be described as \u201cultimate\u201d questions \u2014 questions having to do with, among other things, life and death, right and wrong, and good and evil. Not every tenet of an established theology need focus upon such elemental matters, of course; still, it is difficult to conceive of a religion that does not address these larger concerns. For, above all else, religions are characterized by their adherence to and promotion of certain \u201cunderlying theories of man\u2019s nature or his place in the Universe.\u201d <em>Founding Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 1146, 1160 (D.C.Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">We conclude that the MOVE organization, as described by Africa at the hearing below, does not satisfy the \u201cultimate\u201d ideas criterion. Save for its preoccupation with living in accord with the dictates of nature, MOVE makes no mention of, much less places any emphasis upon, what might be classified as a fundamental concern. MOVE does not claim to be theistic: indeed it recognizes no Supreme Being and refers to no transcendental or all-controlling force. Moreover, unlike other recognized religions, with which it is to be compared for first amendment purposes, MOVE does not appear to take a position with respect to matters of personal morality, human mortality, or the meaning and purpose of life. The organization, for example, has no functional equivalent of the Ten Commandments, the New Testament Gospels, the Muslim <em>Koran, </em>Hinduism\u2019s <em>Veda, </em>or Transcendental Meditation\u2019s Science of Creative Intelligence. Africa insists that he has discovered a desirable way to conduct his life; he does not contend, however, that his regimen is somehow morally necessary or required. Given this lack of commitment to overarching principles, the MOVE philosophy is not sufficiently analogous to more \u201ctraditional\u201d theologies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Despite having concluded that MOVE does not deal with \u201cultimate ideas,\u201d we concede that the matter is not wholly free from doubt. Appointed counsel for Africa argues that MOVE members do share a fundamental concern, namely, an all-consuming belief in a \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cgenerating\u201d way of life \u2014 a way of life that ultimately cannot be reconciled with \u201ccivilization\u201d itself. According to counsel, Africa\u2019s insistence on keeping \u201cin touch with life\u2019s vibration\u201d amounts to a form of pantheism, wherein</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-10\">the entity of God is the world itself, and God is \u201cswallowed up in that unity which may be designated \u2018nature\u2019 \u201d. . . . [MOVE\u2019s] return to nature is not simply a \u201cpreferred\u201d state. It is the <em>only </em>state. It is the state of being in pure harmony with nature. This, MOVE calls godly. This is pantheism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">Brief for Appellant at 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">We decline to accept such a characterization of Africa\u2019s views, however. We recognize that, under certain circumstances, a pantheistic-based philosophy might qualify for protection under the free exercise clause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> From the record in this case, though, we are not persuaded that Africa is an adherent of pantheism, as that word is commonly defined.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> His mindset seems to be far more the product of a secular philosophy than of a religious orientation. His concerns appear personal (e. <em>g., </em>he contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>that a raw food diet is \u201chealthy\u201d and that pollution and other such products are \u201chazardous\u201d) and social (e. <em>g., </em>he claims that MOVE is a \u201crevolutionary\u201d organization, \u201cabsolutely opposed to all that is wrong\u201d and unable to accept existing regimes), rather than spiritual or other-worldly. Indeed, if Africa\u2019s statements are deemed sufficient to describe a religion under the Constitution, it might well be necessary to extend first amendment protection to a host of individuals and organizations who espouse personal and secular ideologies, however much those ideologies appear dissimilar to traditional religious dogmas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The Supreme Court would appear to have foreclosed such an expansive interpretation of the free exercise clause. <em>In Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>the Court concluded that Wisconsin could not require members of the Amish sect to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade, where there was uneon-tested evidence that such a course was inconsistent with the Amish religion. The Court arrived at this result only after conducting a searching inquiry into the history and customs of the Amish people and into the nature of their religious teachings and practices. In the course of his opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Burger stressed that the objections of the Amish to compulsory secondary education derived from \u201cdeep religious conviction[s]\u201d rather than from a \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201csecular\u201d philosophy. According to the Chief Justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-5\">[I]f the Amish asserted their claims because of their subjective evaluation and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-7\">rejection of the contemporary secular values accepted by the majority, much as Thoreau rejected the social values of his time and isolated himself at Walden Pond, their claim would not rest on a religious basis. Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and personal rather than religious, and such belief does not rise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">406 U.S at 216, 92 S.Ct. at 1533.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Precisely the same distinction had been drawn by the Court in the <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh </em>cases: while an individual could qualify for conscientious objector status on the basis of a genuine \u201creligious belief,\u201d reliance upon a \u201cmerely personal moral code\u201d was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">For purposes of the case at hand, then, it is crucial to realize that the free exercise clause does not protect all deeply held beliefs, however \u201cultimate\u201d their ends or all-consuming their means. An individual or group may adhere to and profess certain political, economic, or social doctrines, perhaps quite passionately. The first amendment, though, has not been construed, at least as yet, to shelter strongly held ideologies of such a nature, however all-encompassing their scope. As the Supreme Court declared in <em>Yoder, </em>\u201c[a] way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation ... if it is based on purely <em>secular </em>considerations; to have the protection of the Religion Clauses, the claims must be rooted in <em>religious </em>belief.\u201d 406 U.S. at 215, 92 S.Ct. at 1533 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>we do not necessarily agree with the district court\u2019s description of MOVE as \u201cmerely a quasi-back-to-nature social movement of limited proportion,\u201d <em>Africa, supra, </em>520 F.Supp. at 970, we conclude that the concerns addressed by MOVE, even assuming they are \u201cultimate\u201d in nature, are more akin to Thoreau\u2019s rejection of \u201cthe contemporary secular values accepted by the majority\u201d than to the \u201cdeep religious conviction[s]\u201d of the Amish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\"><em>Comprehensiveness. \u2022 </em>The concurring opinion in <em>Malnak </em>stressed that a religion must consist of something more than a number of isolated, unconnected ideas. \u201cA religion is not generally confined to one question or one moral teaching; it has a broader scope. It lays claim to an ultimate and comprehensive \u2018truth.\u2019 \u201d 592 F.2d at 209. The Science of Creative Intelligence qualified as a religion, therefore, in part because of its comprehensive nature: its teachings consciously aimed at providing <em>the </em>answers to \u201cquestions concerning the nature both of world and man, the underlying sustaining force of the universe, and the way to unlimited happiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">In contrast, we cannot conclude, at least on the basis of Africa\u2019s testimony, that MOVE members share a comparable \u201cworld view.\u201d MOVE appears to consist of a single governing idea, perhaps best described as philosophical naturalism. Apart from this desire to live in a \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d environment, however \u2014 a desire which we already have deemed insufficiently religious to qualify for first amendment protection\u2014 little more of substance can be identified about the MOVE ideology. It would not be possible, we believe, on the basis of the record in this case, to place Africa\u2019s dietary concerns within the framework of a \u201ccomprehensive belief system.\u201d Expressed somewhat differently, were we to conclude that Africa\u2019s views, taken as a whole, satisfied the comprehensiveness criterion, it would be difficult to explain why other single-faceted ideologies \u2014 such as economic determinism, Social Darwinism, or even vegetarianism \u2014 would not qualify as religions under the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Again, we acknowledge that our conclusion in this regard is not unassailable. It could be argued that Africa\u2019s views are in a sense comprehensive, since, according to his testimony, his every effort and thought is attributable to and explained by his \u201creligious\u201d convictions. MOVE members, according to Africa, \u201care practicing our religious beliefs all the time,\u201d even when running, eating, and breathing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The notion that all of life\u2019s activities can be cloaked with religious significance is, of course, neither unique to MOVE nor foreign to more established religions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Such a notion by itself, however, cannot transform an otherwise secular, one-dimensional philosophy into a comprehensive theological system. It is one thing to believe that, because of one\u2019s religion, day-to-day living takes on added meaning and importance. It is altogether different, however, to contend that certain ideas should be declared religious and therefore accorded first amendment protection from state interference merely because an individual alleges that his life is wholly governed by those ideas. We decline to adopt such a self-defining approach to the definition-of-religion problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\"><em>Structural characteristics. </em>A third indici-um of a religion is the presence of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuDx\">any formal, external, or surface signs that may be analogized to accepted religions. Such signs might include formal services, ceremonial functions, the existence of clergy, structure and organization, efforts at propagation, observance of holidays and other similar manifestations associated with the traditional religions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number><em>Malnak, supra, </em>at 209 (concurring opinion).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> MOVE lacks almost all of the formal identifying characteristics common to most recognized religions. For example, Africa testified that his organization did not conduct any special services and did not recognize any official customs. Similarly, the group apparently exists without an organizational structure, since MOVE consists of only \u201cone member\u201d and since \u201ceverything is level.\u201d In this connection, although Africa claimed to be an ordained \u201cNaturalist Minister,\u201d he did not make clear what responsibilities and benefits, if any, this title conferred on him in contradistinction to other MOVE members. Moreover, MOVE apparently celebrates no holidays, since it takes the position that every day of the year is equally important. Finally, although Africa referred to a series of guidelines that supposedly were written by John Africa and that allegedly set forth MOVE\u2019S principal tenets, no such documents were made available to the district court; thus, the record contains nothing that arguably might pass for a MOVE scripture book or catechism. Given what we know about the group from the record, we are of the view that MOVE is not structurally analogous to those \u201ctraditional\u201d organizations that have been recognized as religions under the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">We conclude first, that to the extent MOVE deals with \u201cultimate\u201d ideas, a proposition in itself subject to serious doubt, it is concerned with secular matters and not with religious principles; second, that MOVE cannot lay claim to be a comprehensive, multi-faceted theology; and third, that MOVE lacks the defining structural characteristics of a traditional religion. The \u201cnew set of ideas or beliefs\u201d presented by Africa does not appear to us to \u201ccon-fron[t] the same concerns, or serv[e] the same purposes, as unquestioned and accepted \u2018religions,\u2019 \u201d <em>Malnak, supra, </em>592 F.2d at 207 (concurring opinion). We hold, therefore, that MOVE, at least as described by Africa, is not a religion for purposes of the religion clauses. We do not conclude that Africa\u2019s sincerely-held beliefs are false, misguided, or unacceptable, but only that those beliefs, as described in the record before us, are not \u201creligious,\u201d as the law has defined that term.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">As the result of our holding in this case, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is not required under the first amendment to supply Frank Africa with a special raw-food diet.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Such a consequence, however troubling, follows directly from our declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>that MOVE is not a religion. We do not mean to suggest, however, that the requirements of the first amendment also define the proper scope of prudent state penological policy. Especially in light of the apparent willingness of Graterford officials to accede to the dietary requirements of other prisoners, both for religious and for medical reasons,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it is not clear from the record why special accommodations cannot be made in this instance for a prisoner who obviously cares deeply about what food he eats. Nonetheless, as a matter of constitutional law, the Commonwealth prevails. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">. To assist the reader, we have corrected mistakes of spelling and punctuation present in various materials submitted by Mr. Africa to the district court and quoted herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">. <em>The MOVE Organization\u2019s Religious Diet, </em>a document made available to the district court, explains that the diet desired by MOVE members consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-10\">[r]aw, uncut-unpeeled, unprocessed chemical free sweet potatoes, yams, white potatoes, turnip roots, <em>all </em>roots of organic eatable nature, wild rice organic, wild organic garlic, onions, peppers, tomatoes, corn, spinach, raw unopened unprocessed nuts, berries, melons, oranges, peaches, pears, grapes, bananas, apples, organic eggs, raw organic water meats, and some land meats....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">Appendix at A-117.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">. Africa does not assert that every member of MOVE follows the dietary regimen he describes. In fact, any such assertion would be inconsistent with other evidence contained in the record. Judge Hannum found, after conducting an in-person inspection of the prison at Graterford, that \u201call MOVE members presently incarcerated are not practicing an alleged MOVE preferred diet.\u201d And in <em>The MOVE Organization\u2019s Religious Diet, </em>it is explained that \u201cthere will be members requesting food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>that is not listed in MOVE\u2019S religious diet, which is understandable and expected, as everybody in MOVE understands [that] people coming to MOVE with customs other than MOVE\u2019S must run clear of these customs at their own pace.\u201d See note 5 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">. Africa does not question this determination, which was clearly correct, <em>see </em>42 Pa.Const. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9762 (Purdon) (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">. After reaching this determination, the district court proceeded to consider two additional matters. First, relying primarily on Chief Justice Burger\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Cruz v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 319, 323, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972), the court held that even if MOVE were declared a religion, state prison authorities would be under no affirmative duty to provide Africa with his dietary requisites. Although Africa enjoyed the freedom to believe as he wished, he could not assert an absolute right to practice his beliefs while in prison. Second, the court noted that other MOVE members apparently did not follow what Africa claimed was MOVE\u2019S religiously mandated diet. See note 3 supra. From this fact the court concluded that \u201cthe MOVE proposed or preferred diet is merely a choice of personal preference\u201d and, as such, did not qualify for special treatment under the first amendment. <em>Africa v. State of Pennsylvania, </em>520 F.Supp. 967, 970-71 (E.D.Pa. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">In light of our ultimate resolution of this appeal, it is unnecessary for us to address either of these two \u201cin-the-alternative\u201d determinations. We note, however, that the district court\u2019s second conclusion may not be compatible with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent observation that \u201cthe guarantee of free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Review Bd, Ind. Employment Sec. Div., </em>450 U.S. 707, 715, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). And with respect to the district court\u2019s first contention, it is observed that the Chief Justice\u2019s concern in <em>Cruz </em>had to do with the distribution of literature within a prison, and not with the receipt of food by prisoners. A number of courts have been willing to uphold prisoners\u2019 religiously based dietary claims. <em>See e. g., Kahane v. Carlson, </em>527 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>see generally, </em>Note, <em>Free Exercise of Religion in Prisons </em>\u2014 The <em>Right to Observe Dietary Laws, </em>45 Fordham L.Rev. 92 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">. <em>Compare St. Claire v.

We have found no case in which the Supreme Court has explicitly concluded that an inquiry into a claimant\u2019s sincerity also is necessary in a constitutional context. Such a requirement, however, plausibly can be inferred from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 78, 64 S.Ct. 882, 88 L.Ed. 1148 (1944), and a number of lower federal courts have so held. <em>See Callahan v.

It is arguable that the Supreme Court implied as much in <em>Peter v. United States, </em>a companion case to <em>United States v. Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 169, 187-88, 85 S.Ct. 850, 855, 864-65, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965). <em>See Malnak v. Yogi, </em>592 F.2d 197, 204 &amp; n.19 (3d Cir. 1979) (Adams, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">. Pantheism is \u201c[t]he religious belief or philosophical theory that God and the universe are identical (implying a denial of the personality and transcendence of God); the doctrine that God is everything and everything is God.\u201d 2 Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary 2067 (1971). <em>See </em>MacIntyre, <em>Pantheism, </em>in 6 Encyclopedia of Philosophy 31,' 31, 34 (1967) (\u201cPantheism is a doctrine that usually occurs in a religious and philosophical context in which there are already tolerably clear conceptions of God and of the universe and the question has arisen of how these two conceptions are related... . Pantheism essentially involves two assertions: that everything that exists constitutes a unity and that this all-inclusive unity is divine\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">. It is possible, of course, to take issue with the Supreme Court\u2019s classification of Thoreau-like beliefs as non-religious. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 247-49, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1549-50, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting in part). It is also possible to <em>dismiss </em>the Court\u2019s observations about Thoreau as being unnecessary to dispose of the <em>Yoder </em>case. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Toward a Constitutional Definition of Religion, </em>supra note 11, at 1066 n.63. Nonetheless, in light of Justice Douglas\u2019 explicit criticism of the majority opinion on precisely this point, it is difficult to conclude other than that the Amish-Thoreau spectrum represented \u2014 and from all indications, still represents \u2014 the considered position of a majority of the Court. We therefore follow the framework set forth in <em>Yoder </em>in deciding the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">. The task of drawing distinctions between religiously-based and secularly-derived claims in no way entitles or forces a court to assess the truth of the contentions under review. As was observed earlier, the judicial branch is neither authorized nor equipped to pronounce upon the veracity of a religious precept. Unless, however, every individual\u2019s subjective definition of a religion is to be controlling in first amendment litigation, \u201ca court must, at least to a degree, examine the content of the supposed religion, not to determine its truth or falsity, or whether it is schismatic or orthodox, but to determine whether the subject matter it comprehends is consistent with the assertion that it is, or is not, a religion.\u201d <em>Malnak, supra, </em>592 F.2d at 208 (concurring opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 11 (\u201cMOVE\u2019S beliefs are totally consuming, totally directing, and totally uncompromising. . . . MOVE compels a way of life that cannot be altered by <em>anything </em>that a person could subjectively evaluate and decide to follow as a matter of personal preference\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">. <em>See e.g., </em>I Corinthians 10:31 (\u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do ail to the glory of God\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">. Since \u201ca religion may exist without any of these signs, . . . they [may not be] determinative, at least by their absence, in resolving a question of definition.\u201d <em>Malnak </em>v. <em>Yogi, </em>592 F.2d 197, 209 (3d Cir. 1979) (Adams, J., concurring). <em>See Stevens v. Berger, </em>428 F.Supp. 896, 900 (E.D.N.Y.1977) (\u201cNeither the trappings of robes, nor temples of stone, nor a fixed liturgy, nor an extensive literature or history is required to meet the test of beliefs cognizable under the Constitution as religious.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">. We emphasize that our holding is narrow in scope. We do not hold that MOVE forever must be classified as a purely secular organization. We do not preclude other members of MOVE from establishing, on the basis of other evidence at another time, that they are entitled to the protections afforded by the free exercise clause. Rather, we have focused solely on the description of MOVE made available to the district court by Frank Africa, and have determined only that the set of ideas for which, according to him, that organization stands, does not rise to the level of a religion within the purview of the first amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">. Our decision in this appeal does not foreclose Africa from challenging, at a later time, the denial of his dietary regimen on other constitutional grounds, particularly the eighth amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. While the Commonwealth does not run afoul of the eighth amendment by refusing to provide Africa with what he <em>wants, </em>it may do so by refusing to provide him with what he <em>needs. </em>According to the testimony below, Africa has followed his special diet for years. It is quite possible, therefore, that any non-raw food provided to him might not be tolerated by his system. In his brief filed with this Court, Africa explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">To deprive us of our diet is to starve us of our nourishment that is our God-given right, and starvation is cruel, sadistic, and torturous. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">This example can be seen clearly in our sister Gail Africa, who has been insensitively denied her diet, and though she still eats cooked food, . . . her body has become sensitive and demanding of our diet, and because of this starvation she is <em>now </em>suffering. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>energy is low, her hair that was full is now dry and brittle, her skin that was clear when we last saw our sister is now broken with rash, her teeth have become dulled, and she suffers dizzy spells.... Those of us who eat only raw food <em>can\u2019t </em>eat anything <em>but </em>raw food, for to do otherwise would cause extreme sickness as harmful as <em>fatal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-16\">Should Graterford decide not to supply Africa with raw food, and should he become ill as a result, Africa might well be entitled to examination and treatment by a doctor. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (\u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the \u2018unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 proscribed by the Eighth Amendment\u201d [citation omitted]).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1031-24\">. <em>See </em>testimony of Julius T. Cuyler, Appendix at A-91 (altered feeding procedures at Grater-ford for inmates who participate in annual Ramadan service); Appendix at A-96, A-99 (Gra-terford provides any special diets ordered by physicians). We also note that the Commonwealth apparently is willing to provide a special raw food diet to female MOVE members incarcerated in the State Correctional Institution at Muncy, Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>Clancy, <em>6 female MOVE prisoners on hunger strike for 33 days, </em>Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 14, 1981, at 1 \u2014 B, col. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
