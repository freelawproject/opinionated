HISTORY OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"AQ7\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-24\">Silencing loud machinery such as air compressors is a prime method of abating noise pollution. \u201c[T]o promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress authorized EPA\u2019s Administrator to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>scribe maximum noise levels for certain types of equipment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Administrator issued regulations requiring, in part, that manufacturers of this equipment verify that their new products comply with EPA\u2019s maximum noise standards before the. products can be sold.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This reporting requirement compelled appellants to submit to EPA the test results and design specifications of their products in \u201cproduction verification\u201d reports. Appellants submitted each report under a claim of confidentiality.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">B. <em>The FOIA Requests and EPA\u2019s Decision to Disclose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The first in a succession of FOIA requests was filed with EPA on 19 July 1978 by a competing manufacturer of air compressors. The requesters generally sought all production verification and quality control reports submitted by other manufacturers, including four appellants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In considering FOIA requests for information submitted under a claim of confidentiality, EPA is required by its regulations to determine initially whether the information \u201cmay be entitled to confidential treatment\u201d or whether it \u201cclearly is not entitled to confidential treatment.\u201d If EPA finds the information \u201cmay be entitled to confidential treatment,\u201d the request is initially denied and a notice and comment proceeding is initiated to give the submitter an opportunity to explain why the information should not be disclosed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If EPA finds the information \u201cclearly is not entitled to confidential treatment,\u201d however, the submitter\u2019s claims are summarily rejected.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">In this case EPA invoked the summary procedure and informed appellants by letter that their claims of confidentiality were summarily denied.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The decision rested on the conclusion that the requested information could be duplicated by anyone with access to their air compressors. \u201cIt is a s'imple matter,\u201d said the Director of EPA\u2019s Noise Enforcement Division, \u201cto obtain a new compressor by buying it or renting it from a firm that leases such equipment.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since the noise test procedure was repeatable, \u201canyone could procure a particular manufacturer\u2019s compressor and ascertain the noise level of the compressor.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This meant the <em>test results </em>were already available to the public. Similarly, the compressor <em>design and engineering specifications </em>could be discovered through \u201creverse engineering,\u201d whereby \u201c[a] manufacturer\u2019s developmental engineers ... dismantle a compressor to examine the specific engineering features.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the information submitted in the reports was found \u201cclearly . . . not entitled to confidential treatment\u201d because competitors could obtain it through <em>private testing </em>and <em>reverse engineering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">C. <em>The District Court\u2019s Grant of Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">To forestall EPA from releasing the reports, appellants initiated an action for ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>dicial review in the district court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Appellants contended in their complaint that the production verification information constituted <em>trade secrets </em>and <em>confidential commercial information </em>within the meaning of FOIA\u2019s Exemption 4, the Noise Control Act, and the Trade Secrets Act. They also argued that the Noise Control Act was a withholding statute within the meaning of FOIA\u2019s Exemption 3 and therefore specifically prohibited EPA from disclosing the information in question. Finally, appellants submitted that EPA\u2019s decision to disclose was founded on the erroneous assumption that private testing and reverse engineering were feasible means of acquiring accurate information and was reached in violation of the agency\u2019s own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Treating EPA\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, the district court first rejected the FOIA, Trade Secrets Act, and Noise Control Act claims, holding that the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provided the proper standard of review.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court then found that the agency\u2019s determination that the reports were clearly not entitled to confidential treatment was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The dispositive fact for the district court, as for the agency, was the availability of private testing and reverse engineering. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">[A]ll of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims suffer from the defective assumption that this material cannot easily be duplicated. The compressors are sold in commerce; anyone can but or rent them;3 and by means of reverse engineering anyone can duplicate the tests and therefore the product verification reports. See <em>Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., </em>416 U.S. 470, 476, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 1883, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">3 While there is some dispute about the degree of difficulty and the cost of acquiring a compressor for testing purposes, there is no dispute with respect to the fact that it can be done.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">Since EPA\u2019s finding that appellants had no right to confidential treatment was thus \u201cnot incorrect,\u201d the court upheld the agency\u2019s use of the summary procedure and granted summary judgment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-16\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">We agree with the district court that the APA provides appellants\u2019 only basis for judicial review. We hold, however, that summary judgment was inappropriate because of the disputed and unresolved matter of the commercial feasibility of reverse engineering and private testing. That these techniques are theoretically possible does not inevitably thwart a \u201creverse-FOIA\u201d suit such as this one. We leave to the district court the question whether to return the case to EPA or to resolve the disputed factual and legal questions itself. To assist the court we conclude our opinion with a discussion of the relevant issues on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">A. The APA Provides the Appropriate Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">Appellants assert that the Noise Control Act provides them with a private right of action to enjoin disclosure that would violate section 13(b)(1) of the Act. The district court rejected this claim, ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>that EPA\u2019s action was reviewable only under the APA. The court ruled that <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held that no private right of action exists under FOIA or the Trade Secrets Act, applied as well to the Noise Control Act because the latter \u201csimply incorporates the Trade Secrets Act.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on this issue.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is true, as appellants assert, that rights of action are more frequently implied in civil statutes such as the Noise Control Act than in criminal statutes such as the Trade Secrets Act. But appellants have failed to offer any positive justification for implying a right of action here. As the Supreme Court has recently held, \u201c[t]he key to the inquiry is the intent of the legislature.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The statutory language itself provides no support for appellants\u2019 claim; it refers only to the Trade Secrets Act, which contains no express or implied right of action. Moreover, appellants were unable to direct us to <em>any </em>indication in the legislative history that a private right of action was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Most important, review is available under the APA to determine whether EPA\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If EPA determines to disclose information in violation of the Noise Control Act, that action can be struck down as \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d Accordingly, there is no justification for implying a right of action because one is not \u201c \u2018necessary to make effective the congressional purpose.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">B. <em>The Grant of Summary Judgment was Improper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">1. <em>The test for confidentiality: substantial competitive harm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">Initially, we observe that the basic legal issue resolved by the district court was the applicability of FOIA Exemption 4 to the production verification reports. EPA\u2019s determination that the reports were not entitled to confidential treatment was in effect a finding that Exemption 4 did not apply and that FOIA mandated disclosure. This is because Exemption 4, which provides that mandatory disclosure does not apply to \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is expressly adopted in EPA\u2019s disclosure regulations as a basis for determining claims of confidentiality. \u201cReasons of business confidentiality\u201d is defined in the regulations \u201cto encompass any concept which authorizes a Federal agency to withhold business information under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvY\">Thus, when EPA determined that the reports were not \u201centitled to confidential treatment for reasons of business confidentiality,\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it necessarily found that Exemption 4 did not apply. Moreover, the regulations state that \u201c[a]s a matter of policy, EPA will not release a requested record if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>EPA has determined that one or more of [Exemptions 1, 3, <em>4, </em>6, 8, and 9] applies to the record, except when ordered to do so by a Federal court or in exceptional circumstances .<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The regulatory scheme thus attempts to deal with allegedly confidential information by disclosing all that falls outside of Exemption 4 (unless some other statute precludes disclosure) and withholding all that falls within Exemption 4. Thus one of the problems before the district court was \u2014 and will be \u2014 whether this filed information falls within Exemption 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The test for determining confidentiality under Exemption 4 was set forth in <em>National Parks &amp; Conservation Association v. Morton: </em>information is confidential if its disclosure would (1) \u201cimpair the government\u2019s ability to obtain necessary information in the future,\u201d or (2) \u201ccause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Since submission of noise test information is compulsory under the Noise Control Act, the Government\u2019s ability to obtain information is not at issue here. The relevant test is thus whether disclosure will cause <em>substantial competitive harm </em>to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The substantial competitive harm test is rather simple to apply in the typical reverse-FOIA ease where Government disclosure is the sole means by which competitors can gain access to the requested information. The court considers how valuable the information will be to the requesting competitors and how much this gain will damage the submitter. In this case, however, we have the additional wrinkle that the requested information is available, <em>at some cost, </em>from an additional source. In our view, this requires that the inquiry be expanded to include two considerations: (1) the <em>commercial value </em>of the requested information, and (2) the <em>cost of acquiring </em>the information through other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The first consideration is based on the obvious fact that a submitter can suffer competitive harm only if the requested information has commercial value to competitors. When the information does have commercial value, the second consideration comes into play. If the information is freely or cheaply available from other sources, such as reverse engineering, it can hardly be called confidential and agency disclosure is unlikely to cause competitive harm to the submitter. If, on the other hand, competitors can acquire the information only at considerable cost, agency disclosure may well benefit the competitors at the expense of the submitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">We believe the latter possibility deserves close attention in Exemption 4 cases. Because competition in business turns on the relative costs and opportunities faced by members of the same industry, there is a potential windfall for competitors to whom valuable information is released under FOIA. If those competitors are charged only minimal FOIA retrieval costs for the information, rather than the considerable costs of private reproduction, they may be getting quite a bargain. Such bargains could easily have competitive consequences not contemplated as part of FOIA's principal aim of promoting openness in government.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">The dimensions of the windfall can be measured by evaluating the <em>commercial practicability </em>of private acquisition of the commercially valuable information. If private reproduction of the information would be so expensive or arcane as to be impracticable, disclosure of that information through the FOIA conduit could damage the competitive position of the submitters, to the advantage of FOIA requesters. Such a disregard of the impact on private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>costs and benefits would not satisfactorily account for \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d; on the contrary, it would challenge the notion that \u201cas a matter basic to our free enterprise system, private business information should be afforded appropriate protection, at least from competitors.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We note also that the substantive criteria in EPA\u2019s confidentiality regulations are in accord with our analysis of Exemption 4. Section 2.208(e)(1) of the regulations restates the <em>National Parks </em>test of substantial competitive harm or impairment of Government ability to obtain information.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In addition, section 2.208(c) provides that information shall be held confidential if it \u201cis not, and has not been, <em>reasonably obtainable </em>without the business\u2019s consent by other persons (other than governmental bodies) by use of legitimate means (other than discovery based on a showing of special need in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding).\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We think \u201creasonably obtainable\u201d necessarily means that the cost of obtaining information is an important consideration in determining claims of confidentiality. Thus, although the substantive criteria set forth in the regulations do not exactly mirror those relevant under Exemption 4, the essential test is the same: whether release of the requested information, given its commercial value to competitors and the cost of acquiring it through other means, will cause substantial competitive harm to the business that submitted it.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">2. <em>The district court\u2019s error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The key to the grant of summary judgment below was the district court\u2019s adherence to a narrow definition of \u201cconfidentiality.\u201d For the court, as well as for EPA, disclosure could harm appellants only if there were no other means by which competitors could obtain the reports. Since reverse engineering is <em>technically possible, </em>disclosure would not create new access to otherwise unavailable information. Thus the court saw no problem in conceding that \u201cthere is some dispute about the degree of difficulty and the cost of acquiring a compressor for testing purposes,\u201d and then dismissing the controversy as irrelevant on the ground that \u201cthere is no dispute with respect to the fact that it can be done.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">Applying the substantial competitive harm standard set forth in the previous section, we find two key errors in the district court\u2019s summary disposition.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Its pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>mary mistake was in dismissing the dispute over the difficulty and cost of reverse engineering as irrelevant. If appellants can demonstrate, as they allege, that reverse engineering in the air compressor industry is commercially impracticable, their claim of competitive harm resulting from disclosure may have merit. Competitors would be able to acquire, at virtually .no cost, the design and engineering specifications of appellants\u2019 compressors. The cost of reverse engineering is thus a disputed material fact that must be resolved prior to judgment.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The district court also erred in concluding summarily that \u201c[t]he design information submitted with respect to the compressors appears to be fairly basic and includes nothing that could not be secured from the general trade literature.\u201d <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Appellants offered evidence that they have kept design information confidential and that disclosure would permit competitors to discover noise attenuation techniques that were costly to develop.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> They thus alleged that the reports contained information that was corn-mercially valuable to competitors. In rejecting this evidence in favor of EPA\u2019s contention that the information is not confidential, without giving any indication why it considered the issue undisputed or appellants\u2019 evidence incredible, the district court committed error. As this court held in <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. GSA,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">[wjhere there is a conflict in the affidavits as to what adverse consequences will flow from the revelation of the facts contained in the documents sought to be disclosed, then it appears that there is indeed a conflict regarding very material facts which calls for some type of adversary procedure.... Summary judgment was not appropriate.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">C. <em>Issues on Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">We have held that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because material factual issues \u2014 the cost and practicability of reverse engineering and the commercial value of the submitted design information \u2014 were in dispute. In the rest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>this opinion we outline the legal issues remaining in the case to guide the court in determining how to proceed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">1. <em>Did EPA violate its own </em>regulations?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Appellants contend that EPA erred in disposing of their claims summarily under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.204(d)(2). In light of our opinion, which casts doubt on EPA\u2019s finding that the reports were <em>clearly </em>not entitled to confidential treatment, the district court may determine that EPA abused its discretion in invoking the summary procedure in this case. The court could thus find that the information \u201cmay be entitled to confidential treatment\u201d and remand to the agency for a redetermination of the confidentiality claims under \u00a7 2.204(d)(1).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">2. <em>Does Exemption 4 apply to the requested information?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">On remand the district court, or EPA if the court returns the case to it, will have to resolve the factual issues relevant to consideration of \u201csubstantial competitive harm\u201d and thus the applicability of Exemption 4. If this exemption is found not to apply, disclosure should follow pursuant to FOIA, unless some other basis for withholding the information is found.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> If Exemption 4 does apply, however, disclosure is inappropriate under EPA\u2019s regulations. In the typical reverse-FOIA case, we should emphasize, the applicability of Exemption 4 does not give the submitters a right to compel the agency to withhold the requested material. Rather, it entitles the agency to exercise discretion in determining whether or not to endorse the claims of confidentiality and thus to withhold the information.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In this case, however, EPA has chosen to be guided by the policy of FOIA in exercising its discretion to disclose: the applicable regulations provide that EPA will treat as confidential, and thus refrain from disclosing, all information that is exempt under Exemption 4.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Determination of the Exemption 4 issue, then, will also determine the confidentiality claims, absent some independent basis for compelled nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">3. <em>Does the Trade Secrets Act or the Noise Control Act bar disclosure?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The district court summarily rejected appellants\u2019 claims under the Noise Control Act and the Trade Secrets Act, finding that the Noise Control Act merely incorporated the Trade Secrets Act and that the Trade Secrets Act was inapplicable because it does not \u201cprovide plaintiffs a private right of action to enjoin agency disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The court was correct in finding that neither of these statutes provides a private right of action. But there remain two ways in which they are relevant in reverse-FOIA cases: (1) disclosure in violation of their provisions may be \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d under the APA, and (2) they may be withholding statutes under FOIA Exemption 3.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The first of these two possibilities derives from <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown.</em><footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s refusal in <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>to imply a private right of action under section 1905 of the Trade Secrets Act, as well as our holding today that no right of action exists under the Noise Control Act, was based largely on the fact that the statutory confidentiality provisions could be considered adequately under APA review.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The Court held that \u201cany disclosure that violates \u00a7 1905 is \u2018not in accordance with law\u2019 within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Section 1905 makes it a criminal offense for an officer or employee of the United States to divulge information relating to trade secrets and other confidential matters \u201cto any extent not authorized by law.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> An agency may release such information pursuant to binding regulations only if the regulations were adopted under a grant of legislative authority from Congress.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> On remand, therefore, the district court may need to determine whether the production verification reports are covered by the Trade Secrets Act or the Noise Control Act and, if so, whether EPA\u2019s regulations authorize disclosure.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL\">The second way in which these statutes may be applicable is pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3. One of appellants\u2019 main arguments is that the Noise Control Act, and presumably the Trade Secrets Act as well, is an exempting statute that mandates nondisclosure under Exemption 3. In <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>the Supreme Court refused to decide whether the Trade Secrets Act is such a withholding statute.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In 1976 Congress narrowed Exemption 3, making it more difficult for statutes to qualify as withholding statutes.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania,</em><footnotemark><em>62</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which it held that the Consumer Product Safety Act was a withholding statute under Exemption 3, makes clear that Exemption 3 claims have by no means become impossible to sustain. If the district court finds that Exemption 4 is applicable to the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tion in this case, it will not have to rule on appellants\u2019 Exemption 3 claims. If, however, the court finds Exemption 4 to be inapplicable, it should proceed to determine whether the Trade Secrets Act or the Noise Control Act is a withholding statute.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">III.

The district court also rejected appellants\u2019 claim that they would be damaged by release of the test results. EPA had dismissed this contention on the ground that the test results could be repeated by anyone who acquired a compressor. Appellants challenged this finding, asserting that the results could not be duplicated because of variability in machines and testing conditions. The basis of the court\u2019s dismissal of this claim is ambiguous. On the one hand, the court stated that \u201c[t]he short answer to this claim is that it is common knowledge in the trade that there will be variations in test results depending on the testing conditions.\u201d Mem.

On remand the court should consider whether the tests can be accurately duplicated, bearing in mind the relevance of the question whether the cost of obtaining compressors to conduct the tests is so substantial as to make private testing impracticable.

Order at 3, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 290. <em>Kewanee Oil </em>does not apply here, however, because the issue in that case involved preemption by federal patent laws of state trade secret laws.

Most courts have interpreted \u00a7 1905 as being coextensive with Exemption 4. <em>See </em>Clement, The Rights of Submitters to <em>Prevent Agency Disclosure of Confidential Business Information: The Reverse Freedom of Information Act Lawsuit, </em>55 Tex.L.Rev. 587, 605 &amp; n. 79 (1977) (cases listed). In this case, moreover, it is doubtful whether the Trade Secrets Act will prove important. As we have pointed out, if Exemption 4 applies to the requested reports, disclosure will be withheld under EPA\u2019s regulations. Moreover, if Exemption 4 does not apply and if \u00a7 1905 is construed to be broader than Exemption 4 so as to apply to the information, FOIA may provide the necessary \u201cauthorization by law\u201d to satisfy \u00a7 1905. (In <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>the Supreme Court called this a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d that \u201cis at most of limited practical significance in view of the similarity of language between Exemption 4 and the substantive provisions of \u00a7 1905.\u201d 441 U.S. at 319 n. 49, 99 S.Ct. at 1726 n. 49.) Finally, EPA\u2019s regulations define \u201creasons of business confidentiality\u201d to include \u201cany concept which requires EPA to withhold information ... under 18 U.S.C. 1905,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.201(e) (1980), suggesting that EPA will not seek to disclose information where the Trade Secrets Act points toward nondisclosure. The real test of the relationship between Exemption 4 and \u00a7 1905 will come where, unlike here, an agency\u2019s regulations permit it to disclose information even where Exemption 4 is applicable. In such a case, the issues would be raised whether the Trade Secrets Act also applied and, if so, whether disclosure was authorized by law within the meaning of \u00a7 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">If the Trade Secrets Act does not apply, the court would need to consider the meaning of the Noise Control Act\u2019s confidentiality section. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4912(b)(1) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b111-17\">. 441 U.S. at 319 n. 49, 99 S.Ct. at 1726 n. 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b111-18\">.
