The court relied exclusively on appellant\u2019s 1978 automatic disbarment from the New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>State courts, which followed his 1976 felony conviction for assaulting a federal officer. The sole issue on this appeal is whether the Tax Court\u2019s exclusive reliance on the state disbarment was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In <em>Selling v. Radford, </em>243 U.S. 46, 37 S.Ct. 377, 61 L.Ed. 585 (1917), the Supreme Court considered the effect of disbarment from state court in a federal disbarment action. The Court found that although admission to a state bar may be a predicate to admission to a federal bar, a state disbarment order does not automatically bind a federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court reconciled the interest in judicial economy with the \u201cquasi-criminal nature\u201d of a disbarment proceeding,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and concluded that a state disbarment gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that an attorney lacks the \u201cprivate and professional character\u201d to remain a member of the federal bar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The federal court should give conclusive effect to this presumption of unfitness</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyN\">unless, from an intrinsic consideration of the state record, one or all of the following conditions should appear: 1. That the state procedure from want of notice or opportunity to be heard was wanting in due process; 2, that there was such an infirmity of proof as to facts found . . . that we could not . . . accept as final the conclusion on [the attorney\u2019s lack of character]; 3, that some other grave reason existed [which would make disbarment inconsistent with] principles of right and justice . . . .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On November 22, 1976, Thies was convicted of assaulting a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This conviction was affirmed on December 5, 1977.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thies was subsequently convicted of selling stolen securities,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but this conviction was overturned on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On March 13; 1978, the New York State Appellate Division disbarred Thies without a hearing on the ground that \u00a7 90(4) of the New York Judiciary Law mandated automatic disbarment upon any felony conviction. The state court initially relied on both convictions, but later amended its judgment when the second conviction was reversed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">The Tax Court, without prior notice, suspended Thies from practice on April 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>1978, and directed him to show cause why he should not be disbarred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both the suspension and the show cause order cited only the state disbarment. The appellant requested a hearing, which was held in January 1979.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Appellant contends that if the Tax Court made and relied on independent factual findings, he was denied due process because he received inadequate notice of the hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Counsel for the appellee acknowledged that the Tax Court relied exclusively on the state disbarment. The court\u2019s order cites only the state disbarment, and contains no findings other than a bare statement that the <em>Selling v. Radford </em>criteria were satisfied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">We find that, in these circumstances, the Tax Court erred in its exclusive reliance on the state disbarment. The state court did not offer appellant the procedural guarantees specified by <em>Selling v. Radford.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>No hearing was held.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, the disbarment followed automatically upon Thies\u2019 felony conviction. Nor was the state\u2019s \u201cconclusion on [Thies\u2019] character\u201d supported by recorded findings; the state made no factual findings whatsoever. Accordingly, we need not consider the third factor listed in <em>Selling: </em>whether under all of the circumstances,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thies\u2019 disbarment from feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>al court would violate principles of \u201cright and justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The order of the Tax Court is vacated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. 243 U.S. at 50-51, 37 S.Ct. at 378-379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">. <em>In Re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 551, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. <em>Selling v.

A lawyer facing disbarment is \u201centitled to procedural due process, which includes fair notice of the charge.\u201d <em>In Re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 550, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1225, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968). The transcript of the appellant\u2019s hearing before the Tax Court suggests that some members of the court considered the appellant\u2019s second conviction relevant to his federal disbarment. <em>See </em>J.A. at 51, 94. Appellant contends, however, that due process barred reliance on the second conviction because neither the original suspension nor the show cause order referred to the second conviction in the \u201ccharge\u201d of unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">The suspension notice and show cause order did refer to the first conviction, but the appellant contends that Judge Scott\u2019s letter, <em>see </em>note 11 <em>supra, </em>hardly provided fair notice that the court would make independent factual findings. The appellee notes that Judge Scott sought to clarify her position when the hearing began, <em>see </em>J.A. at 32. <em>But cf.

However, before a federal court gives conclusive effect to a state court finding of unfitness to practice, it must assure itself that the individual received the due process expected in \u201cadversary proceedings of a quasi-criminal nature.\u201d <em>In Re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 551, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b807-18\">.
