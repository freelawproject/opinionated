When this case first came before us on interlocutory appeal, we vacated the proposed compensation procedure and remanded to the district judge for immediate resolution of those seniority issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">In the four years intervening, two decisions have sharply narrowed the questions yet to be resolved. In <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States (Teamsters),</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided just before our decision vacating and remanding,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that the precise seniority system challenged here had been adopted and maintained without discriminatory intent and thus constituted a \u201cbona fide seniority system\u201d expressly exempt from liability under section 703(h) of Title VII.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>appellants argued to the district court that the challenged seniority system, even if expressly declared lawful under Title VII by <em>Teamsters, </em>nevertheless violated, the contractual \u201caffirmative action\u201d obligations imposed on defendants by Executive Order No. 11,246.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In the ruling being appealed to us today, the district judge dismissed <em>inter alia </em>those portions of appellants\u2019 complaint alleging violations of the Executive Order for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district judge framed the central question before him as whether Executive Order No. 11,246 can \u201cmake unlawful the negotiation and maintenance of the [very] seniority system found bona fide and lawful by the Supreme Court under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Answering that question in the negative, the district judge cited, but did not rely upon, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s 1977 decision in <em>United States v. East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a suit involving all of the plaintiffs and some of the defendants here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In that case, the Fifth Circuit held that a bona fide seniority system found lawful under Title VII by virtue of section 703(h) may <em>not </em>be found unlawful under Executive Order No. 11,246. Because we find the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision persuasive, if not preclusive, on this issue, we affirm. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Nationally active common carriers maintain a distinction between higher-paid intercity drivers who haul motor freight over long distances between company terminals (\u201cover-the-road\u201d or \u201cline\u201d drivers) and lower-paid intracity drivers who pick up and deliver goods only within the immediate vicinity of a particular company terminal (\u201ccity\u201d drivers). Through bargaining agents, the national trucking companies and the Teamsters, which represents all truck drivers, have negotiated a comprehensive nationwide collective bargaining agreement with area supplements called the National Master Freight Agreement (NMFA). That agreement recognizes over-the-road drivers and city drivers as separate job classifications and bargaining units, providing for separate lines of job seniority for each. Accordingly, drivers are hired for one job or the other, and any driver transferring between classifications loses the accumulated seniority from his or her earlier job.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">In the early 1970\u2019s the Government, first through the Department of Justice and later through the EEOC,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> began to file com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>plaints in various circuits charging the nationwide trucking companies, the unions representing their employees, and the bargaining agents for both sides with violations of Title VII and Executive Order 11,-246.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Generally speaking, the complaints alleged that separation of drivers into two classes for purposes of hiring, assignment, seniority, and transfer constituted an unlawful industry-wide \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination against those present and prospective black and Hispanic drivers seeking the better-paid line driver positions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Eight years ago the Government brought the suit on appeal here against eleven named companies, as representatives of a defendant class of more than 300 common carriers of general commodity freight employing over-the-road drivers (the Companies), Trucking Management, Inc. (TMI),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which represents most of the Companies for collective bargaining purposes, the Teamsters and their bargaining committee,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the Machinists, which represents the shop employees of some of the defendant Companies.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The complaint charged that the Companies had violated legal obligations under both Title VII and Executive Order No. 11,246 by establishing and conducting the two-tiered seniority system. It further claimed that the unions had perpetuated the discriminatory effects of the Companies\u2019 practices by negotiating and consenting to the NMFA. As relief, the Government sought an injunction order permitting black and Hispanic employees to transfer between job classifications without loss of seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">In May 1977, while interlocutory appeal was being taken from the district court\u2019s .initial ruling in this case,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Supreme Court decided <em>Teamsters, </em>its second major decision regarding the lawfulness of seniority systems under section 703(h) of Title VII.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Teamsters </em>the Court held that seniority systems which perpetuate past discrimination are nevertheless exempt from attack under Title VII, so long as they are \u201cbona fide\u201d within the meaning of section 703(h) of that title.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Equally significant for our purposes, however, the Court explicitly held as a matter of fact that the NMFA, the seniority system challenged here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>from transferring to line-driver jobs are not all Negroes or Spanish-surnamed Americans; to the contrary, the overwhelming majority are white. The placing of line drivers in a separate bargaining unit from other employees is rational, in accord with the industry practice, and consistent with National Labor Relation Board precedents. It is conceded that the seniority system did not have its genesis in racial discrimination, and that it was negotiated and has been maintained free from any illegal purpose.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Shortly after <em>Teamsters, </em>this court remanded the interlocutory appeal, requiring that the district judge determine the scope of the employees\u2019 seniority rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> At that time we specifically chose not to address any other issues raised by the parties.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Relying largely on <em>Teamsters, </em>defendants then proceeded to file a series of motions urging decertification of the defendant class, judgment on the pleadings, and summary judgment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Seven months after <em>Teamsters, </em>while remand proceedings continued in this case, the Fifth Circuit handed down its decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>East Texas Motor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\"><em>Freight System, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case arising out of facts remarkably similar to our own.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The United States and the EEOC had litigated a two-week nonjury trial against the Teamsters on the question whether \u201cthe seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the [Teamsters] and E[ast] T[exas] violated Title VII and the Executive Order because they perpetuated the effects of [past] discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As part of their relief, plaintiffs had requested an injunction granting a \u201cseniority carryover\u201d award to line drivers transferring to over-the-road slots under a pretrial consent decree.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In a judgment handed down prior to <em>Teamsters, </em>the district court had awarded partial \u201cseniority relief\u201d to the drivers, finding that the seniority system created a barrier to the movement of minorities to over-the-road jobs. At the urging of the United States, the Fifth Circuit considered whether the district court\u2019s award of seniority rights, now unsupportable under Title VII after <em>Teamsters,</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>could nevertheless be sustained on the basis of Executive Order No. 11,246. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Executive Order <em>authorized </em>the plaintiffs to bring an action against the union to award retroactive seniority relief to individual em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ployees,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the Fifth Circuit then turned to the precise question before us today: \u201cwhether a bona fide seniority system is lawful under Title VII (by virtue of Section 703(h) of Title VII) but unlawful under the Executive Order.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In particular, the court examined plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Executive Order imposes obligations on government contractors \u201cabove and beyond\u201d those imposed on employers by Title VII because the Executive Order contains no provision corresponding to section 703(h), Title VII\u2019s \u201cbona fide seniority system\u201d exemption.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The Fifth Circuit noted first that the Government\u2019s Executive Order claim was \u201can argument never made until after the <em>Teamsters </em>decision.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It then rejected the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">Congress has declared for a policy that a bona fide seniority system shall be lawful. The Executive may not, in defiance of such a policy, make unlawful \u2014 or penalize \u2014 a bona fide seniority system. This Court ... [recently] . . . recognized that an order of the Executive has the force of law only \u201cif it is not in conflict with an express statutory provision.\u201d. . . Section 703(h) of Title VII is such a provision. The authorities cited by plaintiffs, to whatever extent applicable, are before the <em>Teamsters </em>decision and are made obsolete by that decision.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Turning to <em>Teamsters </em>itself, the court concluded that the Supreme Court had based that decision not on the specific language of Title VII but on the congressional intent and policy underlying it.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Noting that the Court had vacated and remanded in light of <em>Teamsters </em>a judgment in a seniority system case involving 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claims,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the Fifth Circuit concluded that the <em>Teamsters </em>Court did not intend the principles of its decision \u201cto be limited to claims under Title VII.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">Defendants in this case subsequently argued before Chief District Judge Bryant that the <em>East Texas </em>holding collaterally es-topped the Government\u2019s renewed challenge to the NMFA under the Executive Order. While eventually endorsing the position adopted by the Fifth Circuit, Judge Bryant chose not to apply collateral estoppel to bar plaintiffs from newly raising the Executive Order issue.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Reaching that issue afresh, Judge Bryant concluded as a matter of law that Executive Order No. 11,246 could not render unlawful a seniority system which the Supreme Court had expressly found lawful under Title VII.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"API\">A. <em>Issue Preclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">At the threshold, we must examine whether the Fifth Circuit\u2019s resolution of the Executive Order issue was in fact binding upon the district court under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or, stated in modern parlance, whether the issue of the seniority system\u2019s lawfulness under Executive Order No. 11,246 was precluded in the district court since the plaintiffs \u2014 the United States and the EEOC \u2014 had fully and fairly litigated the issue before the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">We find this a close question. The United States conceded at oral argument that the issue presented here is identical to the one argued to the Fifth Circuit, excepting only that the Government\u2019s presentation today discusses the legislative history of Title VII in greater detail. Thus, the very issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>we are now asked to decide was both actually litigated and actually decided by another circuit court against the same plaintiffs, after a full and fair opportunity for litigation, by a final, valid disposition. In such cases the Supreme Court has expressly endorsed the use of issue preclusion as a shield \u2014 even for defendants not present at the earlier action \u2014 as a valuable method of conserving scarce judicial resources.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Judge Bryant chose not to apply collateral estoppel, however, because he found indications in the record that the <em>East Texas </em>plaintiffs had presented their claims in a procedural posture significantly different from the posture of this case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Since the trial court may refuse to permit the defensive use of collateral estoppel when there is good reason to allow a party to relitigate an issue,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and since the court found \u201creasonable disagreement\u201d as to whether today\u2019s issue was in fact properly preserved and pleaded in <em>East </em>Texas;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> we are loath to find reversible error on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The closeness of the question does, however, suggest the prudence of carefully examining the reasoning by which the Fifth Circuit resolved today\u2019s issue in <em>East Texas. </em>Since we find the reasoning to be persuasive, further investigation of the numerous complex and troubling issues raised by counsel is both unwarranted and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">B. <em>The Relationship Between Title VII and Executive Order No. 11,246</em></p>\n<p id=\"AD\">The district judge read Title VII and its legislative history as reflecting \u201cCongress\u2019 will to protect seniority rights even if it means blunting the attack on the effects of discrimination caused by inertia.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> While \u201cthe Executive Order has the force and effect of law,\u201d Judge Bryant noted, \u201cit is not a statute and must be enforced within the framework of Congress\u2019 legislative will.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> To interpret the Executive Order as invalidating bona fide seniority systems protected by Title VII, he concluded, \u201cwould run afoul of the statutory construction of Title VII and legislative intent of Congress as pronounced by the Supreme Court, and as such would violate the doctrine of separation of powers and vitiate the holding of Teamsters.\"<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The Government now argues on appeal that Judge Bryant\u2019s conclusion should be reversed for erroneous statutory construction.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Its core contention is that the district court, like the Fifth Circuit in <em>East Texas, </em>\u201cdid not accurately determine Congress\u2019 intent\u201d in enacting section 703(h) of Title VII.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The \u201cfundamental issue in the present case,\u201d as appellants see it, is not whether the President has inherent authority by Executive Order to override the expressed or implied will of Congress \u2014 indeed, appellants do not argue that issue.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The only controversy created here involves the question \u201cwhether Section 703(h) is intended to govern implementation of Executive Order 11246.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> If Congress intended <em>only </em>to shield bona fide seniority systems from challenge <em>under Title VII, </em>appellants claim, their interpretation of the Executive Order would not conflict with the legislative will and hence would still carry the force of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>In support of their theory, appellants rely on two arguments, one based on the language of section 703(h) and one based on its legislative history. The argument made from language is easily dismissed. Appellants contend that section 703(h) provides only that bona fide seniority systems are lawful \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision <em>of this </em>title,\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> thus allowing provisions of other titles, and a <em>fortiori, </em>executive orders carrying the force of law, to be invoked to challenge those systems. The <em>East Texas </em>court was careful to note that the <em>Teamsters </em>Court itself, by subsequent action in a case brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, had indicated the lawfulness of bona fide seniority systems under provisions of other titles.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> That suggestion accords with a series of cases decided both before and after <em>Teamsters </em>uniformly holding that section 703(h)\u2019s immunization of bona fide seniority systems clearly extends to suits brought under section 1981.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> We agree that under those cases appellants\u2019 reading of the \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of this title\u201d language is implausible. To us that language suggests Congress\u2019 simple, but unequivocal, intent to preserve the lawfulness of bona fide seniority systems <em>even after </em>the passage of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">With regard to section 703(h)\u2019s legislative history, we again find the Fifth Circuit\u2019s observations in <em>East Texas </em>persuasive. That court noted frankly that until <em>Teamsters </em>the Government had never argued that the Executive Order invalidates seniority systems expressly found lawful under Title VII itself.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The reason why is apparent. Before <em>Teamsters </em>was decided, <em>Title VII itself, </em>as interpreted by lower courts, had provided the Government with a sufficient basis for challenging facially neutral seniority systems which, though adopted and maintained without discriminatory intent, nevertheless perpetuated some effects of past discrimination.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">Accordingly, before <em>Teamsters </em>the Government never had cause to construe Title VII\u2019s legislative history as expressing congressional approval of a more far-reaching <em>executive </em>power to remedy past discrimination perpetuated by bona fide seniority systems.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Only after <em>Teamsters </em>was decided did the EEOC adopt the position that Title VII\u2019s legislative history evinces congressional intent that, with respect to seniority systems, the reach of Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>VII and the Executive Order should not be coterminous.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">We find appellants\u2019 present efforts to reassess the legislative history strained and unconvincing. As originally enacted, Title VII made only one reference to the entire Executive Order program, and that was inserted into the legislative history without debate or commentary.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The legislative history of section 703(h), the section of Title VII explicitly concerned with seniority systems, made no mention of the Executive Order. At the same time, however, the legislative history of that section exhibited considerable congressional concern and struggle to preserve the vested seniority rights of workers without major curtailment of Title VII\u2019s overriding objective of eliminating employment discrimination based on race, sex, and national origin.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The <em>Teamsters </em>Court read the legislative history of Title VII as revealing plain congressional intent to <em>protect seniority rights, </em>so long as those rights are preserved by a \u201cbona fide\u201d seniority system.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> A fair reading of the same legislative history suggests that Congress simply did not consider, either in 1964 when it passed Title VII,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> or in 1972 when it amended it,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> whether the Executive could or should reach <em>beyond </em>Title VII to redress any discrimination which a facially neutral bona fide seniority system might perpetuate. The Government\u2019s construction of section 703(h) would require us to conclude that Congress somehow intended to permit the Executive independently to modify or dismantle concededly bona fide seniority systems. We find it highly unlikely that Congress would have impliedly approved Executive interference with the same bona fide seniority systems it had deliberately immunized under section 703(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Although we think the legislative history clearly refutes the Government\u2019s argument, we note an additional consideration demonstrating that Congress did not intend to permit executive orders to override seniority systems that are exempt under section 703(h). Appellees here are subject to Executive Order No. 11,246 because they carry goods under Government bills of lading. Common carriers must accept all goods offered for shipment; given the vast volume of Government traffic, virtually all of them will carry some Government goods and thus be subject to this Executive Order. To read section 703(h) as placing no limit on the Executive Order\u2019s capacity to regulate bona fide seniority systems would permit the Executive to ignore section 703(h) completely and to redefine which common carrier seniority systems are lawful and which are not. Such a result would plainly violate the congressional prerogative to strike the balance between the national goals of preventing employment discrimination and preserving vested seniority rights.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> We cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>presume, especially in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that Congress intended this result.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s ruling dismissing the Government\u2019s Executive Order claims is hereby affirmed. Because the related rulings regarding de-certification of the defendant class, modification of the consent decree, and dismissal of the Executive Order claims against the Machinists and four companies who did not sign the partial consent decree all stemmed directly from the dismissal of the Executive Order claims, they are also hereby affirmed.

An additional problem with the Government\u2019s construction is that it could actually work to the detriment of some minority drivers. Since the passage of Title VII blacks and Hispanics have accumulated seniority as over-the-road and city drivers. To abolish the separate seniority lists and order transfers with seniority carryover between the lists could result in some white city drivers with accumulated seniority from before 1965 gaining seniority over black and Hispanic over-the-road drivers hired after 1965.
