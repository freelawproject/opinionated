The Youngers\u2019 two-story Fort Lewis dwelling had no second story fire exit. The Young-ers contend that their daughters\u2019 deaths would have been prevented if smoke detectors had been installed in their Army-provided residence. The Youngers, therefore, brought this wrongful death suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act alleging that the Government was negligent in failing to install smoke detectors, particularly when the house was renovated in 1977 before they moved in.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-17\">The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Senior District Judge Blumenfeld of Connecticut sitting by designation, granted summary judgment for the United States. The district court held that the United States owed no duty to install smoke detectors in the Youngers\u2019 dwelling and that, therefore, the Government was not negligent. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-18\">I. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b635-19\">Was the United States under a duty to install smoke detectors in the Youngers\u2019 Fort Lewis dwelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">A. Did Washington common law impose a duty to install smoke detectors in the Youngers\u2019 dwelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">B. Did the Washington Residential Landlord-Tenant Act, read in conjunction with the State Building Code, create a duty to install smoke detectors in the Youngers\u2019 dwelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">C. Did the Army\u2019s regulations or plans to install smoke detectors in its family housing units impose a duty to install smoke detectors?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-24\">The Youngers brought this action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671-80. Under the FTCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the United States is liable for tort claims \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674, according to \u201cthe law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Thus, in the instant case, the Government\u2019s liability must be determined by considering the liability, under Washington state law, of a private landlord under similar circumstances. <em>See United Scottish Insurance Company v. United States, </em>614 F.2d 188, 190 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">A. <em>Washington common law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Washington common law provides that a landlord will be liable to a tenant for harm caused by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">(1) latent or hidden defects in the leasehold</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">(2) that existed at the commencement of the leasehold</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(3) of which the landlord had actual knowledge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">(4) and of which the landlord failed to inform the tenant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Stoebuck, <em>The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington: Part I, </em>49 Wash.L. Rev. 291, 342 (1974); <em>Flannery v. Nelson, </em>366 P.2d 329, 59 Wash.2d 120 (1961). Central to the latent defect theory is that there is no liability if the defect is open and visible to the tenant, so that he does or should see it. Stoebuck, 49 Wash.L.Rev. at 353; <em>Peterson v. Betts, </em>165 P.2d 95, 107, 24 Wash.2d 376 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">The Youngers contend that all four elements of the common law tort claim based on a concealed dangerous condition known to the lessor are fulfilled in this case. First, they argue that the absence of a smoke detector \u2014 a small device that by Army regulation is installed on the second floor ceiling above the staircase \u2014 was an obscure defect the average person would not discover. <em>See Thomas v. Housing Authority of Bremerton, </em>426 P.2d 836, 840, 71 Wash.2d 69, 75 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Second, it is undisputed that no smoke detector was present in the Youngers\u2019 assigned dwelling at the outset of their tenancy (or at any time before the fire).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">Third, it is also uncontested that the U.S. Army had actual knowledge of the absence of smoke detectors. The district court noted that the Government\u2019s documents indi- ' cate awareness of the need for smoke detectors in military family housing since at least 1974. The Government, moreover, was engaged in a program to bolster fire safety by installing smoke detectors in all military family housing by the end of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">Fourth, there is no evidence that the Youngers were informed of the lack of smoke detectors and the fire safety risks inherent in residing in a wooden dwelling without smoke detectors or a second story exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">A grant of summary judgment is proper only when, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the adverse party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Murphy, </em>626 F.2d 633, 640 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Youngers, summary judgment was inappropriate. The court\u2019s statement that the absence of a smoke detector was an <em>apparent </em>deficiency was a prerequisite to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Youngers\u2019 suit failed under Washington common law. The court\u2019s ruling stated that <em>\u201cthe absence of such detectors was readily apparent to the plaintiffs.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). By reaching a conclusion on this genuine issue of material fact \u2014 a fact issue which is pivotal to the Youngers\u2019 latent defect theory \u2014 the district court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">The Government attempts to ameliorate the district court\u2019s error by asserting that whether the absence of smoke detectors was latent or apparent is an immaterial factual dispute. The Government argues that, as a matter of law, the absence of a smoke detector is not a \u201cdefect\u201d because that condition did not \u201cstart, spread, or intensify\u201d the fatal fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>In this context, \u201cdefect\u201d is synonymous with a \u201cdangerous condition\u201d which would lead a reasonable person to suspect the existence of an unreasonable risk of harm. <em>See </em>W. Prosser, Law <em>of Torts </em>(4th ed. 1971), section 63 at 401-402. Thus, the question arises whether the lack of a smoke detector in a recently renovated military family housing unit that had no second story fire exit presented an unreasonable risk of harm. Obviously, such a condition did not start, spread, or intensify the fire. However, viewing the scant evidence in the light most favorable to the Youngers, it is reasonable to advance the proposition that the absence of smoke detectors constitutes a defect or dangerous condition. The Government\u2019s arguments are appropriately aimed at the causation element of the Youngers\u2019 negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">B. <em>Residential Landlord-Tenant Act and State Building Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The Youngers contend that Washington statutory provisions imposed a duty on the Government to install smoke detectors in military family housing. The applicability, if any, of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, Wash.Rev.Code Chapter 59.18, and the State Building Code, Wash.Rev. Code Chapter 19.27, was not discussed in the district court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not reach the Washington statutory issues because we remand on other grounds. On remand, the district court may wish to consider the applicability, if any, of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 and the State Building Code to the Youngers\u2019 FTCA suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">C. <em>Government Regulations Re: Smoke Detector Installation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The parties debate the importance of the Government\u2019s regulations requiring smoke detector installation in military family housing units by the end of 1978. The district court rejected any suggestion that the Government\u2019s smoke detector program gave rise to a duty of care bolstering the Youngers\u2019 FTCA cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm this aspect of the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">D. <em>Implied Warranty of Habitability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">The district court may wish to consider whether Washington\u2019s warranty of habitability imposes a duty on landlords to install smoke detectors in residential rental dwellings as part of the duty to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing. <em>See Foisy v. Wyman, </em>515 P.2d 160, 164, 83 Wash.2d 22 (1973) (\u201cThe value of the lease today ... is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards\u201d); and <em>see </em>Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, Wash.Rev.Code Chapter 59.18 (dwelling units must be kept \u201cfit for human habitation\u201d; Washington public policy ensures \u201cdecent, safe, and sanitary housing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">We conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted in this case because the district court determined a genuine issue of material fact adverse to the Young-ers\u2019 position. In addition, the district court may wish to consider the validity of the Washington statutory theories advanced by the Youngers and the applicability, if any, of Washington\u2019s warranty of habitability to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\">.
