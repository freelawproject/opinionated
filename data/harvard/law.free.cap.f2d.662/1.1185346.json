Our consideration of these petitions was expedited because the new rates were scheduled to become effective on July 1, 1981. Oral argument was heard on June 18, 1981, and on June 23 a judgment was entered, upholding the Tribunal in part, and reversing and remanding in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-20\">We held that the Tribunal acted within its authority in adjusting the royalty rate and in assigning the increase an effective date of July 1, 1981, but that the Tribunal had exceeded its authority in adopting a procedure for interim rate adjustments that would require the Tribunal to convene annual proceedings for the exercise of discretion. The case was remanded to permit the Tribunal to adopt, if it so desired, an alternative scheme of interim rate adjustment. This opinion explains more fully the basis of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>I. THE COMPULSORY LICENSE AND THE COPYRIGHT ROYALTY TRIBUNAL</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The royalty determinations challenged in this proceeding concern the compulsory license for phonorecords<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-810 (1976). Once the creator of a nondramatic musical work has allowed phonorecords of that work to be produced and distributed, the statute requires him to grant a license upon request to any other person who proposes to make and distribute phonorecords of the work, at a royalty rate set by law. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 115.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This compulsory licensing scheme is one of several established by the Copyright Act, and determination of the appropriate royalty rates is one of the principal functions Congress has assigned to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">The phonorecord compulsory licensing system dates back to 1909, when Congress first extended a composer\u2019s copyright protection to include the right to control manufacture of \u201cparts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the musical work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Industry representatives expressed a fear that this protection ran the risk of \u201cestablishing a great music monopoly\u201d because the Aeolian Company, a manufacturer of player-piano rolls, was acquiring exclusive contract rights from composers and publishers. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1909).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The music industry has undergone major transformations in the intervening years, but record producers have continued to argue that a danger of monopolization and discriminatory practices exists, and Congress has concluded that a compulsory licensing system is still warranted. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 107 (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5659 [hereinafter cited as <em>1976 House Report]-, </em>H.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 66-67 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Although the availability of the compulsory license under the 1909 Act has been very important to the structure of the recording industry, the statutory procedures for invoking the license have rarely been used.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The usual effect of the system is to make the statutory royalty rate a ceiling on the price copyright owners can charge for use of their songs under negotiated contracts: if the owner demands a higher price in voluntary negotiations, the manufacturer can turn to the statutory scheme, but if the owner is willing to accept less than the statutory rate, he is free to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Today, the vast majority of contracts for use of copyrighted musical works involve voluntary payment at precisely the statutory rate. <em>See Adjustment of Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords, </em>46 Fed.Reg. 10,-466, 10,479-80 (1981); S.Rep. No. 473, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 93-94 (1975) [hereinafter cited as <em>1975 Senate Report], </em>This was not the case earlier in the century, because the statutory rate was then high enough in terms of purchasing power to allow a greater range for individual bargaining.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 1909 Act had set the royalty rate at two cents for each \u201cpart\u201d (e. <em>g., </em>disc) manufactured, and this rate remained unchanged until the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, which increased the statutory rate to <em>2% </em>cents per copy and provided for further adjustments by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">The inadequacy of the two-cent rate after half a century of economic change had long been recognized. <em>See, e. g., </em>H.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 67 (1967). Nonetheless, the rate increase was continually delayed by the battle over comprehensive copyright law revision and as the years passed, spokesmen for the opposing interests returned to argue over further incremental adjustments. Ultimately Congress found it \u201cneither feasible nor desirable that these rates should be adjusted exclusively by the normal legislative process.\u201d <em>1975 Senate Report </em>at 155.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress chose in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>stead to make a first, approximate modification of the royalty rate, and to delegate the authority to make future adjustments to an independent tribunal. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(b) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The Senate and the House proposed entirely different structures for the independent body that would determine rates. The Senate version provided an ad hoc tribunal convened by the Register of Copyrights whenever a rate proceeding was necessary; the American Arbitration Association was to name three of its members to form the panel, and this choice would be binding unless parties made well-founded objections. S. 22, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 803 (1975) [hereinafter cited as Senate Bill], <em>see </em>1975 <em>Senate Report </em>at 36,157. Rate adjustments could be vetoed by resolution of either house of Congress, and judicial review was provided only when a party charged that a proceeding for distribution of collected royalty fees was tainted by partiality, corruption, fraud, or other misconduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Senate Bill \u00a7\u00a7 807, 809; <em>see 1975 Senate Report </em>at 37, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The House, in contrast, proposed a permanent body, the Copyright Royalty Commission. The Commission would function like a traditional administrative agency. Its three members would be appointed by the President for five-year terms, and its proceedings would be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, including the normal scope of judicial review. <em>See 1976 House Report </em>at 41-44,174,179. The legislative veto was eliminated. <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">As the conference report stated, the structure finally chosen for the Tribunal \u201cconforms in general to the House bill, but with several changes.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1733, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 82 (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 5823 [hereinafter cited as <em>Conference </em>Report]. The Act establishes \u201can independent Copyright Royalty Tribunal in the legislative branch.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(a) (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Tribunal is composed of five commissioners appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for seven-year terms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 802. The Tribunal is subject to the APA, and is directed to adopt regulations \u201cgoverning its procedure and methods of operation\u201d arid to accompany its final decisions by a statement of \u201cthe criteria that [it] determined to be applicable to the particular proceeding, the various facts that it found relevant to its determination in that proceeding, and the specific reasons for its determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 803.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The APA also governs judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s actions, and there is no legislative veto provision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Replacement of the legislative veto by the normal process of judicial review was intended to \u201cpermit more detailed, thoughtful, and careful review of possibly arbitrary or capricious determinations\u201d of the Tribunal. <em>1976 House Report </em>at 179, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 5795. Congress also enhanced the protection against arbitrary action by reconstituting the Tribunal as a permanent body. The Register of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Copyrights, testifying before a House subcommittee, expressed her belief that the Senate proposal was constitutional, but urged the House to strengthen the Tribunal, emphasizing \u201cthat it should have continuity and not be as ad hoc as is laid out in the bill at the moment.\u201d <em>1975 Hearings </em>at 1914-15 (testimony of Ms. Ringer).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Assimilation of the Tribunal to the usual agency model provides greater practical and procedural assurances of a coherent royalty system.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The present case involves petitions for review of the Tribunal\u2019s first redetermination of the royalty rate for the phonorecord compulsory license. The statute requires the Tribunal to institute proceedings for a royalty adjustment on January 1,1980, and, upon petition, \u201cin 1987 and in each subsequent tenth calendar year.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 804(a)(1), (2)(B) (1976). The rate applicable to the phonorecord license is to be calculated to achieve the following objectives: <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 801(b)(1). Until that redetermination has been made, the royalty rate is \u201ceither two and three-fourths cents, or one-half of one cent per minute of playing time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 115(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">(A) To maximize the availability of creative works to the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">(B) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his creative work and the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">(C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copyright user in the product made available to the public with respect to relative creative contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost, risk, and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative expression and media for their communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">(D) To minimize, any disruptive impact on the structure of the industries involved and on generally prevailing industry practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">II. THE NEW ROYALTY RATE</p>\n<p id=\"ATa9\">The Copyright Royalty Tribunal published notice of its first proceeding to determine the royalty rate for the phonorecord compulsory license on January 2, 1980. 45 Fed.Reg. 63 (1980). In the spring of that year, the Tribunal accepted submissions of economic studies and legal motions, and then commenced evidentiary hearings that lasted forty-six days and involved thirty-five witnesses. <em>See Adjustment of Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords, </em>46 Fed.Reg. 10,466, 10,466-67 (1981). Closing arguments followed in November, and the Tribunal published the new rate in the <em>Federal Register </em>on January 5, 1981. 46 Fed. Reg. 891 (1981). The royalty rate was increased to \u201cfour cents, or three-quarters of one cent per minute of playing time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892 (to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.2). The Tribunal also set out a complex system for future interim adjustments in the rate to reflect increases in the average list price of albums. <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.3-.4). On February 3, the Tribunal published its findings in a detailed statement of the reasons for the adjustment it made in the rate. 46 Fed.Reg. 10,466-87 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Various parties petitioned for review of the Tribunal\u2019s action. Parties on the receiving end argued that the royalty was too low, and that the effective date of the increase had been improperly postponed;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>parties who would be paying the royalty argued that the rate was too high and that the procedures for making interim adjustments were unlawful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We turn first to the contentions concerning the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the four-cent royalty rate itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">A. <em>The Adequacy of the Tribunal\u2019s Explanation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The Copyright Act, as we have noted, requires the Tribunal to \u201cstate in detail the criteria that the Tribunal determined to be applicable to the particular proceeding, the various facts that it found relevant to its determination in that proceeding, and the specific reasons for its determination.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(b) (1976). On the basis of this detailed statement and the record before the Tribunal, judicial review is available in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 810; <em>see Amusement and Music Operators Ass\u2019n v. Copyright Royalty Tribunal, </em>636 F.2d 531 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The copyright users insist that the incorporation of the usual APA review provisions in the statutory scheme demonstrates a congressional desire for \u201csearching judicial scrutiny.\u201d Responsive Brief for Petitioners RIAA and CBS Inc. at 13 n.32. They stress the reference in the House report to \u201cthe full scope of judicial review provided by Chapter 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d <em>1976 House Report </em>at 179, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 5795. The context of this reference makes clear, however, that the House committee did not contemplate intrusive judicial review beyond that ordinarily available under the APA, but- rather contrasted the normal APA process of reviewing both the substantive and procedural aspects of all final decisions with the Senate\u2019s proposal to limit judicial review to gross procedural irregularities in the royalty distribution proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">The Copyright Act permits the Tribunal to conduct its royalty determination as an informal rulemaking.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In such proceedings, the APA requires a court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and conclusions\u201d if they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>wise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). Our responsibilities under this \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard include ascertaining the facts on which the Tribunal relied in making its decision, determining whether those facts have some basis in the record,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and judging whether a reasonable decisionmaker could respond to those facts as the Tribunal did. <em>See, e. g., </em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. <em>Costle, </em>590 F.2d 1011, 1027 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">When applying the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard to the Tribunal\u2019s determinations, we must bear in mind that the thoroughness of the factual support an agency can supply for its decision will vary with the nature of the decision being made. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 813, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2121, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978); <em>Industrial Union Dep\u2019t v. Hodgson, </em>499 F.2d 467, 474-75 (D.C.Cir.1974). The setting of the royalty rate is not a routine exercise in historical cost of service ratemaking for a public utility. At least three distinct aspects of the royalty rate scheme increase the deference that this court owes to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">First, some of the statutory factors require the Tribunal to estimate the effect of the royalty rate on the future of the music industry. The rate should be calculated <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to \u201cmaximize the availability of creative works to the public,\u201d but to \u201cminimize any disruptive impact on the structure of the industries involved and on generally prevailing industry practices.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801(b)(1)(A), (D) (1976). These criteria require determinations \u201cof a judgmental or predictive nature,\u201d and the court must be aware that \u201c \u2018a forecast of the direction in which the future public interest lies necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency,\u2019 \u201d <em>FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. at 813-14, 98 S.Ct. at 2121 (quoting <em>FPC </em>v. <em>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., </em>365 U.S. 1, 29, 81 S.Ct. 435, 450, 5 L.Ed.2d 377 (1961)). In establishing a permanent Tribunal, Congress expressed its expectation that members would be appointed \u201cfrom among persons who have demonstrated professional competence in the field of copyright policy,\u201d <em>1976 House Report </em>at 174-75, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at p. 5791, and a court must recognize the contributions of this expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Second, other statutory criteria invite the Tribunal to exercise a legislative discretion in determining copyright policy in order to achieve an equitable division of music industry profits between the copyright owners and users. Section 801(b)(1)(C) provides that the royalty rate should \u201creflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copyright user in the product ...\u201d (em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>phasis added). Similarly, section 801(b)(1)(B) states a congressional purpose to \u201cafford the copyright owner a fair return for his creative work and the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions.\u201d It is evident that the \u201cfairness\u201d of the return to a songwriter for his creative effort cannot be defined by the traditional methods of cost of service ratemak-ing; a broader inquiry is called for.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, a court owes considerable deference to the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate policy choices. <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <em>Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, </em>564 F.2d 458, 479 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Federation of Homemakers </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>539 F.2d 740, 743 (D.C.Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Finally, the statutory factors pull in opposing directions, and reconciliation of these objectives is committed to the Tribunal as part of its mandate to determine \u201creasonable\u201d royalty rates. Both the House and the Senate had originally passed bills whose only instruction to the Tribunal was to assure that the royalty rate was reasonable,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> although the House report had stated objectives that it \u201canticipated that the Commission will consider.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As part of the compromise that produced the final structure of the Tribunal, most of those objectives were written into the statute, see <em>Conference Report </em>at 82, but the Tribunal was not'told which factors should receive higher priorities. To the extent that the statutory objectives determine a range of reasonable royalty rates that would serve all these objectives adequately but to differing degrees, the Tribunal is free to choose among those rates, and courts are without authority to set aside the particular rate chosen by the Tribunal if it lies within a \u201czone of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Permian Basin Area Rate </em>Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 767, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 1360, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968); <em>FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. 575, 586, 62 S.Ct. 736, 743, 86 L.Ed. 1037 (1942); <em>Hercules, Inc. v. EPA, </em>598 F.2d 91, 107 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The copyright users attack the Tribunal\u2019s explanation of its reasons for choosing the four-cent royalty rate. They insist that the Tribunal has failed to give a sufficient derivation of the four-cent figure, that the Tribunal did not give adequate consideration to certain relevant factors, and that the Tribunal improperly gave weight to other, irrelevant factors. None of these objections require extended discussion,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but there may be some value for future Tribunal decisions in a brief treatment of a few of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The copyright users make a fundamental argument that the Tribunal\u2019s decision provides no explanation for the selection of the four-cent figure. We recognize that the character of the Tribunal\u2019s explanation leaves room for improvement, but the industry\u2019s objection is greatly overstated. Stylistically, the Tribunal\u2019s opinion is structured more as a demonstration that- the four-cent royalty rate is calculated to achieve the statutory objectives than as a derivation of a 4.00&lt;p numerical figure. But this difference in focus does not obscure the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The Tribunal\u2019s explanation of the rate increase is published in the <em>Federal Register, </em>and there is no need to recount it at length here. The Tribunal analyzed the empirical evidence in relation to the statutory criteria. One major target of the copyright owners\u2019 submissions, the effect of inflation on their return from the royalty rate, was pertinent to several factors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The Tribunal found that the current rate was too low to provide a financial incentive that would maximize the production of creative works, and rejected copyright users\u2019 claim that the effect of a rate increase on price (and thereby on demand) would be substantial enough to diminish the variety of new works that the industry could make available to the public. 46 Fed.Reg. at 10,-479. Analyzing the relative contributions of the owners and users and their respective shares of recording industry revenues (as well as the shares taken by a third group, the performing artists), the Tribunal concluded that the return to the copyright owners had unfairly dwindled because of the price ceiling while the return to others had been greatly enhanced.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 10,480, 10,483.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In light of the economic evidence, the \u201crelative roles\u201d of the copyright owners and others, and the higher level of remuneration to composers under compulsory licenses abroad, the Tribunal concluded that a fair return to the owners required an immediate increase in the royalty rate \u201cto at least four cents per song.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10,485. The Tribunal also found that a four-cent royalty would be consistent with the opposing constraints among the statutory criteria, that the rate did not disrupt industry structure and practices or unfairly diminish the income of the copyright users. <em>Id.; id. </em>at 10,481, 10482.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Tribunal\u2019s discussion more than satisfies the statutory directive</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We conclude that, based on the statutory objectives and the character of the determination they require, the Tribunal has adequately explained its choice of a royalty rate. The copyright users have not shown that the rate chosen lies outside the zone of reasonableness suggested by the Tribunal\u2019s factual findings, or that the Tribunal\u2019s decision is arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">B. <em>The Bargaining Room Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The copyright owners assert that the Tribunal misconstrued the purpose of the statutory royalty rate, and set the rate too low because of this misinterpretation. They argue that the two-cent royalty rate set by Congress in 1909 did not become a rigidly prevailing rate until much later in this century. The owners insist that the intent of Congress in 1976 was to revive the flexibility of the original compulsory license system, and that the Tribunal should have set a rate high enough to leave greater room for individual songwriters to negotiate a fair return on their works by bargaining within a range below the statutory ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The Tribunal rejected this argument, explaining that the bargaining room theory was inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the statutory criteria:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The statute requires the Tribunal to establish a \u201creasonable\u201d royalty rate calculated to achieve the statutory objectives. We adopt the view of RIAA that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjB\">A rate that is deliberately fixed above the level that the market can bear \u2014 so that a lower rate can be negotiated in the marketplace \u2014 cannot be \u2018reasonable.\u2019 Such a rate would yield more than the \u2018fair return\u2019 to copyright owners mandated by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">46 Fed.Reg. at 10,478 (emphasis and footnote omitted). The Tribunal did not agree with RIAA\u2019s economic argument that bargaining was impossible,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but concluded that the statutory rate should itself be reasonable and should afford the possibility of what the Tribunal considered a fair return to individual songwriters, while leaving them free to accept less if bargaining did take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We have already observed that the statutory criteria, including the directive that the rate be calculated to \u201cafford the copyright owner a fair return for his creative work,\u201d leave the Tribunal substantial discretion to determine policy within the framework of the statute, and that the Tribunal\u2019s choices in this area are entitled to deference.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The copyright owners argue, however, that the legislative history clearly demonstrates that Congress intended to restore the free play of market forces within a generous price ceiling, and that the</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Tribunal\u2019s ruling must be set aside as inconsistent with that legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The copyright owners correctly point out that a House committee report issued in 1967 appears to express a legislative intent to adopt the bargaining room approach. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 72-74 (1967).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This 1967 bill, however, was not enacted into law, and its approach to the compulsory license was significantly changed by the subsequent creation of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal. The choice between a bargaining room theory and a prevailing rate theory of the royalty continued to spark controversy over the years, and the 1967 report\u2019s summary of the opposing contentions of the copyright owners and users was repeated with some statistical updating in the 1975 Senate report. <em>See 1975 Senate Report </em>at 93-94. But the <em>conclusions </em>of the 1967 House report were <em>not </em>repeated. Rather, the Senate committee drew no explicit conclusion on this issue, merely expressing its approval of a rate increase to 2V2 cents, and observing that \u201cthe publishers and composers will have the opportunity to present their case to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal, an expert body qualified to review the economic evidence in detail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">Thus, the legislative history does not demonstrate that Congress intended to impose a bargaining room rationale on the Tribunal\u2019s determination of a reasonable rate.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The legislative history indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>only that the bargaining room theory had been considered, and that Congress had chosen to express its will through the statutory criteria instead. These criteria do not explicitly address the bargaining room question, and that dispute can only be resolved through the Tribunal\u2019s articulation of principles that flesh out the statutory notions of \u201creasonable\u201d rates and \u201cfair\u201d returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The Tribunal\u2019s decision that the royalty rate must be reasonable as set, and must not yield an unfairly large return, is based on a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language and is entitled to the deference of this court. Congress established a permanent tribunal, in part, to assure the development of a consistent royalty policy.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The copyright owners have not shown that this policy determination should be reversed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">III. ISSUES OF TIMING</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Both groups of petitioners find fault with the schedule that the Tribunal designed for adjustment of the royalty rate. The copyright owners contend that delaying the effective date of the increase to four cents until July 1, 1981, was arbitrary and capricious and inconsistent with the legislative \u2022 intent. The copyright users charge that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by establishing a structure for interim rate adjustments that requires the Tribunal to meet annually to reevaluate economic conditions in the recording industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Turning first to the effective date, we note that nothing in the Copyright Act expressly forbids the Tribunal to postpone the effective date of a rate increase, at least when an aggrieved party has sought judicial review.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Petitioners appear to recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>nize this fact, <em>see </em>Brief for Intervenor NMPA at 52, but they argue that postponement frustrates the congressional intent underlying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Section 803(a) of the Copyright Act makes the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings subject to the provisions of the APA. The APA does not supply a mandatory effective date for agency rulemaking; rather, it requires an agency to publish most rules \u201cnot less than 30 days\u201d before the effective date, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d) (1976), and permits an agency to postpone the effective date of an action pending judicial review, if it \u201cfinds that justice so requires,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 705. When the statute authorizing agency action fails to specify a timetable for effectiveness of decisions, the agency normally retains considerable discretion to choose an effective date.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Petitioners have not demonstrated a congressional intent to withdraw this discretion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We also recognize a certain tension between the copyright owners\u2019 position that the rate must become effective immediately after thirty days and their insistence that the Tribunal has the authority to make interim adjustments to the rate before the next full rate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Nor have petitioners shown that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to delay the effective date was arbitrary and capricious. The Tribunal\u2019s opinion demonstrates its concern \u201cto minimize disruptive impacts\u201d on the recording industry, and its view that the effective date of a royalty adjustment should be arranged so as to be \u201cless disruptive to the industries.\u201d 46 Fed.Reg. at 10,486. Although the Tribunal concluded that a single increase to the full four-cent rate would not be unduly disruptive, <em>id. </em>at 10,481, it was within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion to give the industry adequate lead time to prepare for the increase. See, e. <em>g., National Ass\u2019n of Independent Television Producers &amp; Dis-tribs. v. FCC, </em>502 F.2d 249 (2d Cir. 1974). While we cannot deny that, on this point, the Tribunal\u2019s decision was \u201cof less than ideal clarity,\u201d nonetheless we must uphold the determination \u201cif the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, <em>42 </em>L.Ed.2d 447 (1974). That test is met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">We find more troubling, however, the Tribunal\u2019s reservation of authority to calculate appropriate interim adjustment figures through annual proceedings. The procedure set out in the Tribunal\u2019s rules requires an annual change in the royalty rate \u201cdirectly proportionate to the change, if any, in the average suggested retail list price of albums\u201d over a designated twelve-month period. 46 Fed.Reg. 892 (1981) (to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.3(a)). The rule goes on to define the \u201caverage suggested retail list price of albums\u201d as the average determined from a \u201crepresentative group\u201d to be chosen by the CRT (j. <em>e., </em>the Tribunal) from \u201cCRT-conducted surveys and/or studies which it may deem necessary, advisable and appropriate,\u201d with due consideration to studies submitted by interested parties. <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.3(b), (c)). Even this procedure may be superseded, however, \u201c[i]n the event that albums made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and distributed in the United States without a suggested retail list price distort the average suggested retail list price, so that it does not reflect record price changes in the relevant period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.4(a)). In that case, \u201cCRT-eon-ducted surveys and/or studies\u201d will be used to determine an \u201caverage wholesale price\u201d from a \u201crepresentative group\u201d of albums. <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.4(b), (c)). It is evident from this description of the Tribunal\u2019s intended analysis that the Tribunal expects to wield its expert discretion in selecting representative groups of recordings and deciding whether the average price they yield is unduly distorted.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The copyright users argue that \u201c[b]y its ambiguity and breadth, the rule gives the Tribunal standing authority to monitor and regulate the recorded music industry and discretion to reconsider the compulsory rate <em>ah initio </em>each year for the next seven years.\u201d Brief for Petitioners RIAA and CBS at 64 (footnote omitted). This contention is somewhat overstated: the Tribunal\u2019s rule does not authorize a reexamination of the recording industry\u2019s profits or the creative contributions of the owners and the users. All that the procedure requires is an analysis of recording industry pricing patterns. Nonetheless, we conclude that this annual analysis is a task that Congress did not intend for the Tribunal to undertake, and that the Tribunal has overstepped the bounds of its statutory authority by scheduling annual proceedings for the exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The Copyright Act establishes the Tribunal as a permanent body, and authorizes it to settle controversies over the distribution of royalty fees deposited with the Register of Copyrights under sections 111 and 116 whenever the Tribunal determines that such a controversy exists. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801(b)(3), 804(d) (1976). In contrast, the Act does not grant the Tribunal continuous jurisdiction to monitor the fairness of royalty rates. Rather, the statute sets out a precise schedule for initiation and conclusion of proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 804. Proceedings for the adjustment of the royalty under the compulsory license for phonorecords are to be commenced on January 1, 1980, and thereafter only in response to petitions which may be filed \u201cin 1987 and in each subsequent tenth calendar year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 804(a)(1), (2)(B). All proceedings are to be \u201cinitiated without delay following publication of notice,\u201d and the Tribunal is to \u201crender its final decision in any such proceeding within one year from the date of such publication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 804(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Because the timetable for proceedings is so rigid, it is conceivable that economic changes unforeseen at the time of the most recent rate proceeding could create an unfairness in the royalty rate that could not be rectified until the next rate proceeding. The statute itself demonstrates that Congress recognized and accepted this possibility: the inflexibility of the timetable is highlighted by the narrow provision for additional proceedings to adjust the royalty rate for secondary transmission by cable systems in the event of certain changes in federal regulatory policy. Cable royalty adjustments to reflect national monetary inflation and changes in rates to cable subscribers are permitted only in 1980 and each subsequent fifth calendar year, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 804(a)(1), (2)(A), but adjustments in response to amendments to certain Federal Communications Commission rules governing cable operation are permitted whenever the FCC implements such changes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 804(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The statute thus indicates that Congress intended the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to determine royalty rates only at recurring intervals. This indication is fully borne out by the legislative history. The long intervals between Tribunal proceedings were not accidental, but were the product of a continuing process of compromise between opposing interests. <em>See, e. g., 1975 Senate Report </em>at 169 (additional views of Sen. Tunney); 122 Cong.Rec. 3823 (1976) (remarks of Sen. Thurmond). The House report explained its reasons for choosing different intervals for the different royalty rates, in terms demonstrating a belief that the Tribunal would not be reevaluating the economic situation between statutory proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>[T]he Committee recognizes that the cable television industry is a developing industry in transition, whereas the recording and jukebox industries are long-established. Therefore, the Committee has chosen periods of different lengths in which the [Copyright Royalty] Commission is to review the rates affecting those industries. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">The Committee has chosen to stagger the times for review of the various rates established under the bill so as to balance the workload of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>1976 House Report </em>at 173, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 5789.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The copyright owners and the Tribunal itself, in defending the Tribunal\u2019s proposed interim adjustment system, have not presented any evidence from the legislative history indicating that the conversion of the Tribunal from an ad hoc panel of arbitrators to a permanent agency was intended to change the nature of the Tribunal\u2019s functions during the periods between statutory rate proceedings. The reasons given in the House for reconstituting the Tribunal were avoiding possible constitutional infirmities and strengthening the Tribunal\u2019s ability to carry out the responsibilities it already possessed. <em>See </em>note 13 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text; <em>1976 House Report </em>at 174; 122 Cong.Rec. 34,226 (1976) (remarks of Rep. Kastenmeier). Yet it is clear from the Senate debates<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and from the structure of the Senate\u2019s ad hoc Tribunal proposal that no adjustment proceedings were intended for interim years \u2014 indeed, no proceedings were <em>possible, </em>since the \u201cTribunal\u201d was to consist of separate panels of arbitrators, each selected for a single rate proceeding in the years designated by the bill, producing its final decision within a year. <em>See </em>Senate Bill \u00a7\u00a7 802, 803(a), 804(e); <em>1975 Senate Report </em>at 36, 157.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The Senate debates also contain the fullest elucidation of the harms inherent in frequent rate review, which justified acceptance of the possibility that some inequity would develop during the interim periods. One disadvantage of frequent Tribunal proceedings was the expense to the parties resulting from active administrative and judicial litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">First of all, the procedure set out in chapter 8 for accomplishing a review of the fee schedules entrusted to the tribunal is a complex one. It will take almost 2 years to complete, even disregarding the possibility of subsequent judicial review. Because this process is time-consuming and complex, it will necessarily be costly for the industries involved, and these costs must obviously be passed on eventually to consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">122 Cong.Rec. 3148 (1976) (remarks of Sen. Beall). Another ill effect of decreasing the period between adjustments was its unsettling effect on industry planning. \u201c[T]he industry needs rate certainty for a fixed, stable period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(statement of Sen. Abourezk); <em>see id. </em>at 3149 (remarks of Sen. Beall).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Thus, the legislative history and the structure of the statute itself evidence a deliberate congressional intent to limit the Tribunal\u2019s exercise of discretion in evaluating economic and other factors relating to the fairness of the royalty rate to the review proceedings provided by the statute. This interpretation of the statute is in substantial agreement with the Tribunal\u2019s own interpretation, as set out in its regulations. For example, those regulations provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that, after 1980, \u201cfor rate adjustment proceedings to comme[n]ce, a petition must be filed by an interested party according to the [statutory] schedule.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.61(b) (1980). Furthermore, \u201c[f]ollowing the publication of a final determination in the <em>Federal Register </em>the Tribunal shall not reopen or'conduct any further proceedings.\u201d <em>- Id. </em>\u00a7 301.68. Nonetheless, without even alluding to the statutory limits on its authority to conduct proceedings, the Tribunal adopted its scheme for determining through its own expertise an average price of records. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. at 10,485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The Tribunal itself has given no explanation of how these nonstatutory proceedings can be reconciled with the statute, but its counsel argues that the interim proceedings are permissible because they are not the same <em>kind </em>of proceeding as the statutory rate determinations. Rather than a plenary reconsideration of the fairness of the return the rate affords to the copyright owners and users, these proceedings are intended \u201cto maintain the real fee level\u201d in the face of raging inflation. Brief for Respondent Copyright Royalty Tribunal at 48 (emphasis omitted).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But regardless of the narrower scope of the intended inquiry, the analysis of record industry pricing structure is sure to be complex and expensive, and possesses ample potential for spawning litigation. Not only would the Tribunal be free to choose among competing \u201crepresentative samples\u201d in determining average list prices, but it would also have the option of rejecting list prices as \u201cdistorted\u201d and switching to a wholesale pricing model. Congress intended that the Tribunal undertake such analyses of the economics of the recording industry only at the widely-spaced recurring statutory proceedings.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">We do not suggest that the Tribunal must set a flat rate that will remain in effect until the next rate determination in 1987. If economic conditions make it implausible that any numerical rate will remain reasonable over the next seven years, then we see nothing in the statute precluding the Tribunal from adopting a reasonable mechanism for automatic rate changes in interim years. <em>See Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 776, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 1364, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). But, whatever the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s adjustment powers may be, the mechanism chosen must be well-determined and beyond the Tribunal\u2019s discretion, and judicial review of the reasonableness of the chosen mechanism must be available as part of the review of the Tribunal\u2019s statutory rate proceeding. It is possible' that an automatic adjustment mechanism will subject the copyright owners to some inequities during interim periods, but this is the \u201cdelicate balance\u201d that Congress decreed in the Copyright Act. <em>See </em>122 Cong.Rec. 3823 (1976) (remarks of Sen. Abourezk).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">We conclude that the Tribunal impermis-sibly awarded itself discretion to reevaluate economic conditions in the recording industry as a part of its rate adjustment mechanism. The scope of the discretion reserved may be relatively narrow when compared to the plenary review proceedings, but the statute gives the Tribunal no authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>engage in discretionary interim proceedings on this subject at all. Accordingly, the adjustment regulations, 46 Fed.Reg. 892 (1981) (to be codified at 37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 307.3, 307.4), cannot be upheld. This case must be remanded to the Tribunal for further proceedings to allow the Tribunal, if it so desires, to adopt an alternative scheme of interim rate adjustment that does not require annual exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Since this defect in the Tribunal\u2019s decision does not impair the reasonableness of the royalty rate as set for 1981, our remand is not intended to obstruct the effectiveness of the four-cent royalty rate as of July 1,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Congress created a permanent Copyright Royalty Tribunal to set fair royalty rates under the compulsory licenses in accordance with a consistent and articulated royalty policy. The statutory criteria determining the reasonableness of the phonorecord royalty rate provide significant guidance to the Tribunal, but they also leave it considerable discretion in charting royalty policy. We expect that in future years the staggering of the Tribunal\u2019s workload will permit a fuller explanation of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions, more facilitative of judicial review, but we find on the whole that the Tribunal has adequately explained its reasons and adduced support for its adjustment of the royalty rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s rate adjustment withstands the attacks launched by the various petitioners from their respective sides, and that the Tribunal did not act arbitrarily or unlawfully in deferring the effective date of the new rate. We find, however, that the Tribunal exceeded its authority in adopting its procedure for interim rate adjustments. Accordingly, the case is remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the Tribunal to consider whether it wishes to adopt an alternative scheme for interim adjustments that is within the limits ordained by Congress. In all other respects the Tribunal\u2019s decision is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">.

The Tribunal found that designation of a small portion of the singer-songwriters\u2019 fees as a royalty for use of the composition is merely conventional, and does not change the fact that the heavy compensation of these performers is a product of bargaining, not of the compulsory license system. <em>Id. </em>The Tribunal was entitled to conclude that the wealth of the singer-songwriters does not justify denying nonsinging songwriters a fair return, and that evidence documenting this wealth was essentially irrelevant to the royalty proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\">. Petitioners RIAA and CBS take a somewhat ambiguous position on the propriety of considering inflation at all in the royalty rate proceeding, <em>see </em>Brief for Petitioners RIAA and CBS Inc. at 39-40 &amp; n.104. It is obvious, however, that the purchasing power of the return to the copyright owners is an essential element in determining the fairness of the return, <em>see </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 801(b)(1)(B) (1976), in evaluating the effectiveness of the rate in maximizing the availability of musical works, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 801(b)(1)(A), and in setting a rate that reflects the relative roles of copyright owners and users, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 801(b)(1)(C), particularly where the owners\u2019 rate is fixed by law and the users remain free to charge what the market will bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">We agree with petitioners that the Tribunal would be acting improperly if it ignored the statutory criteria altogether and set the rate merely by multiplying the interim figure in \u00a7 115(c)(2) by the increase in the consumer price index over some interval of time. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioners RIAA and CBS Inc. at 34-46. Petitioners present no genuine evidence, however, that this was the Tribunal\u2019s method. The Tribunal\u2019s exhaustive proceedings and its twenty-page opinion would be a massive exercise in hypocrisy if petitioners were correct. Petitioners calculate that an appropriate choice of base period would give a roughly equivalent number, they lift out of context the Tribunal\u2019s allusions to inflation as a factor affecting the fairness of a given royalty rate, and they purport to reconstruct backroom bargaining by reading between the lines in the brief dissent of Tribunal Commissioner Burg, <em>see </em>46 Fed.Reg. at 10,486-87. This is hardly a showing that would rebut the strong presumption of regularity in administrative decision-making. <em>See, e. g., Hercules, Inc. v.

The Tribunal also found, for example, that from 1955 to 1979 composers\u2019 royalties had declined from being slightly greater than performers\u2019 royalties to barely a quarter of the performers\u2019 share, <em>id. </em>at 10,485, and that from 1964 to 1974 copyright owners\u2019 royalty payments declined from 11.2% of wholesale record price to 7.2%, <em>id. </em>at 10,481.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\">.

The copyright owners also argue that their cross-examination of industry testimony was unduly impaired by the Tribunal\u2019s failure to insist that the data underlying a commissioned economic survey be disclosed. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. at 10,478. As we have observed, <em>see </em>note 17 and accompanying text supra, the Copyright Act does not require formal hearing procedures before the Tribunal.

While we do not condone RIAA\u2019s defiance of the Tribunal\u2019s request for data, we see nothing in the regulations that would preclude the Tribunal from withdrawing its request, or that would require the Tribunal to strike a survey from the record because a request for underlying data had been denied. The Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of its \u00f3wn regulations is, of course, entitled to deference. <em>See Bowles v.

Since the survey in question was not determinative of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, and since it was corroborated by other evidence, we agree that it was sufficient for the Tribunal to view the refusal to submit possibly confidential data as \u201cgo[ing] to the weight we should accord their evidence, not to its admissibility.\u201d 46 Fed.Reg. at 10,478.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b69-12\">.

The significance of the expression \u201cto maintain the real fee level\u201d is not entirely clear. Contrary to the implication in NMPA\u2019s arguments that inflationary pressure on the purchasing value of the royalty rate is the key, <em>see </em>Answering Brief for Intervenor NMPA at 23-27, the adjustment procedure is not designed to track changes in the purchasing power of the dollar. Rather, royalty payments are increased only to the extent that record manufacturers increase the prices of their products. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. at 10,486. Maintaining the royalty as a constant fraction of average record prices appears to be more related to guaranteeing copyright owners a fair share of industry revenues than to compensating for erosion of the rate by inflation. This approach is, of course, within the discretion of the Tribunal; we do not suggest that tying the royalty rate to the consumer price index would be more appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b73-12\">. Our inability to defer to the Tribunal on this point of statutory interpretation results from the clarity of the statutory language and the legislative history, the failure of the Tribunal to address the legal point directly, and the irrelevance of the Tribunal\u2019s expertise to the legal question of its authority to institute proceedings between the statutory dates. <em>See, e. g., Office of Consumers' Counsel v. FERC, </em>655 F.2d 1132 at 1141-1142 (D.C.Cir.1980), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. The statutory provision requiring the Tribunal to render its final decision within one year from initiation of proceedings, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 804(e) (1976), does not preclude further proceedings on direction of a court exercising judicial review. <em>See Jacksonville Port Authority v. Adams, </em>556 F.2d 52, 56 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
