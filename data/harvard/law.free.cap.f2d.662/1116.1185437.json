Watkins, </em>655 F.2d 1346, 1367-77 (5th Cir. 1981)), as \u201cpatterned after Mississippi Model Jury Instruction 114.07\u201d (Respondents-Appellees Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc at i) and represented that the instruction given \u201cis presently in use throughout the State of Mississippi.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at ii, n. 1. In view of the fact that the court\u2019s opinion in this case suggested that, for several reasons specified in the opinion, 655 F.2d at 1377, the practical impact of its holding should be relatively narrow, the State\u2019s representation in the Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc caused us to obtain a copy of Mississippi Model Jury Instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>No. 114.07, as in effect during at least a part of 1977 (the year of Washington\u2019s trial). The relevant portion follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-4\">If an element of aggravation is found to exist, then you must consider whether there are mitigating circumstances which outweigh the aggravating circumstance^). Consider the following elements) of mitigation in determining whether the death penalty should not be imposed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-6\">(1) That the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-7\">(2) That the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance when the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-8\">(3) That the victim participated in the defendant\u2019s conduct or consented to the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-9\">(4) That the defendant was an accomplice to the capital murder committed by another person and the defendant\u2019s participation was relatively minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-10\">(5) That the defendant was under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-11\">(6) That the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of this conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-12\">(7) The defendant\u2019s age at the time of the capital murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-13\">(8) Any other facts which you find from the evidence reasonably mitigates against imposition of the death penalty. If you find from the evidence that [one</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-14\">or more of] the preceding element(s) constitutes a mitigating circumstanee(s), then you must consider whether [it/they] outweigh(s) the aggravating circumstances you previously found, and you must return one of the following verdicts. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axq-dedup-0\">If the instruction given in this case was, in fact, patterned after the Model Jury Instruction, a comparison of the instruction given (reproduced at 655 F.2d 1367-68) and the Model Jury Instruction demonstrates that, whether by design or by inadvertence, the trial judge omitted paragraph (8) of the Model Jury Instruction, which authorizes the jury to consider \u201cany other facts which you find from the evidence reasonably mitigates [sic] against imposition of the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-17\">We assume that the State\u2019s seemingly equivocal representations to the district court (described at 655 F.2d 1377, n. 59) and its representations to this court in the Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc were inadvertent. In any event, they did place upon the district court and have placed on this court unnecessary and regretable burdens.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
