The National Labor Relations Board summarily affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \u201crulings, findings, and conclusions\u201d and adopted his order with a slight modification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pioneer petitions for review, and the Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. We grant Pioneer\u2019s petition and deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\">In March 1978, a union began a campaign to organize Pioneer\u2019s employees at Pioneer\u2019s several places of business. The campaign ended on October 13, 1978. There is no evidence in the record that Pioneer actively opposed this or any other union. The union simply failed to gain sufficient support from the employees. As the ALJ found, Pioneer demonstrated \u201clittle or no\u201d anti-union animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">The violations found in this case all occurred in one department on one floor in one of Pioneer\u2019s many facilities. This \u201cgas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>measurement\u201d department had 17 non-supervisory employees; all but one were female. Five women worked under the supervision of James Blatzheim, the chief clerk of gas measurement; the others worked under the supervision of James Goldston, the computer supervisor. Both Blatzheim and Goldston reported to supervisor Bob Brotherton; Brotherton reported to Guy Bufkin, the Assistant Director of the Department; and Bufkin reported to Bob Spikes, the Director. With a single exception, all of the events involved three of the five employees who worked for Blatzheim\u2014 Ninnevah Kay Younger, Biolanda Benitez, and Deborah Gallegos (the \u201creprimandees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The ALJ found, and the record makes clear, that, prior to June 1978, there was constant bickering between the three repri-mandees and some of the women who worked for Goldston. On June 6, the three were called individually into Blatzheim\u2019s office and were reprimanded for criticizing, badgering, deliberately antagonizing, and threatening violence against Goldston\u2019s employees, and for making deliberate mistakes on the job and bragging that supervisors couldn\u2019t tell them what to do. That all of these charges had some basis in fact is established by the three reprimandees\u2019 own testimony at the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ found, however, that the reprimands were issued because two of the three had attended a union meeting on May 25, and because all three had thereafter distributed union cards and advocated the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The ALJ also found that two statements Blatzheim made to Younger on June 6, and two questions Goldston asked Benitez and another employee in late May and early June, were instances of \u201crestraint and coercion\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Finally, the ALJ found that the discharge of Gallegos in June 1979, over eight months after the union campaign had ended, was in retaliation for her attempt to engage in \u201cconcerted activity\u201d protected by \u00a7 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">As we have said, all of the ALJ\u2019s determinations were affirmed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">II. <em>Review of the Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">We are, of course, bound by the Board\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record \u201cconsidered as a whole.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>see Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). If the Board applies an erroneous legal rule in concluding that the facts establish a violation of the Act, however, we are not bound by the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Act has been violated. <em>See Allied Chem. &amp; Alkali Workers v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>404 U.S. 157, 182, 92 S.Ct. 383, 399, 30 L.Ed.2d 341 (1971) (\u201cthe legal standard to be applied is ultimately for the courts to decide and enforce\u201d). Instead, we apply the Board\u2019s factual findings to the correct legal standard. If the Board has not made a necessary finding, we may nevertheless sustain its conclusion if the record clearly supports the omitted finding. If the record is unclear, we may remand to the agency for further proceedings. If the record clearly provides no support for the necessary finding, however, we may deny enforcement without resort to remand. <em>See Delco-Remy Div., Gen. Motors Corp. v. NLRB, </em>596 F.2d 1295, 1309-10 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">With these principles in mind, we review the Board\u2019s determinations on each of the alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>A. <em>The Reprimands</em></p>\n<p id=\"ate-dedup-0\">The ALJ concluded that the decision to reprimand Younger, Benitez and Gallegos was discrimination that violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to prove that Pioneer discriminated against its employees, \u201cthe Board must show that the particular supervisor responsible for the [action] knew about [the employees\u2019] union activities,\u201d <em>Delchamps, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>585 F.2d 91, 94 (5th Cir. 1978), and that the employees\u2019 union activities were a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s action, <em>Delco-Remy, </em>596 F.2d at 1305; <em>NLRB v. Whitfield Pickle Co., </em>374 F.2d 576, 582 (5th Cir. 1967) (anti-union animus must be a \u201cbut for\u201d cause). In establishing the knowledge element, the Board may not simply \u201cimpute\u201d the knowledge of a lower-level supervisor to the decision-making supervisor, <em>Delchamps, </em>585 F.2d at 94; the Board may, however, \u201crel[y] on circumstantial evidence to infer that the knowledge of one supervisor has been communicated\u201d to the other, <em>id. </em>at 95 (citing <em>Texas Aluminum Co. v. NLRB, </em>435 F.2d 917, 919 (5th Cir. 1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The ALJ found that Blatzheim learned on May 24 that Younger planned to attend a union meeting on May 25, and that he learned on May 26 that Younger was distributing union cards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ALJ also found that Goldston learned on May 25 that Beni-tez planned to attend the meeting. In addition, the ALJ noted that Blatzheim and Goldston worked in the vicinity of the three reprimandees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From these facts, the ALJ found \u201cthat Respondent, through its supervisors Blatzheim and Goldston, was aware of [the three employees\u2019 union] activities during late May, 1978.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">The undisputed evidence shows, and the ALJ found, that neither Blatzheim nor Goldston made the decision to reprimand the three employees. That decision was made by Assistant Director Bufkin and Director Spikes. Neither the ALJ nor the Board found that Bufkin or Spikes was aware of the reprimandees\u2019 union activities, or that Blatzheim or Goldston communicated his knowledge to Bufkin or Spikes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that the ALJ performed the \u201cmechanical imputation\u201d of knowledge rejected in <em>Delchamps, </em>585 F.2d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">The Board argues that, despite its failure to follow <em>Delchamps, </em>the circumstances surrounding the reprimand support the inference that Spikes and Bufkin knew of the reprimandees\u2019 union activities. We think that there is no support in the record for this inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">The reprimandees\u2019 own testimony establishes that the reprimandees themselves were not aware of the union campaign before May 18, 1978. Pioneer claimed at the hearing that the decision to reprimand was made in April. Pioneer\u2019s supervisors testified that the continuing complaints from Goldston\u2019s employees about the repriman-dees were brought to Bufkin\u2019s attention sometime in April. Bufkin testified that he and Spikes decided to reprimand the three, and had Goldston\u2019s employees reduce their complaints to writing. Even if the ALJ disbelieved this testimony, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Counsel was presented with two such written complaints at trial, and stipulated on the record that the written complaints were indeed given to management by two of Goldston\u2019s employees on May 7 and May 8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The General Counsel also stipulated on the record that Goldston submitted a written statement concerning his employees\u2019 complaints on May 19, and that Blatzheim submitted his own written statement on May 22. All of this activity concerning the complaints occurred before Blatzheim or Gold-ston learned of the reprimandees\u2019 union activities, most of it before the reprimandees themselves even knew there was a union. There is no evidence in the record that, after they found out that Younger and Benitez had attended the union meeting, Blatzheim or Goldston participated in any way in the decision to issue the reprimands on June 6<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or communicated their knowledge to Bufkin and Spikes during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The Board argues that other circumstantial evidence, relied on by the ALJ in finding that the reprimand was motivated by the union activities, supports the inference that Bufkin and Spikes knew that the repri-mandees were union supporters. The ALJ relied most heavily on two statements that, he found, Blatzheim made to Younger on June 6. Younger testified that, after Blat-zheim had read to her the reprimand written by Spikes, he told her, \u201cMaybe [the reprimand] has something to do with your union activities.\u201d Younger claimed that Blatzheim made a similar statement to her and her husband later that day in the company parking lot. Blatzheim denied making either statement, but the ALJ discredited his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Although we think that the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Blatzheim\u2019s testimony are unpersuasive,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we accept his credibility determination. Even so, we do not see how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the two statements tend to prove that Buf-kin or Spikes knew of Younger\u2019s union activities. First, under Younger\u2019s own description of the statements, Blatzheim did not purport to know the reason for the reprimands, much less know whether Buf-kin or Spikes knew of Younger\u2019s union activities; he merely suggested a possible explanation for Younger\u2019s reprimand. Second, according to the ALJ\u2019s findings, Blatzheim was the only individual who knew of Younger\u2019s union activities. He was the only one who could have communicated information about Younger\u2019s union activities to Bufkin and Spikes. Since, under Younger\u2019s version of the facts, Blat-zheim was acting as her confidant in revealing Pioneer\u2019s possible motives, we think it unlikely that he would also be informing the company of her union activities. The ALJ drew no such inference, and we refuse to draw it on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Nor do we think that any of the other circumstances relied on by the ALJ in finding causation provide substantial evidence for the inference that Bufkin or Spikes was aware of the reprimandees\u2019 union activities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since the Board has not proved this element of its case, its conclusion that the reprimands violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and \u00a7 8(a)(1) cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">B. <em>The Section 8(a)(1) Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The Board concluded that, in three separate instances, Pioneer had engaged in activity that tended \u201cto interfere with, restrain [and] coerce employees\u201d in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). One instance concerned Blatzheim\u2019s statements to Younger; the other two concerned questions Goldston asked Benitez and another employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\"><em>Blatzheim\u2019s Statements </em>[6] To establish a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation, the Board need not show actual restraint or coercion; it need only draw from the credited evidence the reasonable conclusion that the employer\u2019s conduct would tend to restrain or coerce employees from engaging in protected activities. <em>See NLRB v. Henriksen, Inc., </em>481 F.2d 1156, 1161-62 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>NLRB v. Varo, Inc., </em>425 F.2d 293, 298 (5th Cir. 1970). In reviewing the reasonableness of the Board\u2019s conclusion, the court \u201cmust recognize the Board\u2019s compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tence in the first instance to judge the impact of utterances made in the context of the employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 620, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1943, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The ALJ concluded that Blatzheim\u2019s two statements on June 6 \u201cwould clearly tend to restrain and coerce employes [s/c] from engaging in union activities.\u201d We do not think that this conclusion could reasonably be drawn from the credited evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Blatzheim\u2019s first statement, as recounted by Younger, was made in Blatzheim\u2019s office after he had read the reprimand written by Spikes. Younger told Blatzheim that she didn\u2019t understand the charges. Blatzheim replied, \u201cI don\u2019t understand them either, Kay. Maybe it has something to do with your union activities.\u201d If this incident were taken in isolation, perhaps the Board could reasonably have concluded that Blatzheim saw the reprimands as an opportunity to discourage Younger from further participation in the union campaign. The statement, however, must be taken in the context in. which Younger claims it was made'. Later that same day, Younger claimed that Blat-zheim spoke to her and her husband in the parking lot. Blatzheim told Mr. Younger, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s got to be something with Kay with her union activities. I think, Bob, <em>I would get a lawyer and Pd see if I could get something done on </em>that\u201d (emphasis added). This second statement, rather than one that \u201cwould clearly tend to restrain and coerce,\u201d was a statement encouraging Younger to assert her rights. Indeed, the very picture that Younger attempted to paint with her testimony, which the ALJ credited, was that Blatzheim was on her side concerning the union issue: Younger testified that when she first mentioned the union to Blatzheim on May 24, Blatzheim replied that the union would be \u201ca good thing for you\u201d; that Blatzheim later told her that he had tried to talk Bufkin out of the reprimands on June 2; and that Blatzheim repeatedly told her on June 6 that he did not think that her reprimand was justified.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In fact, Younger believed that Blatzheim was such an ally and friend of the union cause that she asked him to testify for the union in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We think it was unreasonable for the Board to conclude that two statements, which Younger herself considered to be sympathetic statements of support for her and her union activities, tended to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights. We think it even more unreasonable to find that the statements constituted unfair labor practices on the part of Pioneer, which demonstrated no anti-union animus, engaged in no active campaign of opposition to the union, and in fact encouraged its employees to listen to what the union had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\n<em>The Interrogations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Reprimandee Benitez testified that, on May-25,1978, Goldston asked her if she was going to the union meeting that night, and pointed out that unionization \u201chad its good points and its bad, you know, and I had to take it into consideration that Pioneer had good benefits.\u201d Another employee, Maria Escoto, testified that on June 1, 1978 Gold-ston asked her, after a conversation in his office on other subjects, whether she had signed a union card. When she did not respond, he said that \u201cthey would know who filled one out and who didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">In contrast to his conclusion concerning Blatzheim\u2019s statements, the AU did not expressly find that Goldston\u2019s two questions had a tendency to coerce. Rather, he merely described the two incidents and concluded, in \u00e9ffect, that they were <em>per se </em>violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1). This was error. \u201cIt is well established in this Circuit that interrogation of employees is not illegal <em>per se.. . . </em>\u2018To fall within the ambit of \u00a7 8(a)(1), either the words themselves or the context in which they are used must suggest an element of coercion or interference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delco-Remy, </em>596 F.2d at 1309 (quoting <em>NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., </em>339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>F.2d 498, 500 (5th Cir. 1964)). In <em>Delco-Remy, </em>we made it clear that the Board must consider a number of criteria in determining whether the questioning \u201csuggest[s] an element of coercion or interference\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOR\">\u201c(1) the history of the employer\u2019s attitude towards its employees; (2) the type of information sought or related; (3) the company rank of the questioner; (4) the place and manner of the conversation; (5) the truthfulness of the employee\u2019s responses; (6) whether the employer had a valid purpose in obtaining the information; (7) if so, whether this purpose was communicated to the employee, and (8) whether the employer assures employees that no reprisals will be taken if they support the union.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">596 F.2d at 1309 (quoting <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Aero Corp., </em>581 F.2d 511, 514 (5th Cir. 1978)). This list is not definitive, and the Board may find that other factors suggest an element of coercion, even when the listed factors \u201ccut in favor of the employer.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Cameo, Inc., </em>340 F.2d 803, 804 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 926, 86 S.Ct. 313, 15 L.Ed.2d 339 (1965). We made it clear in <em>Delco-Remy, </em>however, that the Board may not ignore these factors and find a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation \u201cin a conclusory fashion.\u201d 596 F.2d at 1309. As in <em>Delco-Remy, </em>that is exactly what the Board did here; and, as in <em>Delco-Remy, </em>we find that the record does not support the Board\u2019s conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 1310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Goldston\u2019s question to Benitez is the kind of casual question that this court has never held to be a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation. <em>See Delco-Remy, </em>596 F.2d at 1310; <em>Mueller Brass Co. v. NLRB, </em>544 F.2d 815, 820-21 (5th Cir. 1977) (involving more intrusive questioning against a clear history of strenuous anti-union activity); <em>NLRB v. O. A. Fuller Super Markets, Inc., </em>374 F.2d 197, 203 (5th Cir. 1967). Certainly there is nothing inherently coercive about the lowest-level supervisor asking an employee, with whom, as the record clearly demonstrates, he engaged in friendly conversation on a daily basis, whether she was going to attend a union meeting, and observing that unionization has \u201cits good points and its bad.\u201d \u201c[interrogation which is not in itself threatening ... must meet fairly severe standards, normally including the showing of a background of employer discrimination and a demonstration that the circumstances of the interrogation would reasonably induce fear of reprisal.\u201d <em>O. A. Fuller Super Markets, </em>374 F.2d at 203. Pioneer has no history of anti-union discrimination. The three-sentence conversation took place when Benitez wandered into another employee\u2019s office, where Goldston was already engaged in conversation with the other employee. Benitez had no hesitation in telling Goldston that she planned to attend the meeting. Finally, Goldston\u2019s \u201cgood points and bad points\u201d remark negated any implication that Pioneer intended to take reprisals against those who attended the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Similar considerations apply to the Goldston-Escoto conversation. The Board points out that this conversation took place in Goldston\u2019s office, that Escoto declined to answer Goldston\u2019s question and that Goldston\u2019s remark \u2014 \u201cthey would know who filled [a card] out and who didn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 could have been taken as a veiled threat of reprisal. Escoto, however, did not testify that she took the remark that way.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Goldston testified that he meant the remark as a joke, and Escoto did not contradict this testimony. Moreover, the conversation took place just two days after Bufkin had made a speech telling the employees to attend union meetings if they wanted to. On a record as barren as this one of any active opposition to the union, any systematic interrogation of employees, or any other circumstances suggesting an element of coercion, we cannot uphold the conclusion that this single incident is a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). <em>Cf. Delco-Remy, </em>596 F.2d at 1306-11 (three interrogations, each more lengthy and intrusive than one at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>here, held not a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation despite background of company opposition to union).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">C. <em>The Discharge of Gallegos</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On Friday, June 22, 1979, eight months after the union campaign had ended, Velma Hall, a black employee, went to Goldston to complain about a problem. On Monday, June 25, Goldston had Hall put her problem in writing. Hall wrote in her own hand that, every single day from June 19 through June 22, Deborah Gallegos had repeatedly informed her that Helen Wilborn, another co-worker, had said \u201cthat she didn\u2019t like to error check with me and that she just don\u2019t like niggers.\u201d Hall\u2019s written statement related that she had \u201cerror checked\u201d with Helen several times that week and had had no problems with Helen. After each session, however, Gallegos would come to her and repeat the racial insults that Helen had allegedly made. On Wednesday, Hall wrote, \u201call [Gallegos] did was tell me what Hellen [s;c] said.\u201d On Thursday, \u201cshe just kept on telling me things like this ... . \u201d Finally, on Friday morning, Hall reported, \u201cI think that Deborah wanted me to have words <em>with Hellen </em>about what she had told me. But I just looked over it. That morning after I had finish [sic] error checking with Hellen, no problems at all, . . . Deborah ... called me into [an office]. I went to see what she wanted not thinking it would something else Hellen said .... I told her that I was so tired of her telling me every day something about what Hellen had said and to just [have] Hellen tell me. I told her I was going to tell James [Gold-ston] about it because if I didn\u2019t know how to error check that he would see to it that I learn how, and she went on telling me that Hellen said this and Hellen said that so I just went right to James\u2019 office and told him about it\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">The day after Hall wrote this account, Bufkin called Gallegos into his office and asked if she had made these statements. Gallegos admitted that she had, but said that Wilborn had actually made the statements to her. Bufkin fired Gallegos on the spot, reminding her that this was the kind of conduct for which she had been reprimanded. That evening, Hall became so afraid that Gallegos would take reprisals against her that she had to have two police officers escort her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">The ALJ concluded that Gallegos\u2019 behavior was \u201cconcerted activity\u201d under \u00a7 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that Gallegos was discharged for engaging in such activity in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(a)(1). The ALJ credited Gallegos\u2019 testimony<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that she encouraged Hall to go to Goldston with \u201cthe Wilborn matter\u201d because she \u201cfelt\u201d that \u201cthat was the best way to go about it instead of us taking care of it ourselves. That way [Goldston] would know what was said and who said it and that way we can clear it up.\u201d The ALJ concluded that Gallegos\u2019 behavior was concerted activity because it related to \u201ca matter of common concern\u201d \u2014 an atmosphere of racial tension.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>It is unbelievable that Gallegos was at all concerned about the work atmosphere. When asked on cross-examination why she did not go herself to complain to a supervisor, Gallegos replied that Wilborn\u2019s alleged racial remarks \u2014 including remarks insulting Gallegos\u2019 own race and her husband\u2019s race \u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t bother me that much.\u201d It was only after a week of harassing Hall, and after suggesting that Hall confront Wil-born, that Gallegos suggested that Hall go to a supervisor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Even if we accept the Board\u2019s finding that the work atmosphere was Gallegos\u2019 concern, however, we doubt that Gallegos engaged in any \u201cconcerted activity\u201d protected by \u00a7 7. In the leading case of <em>Mushroom Transportation </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>330 F.2d 683 (3d Cir. 1964), the court held that advising another employee of his rights is not \u201cconcerted activity.\u201d Imorder for conversations between two employees to constitute \u201cconcerted activity,\u201d there must be \u201csome element of collective activity or contemplation thereof.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Buddies Supermarkets, Inc., </em>481 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1973) (citing <em>Mushroom Transportation). </em>There is no evidence in the record that Gallegos ever proposed collective activity to Hall; the only evidence is that she told Hall to go to a supervisor. While Gallegos may have \u201cfelt\u201d that this was the best way for \u201cus\u201d to handle it, there is no evidence that she ever expressed her \u201cfeeling\u201d to anyone else or suggested that going to Goldston would be a collective effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Thus, the only ground on which we could hold that Gallegos engaged in concerted activity is that she \u201ccontemplated\u201d group action. Even if we could hold that such personal \u201ccontemplation\u201d is sufficient, however, we cannot uphold the Board\u2019s conclusion that Pioneer violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and \u00a7 8(a)(1) by discharging Gallegos because there is no evidence that Gallegos\u2019 discharge was motivated by participation in the protected activities she \u201ccontemplated.\u201d Bufkin and Brotherton made the decision to discharge Gallegos. There is no evidence that either Bufkin or Brotherton knew that Gallegos had told Hall to go to a supervisor. All Bufkin and Brotherton had before them was Hall\u2019s written statement. This statement does not indicate that Gallegos ever suggested that Hall go to management to complain; the only suggestion recounted in the statement is that Hall directly confront Wilborn. Furthermore, there is no evidence that, when Bufkin called Gallegos in to ask her whether she had indeed made the statements that Hall attributed to her, Gallegos ever told Bufkin or Brotherton that she suggested that Hall go to management; she merely insisted that what she had said about Wilborn was true. Thus, there is no evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that \u201cGallegos was discharged because she insisted that Hall go to her supervisor and \u2018clear it up.\u2019 \u201d Since Bufkin and Brotherton did not know that Gallegos told Hall to go to her supervisor, they could not have fired her for that reason. Therefore, her participation in concerted activity could not have been a motivation for her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">ENFORCEMENT DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\">.

Younger and Benitez testified, however, that Gallegos helped them distribute union cards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b468-19\">. Nor was there any direct evidence that either Bufkin or Spikes was aware of the repriman-dees\u2019 union activities. The only evidence on this issue was Bufkin\u2019s testimony denying knowledge. The ALJ failed to mention this testimony in his written decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b469-5\">. The documents themselves were not introduced into evidence and thus are not in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">. Younger did testify that Blatzheim told her that he went to Bufkin on June 2 \u201cto talk him out of the allegations.\u201d Blatzheim denied this, testifying that he did not even know until June 5 that a decision to reprimand had been made. The ALJ noted Younger\u2019s testimony in his review of the evidence, but made no factual finding on this issue. Even if Blatzheim did go to talk Bufkin out of the reprimand, however, this does not tend to prove that he communicated his knowledge of the reprimandees\u2019 union activities; on the contrary, it shows that he was making an effort to protect his employees from discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. We have held that the reviewing court is \u201cnot compelled to respect\u201d credibility choices \u201cbased on an inadequate reason, or no reason at all.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Moore Business Forms, Inc., </em>574 F.2d 835, 843 (5th Cir. 1978). The ALJ discredited Blatzheim\u2019s denials because he found Blatzheim\u2019s testimony \u201cinconsistent and conflicting\u201d when Blatzheim attempted to quantify the number of times he had had problems with the reprimandees. We question this basis for rejecting Blatzheim\u2019s testimony for two reasons. First, the purported \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Blatzheim\u2019s testimony do not exist. The ALJ said that Blatzheim first testified that he had orally reprimanded Younger \u201cabout 12 times,\u201d and later testified that he had orally reprimanded her \u201c6 or 7 times.\u201d Actually, what Blatzheim said the second time was that he had reprimanded Younger \u201c6 or 7 times\u201d <em>on his own initiative; </em>a few questions later, he made it clear that he had reprimanded her \u201cseveral\u201d other times because of complaints from other supervisors about her dealings with employees under their supervision. The other inconsistency found by the ALJ was Blat-zheim\u2019s first statement that Goldston complained about Blatzheim\u2019s employees \u201cabout a dozen\u201d times, followed by a later statement that Goldston complained about Gallegos \u201cabout a dozen\u201d times. Rather than inconsistent, this testimony was entirely consistent with Pioneer\u2019s supervisors\u2019 claims that the complaints were almost always made about the three reprimandees as a group. This testimony was also consistent with Blatzheim\u2019s statement that he never received a complaint concerning the other two of his five employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Second, and more importantly, we think that the ALJ\u2019s focus on a purported inconsistency in the use of round numbers stands in striking contrast with his disregard for the serious inconsistencies in Younger\u2019s story concerning this very issue and other substantial issues. On June 9, 1978, Younger circulated a letter among the supervisors denying the charges in the reprimand. At the same time or shortly thereafter, she circulated a second letter claiming that she was being discriminated against because of her union activities. In neither letter did she mention what one would think would be the crucial evidence supporting her complaint, Blatzheim\u2019s June 6 statements. On another of her claims \u2014 a frivolous charge that she had been \u201cinterrogated\u201d by Pioneer\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ney in a phone conversation she had initiated\u2014 she changed her story several times, first swearing in an affidavit that she had \u201cforgotten\u201d that the man was Pioneer\u2019s attorney, then \u201cclarifying\u201d her story in a second affidavit swearing that she did not know at any time prior to the phone call that the man was Pioneer\u2019s attorney, and finally admitting at the hearing that she did know that the man was Pioneer\u2019s attorney when she called him. The attorney testified and further contradicted Younger\u2019s testimony in many important respects. Younger also denied ever making derogatory statements about Goldston\u2019s employees; this testimony was contradicted by co-re-primandee Benitez. Finally, Younger changed her testimony on other matters when confronted with the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Despite the conflicts in her sworn statements, the ALJ found Younger\u2019s testimony \u201ccandid and consistent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">. The ALJ noted Blatzheim\u2019s admissions that the charges were \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cindividually\u201d did not warrant more than an \u201coral\u201d reprimand. The ALJ fails to note that management could easily have decided that \u201ccollectively\u201d the charges were worthy of a reprimand, and that the evidence in the record, while not specific on dates and events, establishes that the three reprimandees had collectively committed the transgressions generically described in the reprimand. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">The ALJ also found the \u201ctiming\u201d of the reprimands suspect, pointing out that the reprimands were not issued until over a month after the date Pioneer claimed it had made the decision to reprimand. The record demonstrates, however, that Pioneer was taking time to make sure that the reprimands were accurate: for example, by obtaining written statements from the complaining employees on May 8 and 9, and by obtaining statements from Goldston and Blatzheim on May 19 and 22. The fortuity that the reprimandees joined a union on May 24 does not protect them from discipline imposed in good faith on the basis of complaints made before that time. We think the \u201ctiming\u201d factor is little more than a makeweight.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">Finally, the ALJ noted that Pioneer had not reprimanded Vera Isham, another \u201ctroublemaker\u201d in the department. The reason for this \u201cdisparity\u201d was obvious: Isham was one of the very employees who had decided to take their complaints about the reprimandees up the company\u2019s chain of command; no similar complaint had been pressed by the reprimandees (or anyone else) against Isham.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\">. Blatzheim denied making any of these statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. Escoto simply recounted the incident. She did not testify that she felt intimidated or even upset by Goldston\u2019s remarks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">.

Gallegos\u2019 testimony was often incomplete or at odds with Hall\u2019s story. Gallegos testified that Wilborn made the racial insults on June 22, when Hall left work early, and that she told Hall about them on June 25, whereupon Hall went directly to Goldston. According to Hall\u2019s written statement, Gallegos had been reporting these remarks since June 19, and Hall went to Goldston on June 22 after five days of reports and after Gallegos\u2019 suggestion that Hall confront Wilborn. Gallegos also claimed that Hall \u201cknew how Helen was on racial problems\u201d and had heard derogatory comments from Wilborn in the past. Hall, however, testified that when she went to Goldston she did not believe that Wilborn had made the statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b473-15\">.
