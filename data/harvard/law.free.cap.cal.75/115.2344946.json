The defendant attempted to justify the taking under a writ of attachment issued in an action against one Elliott. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant moved for a new trial, and his motion being denied, appealed from the judgment and order. The appellant had printed specifications in the transcript. But they were not part of the statement; and had been stricken from the transcript on a separate motion. The further facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>R.

The statement should therefore be disregarded. (Code Civ.
