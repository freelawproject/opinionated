The defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance on the ground that his counsel had been unable, in consequence of another and prior engagement, to make due preparation for the trial of defendant\u2019s case, was one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>addressed itself to the sound discretion of the court below, and ought not to be interfered with unless we could see clearly that there had been an abuse of discretion, which is not in this case apparent to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">2. Defendant was examined as a witness in his own behalf; and for the purpose of impeaching him, the prosecution called one Adams as a witness, and after he had testified to having known the defendant about four years, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he knew the defendant\u2019s general reputation for truth, honesty, and integrity in the community in which he lives. The witness answered, \u201c I don\u2019t know, as I never heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The witness was then asked by said counsel to say whether he knew it or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">He answered, \u201c I do not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Some other questions elicited from him the statement that he did not know where the defendant lived, and therefore could not state what his reputation was where he lived. The district attorney then asked the witness this question: \u201c Do you know his reputation for honesty and integrity in this community of San Francisco ? \u201d The question was objected to, and the court overruled the objection. The witness answered in the affirmative, and to the question, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d answered, \u201cBad.\u201d This question is not in the approved form, and the court should have sustained the objection to it. But the error, in our opinion, did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s case, and therefore must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The other witnesses, to whom the questions were put in proper form, testified that defendant\u2019s reputation was bad in the community where he lived. In view of the character of the other evidence in the case, we think the evidence as to the defendant\u2019s reputation superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">McFabland, J., Seabls, 0. J., and Patebson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
