The expenses of the Old Ladies\u2019 Home had always been paid by the corporation, and it was under its control. No other institution of the bind was near the place indicated. <em>Held, </em>that the corporation known as the \u201cSisters of Mercy\u201d was entitled to take the bequest.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Appeal from a decree of the Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco distributing the estate of a decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">By the decree in question, the court ordered that the bequest to the Old Ladies\u2019 Home be paid to the repondent, the Sisters of Mercy.

Goodfellow, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">The bequest is not to the Sisters of Mercy in trust for the Old Ladies\u2019 Home or its members, nor is there any evidence to show that such was in fact the intention of the testatrix. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the testatrix was acquainted with the corporation respondent, and its relations to the Old Ladies\u2019 Home and other institutions, and yet she did not mention it in her will. On the other hand, she knew that the Old Ladies\u2019 Home which she did mention was not identical with the claimant, the Bisters of Mercy. The language of the will is free from ambiguity or uncertainty. If the Old Ladies\u2019 Home had been incorporated or otherwise legally competent to take, no one would have disputed its right or thought of diverting the legacy to the Sisters of Mercy. Can the language of the will be transformed because it appears that the testatrix has misapprehended the law? The' legatee not being competent to take, and no trust having been created, the bequest fails. <em>(Sherwood </em>v. <em>Am. Bible Soc., </em>4 Abb. 227; <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Miss. Soc., </em>14 N.

The Old Ladies\u2019 Home was originally in the same building with the hospital, but was recently removed into another building, erected by the corpora^ tion on the same lot about fifty feet from the hospital. The expenses of the Old Ladies\u2019 Home have always been paid by the corporation, and it is under its control. There is no other Old Ladies\u2019 Home in the vicinity of Rincon Hill. The name of the corporation is \u201cThe Sisters of Mercy.\u2019\u2019 It is claimed by the appellant that there is no legatee competent to take, and no trust having been created, the bequest to the Old Ladies\u2019 Home fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Our code provides that \u201c the misnomer of a corporation in any written instrument does not invalidate the instrument, if it can be reasonably ascertained from it what corporation is intended.\" So long as the testator sufficiently indicates the institution intended, the bequest is good; and if from the will itself, or evidence <em>aliunde, </em>the object of the testator\u2019s bounty can be ascertained, a misnomer of a legatee, or devisee, whether a natural person or a corporation, will not invalidate the</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>provision. <em>(Le Fevre </em>v. <em>Le Fevre, </em>59 N. Y. 434.) It was held in a case quite similar to this that a charitable gift to a hospital- should be sustained notwithstanding the misnomer of the corporation, and that it would take and hold the gift on the trust named by the donor. <em>(Lanning </em>v. <em>Sisters of St. Francis, </em>35 N. J. Eq. 392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The court found \u201c that the testatrix meant and intended by her said will, and especially by the twelfth article thereof, to make said corporation, called \u2018The Sisters of Mercy/ her residuary legatee, intending thereby especially to benefit the department thereof which provides for the care, protection, and comfort of old ladies; and the testatrix knew that the only conduit of her charity was the corporation called \u2018The Sisters of Mercy/\u201d We think these findings of the court are justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">' Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">McFarland, J., Sharpstein, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Temple, J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
