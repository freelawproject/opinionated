JAMES RILEY, Appellant.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-9\">Criminal Law\u2014Robbery\u2014Information\u2014Description of Property.\u2014 An information for robbery, which describes the property taken as a specified amount of \u201c lawful money of the United States,\u201d is not defective for not further describing the property as personalty.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-10\">Id. \u2014Taking by Force and Fear. \u2014 Where the information alleges that the robbery was \u201caccomplished by means of force and fear,\u201d an allegation that it was accomplished \u201c against the will\u201d of the person robbed is unnecessary.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-11\">Id. \u2014 Presumption of Identity from Identity of Name\u2014Instruction. \u2014 On a trial for robbery, where the prosecution offers in evidence the deposition taken on the preliminary examination, which shows that the person charged with the offense has the same name as the defendant, and the latter offers no evidence to disprove his identity, the court may instruct the jury that identity of person is presumed from the identity of name, and the failure to instruct that the presumption of identity is only <em>prima fade </em>is without prejudice.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-12\">Id.\u2014Preliminary Examination\u2014Deposition\u2014Objection to Question. The deposition taken on the preliminary examination sufficiently shows the grounds on which the magistrate sustained an objection to a question\" put to a witness, when it appears therefrom that the objection to the question was that it was \u201cirrelevant and immaterial,\u201d and the objection as made was sustained.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-13\">Id. \u2014 Stenographer need not be Sworn. \u2014 A stenographer appointed by the magistrate to take down the testimony given on the preliminary examination, under section 869 of the Penal Code, need not he sworn to faithfully discharge Ms duty, nor need the fact that he was sworn appear m the deposition.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-14\">Id. \u2014 Certificate of Stenographer. \u2014 A certificate of the stenographer to the deposition that the same is \u201ca correct transcript of the examination in the above-entitled case,\u201d is a sufficient certification, under subdivision 5 of section 869 of the Penal Code, to make the deposition <em>prima fade </em>evidence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b128-15\">Id.\u2014Absence of Wetness \u2014 Evidence__The evidence offered for the purpose of showmg that the prosecuting witness, whose deposition was admitted in evidence, was absent from the state, <em>held, </em>sufficient to show the absence of the witness.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">The defendant was prosecuted and convicted of robbery. On the trial, the prosecution offered in evidence the deposition of the prosecuting witness, taken on the preliminary examination, which showed that the offense had been committed by a person of the same name as the defendant. In instructing the jury, the court charged them that identity of person is presumed from identity of name. The further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-6\"><em>Zue G. Peek, </em>and <em>Baker &amp; </em>Blair, for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-7\"><em>Attorney-General </em>Johnson, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-8\">McKinstby, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">The defendant was convicted of robbery in San Bernardino County, and has appealed from the judgment, and from an order denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">It is contended the motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted, because the information does not aver that the one hundred and sixty dollars, lawful money of the United States, \u201c said money being then and there the property of one Christian Meyer,\u201d was \u201c personal \u201d property. The point is hot well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The information charges that the defendants, on a day named, etc., did \u201cunlawfully, willfully, and feloniously, and by means of fraud and force, take from the person, possession,\u201d etc. It is claimed the judgment should have been arrested, because the information is fatally defective, in that it omits the statutory words, \u201c and against his will.\u201d (Pen. Code, sec. 211.) But the information is sufficient. (Pen. Code, sec. 960.) A robbery <em>\u201c </em>accomplished by means of force and fear \u201d must have been accomplished \u201cagainst the will\u201d of the person robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>It is urged as error that the court below charged: \u201c Identity of person is presumed from identity of name.\u201d Identity of person is a deduction which the law expressly directs shall be made from identity of name (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 1959, 1963, subd. 25); and while under our constitution, which prohibits the courts from charging upon matter of fact, a court cannot instruct a jury that any fact is an \" inference \u201d from another fact,\u2014as an inference is defined by section 1960 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u2014the court is authorized to declare a presumption of law. It is true that the presumption of identity of person from identity of name is a <em>disputable </em>presumption, which may be controverted by other evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1963.) But the defendant introduced no evidence to overcome it, and no injury could have accrued to him by the omission of the court to add that identity of name only created the presumption <em>prima facie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">At the trial the prosecution offered in evidence the deposition of Christian Meyer (prosecuting witness), taken at the examination before the committing magistrate. The deposition was admitted over the objections of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">To the deposition the defendant objected that it does not show the \u201cgrounds .or reasons \u201d on which the magistrate sustained an objection to a question put to the witness on cross-examination. But the objection to the question was that it was \u201c irrelevant and immaterial,\u201d and the objection as made was sustained. It would be difficult to state more clearly \u201c the ground on which the question was overruled.\u201d (Pen. Code, see. 869, subd. 3.) As to the alleged refusal of the witness to answer questions, the magistrate, in one instance directed him to answer, and in others the recalcitration of the witness was waived. Besides, the \u201cground\u201d on which the witness declined to answer questions does appear in the deposition., from the statement of the witness itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Appellant further objects that it was not made affirmatively to appear that Joseph E. Rich, whose certificate1 as stenographer is attached to the deposition,.was sworn faithfully to discharge his duty. The <em>defendant </em>proved by Rich that he was appointed to take the testimony by the magistrate. The statute neither requires that the short-hand reporter shall be sworn, nor that the fact that he was sworn shall appear in the deposition; and the testimony, as written out in long-hand by the short-hand reporter, is only evidence <em>prima facie </em>of its correctness. (Pen. Code, sec. 869.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The deposition is certified:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_5\"><em>u </em>State of California, county of San Bernardino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cI hereby certify the foregoing to be a correct tran script of the examination in the above-entitled case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u2022(Signed) \u201c Joseph E. Rich, Stenographer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The statute provides: \u201cWhen written out in longhand and certified as being a correct statement of such testimony and proceedings in the case, shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence,\u201d etc. (Pen. Code, sec. 869, subd. 5.) It is, of course, always better to follow the language of the statute, but we think the certificate substantially complies with the law. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Marine, </em>54 Cal. 575, \u2014 referred to by counsel, \u2014 there was no certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Defendant also objected to the deposition on the ground that the preliminary evidence was not sufficient to show that the witness, Christian Meyer, was either dead, insane, or absent from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Subpoenas were sent to different counties for service. One Neil, an acquaintance of Meyer, gave information that he was at a certain place in San Diego County, but he could not be found there. There was evidence that he had been sought for \u201c pretty much all over \u201d San Bernardino and San Diego counties; that inquiries had been made for him in Sacramento, San Francisco, Stockton, San Jos\u00e9, Lathrop, Woodland, Oakland, and \u201c at all those places along the line of the Southern Pacific railroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>There was no direct evidence that he <em>was </em>in the state, nor any evidence that facts had come to the knowledge of the prosecution tending to prove the whereabouts of the witness which had not been acted upon in good faith, or evidence indicating that the witness had gone to any county to which subpoena was not sent for service. The court was fully justified in finding that the witness could not, with due diligence, be found within the state, and as an inference, that he was not in the state. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gannon, </em>61 Cal. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Searls, C. J., Sharpstein, J., McFarland, J., Paterson, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
