Judgment went for defendants; and in due time plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal, and served it on the said attorney of record, who <em>accepted service for all the defendants. </em>As a matter of fact, however, the defendant Michael Landers had died between the entry of .the judgment and the service of the notice of appeal,\u2014this fact being unknown to plaintiffs or their attorney. And this motion is based on the ground that the service of the notice of appeal was void, because at the time of the service the said Landers was dead; and it is made by the same attorney who accepted the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>In such a case this court will not entertain a motion to dismiss the appeal made by the attorney who accepted service for the dead man.
