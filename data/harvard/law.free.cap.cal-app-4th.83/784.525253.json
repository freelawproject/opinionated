Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 261.5, subd. (d)), and two counts of oral copulation by a person over 21 years of age on a person under 16 years of age (\u00a7 288a, subd. (b)(2)), but was unable to reach a verdict on one count of forcible rape (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)) and two counts of forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2)). The trial court declared a mistrial as to the latter three counts. The trial court subsequently found Scott suffered two prior serious/violent felonies or \u201cstrikes\" (\u00a7 667, subd. (b)-(i)), and sentenced Scott to a total prison term of 50 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In the second trial, a jury convicted Scott of the three violent sex counts that had been mistried. The trial court set aside the previously imposed sentence and resentenced Scott to state prison for a total term of 75 years to life. Scott appeals both judgments; we have consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Scott\u2019s principal assignment of error is the retrial on the forcible sex offenses was barred under double jeopardy principles because his convictions of the nonforcible sex offenses in the first trial were lesser included offenses under an accusatory pleading test. Scott also contends the trial court in the first trial erred by (1) not instructing that Scott\u2019s reasonable belief the victim was 16 years old was a defense to the nonforcible sex offenses, and (2) finding that a prior felony conviction in Minnesota constituted a strike under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law. Additionally, Scott assigns error to the giving of CALJIC No. 17.41.1 in both trials, and the calculation of his conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">On September 3, 1996, Kristina G. and Pamela G., two 14-year-old friends, were at the Burger King restaurant at the El Camino Real Mall in Carlsbad when they were approached by two men who introduced themselves as \u201cL.A.\u201d and \u201cGoody.\u201d \u201cGoody\u201d was Scott, who was 40 years old, and L.A. was Scott\u2019s 28-year-old brother. Kristina told the brothers she was 16 years old when they asked her age. Pamela said she was 14 years old. The foursome talked about 20 minutes, and L.A. and Kristina exchanged telephone numbers before the men left.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">On September 4, L.A. telephoned Kristina and asked if she wanted to go somewhere with him on the following day. Kristina said she would go if she could bring Pamela; and they arranged to meet at the Vista Transit Center. On September 5, L.A. and Scott picked up Kristina and Pamela and drove them to San Diego. On the way, they stopped at a liquor store and bought alcohol, which the men drank during the trip. After stopping in a park, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>men took the girls to their apartment to watch movies. The men told the girls there was nothing to worry about because their girlfriends were at the house and they would just watch movies and hang out.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Their apartment was on the second story and had a security screen door with a lock that locked from the inside with a key. Scott\u2019s girlfriend, Michelle, and her baby, and L.A.\u2019s girlfriend, Tammy, were inside. Kristina and Pamela sat down in the living room and watched television.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Scott called Kristina into a bedroom and told her he was going to have sex with her even though she did not want to and that she was not going to die from it. Kristina said she was not going to have sex with him and went back to the living room, where she asked L.A. to take her home. L.A. said he was busy and wanted to eat first. Scott took Kristina to a nearby Burger King and they ordered food from the drive-through window. Kristina considered getting out of the car but did not do so because she did not want to desert Pamela, who was still in the men\u2019s apartment. Pamela also left the apartment once, going with L.A. and Tammy to rent a video. Pamela did not try to get away because Kristina was in the apartment, and Pamela did not really believe she would be raped if she returned to the apartment even though the men had said they were going to have sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">After Kristina and Scott returned, he took her into a bedroom, and again told her that he was going to have sex with her. She repeatedly said no, but Scott was yelling at her with an angry voice and she was scared. She complied with his orders to take off her clothes and lie down because \u201cat that point [I thought] I was going to get raped [and] I would never be able to leave. He was probably going to kill me or something.\u201d Scott proceeded to put his penis in Kristina\u2019s vagina. L.A. entered the bedroom, and when Scott left, L.A. raped Kristina.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">After Kristina returned to the living room, L.A. called Pamela into a bedroom and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Later, L.A. raped Kristina again and made her orally copulate him in the back bedroom. When Kristina returned to the living room, Scott grabbed Kristina\u2019s arm and pulled her into the bathroom and forced her to orally copulate him two times.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Eventually, Tammy and Michelle drove Kristina and Pamela home. Two weeks later, Kristina and Pamela went to a clinic to be tested for venereal diseases. The clinic contacted police. Kristina and Pamela selected Scott and L.A. from separate photographic lineups.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Scott testified in his first trial that he came to San Diego from Minnesota in July or August 1996, and he and his wife and daughter shared an apartment with his brother, L.A., L.A.\u2019s girlfriend, Tammy, and another woman. Scott vaguely recognized Kristina and Pamela and remembered seeing them at the apartment; however, he denied ever sexually touching either girl. The girls went in a back bedroom with L.A. and Tammy, where they had \u201ctheir own little party going on.\u201d Meanwhile, Scott was sitting on the living room couch watching television with his wife and one-year-old daughter. Scott believed L.A. had herpes, and he would not have sex with any person after L.A. had sex with that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Scott did not testify at his second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">I. <em>Retrial Did Not Violate Double Jeopardy Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In count 1 of the information, Scott was charged with the forcible rape of Kristina, and in count 2, Scott was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse by a person over 21 years with a person under 16 years of age\u2014namely, Kristina. In count 3, Scott was charged with forcible oral copulation with Kristina, and in count 4, Scott was charged with oral copulation by a person over 21 years of age with a person under 16 years of age regarding the same incident. Both counts 3 and 4 dealt with the \u201cfirst instance\u201d of oral copulation involving Scott and Kristina. In counts 5 and 6, Scott was charged with the same offenses concerning the \u201csecond instance\u201d of oral copulation involving him and Kristina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Scott contends the retrial of the forcible sex offenses should have been barred under section 1023 and double jeopardy principles based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>argument that under the accusatory pleading test the nonforcible sex crimes were lesser included offenses of the forcible sex offenses. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Preliminarily, we note this claim has been waived because it was not raised below. A plea of double jeopardy cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1201 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354].) However, we address the merits because Scott has maintained, in a supplemental brief, that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise this defense constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A defendant cannot prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless the defendant can establish (1) counsel performed at a level below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms <em>and </em>(2) the defense was subjected to prejudice flowing from the deficient performance of counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 351, 377 [247 Cal.Rptr. 31, 753 P.2d 1109].) The ineffective assistance claim fails if defendant cannot make a sufficient showing on either of these components. (Pe<em>ople v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1126 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>General Legal Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The double jeopardy clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15, of the California Constitution ensure a person shall not be placed twice \u201cin jeopardy\u201d for the \u201csame offense.\u201d (See also \u00a7 687.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">As the high court explained in <em>Green v. United States </em>(1957) 355 U.S. 184 [78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199], \u201cThe underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 187-188 [78 S.Ct. at p. 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">As articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 711, 717 [89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656], the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy \u201cconsists] of three separate constitutional protections. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Scott seeks relief under the first prong of double jeopardy protections as refined by the \u201cimplied acquittal\u201d doctrine. An acquittal barring a second prosecution may be either express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given the opportunity to return a verdict on the greater offense. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>United </em>States, <em>supra, </em>355 U.S. at pp. 190-191 [78 S.Ct. at pp. 225-226].) Under the \u201cimplied acquittal\u201d doctrine, a guilty verdict on a lesser included offense represents \u201can implied acquittal of the greater offense of which the jury could have convicted the defendant.\u201d <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 511 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809], fn. omitted.) Double jeopardy principles prohibit a second prosecution when a defendant has been implicitly acquitted of an offense; under the \u201cimplied acquittal\u201d doctrine, \u201c \u2018a verdict of guilty on a lesser included offense constitutes an implied acquittal of the greater offense of which the jury could have convicted the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 289, 299 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 282, 914 P.2d 832].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Thus, under Scott\u2019s argument, in which he posits that the nonforcible sex crimes were lesser included offenses of the forcible rape and oral copulation counts, he was implicitly acquitted of the latter crimes when the jury convicted him of the nonforcible sex offenses. Accordingly, Scott claims double jeopardy principles and section 1023, which incorporates those principles, barred his retrial on the forcible sex crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Section 1023 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the defendant is convicted or acquitted or has been once placed in jeopardy upon an accusatory pleading, the conviction, acquittal, or jeopardy is a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged in such accusatory pleading, or for an attempt to commit the same, <em>or for an offense necessarily included therein, </em>of which he might have been convicted under that accusatory pleading.\u201d (Italics added.)  When a jury deadlocks on the greater offense, but convicts the accused of a necessarily lesser included offense, the conviction bars a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>subsequent prosecution for the greater offense under section 1023. <em>(People v. Greer </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 589, 596-597 [184 P.2d 512], not followed on other grounds in <em>People v. Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351, 358 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595], and overruled on other grounds by <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 308, fn. 6.) The rationale for the rule is straightforward: \u201c \u2018A conviction of the lesser is held to be a bar to [the] prosecution for the greater on the theory that to [later] convict of the greater would be to convict twice of the lesser.\u2019 \u201d (30 Cal.2d at p. 597, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Krupa </em>(1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 592, 598 [149 P.2d 416].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">As we shall explain, Scott\u2019s double jeopardy argument fails because his basic premise\u2014that the nonforcible sex offenses were lesser included offenses of the forcible sex offenses within the context of double jeopardy principles and section 1023\u2014is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The applicable definition of \u201cnecessarily included offenses\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy law \u201cis simply that where an offense cannot be committed without necessarily committing another offense, the latter is a necessarily included offense. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at 596, fn. omitted.) This is commonly referred to as the \u201celements\u201d test, which is met when all the elements of the lesser offense are included in the elements of the greater offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 282, 288-289 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 195, 965 P.2d 713].) Under this test, which compares the statutory language, an offense is necessarily included if the crimes are defined in such a way as to make it impossible to commit the greater offense without also committing the lesser. <em>(People v. Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 597.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Scott concedes, as he must, that the nonforcible offenses of which he stands convicted are not lesser included offenses under the \u201celements\u201d test. <em>(People v. Chapman </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 597, 603-604 [121 Cal.Rptr. 315]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montero </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 415, 433 [229 Cal.Rptr. 750].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The nonforcible sex crimes require the perpetrator and victim to be within certain age limits while the forcible sex crimes do not (see fn. 4, <em>ante); </em>thus, the nonforcible crimes are not lesser included offenses of the forcible sex crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Nonetheless, Scott maintains that these nonforcible sex crimes are lesser included offenses under the \u201caccusatory pleading\u201d test.  A lesser offense is included within the greater offense under the accusatory pleading test \u201c \u201cif the charging allegations of the accusatory pleading include language describing the offense in such a way that if committed as specified the lesser offense is necessarily committed.\u201d . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 288-289.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Because the various counts specified the same date and victim, and denominated the two acts of oral copulation as \u201cfirst instance\u201d and \u201csecond instance\u201d (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>Scott argues the alleged nonforcible sex counts corresponded to the alleged forcible sex counts and therefore were lesser included offenses under the accusatory pleading test.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Scott is mistaken.  The nonforcible sex offenses were separately pled counts, which were not lesser included offenses merely because they were committed at the same time as the forcible sex crimes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In any event, in the double jeopardy context, it does not matter whether or not the nonforcible sex crimes were lesser included offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>under the accusatory pleading test. The appropriate yardstick is the elements test based on statutory comparison of the crimes. (See <em>United States v. Dixon </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 688, 703-712 [113 S.Ct. 2849, 2859-2864, 125 L.Ed.2d 556]; <em>People v. Scheidt </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 162, 165-166, 170 [282 Cal.Rptr. 228].)  This follows because the accusatory pleading test has nothing to do with double jeopardy principles or section 1023, each of which applies when \u201ca given crime, by definition, <em>necessarily and at all times </em>is included within another one.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kehoe </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 711, 713 [204 P.2d 321], italics added.) The accusatory pleading test, which unavoidably is fact specific, cannot be the benchmark that a crime in the abstract will necessarily and always be included within another one for purposes of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">What Scott fails to recognize is that the broader accusatory pleading test, which is primarily concerned with issues of notice, has limited applications. For example, the accusatory pleading test is used in determining whether it is proper to give jury instructions on lesser offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510, 517, fn. 4 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055], overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 112 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073].) Use of the accusatory pleading test also is appropriate in the context of section 1159, which authorizes finding a defendant guilty of a lesser included offense. <em>(People v. Marshall, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 405.) (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The key term in the double jeopardy context is \u201cnecessarily included.\u201d As the Court of Appeal in <em>People v. Scheidt, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pages 165 to 166, put it: \u201c[A] statutorily lesser included offense is subject to the bar against multiple convictions in the same proceeding. An offense that <em>may be </em>a lesser included offense because of the specific nature of the accusatory pleading is not subject to the same bar.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Thus, \u201c <em>\u2018[f]actual </em>inextricability does <em>not </em>equal \u201cnecessarily included.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Ortega, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 697-698, italics in original.) \u201cSome cases suggest mistaken views that an offense may be \u2018necessarily included\u2019 in another offense . . . because the evidence proves a \u2018lesser\u2019 offense . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In sum, neither the constitutional prohibition against being twice placed in jeopardy nor the statutory bar of section 1023 applies because in this context Scott\u2019s nonforcible sex offenses were not necessarily included in his forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>sex offenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Trial counsel therefore could not have been ineffective for failing to raise the issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">II. <em>No Error in Failing to Instruct on Reasonable Belief as to Victim\u2019s Age</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Scott contends the trial court committed prejudicial error when it refused to instruct that his reasonable belief Kristina was 16 years old was a defense to the nonforcible sex crimes. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Essentially, Scott is arguing that he was entitled to such an instruction under <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 529 [39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673, 8 A.L.R.3d 1092], in which our Supreme Court held a good faith and reasonable belief that a victim was over the age of consent and had voluntarily engaged in sexual intercourse was a defense to statutory rape.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We conclude that the <em>Hernandez </em>defense does not apply here. Rather, as we shall explain, we find the teachings of <em>People </em>v. <em>Olsen </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 638 [205 Cal.Rptr. 492, 685 P.2d 52] are controlling, and the trial court correctly refused to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">\n<em>The Hernandez and Olsen Decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 529, the defendant was charged with statutory rape of a girl who was 17 years and 9 months old, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the trial court refused to allow the defendant to present evidence of his good faith, reasonable belief that the girl was 18 or over. Overruling established precedent such as <em>People v. Ratz </em>(1896) 115 Cal. 132 [46 P. 915], the high court in <em>Hernandez </em>held it was reversible error to exclude such evidence, finding that a reasonable mistake of fact as to age can eliminate the requisite criminal intent. <em>(People v. Hernandez, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at pp. 534-536.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">\u201cWe are persuaded that the reluctance to accord to a charge of statutory rape the defense of a lack of criminal intent has no greater justification than in the case of other statutory crimes [such as bigamy], where the Legislature had made identical provision with respect to intent. \u2018 \u201cAt common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which the person is indicted an innocent act, has always been held to be a good defense [Citations.] Our departure from the views expressed in <em>Ratz </em>is in no manner indicative of a withdrawal from the sound policy that it is in the public interest to protect the sexually naive female from exploitation. No responsible person would hesitate to condemn as untenable- a claimed good faith belief in the age of consent of an \u2018infant\u2019 female whose obviously tender years preclude the existence of reasonable grounds for that belief. However, the prosecutrix in the instant case was but three months short of 18 years of age and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the purposes of the law as stated in <em>Ratz </em>can be better served by foreclosing the defense of lack of intent. This is not to say that the granting to consent by even a sexually sophisticated girl known to be less than the statutory age is a defense. We hold only that, in the absence of a legislative direction otherwise, a charge of statutory rape is defensible wherein a criminal intent is lacking.\u201d <em>(People v. Hernandez, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at pp. 535-536, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The high court rejected the accepted notion that one who has sexual relations with a young female does so at his peril, assuming the risk that his partner is under the age of consent: \u201c[I]f [the perpetrator] participates in a mutual act of sexual intercourse, believing his partner to be beyond the age of consent, with reasonable grounds for such belief, where is his criminal intent? In such circumstances he has not consciously taken any risk. Instead he has subjectively eliminated the risk by satisfying himself on reasonable evidence that the crime cannot be committed. If it occurs that he has been misled, we cannot realistically conclude that for such reason alone the intent with which he undertook the act suddenly becomes more heinous.\u201d <em>(People v.

Olsen, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pages 642 to 649, the Supreme Court distinguished <em>Hernandez </em>and declined to apply a mistake of age defense to a charge of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under the age of 14 years (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)). \u201c[O]ne who commits lewd or lascivious acts with a child, even with a good faith belief that the child is 14 years of age or older, does so at his or her peril.\u201d <em>(People v. Olsen, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The high court in <em>Olsen </em>noted that the <em>Hernandez </em>decision expressly said it was not withdrawing from the sound policy \u201c \u2018that it is in the public interest to protect the sexually naive female from exploitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Olsen, supra, 36 </em>Cal.3d at p. 644.) Further, the <em>Olsen </em>court, relying on various Court of Appeal decisions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> noted that the younger the child victim is the less credible a defendant\u2019s claim of a mistaken belief that the victim is of the age of legal consent becomes. <em>(Olsen, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 646-647.) Moreover, stronger public policy considerations are implicated in protecting children under the age of 14 from sexual exploitation than those involved with unlawful sexual intercourse, and the law reflects this because typically more severe penalties are assigned to sex crimes involving children under the age of 14 than to statutory rape. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 648-649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">As indicated above (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>what was known as statutory rape (former \u00a7 261, subd. 1) was recodified in 1970 and is now known as unlawful sexual intercourse (\u00a7 261.5). Until a 1993 amendment, there were no gradations of the offense; now, however, the statute distinguishes between the relative ages of the perpetrator and the victim, assigning misdemeanor status to the offense when the ages of the perpetrator and victim are within a three-year range (i.e., teenagers) and felony status to other situations. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.) </em>The most severe punishment attaches to the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>when the perpetrator is an adult and the minor is under the age of 16 years. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In <em>Hernandez, </em>the court was concerned with the effect of the mistake of fact on a defendant\u2019s intent in a situation where if there was no mistake\u2014 that is, the facts were as the defendant believed them to be\u2014then he would not have committed the crime. Specifically, Hernandez believed the prosecutrix was 18 years old when in fact she was three months shy of the age of legal consent, and therefore, he committed the offense of statutory rape. If, however, the prosecutrix had been 18 years old as Hernandez believed, his conduct would not have been criminal. \u201c \u2018 \u201cAt common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which the person is indicted an innocent act, has always been held to be a good defense . . . <em>(.People v. Hernandez, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at p. 535.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Thus, Hernandez\u2019s good faith, reasonable mistake was a valid defense under section 26, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the following classes: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Three\u2014Persons who committed the act or made the omission charged under an ignorance or mistake of fact, which disproves any criminal intent. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">But that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Scott very well may have been operating under the mistaken belief that Kristina was 16 rather than 14 years old, but even if there were no mistake of fact he still would have been guilty of a crime, which he had intended to commit. In other words, even if Kristina had been 16, Scott would still be guilty of felony unlawful sexual intercourse (\u00a7 261.5, subd. (c)). Scott is not deserving of the <em>Hernandez </em>defense of mistake of fact under section 26 because he intended to commit a crime. \u201c[A] mistake of fact will disprove a criminal charge if the mistaken belief is . . . honestly entertained . . . based upon reasonable grounds and ... of such a nature that <em>the conduct would have been lawful and proper </em>had the facts been as they were reasonably supposed to be.\u201d (Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) Ignorance or Mistake of Fact, \u00a7 1, p. 1045, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>This age-old rule reflects the evolution of our criminal jurisprudence and the central concept that every crime consists of two parts: the actus reus or guilty act; and the mens rea or guilty mind\u2014the mental state attendant to the prohibited deed. \u201cCrime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand, was congenial to an intense individualism and took deep and early root in American soil.\u201d <em>(Morissette v. United States </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 246, 251-252 [72 S.Ct. 240, 244, 96 L.Ed. 288].)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\u201c[J]udges, in the development of the mens-rea doctrine, spoke in terms of the guilty mind <em>(nisi mens sit </em>rea) .... [T]he mind [w]as either innocent or guilty .... One who was intending to commit a crime did not have an innocent mind. Hence he was acting with mens rea and if he committed the actus reus of some unintended crime he was guilty of that crime unless it required a specific intent or some other special mental element. As he was acting with mens rea it was unimportant that the mistake he made was based upon reasonable grounds. The courts also held that the mind was not innocent if the actor was intending to commit a very wrongful act, even if no punishment was provided for that act, and hence he was acting with mens rea and might be guilty of an unintended crime.\u201d (Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Ignorance or Mistake of Fact, \u00a7 1, p. 1049, some italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Further, \u201ca mistake of fact relating only to the gravity of an offense will not shield a deliberate offender from the full consequences of the wrong actually committed.\u201d <em>(People v.

(Stats. 1913, ch. 122, \u00a7 1, p. 212.) A 1970 amendment recodified subdivision 1 as section 261.5 (unlawful sexual intercourse). (Stats. 1970, ch. 1301, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2, pp. 2405-2406.) As originally enacted, section 261.5 read: \u201cUnlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years.\u201d (Stats. 1970, ch. 1301, \u00a7 2, p. 2406.)</p>\n<p id=\"AjI\">In 1993, the Legislature amended section 261.5 to read: \u201c(a) Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person who is not the spouse of the perpetrator, if the person is a minor. For the purposes of this section, a \u2018minor\u2019 is a person under the age of 18 years.

However, I do not agree with part I (lesser included offense analysis) and as a result I also do not agree with part V (limitation on credits).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">In part I the majority concludes that the count 2 offense (unlawful intercourse with a minor under 16 years of age) is not a lesser included offense to the count 1 offense (forcible rape), and the counts 4 and 6 offenses (oral copulation by a person over 21 years of age with a minor under 16 years of age) are not lesser included offenses to the counts 3 and 5 offenses (forcible oral copulation), respectively. Were the majority comfortable with this conclusion, part I would have ended at that point; no further discussion of Scott\u2019s argument that section 1023 barred retrial of counts 1, 3 and 5 was necessary. However, part I continues with a discussion that concludes double jeopardy and section 1023 would prohibit retrial of the forcible sex offenses (counts 1, 3 and 5) if the nonforcible sex offenses (counts 2, 4 and 6) were lesser included offenses of the forcible sex offenses under the elements test but not if they were lesser included offenses under only the accusatory pleading test. In my opinion counts 2, 4 and 6 are lesser included offenses to counts 1, 3 and 5, respectively, under the accusatory pleading test, and section 1023 as applied in <em>People v. Fields </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 289 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 282, 914 P.2d 832] <em>(Fields), </em>bars retrial of the greater offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The California Supreme Court recently summarized the principles of lesser included offenses in <em>People v. Lopez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 282 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 195, 965 P.2d 713]. In <em>Lopez, </em>the court stated at pages 288 and 289:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\u201cTo determine whether a lesser offense is necessarily included in the charged offense, one of two tests (called the \u2018elements\u2019 test and the \u2018accusatory pleading\u2019 test) must be met. The elements test is satisfied when \u2018\u201dall the legal ingredients of the corpus delicti of the lesser offense [are] included in the elements of the greater offense.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\u201cUnder the accusatory pleading test, a lesser offense is included within the greater charged offense \u2018 \u201cif the charging allegations of the accusatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>pleading include language describing the offense in such a way that if committed as specified the lesser offense is necessarily committed.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d If either test is met the lesser included offense is <em>necessarily </em>included in the charged offense. (19 Cal.4th at p. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In this case the charging allegations of counts 1 and 2, considered together, describe the offense as follows: On or about September 5, 1996, Scott, a person over 21 years, did unlawfully have and accomplish an act of sexual intercourse with Kristina, a minor under 16 years of age not his spouse, against said person\u2019s will, by means of force, violence, duress, menace and fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury in violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(2). As so charged, if section 261, subdivision (a)(2) is committed, the lesser offense of section 261.5, subdivision (d) is necessarily committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The charging allegations of counts 3 and 4, considered together, describe the offense as follows: On or about September 5, 1996, Scott, being over 21 years of age, did unlawfully accomplish an act of oral copulation with Kristina, a person under the age of 16, which act was accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace and feat or immediate and unlawful bodily injury in violation of section 288a, subdivision (c). As so charged, if section 288a, subdivision (c) is committed, the lesser offense of section 288a, subdivision (b)(2) is necessarily committed. Counts 3 and 4 are described in the charging allegation as the \u201cfirst instance\u201d to distinguish the charge from counts 5 and 6, which are described as the \u201csecond instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Similarly, the charging allegations of counts 5 and 6, considered together, describe the offense as follows: On or about September 5, 1996, Scott, being over 21 years of age, did unlawfully accomplish an act of oral copulation with Kristina, a person under the age of 16, which act was accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace and fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury in violation of section 288a, subdivision (c). As so charged, if section 288a, subdivision (c) is committed, the lesser offense of section 288a, subdivision (b)(2) is necessarily commit-ted.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Therefore, under the accusatory pleading test set forth in <em>Lopez, </em>as charged count 2 is a lesser included offense to count 1, count 4 is a lesser included offense to count 3, and count 6 is a lesser included offense to count 5. The majority disagrees with my view because the offenses were pleaded in different counts (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 795-796). However, if merely pleading in separate counts avoided the issue of lesser included offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>determined under the accusatory pleading test, there would be no accusatory pleading test; the test could always be avoided by merely using multiple counts for the same offense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 20 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 15] [lesser included offenses found in separate counts under the accusatory pleading test].) The majority also refers to <em>People v. Ortega </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 686, 693 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 489, 968 P.2d 48] for the proposition that a person may be convicted of multiple offenses arising from a single act or individual course of conduct, although section 654 bars multiple punishment. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 795, fn. 6.) However, the majority\u2019s quotation from <em>Ortega </em>includes the caveat that the proposition does not apply if one offense is a necessarily included offense to the other. Because here the nonforcible offenses are lesser included offenses to the forcible offenses, the majority\u2019s quote from <em>Ortega, </em>although correct, by its terms is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The majority\u2019s analysis is based on two concepts; double jeopardy and a perceived distinction between elements lesser included offenses and accusatory pleading lesser included offenses. The majority\u2019s position assumes that under the accusatory pleading test, but not under the elements test, the nonforcible sex crimes are lesser included offenses to the forcible sex offenses. It then concludes that only elements test lesser included offenses may be considered in a double jeopardy analysis. The problem with the majority\u2019s position is that no one, other than the majority, contends the bar to retrial of the forcible sex offenses is based on double jeopardy principles. Therefore, even if the majority\u2019s perceived distinction between elements test and accusatory pleading test lesser included offenses is Correct, it is not relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">First, the majority opinion characterizes Scott\u2019s appellate contention to be that his convictions of the nonforcible sex offenses were implicit acquittals of the forcible sex offenses because the former were lesser included offenses of the latter and as a result retrial of the forcible sex offenses was barred by double jeopardy principles. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 793-794.) The majority opinion has mischaracterized Scott\u2019s position. Scott does not argue that double jeopardy bars retrial of the forcible sex offenses; <em>Fields </em>rejected the double jeopardy argument. <em>(Fields', supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 303 [\u201cWe thus conclude that under the double jeopardy principles embodied in the California Constitution [and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution], when jurors deadlock on a greater offense, an acquittal on that charge will not be implied by the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on a lesser included offense\u201d].) Rather, Scott\u2019s appellate argument is based on the holding in <em>Fields </em>that \u201cpursuant to section 1023 and <em>[People </em>v. <em>Greer </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 589 [184 P.2d 512]], the conviction of the lesser offense in the first trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>operated to bar the retrial of defendant on the greater offense, regardless of the first jury\u2019s deadlock on the greater offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The <em>Fields </em>decision was not based on double jeopardy principles but rather on the following considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">1. \u201c[O]nce a conviction on the lesser offense has been obtained, \u2018\u201cto [later] convict of the greater would be to convict twice of the lesser.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 306.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">2. A contrary rule would vitiate section 1023 by permitting the prosecution to start with \u201c \u2018prosecution of the lesser offense and proceeding up the scale.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 307.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">3. Problems of application of a contrary rule, including instructions to the jury in the second trial. <em>(Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 307, fin. 5.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">4. Consistency with \u201c[t]he acquittal-first rule, requiring the jury to expressly acquit the defendant before rendering a verdict on the lesser offense\u201d <em>(Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 309), as set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kurtzman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 322, 334 [250 Cal.Rptr. 244, 758 P.2d 572],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">To avoid the problem presented in <em>Fields </em>and in this case, the Supreme Court in <em>Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 289, set forth detailed rules addressed to trial courts and prosecutors. The court stated at pages 310 and 311:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201cAs our opinion today makes clear, under <em>Kurtzman, </em>when the jury returns a verdict on the lesser included offense, it must also render a corresponding verdict of acquittal on the greater offense. If a verdict of guilty on the lesser offense is recorded and the jury discharged without having rendered any verdict on the greater offense, a retrial on the greater offense is barred under section 1023, regardless of whether the jury expressly deadlocked on that charge. We recognize, however, that there may be instances such as occurred here in which, contrary to the rule of <em>Kurtzman, </em>the jury renders only a verdict of guilty on the lesser included offense. If this occurs, the trial court may properly decline to receive and record this verdict of conviction pending further deliberations by the jury. More specifically, prior to discharging the jury, the trial court has the authority pursuant to section 1161 to direct the jury to reconsider its lone verdict of conviction on the lesser included offense in light of <em>Kurtzman </em>and the acquittal-first rule. [Citation.] By making use of such a procedure, the trial court can prevent the unintended consequences flowing from the jury\u2019s mistake in returning a verdict of guilty on the lesser included offense while deadlocking on the greater offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">\u201cSection 1161 provides in pertinent part: \u2018When there is a verdict of conviction, in which it appears to the court that the jury have mistaken the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>law, the court may explain the reason for that opinion and direct the jury to reconsider their verdict, and if[,] after the reconsideration, they return the same verdict, it must be entered. . . .\u2019If, contrary to <em>Kurtzman, </em>the jury renders only a verdict of conviction on the lesser included offense, without a corresponding verdict of acquittal on the greater offense, its verdict of conviction is incomplete \u2018under the law and the instructions.\u2019 [Citations.] Under these circumstances, the trial court is permitted, pursuant to section 1161, to direct the jury to reconsider its verdict of conviction in light of the acquittal-first rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">\u201cPrior to the discharge of the jury, during which time the trial court is empowered to direct the jury to reconsider a lone verdict of conviction on the lesser included offense in light of <em>Kurtzman, </em>the incomplete verdict of conviction rendered by a jury \u2018mistaken in the law\u2019 does not implicate a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interest in avoiding retrial on the greater offense. [Citations.] By contrast, if the jury renders an incomplete verdict of conviction on the lesser included offense, and the rendered verdict is received by the court and recorded, and the jury is discharged, the trial court no longer has jurisdiction to direct jurors to reconsider their irregular verdict. [Citations.] Under such a scenario, the consequence of the \u2018mistake in the law\u2019 should be borne by the People, rather than the defendant. Thus, once the jury is discharged after rendering a verdict of guilty on the lesser included offense, without a corresponding verdict of acquittal on the greater offense, the defendant stands convicted of the lesser included offense, and retrial on the greater offense is barred notwithstanding the jury\u2019s deadlock on that charge. (\u00a7 1023.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">\u201cPlacing the onus on the People to bring an incomplete verdict of conviction to the trial court\u2019s attention prior to jury discharge is appropriate because it preserves the possibility that, after reconsideration pursuant to section 1161, the jury will decline to return the requisite verdict of acquittal of the greater offense. Should this occur, the incomplete verdict of conviction on the lesser included offense initially rendered by the jury is of no effect, and the prosecutor may move the trial court to declare a mistrial, discharge the jury, and set the entire matter for retrial. [Citations.] Alternatively, when faced with a deadlock on the greater offense and a verdict of guilty on the lesser included offense, the People may prefer to forgo the opportunity to convict the accused of the greater offense on retrial in favor of obtaining a present conviction on the lesser included offense. [Citation.] In that case, the People should move the trial court to exercise its discretion to dismiss the charge on the greater offense in furtherance of justice under section 1385.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Neither the language nor the rationale of <em>Fields </em>distinguishes between elements test and accusatory pleading test lesser included offenses for purposes of the retrial bar of section 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Second, the majority seems to adopt the view that a lesser included offense so determined under the accusatory pleading test is not a \u201cnecessarily\u201d lesser included offense and therefore has limited application. For example, the majority opinion does not express disagreement with the Supreme Court in <em>Fields, </em>it merely concludes that <em>Fields </em>does not apply if the lesser included offense is so designated under the accusatory pleading test rather than under the elements test because under the former it is not a <em>necessarily </em>lesser included offense. I find no rationale for this distinction. Certainly there is no reference to that distinction in <em>Fields, </em>which does not use the term \u201cnecessarily included offense,\u201d and the rationale of <em>Fields </em>applies as much to accusatory pleading test lesser included offenses as to element test lesser included offenses. Furthermore, <em>Lopez </em>defined accusatory pleading lesser included offenses as necessarily lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The majority acknowledges that for purposes of jury instructions, a lesser included offense under the accusatory pleading test is the equivalent of a lesser included offense under the elements test. If the trial court must instruct on the lesser included offense, then the appropriate instruction concludes: \u201cHowever, the court cannot accept a guilty verdict on a lesser crime unless you have unanimously found the defendant not guilty of the . . . greater crime.\u201d (CALJIC No. 17.10.) This instruction is consistent with <em>Fields </em>and makes no distinction between elements test lesser included offenses and accusatory pleading lesser included offenses. Therefore, in this case, the trial court erred by accepting guilty verdicts on the nonforcible sex offenses (lesser included offenses) without requiring a verdict of acquittal on the forcible sex offenses (greater offenses). Under these circumstances, the jury has returned an irregular verdict and if the court, as here, releases the jury, \u201cthe defendant stands convicted of the lesser included offense, and retrial on the greater offense is barred notwithstanding the jury\u2019s deadlock on that charge. (\u00a7 1023.)\u201d <em>(Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Although the majority opinion acknowledges that instructions on the lesser included offense determined under the accusatory pleading test must be given (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 795-796), it ignores the ramifications of the instruction requirement set forth in <em>Fields. </em>It also acknowledges that offenses determined to be lesser included offenses under the accusatory pleading test are subject to the provisions of section 1159. By its terms, section 1159 is applicable to \u201cnecessarily included\u201d lesser offenses. If section 1159 is applicable to accusatory pleading lesser included offenses, then those offenses are by definition \u201cnecessarily\u201d lesser included offenses. (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scheldt </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 162, 167-168 [282 Cal.Rptr. 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In my opinion the <em>Fields </em>decision is binding on this court and dispositive of the issue of whether the forcible sex offenses on which the jury in Scott\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>first trial could not reach a verdict can be retried following Scott\u2019s convictions on the lesser included nonforcible sex offenses. Based on the authority of <em>Fields, </em>I conclude that the trial court was without jurisdiction to retry Scott on the alleged forcible sex offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The People argue that even were Scott\u2019s retrial barred, there was no objection in the trial court and this contention may not be raised for the first time on appeal. I note, however, that there is no reference in <em>Fields </em>to the requirement of raising the bar first in the trial court, although that is clearly the best procedure. In any event, if the issue must be raised first in the trial court and was not, Scott received ineffective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel not raising the issue. Furthermore, the ineffective assistance of counsel was prejudicial because it resulted in three convictions that under <em>Fields </em>were barred from retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">I would reverse Scott\u2019s convictions for the three forcible sex offenses (counts 1, 3 and 5) and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing and reconsideration of the credit limitation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 10, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
