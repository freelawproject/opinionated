The record provided in support of the petition establishes the Department is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">At a single proceeding, a hearing for the selection and implementation of a permanent plan (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26) for Jonus S., the juvenile court terminated the parental rights of Jonus\u2019s father and of his mother, real party in interest Rebecca H. The father appealed. Rebecca did not appeal. In the father\u2019s appeal, this court reversed the order terminating his parental rights on the ground he was not properly noticed of the selection and implementation hearing. On remand, the juvenile court reinstated the father\u2019s parental rights and Rebecca\u2019s parental rights as well. This was error, as only the father\u2019s parental rights should have been reinstated. As explained in rule 1463(g) of the California Rules of Court, the purpose of termination of parental rights is to free the dependent child for adoption. Accordingly, \u201cthe court shall not terminate the rights of only one parent.\u201d However, the rule proceeds to provide an exception, permitting the termination of the rights of only one parent when \u201cthe rights of the other parent have been terminated by a California court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In this case, the juvenile court initially terminated the parental rights of both parents, in a single proceeding as required by California Rules of Court, rule 1463. On the father\u2019s appeal, we ordered his rights to be reinstated. At this point, Rebecca\u2019s rights had been \u201cterminated by a California court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d and the order terminating her rights could not be set aside by the juvenile court absent an appeal by Rebecca. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (i); <em>In re Meranda P. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1143, 1161 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 913] [\u201cThis statute forbids alteration or revocation of an order terminating parental rights except by means of a direct appeal from the order\u201d].) And, one parent, here, Rebecca, cannot benefit from an error in terminating the other parent\u2019s rights \u201cso as to make into error an errorless termination of <em>her </em>parental rights.\u201d <em>(In re Caitlin B. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1194 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 480], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">We have followed the procedures and given the notice described in <em>Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 177-183 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893]. There are no disputed factual issues, the legal error is clear, and the matter should be expedited. A peremptory writ in the first instance is thus appropriate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1088; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1218, 1222-1223 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 397, 859 P.2d 96]; <em>Ng v.
