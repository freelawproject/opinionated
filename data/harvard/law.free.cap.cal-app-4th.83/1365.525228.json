J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJO\">In this opinion, we consider whether the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a71001 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> preempts a common law cause of action by an ERISA fiduciary against an ERISA plan beneficiary for breach of an agreement settling an earlier federal court lawsuit concerning the reimbursement of medical benefits paid by the fiduciary. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">Carpenters Health and Welfare Trust Fund for California (CHWT) is an \u201cemployee benefit trust fund established pursuant to an agreement and declaration of trust executed by employer associations representing employers in the unionized construction industry and union representatives affiliated with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.\u201d CHWT is governed by a board of trustees (Trustees), which established the CHWT health and welfare plan (Plan). The Plan provides medical, hospitalization and other benefits to \u201ccovered participants and their eligible dependents,\u201d but \u201crequires reimbursement . . . when a participant or eligible dependent recovers from a potentially liable third party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-12\">Rodney McCracken is a carpenter eligible for benefits under the Plan. On September 7, 1994, Rodney\u2019s daughter, Jenny McCracken\u2014also eligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Plan benefits as Rodney\u2019s dependent\u2014was injured in a pedestrian/motor vehicle accident. Jenny sued those allegedly responsible for her injuries. In the interim, the Plan paid Jenny\u2019s medical expenses. Following the accident, Rodney and Jenny (collectively, the McCrackens) signed a reimbursement agreement acknowledging their obligation to reimburse CHWT if they recovered from a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Eventually, the McCrackens received a partial settlement in the sum of $100,000 for Jenny\u2019s injuries. CHWT demanded reimbursement for $96,763.42 in medical expenses paid on Jenny\u2019s behalf. The McCrackens refused to make any reimbursement. Accordingly, CHWT and the Trustees sued Rodney in federal district court for \u201crestitution\u201d of the $96,763.42.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">The parties later settled the federal lawsuit. The settlement was embodied in a \u201csettlement agreement and general release.\u201d Under its terms, the McCrackens agreed to pay CHWT $45,000. The McCrackens also agreed to pay CHWT \u201cup to 50 %\u201d of proceeds received by way of \u201cjudgment, arbitration award, settlement or otherwise\u201d up to a total of $51,763.42 in connection with the McCrackens\u2019 remaining claim against the City of Modesto (the City), the city where Jenny\u2019s injury occurred. In addition, the McCrackens agreed to keep CHWT apprised of all proceedings in their action against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Sometime thereafter, CHWT demanded a status report from the McCrackens regarding their case against the City. On January 23, 1998, the McCrackens, through their counsel, tacitly acknowledged a settlement in that case but refused to pay any sums to CHWT, contending that CHWT had no recourse under ERISA and was precluded from suing to recover any funds in either federal or state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">Based on this refusal, CHWT again sued the McCrackens, this time in state court for common law breach of contract. CHWT alleged that the McCrackens had breached the written settlement agreement by failing to notify CHWT of the settlement with the City and by failing to reimburse CHWT in the sum of $51,763.42. The McCrackens demurred, contending that California state courts lacked jurisdiction over the dispute. CHWT responded, arguing that ERISA did not preempt its state court action. The trial court evidently agreed with the McCrackens and sustained their demurrer on the ground that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction of the subject matter raised by [the complaint].\u201d Judgment was thereafter entered in favor of the McCrackens. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>H. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">This appeal raises a single legal issue\u2014namely, whether CHWT\u2019s common law cause of action against the McCrackens for breach of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement is preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the governing legal principles. \u201cERISA is a comprehensive federal law designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee pension and benefit plans. [Citation.] As a part of this integrated regulatory system, Congress enacted various safeguards to preclude abuse and to secure the rights and expectations that ERISA brought into being. [Citations.] Prominent among these safeguards is an expansive preemption provision, found at section 514 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144; [citations].)\u201d <em>(Marshall </em>v. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1045, 1050-1051 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 832 P.2d 573].) That provision preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d governed by ERISA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1144(a).)  The parties here vigorously dispute whether CHWT\u2019s claim relates to an employee benefit plan within the meaning of section 1144(a) and, hence, is preempted. The case law bearing on this issue is in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">In <em>Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Krafka </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 190 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 723] <em>(Krafka), </em>the court addressed whether a reimbursement claim made pursuant to the terms of an employee benefit plan was preempted by ERISA. In that case, \u201c[p]laintiff issued a group medical insurance policy to defendant\u2019s employer covering employees. The policy provided, among other things, that if a policyholder was injured in an accident caused by the negligence of another and plaintiff paid the insured\u2019s medical bills, it would be entitled to reimbursement out of any recovery by the insured under his or her uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193, fn. omitted.) After sustaining injuries in an automobile accident; \u201cdefendant signed a subrogation and reimbursement agreement acknowledging that, as required under the policy, plaintiff would be reimbursed out of any recovery by defendant from a third party.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) Subsequently, the defendant recovered under his uninsured motorist coverage but failed to reimburse the plaintiff for the medical benefits paid on his behalf. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>plaintiff filed a state court complaint against the defendant alleging several common law causes of action, including breach of the insurance policy reimbursement provision and breach of the subrogation and reimbursement agreement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">On these facts, our colleagues in the Second District held that the plaintiff\u2019s common law causes of action were preempted by ERISA, noting that it was \u201cundisputed plaintiff\u2019s claims \u2018relate to\u2019 the plan.\u201d <em>(Krafka, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at pp. 192, 194, fn. omitted.) The court concluded that the federal courts had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s claim and, therefore, directed that its state court complaint be dismissed. (Id. at p. 192.) In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Krafka </em>court specifically relied on the availability of a federal court remedy, reasoning as follows: \u201cA cause of action <em>is </em>available in federal court to an ERISA fiduciary seeking, as here, reimbursement for medical expenses paid. Section 1132(a)(3) provides a civil action may be brought: \u2018[B]y a participant, beneficiary, or <em>fiduciary </em>(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan[.]\u2019 (Italics added.) Federal courts have held a claim, as here, for reimbursement pursuant to the plan by an ERISA fiduciary falls within section 1132(a)(3). ([Citations]; see <em>Pacificare Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 34 F.3d 834, 837, 838.) The ERISA fiduciary can bring an equitable restitution action in federal court to enforce the reimbursement provision of the plan and to prevent the unjust enrichment of the employee. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under <em>Mertens </em>v. <em>Hewitt Associates </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 248, 256 [124 L.Ed.2d 161, 170, 113 S.Ct. 2063], the phrase \u2018other appropriate equitable relief\u2019 in section 1132(a)(3) means \u2018those categories of relief that were <em>typically </em>available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensatory damages.)\u2019 (Original italics.) In the present case, plaintiff seeks restitution.\u201d <em>(Krafka, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at pp. 195-196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">Less than a year after <em>Krafka </em>was decided, however, the Ninth Circuit held that section 1132(a)(3) <em>does not </em>authorize reimbursement actions, reasoning that the relief being sought in such actions was legal and not equitable in nature. (See <em>FMC Medical Plan v. Owens </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 1258, 1260-1262 <em>(Owens).) </em>Although the <em>Owens </em>court did not cite <em>Krafka, </em>the court did reject its interpretation of <em>Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, supra, </em>508 U.S. 248. (See <em>Owens, supra, </em>122 F.3d at p. 1262 [Reimbursement \u201cis not a form of equitable relief recognized by the narrow construction of section 1132(a)(3) as required by <em>Mertens. </em>This court relies on the construction mandated by <em>Mertens </em>and declines to extend the interpretation of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>1132(a)(3) to include a claim for reimbursement\u201d].) Ironically, in directing that the plaintiff\u2019s federal court complaint be dismissed, the Ninth Circuit pointed to the availability of a <em>state court </em>remedy, noting that the plaintiff \u201cwill have to pursue its claims under the Plans in state court if it wishes to receive the reimbursement it is allegedly owed by [the defendant].\u201d <em>(Owens, supra, </em>122 F.3d at p. 1262, fn. 2.) These remarks presuppose that such a state court action would <em>not </em>be preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Further complicating matters, at least three other federal circuits have rejected the approach taken by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Owens </em>and have allowed federal court reimbursement actions to proceed under section 1132(a)(3). (See <em>Administrative Committee v. Gauf </em>(7th Cir. 1999) 188 F.3d 767, 770-771; <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(11th Cir. 1998) 138 F.3d 1347, 1352-1353, fn. 5; see also <em>Southern Council of Industrial Workers </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(8th Cir. 1996) 83 F.3d 966, 969.) Despite this criticism, however, the Ninth Circuit has remained steadfast, just recently declining an invitation to revisit its holding in <em>Owens. </em>(See <em>Reynolds Metals Co. v. Ellis </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 202 F.3d 1246, 1248-1249 <em>(Ellis).)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Taken together, <em>Krafka </em>and <em>Owens </em>place a plaintiff seeking reimbursement under the terms of an employee benefit plan in a Catch-22. Under <em>Krafka, </em>the plaintiff must pursue its reimbursement claim in <em>federal </em>court. <em>(Krafka, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at pp. 192, 195-196.) Under <em>Owens, </em>by contrast, the plaintiff must pursue its reimbursement claim in <em>state </em>court. <em>(Owens, supra, </em>122 F.3d at p. 1262, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Fortunately, we need not resolve this conundrum, in the instant case. Here, we are concerned not with CHWT\u2019s original reimbursement claim against the McCrackens, which was the subject of an earlier federal court lawsuit between the parties, but rather with a subsequent action for breach of an agreement settling the earlier lawsuit. Regardless of whether the original action related to an employee benefit plan for the purpose of ERISA preemption, the subsequent action for breach of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement almost certainly does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">As noted above, section 1144(a) preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d governed by ERISA. Notwithstanding this broad language, as well as expansive language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>in some of its own prior decisions, the United States Supreme Court has recently cautioned against \u201cuncritical literalism ... in trying to construe [the phrase] \u2018relate to.\u2019 \u201d <em>(New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 645, 656 [115 S.Ct. 1671, 1677, 131 L.Ed.2d 695] <em>(Travelers).) </em>\u201cIf \u2018relate to\u2019 were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course, for \u2018[r]eally, universally, relations stop nowhere,\u2019 [citation]. But that, of course, would be to read Congress\u2019s words of limitation as mere sham, and to read the presumption against pre-emption out of the law whenever Congress speaks to the matter with generality.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 655 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1677]; see also <em>California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc. </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 316, 325 [117 S.Ct. 832, 838, 136 L.Ed.2d 791] [\u201cAs is always the case in our pre-emption jurisprudence, where \u2018federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation, ... we have worked on the \u201cassumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Accordingly, in determining the breadth of ERISA preemption, courts \u201cmust go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\u201d <em>(Travelers, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 656 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1677].) \u201cERISA was passed by Congress in 1974 to safeguard employees from the abuse and mismanagement of funds that had been accumulated to finance various types of employee benefits. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Morash </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 107, 112-113 [109 S.Ct. 1668, 1671, 104 L.Ed.2d 98].) \u201cThe focus of the statute thus is on the administrative integrity of benefits plans\u2014which presumes that some type of administrative activity is taking place. [Citations.] [\u00b6] The foregoing makes clear . . . why ERISA is concerned with regulating benefit \u2018plans\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Fort Halifax Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Coyne </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 1, 15-16 [107 S.Ct. 2211, 2219, 96 L.Ed.2d 1]; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 7 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2215] [\u201cERISA\u2019s pre-emption provision does not refer to state laws relating to \u2018employee benefits,\u2019 but to state laws relating to \u2018employee benefit <em>plans\u2019 . . </em>.\u201d].) In this case, although the settlement agreement between CHWT and the McCrackens relates to employee benefits, it does not relate to an employee benefit <em>plan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>Graham v. Balcor Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 146 F.3d 1052 <em>(Graham), </em>is instructive in this regard. In <em>Graham, </em>the parties entered a settlement agreement whereby the plaintiff gave up her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>right to pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit in exchange for the defendant\u2019s agreement to continue to provide benefits under its employee benefit plan. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1054.) The plaintiff later filed a lawsuit alleging that the defendant had breached the agreement and asserting various state law causes of action. <em>{Ibid.) </em>On appeal, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that these causes of action were preempted by ERISA, noting that the settlement agreement \u201cconcem[ed] only one employee, not the entire plan. Therefore, it falls outside plan administration, and does not trigger preemption.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1055.) The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he intent of ERISA preemption is to establish uniformity in the administration of plans, not in employee-employer settlements which are by necessity individualized. Therefore, we hold that ERISA does not preempt the state claims arising from this legal settlement, the subject matter of which is employee benefits, because it does not implicate the administration of an employee benefit plan.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">As in Graham, the settlement agreement at issue here concerns only the McCrackens, not CHWT\u2019s entire employee benefit plan. Under these circumstances, CHWT\u2019s common law cause of action for breach of the agreement is not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to overrule the McCrackens\u2019 demurrer.
