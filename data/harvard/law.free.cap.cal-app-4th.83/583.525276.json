Code, \u00a7 366.26) to William C. and Laura F.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the minors are Indian children, the court was required to comply not only with California\u2019s dependency law, but also the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.), which establishes minimum federal standards, both procedural and substantive, governing the removal of Indian children from their families. <em>(In re Alicia S. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 79, 81 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 121].) The mother has also filed a petition to invalidate the termination order under the federal act (see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address the mother\u2019s contention that the trial court violated a full faith and credit provision contained in the ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(d)) by not giving \u201cabsolute deference\u201d to a tribal resolution voicing opposition to the adoption of its members who are dependent children, such as the minors herein. We hold the full faith and credit provision of the ICWA does not require a state court to apply a tribe\u2019s law in violation of the state\u2019s own legitimate policy nor does it empower a tribe to control the outcome of the state court proceedings. Having reviewed the record and relevant legal authorities, we will affirm the judgment and deny the petition for invalidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Procedural and Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The mother has an extensive history, dating back to 1988, of drug abuse and drug-related arrests and incarcerations. In 1994, the Tulare County Superior Court sitting as a juvenile court removed her three oldest children because her substance abuse rendered her unable to properly care for the minors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">On May 8, 1995, as she failed to comply with her case plan for reunification with her other children, the mother gave birth to Laura. Both Laura and the mother tested positive for opiates. Hospital staff also observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Laura suffered from symptoms of controlled substance absorption in \u00fatero and controlled substance withdrawal. When interviewed, the mother admitted ingesting heroin four days before Laura\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Consequently, the Tulare County Health and Human Services Agency (the Agency) initiated dependency proceedings on Laura\u2019s behalf based on the mother\u2019s failure or inability to provide due to her abuse of controlled substances (\u00a7 300, subd. (b)). Because the mother was a member of the Tule River Indian Tribe (the Tribe), the Agency advised the juvenile court of the mother and Laura\u2019s Native American heritage and notified the Tribe of the proceedings. Parenthetically, the mother did not reside on the Tribe\u2019s reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In June 1995, the court, having previously determined Laura was a minor described under section 300, subdivisions (b) and (g), adjudged her a dependent child of the court. In addition, the court removed Laura from parental custody and adopted a recommended reunification plan that included substance abuse evaluation and recommended treatment, drug testing, and parenting classes. The court also authorized the Agency to investigate suitable placement for Laura that would include relatives or foster parents who were Tribe members.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Commencing in January 1996, the Tribe began to informally participate in Laura\u2019s dependency proceedings (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1412(i)(2)), through its representative, Louise Cornell. At that time, Cornell confirmed that the Tribe approved placement of Laura with her maternal great-aunt Brenda S., who was a member of the Tribe. Accordingly, the court authorized the relative placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">As was the case with her older children, the mother did not successfully complete her reunification program as to Laura. The mother failed to test as directed for drugs on numerous occasions and had tested positive for opiates on the two occasions she did test. She had not completed a requisite residential drug treatment program and by her admission had not attended Narcotics\u2019 Anonymous meetings as ordered by the court. She did not attend, let alone complete, parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Additionally, she was arrested in mid-1996 for being under the influence of a controlled substance and thereafter failed to take advantage of a diversion program in lieu of at least a one-year sentence. As a result, there was an outstanding warrant for her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">In light of the mother\u2019s dismal performance, a social worker recommended that reunification services be terminated and a permanency planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>hearing be set. At an August 1996 review hearing, the mother submitted the matter without argument. The court made the requisite findings to continue Laura\u2019s out-of-home placement, terminated services, and set the matter for a section 366.26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The Agency initially recommended adoption as a permanent plan for Laura based on her young age and good health. Her relative caregivers, who loved Laura and considered her part of their family, however, could not commit to adopting the child or becoming her legal guardian. The maternal great-aunt hoped Laura and her mother would reunite. Cornell, the Tribe\u2019s representative as well as its ICWA coordinator, also made it known that based on its customs and culture the Tribe was opposed to adoption as a general proposition for its members who were dependent children.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">By February 1997, the Agency had modified its recommendation. Accordingly, the court selected long-term foster care as the permanent plan for Laura. Long-term foster care remained the court\u2019s permanent plan for Laura through two semiannual, postpermanency planning review hearings (\u00a7 366.3). Notably, there was evidence that although there was a strong bond between Laura and her relative caregivers and the maternal great-aunt acknowledged reunification might never occur, a tribal representative dissuaded the relatives from pursuing adoption of Laura.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Then, on April 13, 1998, the mother gave birth to William. Tragically, he was also bom with opiates in his system. Thus, within days of the infant\u2019s birth, the Agency initiated dependency proceedings as to William based on his prenatal drug exposure and his mother\u2019s abuse of his half siblings (\u00a7 300, subds. (b) and (j)). As in Laura\u2019s case, the mother did not live on the Tribe\u2019s reservation at the time of William\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The mother admitted she had a problem with illicit drag use. She used heroin during her pregnancy and within a couple of days of William\u2019s birth. She had failed to follow through with any drag treatment programs and expressed an unwillingness to comply with any recommendations or referrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In June 1998, the court adjudged William a dependent child, placed the infant with his mother\u2019s cousin, Mrs. P., who was also a member of the Tribe and ordered reunification services for the mother\u2019s benefit pursuant to the ICWA. Cornell, again as representative for the Tribe, voiced a desire to be involved in the case plan for the mother. The court endorsed the idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">As in the past, the mother failed to comply with her reunification plan. She failed to submit to drag testing or complete any drug rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>program. The mother told a social worker that completing such a program was just \u201ctoo difficult\u201d and that she just could not do it. She visited William only once in six months and never called to check on him. By November of 1998, the mother\u2019s precise whereabouts were unknown. One of the mother\u2019s relatives thought the mother was homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Due to the mother\u2019s lack of compliance with the case plan, the court in December 1998 continued William\u2019s out-of-home placement and terminated reunification services. During the same time frame Laura\u2019s relative caregivers had decided to pursue her adoption. Accordingly, the court elected to set a section 366.26 hearing for both minors in April 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Reports prepared in anticipation of the section 366.26 hearing revealed the children had become very attached to their respective care providers who in turn wished to adopt them. The children\u2019s American Indian heritage could be maintained in each household, given the families\u2019 ties to the Tribe. The Agency recommended that both children be freed by adoption by their respective relative caregivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On the date originally set for the joint section 366.26 hearing, an attorney for the Tribe made a special appearance. While the Agency claims counsel\u2019s appearance amounted to the Tribe\u2019s intervention in the matter, there is no indication in the record that the Tribe ever formally moved to intervene. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1412 (i)(l).) The Tribe, along with the mother, requested a contested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Consequently, the matter was put over to a date in July 1999. At that hearing, a referee selected legal guardianship as the permanent plan for each minor. However, the Agency moved for rehearing (\u00a7 252), which the court granted. In turn, the referee\u2019s orders were vacated and the court calendared a trial de novo on permanency planning for September 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">At the September hearing, counsel for the Tribe once again made a special appearance. The court took judicial notice of its file as well as an April 1999 tribal resolution voicing opposition based on the Tribe\u2019s culture and customs to the adoption of dependent children such as the minors herein who are members of the Tribe. The Agency then called a single witness whom the court found qualified as an expert under the ICWA to render an opinion regarding whether Laura and William\u2019s continued custody by the mother was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to them (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Based on her experience, training, review of the files of each child, and her interviews of the social workers assigned to their cases, the witness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d of such a risk of harm. The mother simply did not understand her drug addiction. Indeed, she had not even taken the first step towards recovery, that is, taking responsibility for her own use, let alone ever followed through with the treatment she needed. At this point, many treatment programs would not accept an in-patient client, such as the mother, who had already failed three or more treatment programs. The mother had not completed any of the five drug treatment programs in which she was previously enrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Because of the mother\u2019s drug addiction, her continued custody would result in the minors\u2019 neglect, a lack of bonding between parent and child, as well as a lack of food and shelter for the children. It was also of importance to the witness that Laura and William were at a significant stage of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Other than to cross-examine the expert witness, neither the mother nor the Tribe introduced any evidence at the hearing. At the close of the hearing, the judge found clear and convincing evidence established that it is likely both Laura and William would be adopted. The court went on to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that continued custody by the mother was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the minors. It then terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights in both children and ordered them placed for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The mother filed a timely notice of appeal from the court\u2019s decision. She also filed a petition for invalidation of the judgment pursuant to the ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\n<em>Full Faith and Credit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Prior to the permanency planning hearing originally scheduled for April 1999, counsel for the Tribe wrote the court, asking it to take judicial notice of a tribal resolution. The heart of the resolution read: \u201cthe Tule River Tribe, as a sovereign American Indian Nation with a government-to-government relationship with the United States, declares that its child-rearing practices and longstanding custom and tradition shall be recognized in all juvenile dependency proceedings involving a minor who is a Tule River Tribal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>member or eligible for membership in the Tribe as evidence that adoption of the child is not in the interest of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>As alluded to above, at the outset of the September permanency planning hearing, the court announced it would take judicial notice of the resolution over the objection of the Agency and minors\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\n<em>Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On appeal, the mother contends the resolution was entitled to full faith and credit under the ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(d)). This provision requires all jurisdictions within the United States to give full faith and credit to \u201cthe public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any Indian tribe [that are] applicable to Indian child custody proceedings to the same extent that such entities give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any other entity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">According to the mother, the tribal resolution was a public act, record, and judicial decision entitled to \u201cabsolute deference\u201d in the juvenile court. Because the resolution provided that adoption was not in the best interest of dependent minors who were members of or eligible for membership in the Tribe, the mother therefore argues the court could not properly free Laura and William for adoption. As explained below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The mother fails to cite, and our research does not disclose, any case law analyzing 25 United States Code section 1911(d), much less the mother\u2019s insistence on \u201cabsolute deference.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, case law interpreting our federal Constitution\u2019s full faith and credit clause settles the issue. By analogy, we conclude the juvenile court did not violate the full faith and credit provision in the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The constitutional full faith and credit clause requires each state to give effect to official acts of other states. <em>(Nevada v. Hall </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 410, 422 [99 S.Ct. 1182, 1189, 59 L.Ed.2d 416].) However, \u201cprecedence differentiates the credit owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to judgments.\u201d <em>(Baker v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1998) 522 U.S. 222, 232 [118 S.Ct. 657, 663, 139 L.Ed.2d 580].) The obligation is \u201cexacting\u201d as to judgments. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 233 [118 S.Ct. at p. 664].) A judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>entered in one state must be respected in another provided that the first state had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. <em>(Nevada </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>440 U.S. 410, 422 [99 S.Ct. 1182, 1189].) Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201ccredit must be given to the judgment of another state although the forum [state] would not be required to entertain the suit on which the judgment was founded.\u201d <em>(Milwaukee County </em>v. <em>White Co. </em>(1935) 296 U.S. 268, 277 [56 S.Ct. 229, 234, 80 L.Ed. 220].) \u201cFor claim and issue preclusion (res judicata) purposes, in other words, the judgment of the rendering State gains nationwide force.\u201d <em>(Baker v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>522 U.S. at p. 233 [118 S.Ct. at p. 664], fn. omitted.) The same rule, however, does not necessarily apply to statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u201cThe Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel \u2018a state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>522 U.S. at p. 232 [118 S.Ct. at p. 663].) Indeed, as the Supreme Court in <em>Nevada </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>440 U.S. 410, observed, the full faith and credit clause does not require a state to apply another state\u2019s statutory law in violation of its own legitimate public policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 422 [99 S.Ct. at p. 1189]; see also <em>Pacific Ins. Co. v. Comm\u2019n </em>(1938) 306 U.S. 493, 502-505 [59 S.Ct. 629, 633-634, 83 L.Ed. 940].) With these principles in mind, we return to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The first question is obvious. Was the resolution a public act, record or judicial proceeding of the Tribe? The face of the resolution does not provide any definitive answer. In addition, neither the mother nor the Tribe introduced any evidence in the juvenile court to establish the nature of the tribal resolution for purposes of 25 United States Code section 1911(d). At best, the record reveals argument below that the resolution was all three, that is, a public act, record and judicial proceeding of the Tribe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">For the sake of the mother\u2019s argument, w.e will assume the resolution was either a public act or record of the Tribe, in other words a tribal statute. We will briefly explain however, before moving on, why we cannot find the resolution was a judgment or other enforceable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">To begin, the Tulare County Superior Court sitting as a juvenile court and the Tribe had concurrent jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving Laura and William inasmuch as these Indian children were neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>domiciled nor residing within any reservation of. the Tribe. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b); <em>Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band </em>v. <em>Holyfield </em>(1988) 490 U.S. 30, 36 [109 S.Ct. 1597, 1602, 104 L.Ed.2d 29].) That is to say, under the circumstances either the juvenile court or the Tribe could conduct such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Nevertheless, the record reveals the Tribe never exercised its jurisdiction over either child. As mentioned in our factual summary, almost immediately after the birth of first Laura and then William, the Agency initiated dependency proceedings to remove each child from the mother\u2019s custody. Notwithstanding the juvenile court\u2019s exercise of its dependency jurisdiction under section 300, the ICWA gave the Tribe the means by which to still exercise its jurisdiction over Laura and William.  As the court in <em>Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band v. Holyfield, supra, </em>490 U.S. 30, explained title 25 United States Code section 1911(b): \u201c[0]n petition of either parent or the tribe, state-court proceedings for foster care placement or termination of parental rights are to be transferred to the tribal court, except in cases of \u2018good cause,\u2019 objection by either parent, or declination of jurisdiction by the tribal court.\u201d <em>(Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band v. Holyfield, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 36 [109 S.Ct. 1182, 1602].)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">If the matter is not transferred to a tribal court, the Tribe has the right to intervene in the state court proceedings at any time. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c); <em>In re Alicia S., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In this case, neither the Tribe nor the mother petitioned the juvenile court to transfer the matter to the Tribe\u2019s jurisdiction (25 U.S.C. 1911(b)); indeed, the Tribe never elected to actually intervene in the juvenile court proceedings (25 U.S.C. 1911(c)). Because there was never any effort to transfer dependency jurisdiction to the Tribe, we are hard pressed to imagine how the Tribe\u2019s resolution could have amounted to a judgment or other enforceable order. Thus, we have concluded the resolution was neither a judgment nor other order entitled to res judicata or collateral estoppel effect in the juvenile court under the ICWA\u2019s full faith and credit provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Given our assumption that the resolution was a public act or record, the second question which we must ask is: did the ICWA\u2019s full faith and credit provision require the juvenile court to substitute the resolution for California\u2019s statutory preference for adoption? The answer is clearly no.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">As noted previously, the full faith and credit clause of our federal Constitution does not require a state to apply another state\u2019s law in violation of its own legitimate public policy. <em>(Nevada v. Hall, supra, </em>440 U.S. at p. 422 [99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>S.Ct. at p. 1189].) By analogy, we presume the same must be said of the ICWA\u2019s full faith and credit provision. In other words, we hold that the full faith and credit provision of the ICWA does not require a state court to apply a Tribe\u2019s law in violation of the state\u2019s own legitimate policy. If the Tribe wished to assert its own law in the matter of Laura and William, it could have done so by exercising its jurisdiction under the ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b)). The full faith and credit provision of the ICWA did not empower the Tribe to control the outcome of the proceedings here.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">California has a compelling state interest in providing stable permanent homes for children who have been removed from parental custody and for whom reunification efforts with their parents have been unsuccessful. <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 307 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].) In furtherance of its interest in stability and permanence for dependent children who cannot return to parental custody, California has declared a strong preference in section 366.26 for adoption as the most permanent, and thus the best, plan for a dependent child. <em>(In re Jose V. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1792, 1799 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 684].) Consequently, once a juvenile court determines in a particular case that adoption is feasible, the less desirable and less permanent alternatives of guardianship and long-term foster care need not be pursued. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Here, the tribal resolution against adoption runs counter to California\u2019s strong preference for adoption of such dependent children. Prefatory language in the tribal resolution indeed acknowledges that \u201cthe statutory preference contained in California law for adoption of minors who cannot be returned to a biological parent within certain specified timeframes <em>is in direct conflict </em>with the long-standing child-rearing practices of the Tule River Indian Tribe, Indian family organization of the Tribe and the customs and traditions of the Tule River Indian Tribe . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">For the juvenile court to apply the tribal resolution, as the mother argues the court should have, would violate the state\u2019s own legitimate policy. Consequently, the ICWA\u2019s full faith and credit provision did not require the juvenile court to adhere to the tribal resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">II-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The judgment terminating parental rights is affirmed.
