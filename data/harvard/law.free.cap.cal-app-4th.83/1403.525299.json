(Citicorp) and its affiliates appeal from a decision of the superior court in favor of the Franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>Tax Board (FTB) in this action for refund of corporate franchise taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. The FTB properly included the California sales of Citicorp\u2019s Citibank (South Dakota), a member of the unitary corporate group, in calculating the amount of income apportionable to California operations under the rule in effect at the time Citicorp filed its amended returns. We also reject Citicorp\u2019s contention that the gain on sales of real property, including its corporate headquarters, was not business income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. The parties submitted a joint stipulation and exhibits to the trial court regarding the relevant facts, which are summarized as follows. Citicorp is a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in New York. Citicorp and its affiliate corporations are part of a worldwide financial services organization. Citicorp directly and indirectly owns several hundred foreign and domestic corporations that offer lending, deposit taking, investment management and other traditional financial and banking services. At the relevant time Citicorp owned over 550 domestic corporations, 88 of which are California taxpayers. The two disputed issues in this appeal are the FTB\u2019s allocation of California destination sales by Citicorp\u2019s Citibank (South Dakota) affiliate, and characterization of the gain on sales of four properties as business income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">\n<em>Taxes Attributable to Sales by Citibank (South Dakota)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">For the tax years ending December 31, 1985, through December 31, 1988, Citicorp and its affiliates filed separate company franchise tax returns in California. In 1992 and 1993, the Citicorp group filed amended returns requesting refunds for the challenged years, taking the position that Citicorp was conducting a worldwide unitary business, and that the combined franchise tax must be computed on a unitary basis. FTB has not challenged Citicorp\u2019s position regarding its unitary business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">Prior to Citicorp\u2019s filing of the amended returns, the State Board of Equalization (SEE) issued its two decisions in <em>Appeal of Finnigan Corporation. (Appeal of Finnigan Corporation </em>(Aug. 25, 1988) [1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-653, p. 25,242 <em>(Finnigan I), </em>opn. on denial of rehg. (Jan. 24, 1990) [1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-797, p. 25,755 <em>(Finnigan II) </em>(reference to both opinions collectively is to <em>Finnigan).) </em>Changing the way in which, an out-of-state affiliate\u2019s sales are apportioned to determine the income of the unitary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>business, <em>Finnigan </em>overruled the precedential decision of <em>Appeal of Joyce, Inc., </em>which had guided allocation of corporate franchise taxes in California for 22 years. <em>Finnigan </em>was applied retroactively in the subsequent case of <em>Appeal of The NutraSweet Company </em>(Oct. 29, 1992) [1992-1993 Transfer Binder] paragraph 402-524, p. 27,351. <em>(Appeal of Joyce, Inc. </em>(Nov. 23, 1966) [1966-1971 Transfer Binder] \u00b6 203-523, p. 13,115; Cal. Franchise Tax Bd., Notice No. 90-3 (June 8, 1990) [1991-1992 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-820, p. 25,856 (Notice No. 90-3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Citicorp\u2019s amended returns constituted timely claims for refund. It is undisputed that Citibank (South Dakota), a South Dakota affiliate that handles VISA and MasterCard credit card business, was a member of the unitary group for the years in question. It is also undisputed that Citibank (South Dakota) had no physical presence in California, its only office was located in South Dakota, and it was not subject to California\u2019s corporate franchise or income tax during the years in question. Citibank (South Dakota) had numerous credit card customers in California. In calculating its California sales, Citicorp excluded California sales by Citibank (South Dakota) in accordance with the holding in the overruled <em>Appeal of Joyce, Inc., </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">FTB audited the amended returns and recalculated the California sales to include the California sales by Citibank (South Dakota) pursuant to the rule of <em>Finnigan. </em>The FTB\u2019s calculation reduced the amount of the refund due to Citicorp. The question presented to the trial court was whether application of the <em>Finnigan </em>rule was appropriate and constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">\n<em>Taxes Attributable to Sales Characterized as Business Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">The second issue involves characterization of the income from the sale of corporate properties. With respect to the year ended December 31, 1987, the FTB concluded that gains from the sale of four parcels of real property constituted business income and should be included in Citicorp\u2019s business income subject to apportionment in California. The four properties included the corporate headquarters of a wholly owned subsidiary, a nine-story office building partially occupied by corporate personnel, a 59-story building known as Citicorp Center, and a residence and land in Osaka, Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">During the income years at issue and prior to the sale of the properties, Citicorp included the original cost of the four properties in the denominator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>of the property factors used to determine business income in an apportionment formula.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Citicorp also included any rental income and expenses associated with the management of the buildings in determining its business income attributable to California sources. However, when it filed its amended return, Citicorp characterized the gain on the sale of these properties as nonbusiness income. In its audit of Citicorp\u2019s amended return and request for refund, the FTB recharacterized the gain on sale of these properties as business income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">On October 22, 1997, Citicorp filed a suit for refund in the superior court. The complaint contained six causes of action. The first through fourth causes of action alleged that inclusion of the sales of Citibank (South Dakota) violated the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA, adopted in California as Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25120 et seq.) and the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and California Constitutions, and the commerce clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fifth cause of action alleged that the gains from sales of the buildings were nonbusiness income under the applicable statutes and regulations. The sixth cause of action was resolved between the parties and no issue regarding it is raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">On March 3, 1999, the court issued its amended statement of decision, deciding the matter in favor of the FTB. Citicorp and its affiliates appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">Citicorp challenges the FTB\u2019s inclusion of the property and sales of the South Dakota affiliate in the numerator of the formula used to apportion the group\u2019s California income. Citicorp argues that including property and sales of the South Dakota affiliate is inconsistent with the Revenue and Taxation Code and the unitary method of taxation in that it ignores separate business identities. Citicorp also contends that the FTB\u2019s position violates the holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>of <em>Current, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 382 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 407] by taxing nontaxable property of the out-of-state affiliate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Citicorp argues that application of the rule of <em>Finnigan </em>violates the UDITPA principle of uniformity because other states did not adopt it. Citicorp urges this court to ignore <em>Finnigan </em>in light of the FTB\u2019s initial opposition to that rule and the SBE\u2019s overruling of <em>Finnigan </em>and the prospective return to the old rule of <em>Joyce </em>after the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Citicorp\u2019s second challenge is to the characterization of the four sales of real property as business income. Citicorp argues that the resulting gains are not business income under a transactional test and that the trial court erred in applying a separate functional test of business income. Citing the FTB\u2019s own regulations, Citicorp argues that the challenged gains are not business income under any test. Finally, Citicorp contends that it is unconstitutional to tax the gain on these sales. We review Citicorp\u2019s arguments in the order presented and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">\n<em>Background of Franchise Taxation of Unitary Businesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">This case involves apportionment of the income of a unitary business.  A unitary business is one that receives income \u201cfrom or attributable to sources both within and without the state . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u00a7 25101.) If a unitary business exists, taxes are apportioned by formula to allocate to California for taxation, \u201cits fair share of the taxable values of the taxpayer . . . .\u201d <em>(Butler Brothers </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 664, 667-668.) In calculating corporate franchise taxes of a unitary business, the FTB apportions income generated by the unitary business based on the relationship of the combined income to the income derived from California sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>The California statutory apportionment formula takes into account three fractions. The first fraction, known as the \u201cproperty factor,\u201d has a numerator of the average value of California real and tangible personal property and a denominator of all real and tangible personal property. (\u00a7 25129.) The second fraction is the \u201cpayroll factor,\u201d which is the total amount of compensation paid by the taxpayer in California divided by the total compensation paid everywhere. (\u00a7 25132.) The third fraction is the \u201csales factor,\u201d which is the total sales in California divided by the \u201ctotal sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the income year.\u201d (\u00a7 25134.) Each fraction has a numerator representing the amount attributable to California and a denominator representing the worldwide amount.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statutory scheme of apportionment is derived from UDITPA, which has been adopted by over 20 states and was enacted in California in 1966. Revenue and Taxation Code sections 25134 and 25135 are substantially identical to UDITPA sections 15 and 16 (7A West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (1999) U. Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16, pp. 392-393.). The expressed general purpose of UDITPA is to standardize state corporate income tax laws and \u201cto make uniform the law of those states which enact it.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25138.) If each state applied the apportionment formula in the same way, the sum of the amounts of income attributed to each taxing state would equal the tax base of the corporation and provide uniform fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">The issue in apportionment of sales is how to properly attribute income among all of the states in which a business operates. Sales of tangible personal property are generally attributed to the state of destination if the taxpayer is subject to taxation in that state. If the taxpayer\u2019s only presence in that state is its customers, sales are generally \u201cthrown back,\u201d or considered for apportionment in its state of origin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shortly after California\u2019s adoption of UDITPA, the SEE issued its opinion in <em>Appeal of Joyce, Inc., supra, </em>[1966-1971 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 203-523, p. 13,115. (FTB, Notice No. 90-3, <em>supra, </em>[1991-1992 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-802, p. 25,856.) In <em>Joyce, </em>the SBE determined that Public Law No. 86-272 (Sept. 14, 1959) 73 Statutes at Large 555 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 et seq.) prevented the state from considering income from a member of a unitary group where the individual member\u2019s sole contact in California was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>sales representatives who solicited, but could not accept, orders in the state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Joyce </em>involved an Ohio corporation and its California subsidiary, both of which sold shoes in California. Only the subsidiary was subject to taxation in California. The SEE concluded that inbound sales by the parent company, which was not subject to tax in California, could not be included in the allocation formula for purposes of calculating the sales factor, even though another member of the group was taxable in California. <em>Joyce </em>was the rule in California from 1966 until 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">In 1988 the SEE adopted a new method of attributing income for members of unitary groups. <em>Finnigan I, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 401-653, page 25,241, a case that was the factual mirror image of <em>Joyce, </em>involved two California corporations with outbound sales to other states. Only one of the corporations had a nexus with the foreign state and the FTB threw back the sales of the second corporation to California. The SEE, however, agreed with the taxpayer that outbound sales to non-Califomia destinations made by a California member of a unitary group should not be thrown back to California for inclusion in the sales factor formula where another member of the group had a nexus in the foreign state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This change from <em>Joyce </em>was based on the fact that one member of the unitary group was taxable in the destination state, even though the individual seller was not. Under <em>Joyce, </em>if the individual seller had not been subject to tax in the foreign state, its foreign sales would have been thrown back to the state of origin. The SEE reached its new result by interpreting the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in this portion of the Revenue and Taxation Code to mean all members of a unitary group. In addition, in <em>Joyce </em>the SEE had been concerned that the federal statute (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381(a)) would be interpreted in an expansive manner to restrict taxation of unitary groups. However, such legitimate fears were subsequently proved unfounded. <em>(Finnigan II, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-797, p. 25,755; see, e.g., <em>Brown Group Retail, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 823 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 202].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>On January 24, 1990, the SBE issued its opinion denying rehearing in <em>Finnigan II. (Finnigan II, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-797, p. 25,755.) The SBE noted that it had not expressly overruled <em>Joyce </em>in <em>Finnigan I </em>because the factual context was different. However, the SBE noted criticism of the <em>Joyce </em>rule and specifically overruled the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">In 1990, the FTB issued Notice No. 90-3, announcing that the rule of <em>Joyce </em>no longer applied, and that the FTB would implement the decision in <em>Finnigan. </em>Neither <em>Finnigan </em>nor Notice No. 90-3 specifically discusses retroactive application of <em>Finnigan, </em>but the decision was applied retroactively in the <em>NutraSweet </em>case. <em>(Appeal of The NutraSweet Company, supra, </em>[1992-1993 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 402-524, at p. 27,352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">The SBE\u2019s 1992 decision in <em>NutraSweet </em>involved facts similar to the facts of <em>Joyce. </em>In <em>NutraSweet, </em>sales into California by a Puerto Rico subsidiary of a unitary group were attributed to California for purposes of the sales factor because a part of the group was taxable in California, even though the actual seller was not. The <em>NutraSweet </em>decision applied the <em>Finnigan </em>rule to tax years 1974 through 1977. The <em>NutraSweet </em>rule was in effect and applied to Citicorp in this case when Citicorp filed amended returns seeking refunds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">In summary, under the <em>Joyce </em>rule, income is only attributable to California for purposes of the allocation formula if the affiliate generating the income has a nexus in the state. Under <em>Joyce, </em>the income of Citibank (South Dakota) would not be attributed to California. Under the <em>Finnigan/NutraSweet </em>rule, the FTB, in determining the proportion of the combined income in California, treats all affiliates as a unitary taxpayer and includes income generated in California from affiliate corporations located outside the state if any member of the group is taxable in the state, even though the affiliate itself is not taxable. Citicorp argues that <em>Joyce </em>supplies the appropriate rule, while the FTB follows <em>Finnigan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">\n<em>Finnigan Is Consistent with Unitary Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">Citicorp argues that the result in <em>Finnigan </em>twists the unitary method in a manner that allows the state to tax the income of a nontaxpaying entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>such as its South Dakota affiliate. However, by considering the California income of Citibank (South Dakota), the FTB is not taxing, but is apportioning income attributable to California. <em>(Edison California Stores </em>v. <em>McColgan, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 472, 474-475.) Taxes are actually imposed only on the corporations that are subject to California\u2019s taxing jurisdiction. Our Supreme Court has approved apportionment formulas as an appropriate method of determining the California income of a unitary group of corporations. <em>(Ibid. </em>[parent and 15 subsidiary corporations, only one of which was qualified in California, properly subject to three-part allocation formula].) The United States Supreme Court held that computing income of a unitary business that is allocable to one state by use of a reasonable formula does not result in an impermissible tax on extraterritorial values. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 483, citing <em>Butler Bros. </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 501, 507 [62 S.Ct. 701, 704, 86 L.Ed. 991]; and <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Grosjean </em>(1937) 301 U.S. 412, 427 [57 S.Ct. 772, 778, 81 L.Ed. 1193, 112 A.L.R. 293] [\u201cIt is not a denial of due process to adjust such license taxes as are here involved to meet the local evil resulting from business practices and superior economic power[,] even though those advantages and that power are largely due to the fact that the taxpayer does business not only in Louisiana[,] but in other states\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">When a unitary business is established, a taxpayer challenging the FTB\u2019s apportionment method must show the \u201cformula allocation method was arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Edison California Stores v. McColgan, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 482.) Although Citicorp argues that <em>Edison </em>is irrelevant here because it predates the enactment of UDITPA, the principles of <em>Edison </em>apply to Citicorp\u2019s argument. Regardless of the date of enactment of the present law, <em>Edison </em>is a clear response to Citicorp\u2019s claim that consideration of the out-of-state affiliate\u2019s California activity results in extraterritorial taxation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe ascertainment of income by the apportionment method is not necessarily a disregard of the corporate entity nor an extension of the provisions of the statute by implication. Formula allocation is merely a method of ascertaining the true income attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s business . . . .\u201d (30 Cal.2d at p. 481.) Finnigan\u2019s methodology is consistent with accepted principles of taxation of a unitary business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">\n<em>The Finnigan Interpretation of \u201cTaxpayer\u201d Is Not Unreasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">Citicorp argues that the trial court stated a \u201cremarkable\u201d proposition without legal support when it upheld the SBE\u2019s determination in <em>Finnigan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number><em>supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 401-653, page 25,242, that the context of section 25135 required the SBE to interpret \u201ctaxpayer\u201d as applying to the entire unitary group for purposes of application of the throwback rule in <em>Finnigan. </em>The referenced portion of the trial court\u2019s opinion discussed the <em>Finnigan </em>interpretation of the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d for purposes of section 25135, as referring to the unitary group, rather than the individual affiliate. Citicorp\u2019s position is that the sales of its South Dakota affiliate cannot be included in the California portion of the allocation formula because the affiliate is not subject to tax in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">In <em>Finnigan, </em>the SBE considered out-of state sales by a California subsidiary, the opposite of the situation in this case. In <em>Finnigan, </em>the FTB had thrown back outbound sales to California because the selling subsidiary was not taxable in the foreign states, even though other members of the group were. The SBE accepted the taxpayer\u2019s argument that it should not interpret the throwback rule on a separate company basis when it interpreted the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in all other instances involving unitary groups to mean all corporations in the unitary group. Citicorp argues that \u201ctaxpayer\u201d means a single company and that it was error to assign the South Dakota sales here when the single company making the sale is not subject to tax here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">As the trial court here pointed out, section 23030 provides: \u201cExcept where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this chapter govern the construction of this part.\u201d Thus, although former section 23037 defined \u201ctaxpayer\u201d as: \u201cany person or bank subject to the tax imposed under . . . this part,\u201d the FTB is free to interpret the term as required by the context of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The reasoning in <em>Finnigan, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 401-653, page 25,241 which relies on FTB regulations and the purposes of UDITPA provisions, supports the court\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>the SBE\u2019s construction of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in this context as referring to the unitary group and refusing to throw back sales when any member of the group is taxable in the destination state. The trial court correctly determined that the provisions of UDITPA do not require the state to confine its focus to members of the group that have a jurisdictional nexus to the state when dealing with a hydra-headed corporation with multistate and multinational connections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">\n<em>There Is No Conflict with Current, Inc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">Citicorp contends that by \u201cignoring\u201d the nontaxable status of Citibank (South Dakota), the trial court\u2019s decision is contrary to the holding in <em>Current, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th 382. <em>Current, Inc. </em>has no application here. That decision invalidated a statute that purported to impose a use tax on an out-of-state mail order company based solely on its acquisition by a corporation with substantial California contacts. The <em>Current, Inc. </em>case did not involve integrated business operations. The court expressly noted that the parties in that case had stipulated that the two companies \u201c \u2018did not have integrated operations or management.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">Citibank (South Dakota) is not being subjected to a tax in this case. The relevant stipulated fact in this case is that Citicorp and its affiliates, including Citibank (South Dakota) \u201cwere conducting a worldwide unitary business during the years in issue, and their combined franchise tax liability must be computed on a unitary basis.\u201d The rule applied here results in recognition that the unitary group benefited from sales in California. The decision of the trial court in this case is not contrary to the discussion in <em>Current, Inc., </em>which involved a situation wholly different from an attempt to fairly apportion components of an accepted formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">\n<em>Principles of Uniformity Do Not Require Unanimous Acceptance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">Citicorp maintains that the <em>Finnigan </em>rule violates UDITPA principles of uniformity because the Multistate Tax Commission has not followed it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Citicorp also notes that two state courts that have considered the <em>Finnigan </em>rule have rejected it. <em>(Dover Corp. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1995) 271 Ill.App.3d 700 [208 Ill.Dec. 167, 648 N.E.2d 1089]; <em>Great No. Nekoosa </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number><em>State Tax </em>(Me. 1996) 675 A.2d 963.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Citicorp argues that of 23 states that have adopted UDITPA, only three other states (Utah, Indiana and Kansas) follow the <em>Finnigan </em>approach by administrative action. (See Table of Jurisdictions, 62 West\u2019s Ann. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code (2000 Supp.) foll. \u00a7 25128, pp. 294-295 [24 states have adopted the uniform act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">No doubt, the circumstances identified by Citicorp contributed to the SBE\u2019s subsequent decision to return to the <em>Joyce </em>rule. <em>(In re Appeal of Huffy Corporation, supra, </em>[1995-1999 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 403-031, at p. 29,261.) However, the mere fact that other bodies and jurisdictions did not follow the <em>Finnigan </em>rule is not a valid basis for this court to disregard the considered decision of a constitutionally created quasi-judicial administrative agency. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 17.) Adherence to an outmoded rule for the sake of consistency in the face of compelling reasons to change is not a virtue. Valid principled reasons support the rationale of <em>Joyce </em>and the rationale of <em>Finnigan. </em>In the absence of legislative direction to the contrary, the SBE is empowered to interpret cases before it in a manner that is consistent with the purposes of the state\u2019s tax code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">The Legislature has delegated to the SBE the duty of hearing and determining appeals from actions of the FTB. (\u00a7\u00a7 19045-19048.) Although the courts \u201cbear ultimate responsibility for construing the statute, we accord great respect to the Board\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>(City of Gilroy v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 589, 597 [260 Cal.Rptr. 723].) Merely pointing to the fact that the FTB\u2019s decision in <em>Finnigan </em>ultimately proved to be a minority position does not support Citicorp\u2019s challenge to the legality or constitutionality of the <em>Finnigan </em>interpretation of the relevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">\n<em>The Decision in Yamaha Corp. Does Not Require Reversal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">Citicorp urges this court to completely disregard the SBE decision in <em>Finnigan </em>based on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the weight to be given to the SBE\u2019s interpretations of law in <em>Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031], In <em>Yamaha Corp., </em>the Supreme Court distinguished the standard of review of the exercise of an agency\u2019s quasi-legislative rulemaking function and agency interpretations of the meaning of a statute. A less deferential standard applies to the latter pronouncements. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 6, 11.) Even so, \u201c. . . \u2018the judiciary, although taking ultimate responsibility for the construction of the statute, accords great weight and respect to the administrative construction. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>The <em>Yamaha </em>court determined that the weight to be given to an agency\u2019s construction of a statute is \u201csituational\u201d and depends on consideration of two categories of relevant factors. <em>(Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 12.) The court referred to factors \u201c \u2018indicating that the agency has a comparative interpretive advantage over the courts,\u2019 and those \u2018indicating that the interpretation in question is probably correct.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Focusing solely on the second category, Citicorp argues that the SBE\u2019s <em>Finnigan </em>decision was incorrect and should, therefore, be rejected by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">As noted above, the Legislature has allocated to the SBE the power to hear and determine appeals of franchise tax matters. (\u00a7\u00a7 19045-19048.) The agency\u2019s expertise in tax matters is not subject to dispute and Citicorp does not disparage it. Citicorp concentrates its argument on factors indicating the decision was incorrect.  The main point relied upon is that the FTB took a litigation position against the <em>Finnigan </em>result in that appeal. In considering the impact of an agency\u2019s theory in litigating a case, the court in <em>Culligan Water Conditioning v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 86 [130 Cal.Rptr. 321, 550 P.2d 593], noted that little weight would be attached to an argument that was merely a litigating position in a particular matter. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 93, noted with approval in <em>Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">We give even less weight than usual to the FTB\u2019s litigation position in <em>Finnigan, </em>because the agency was merely fulfilling its duty to enforce the previous SBE rule of <em>Joyce. </em>Arguments in litigation, although they may be enlightening or helpful, do not control our review of the subsequent acts of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">Citicorp highlights the factors for weighing an agency decision listed in the <em>Yamaha </em>opinion. Those factors include: \u201c. . . \u2018the thoroughness evident in [the agency\u2019s] consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 14-15, italics omitted.) Citicorp adds two other factors noted by the court: indications of careful consideration by senior agency officials and evidence the agency has consistently maintained the interpretation in question. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 13.) Citicorp argues that because the agency has now abandoned <em>Finnigan </em>it was poorly reasoned, inconsistently applied and should be given no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">The fact that an agency changes its interpretation of a statute is not evidence that either interpretation was legally impermissible. <em>(Henning </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number><em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1262, 1269-1270 [252 Cal.Rptr. 278, 762 P.2d 442].) \u201c \u2018In the general case, of course, an administrative agency may change its interpretation of a statute, rejecting an old construction and adopting a new. [Citations.] Put simply, \u201c[a]n administrative agency is not disqualified from changing its mind . . . .\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Californians for Political Reform Foundation v. Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 472, 488 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 606].) As long as the change is constitutionally and legislatively permissible, an agency would be remiss in not adapting its interpretation of the rules to fit the practicalities and present economic conditions dictating a change.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The SBE and FTB followed <em>Finnigan I, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 401-653, page 25,241 decided in August of 1988, until the April 1999 decision in <em>In re Appeal of Huffy Corporation, supra, </em>[1995-1999 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 403-031, page 29,257. It represented the SBE\u2019s decision in litigation between the FTB and a taxpayer and was supported by convincing reasoning. Finnigan Corporation\u2019s California subsidiary made sales into states where Finnigan itself was taxable but the subsidiary was not. The SBE accepted Finnigan Corporation\u2019s argument that the FTB was interpreting the word \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d for purposes of the throw back rule, in a different way than it did all other provisions of UDITPA. The SBE acknowledged the definition of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in section 23037 referred to \u201cany person\u201d but relied on section 23030, which allowed it to vary that definition \u201cwhere the context otherwise requires.\u201d The SBE reviewed FTB regulations under UDITPA and noted that the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d was used in at least two senses, with the most prevalent meaning being the combined unitary group. The SBE concluded that this interpretation was consistent with the unitary theory of apportioning California sales among the members of the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">We find no legal error in the <em>Finnigan </em>approach. <em>(Barclays Bank Internal, Ltd. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 708 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 829 P.2d 279] [Constitution does not mandate use of any particular method of apportionment so long as method used is not arbitrary].) One decision from Maine referenced <em>Finnigan </em>and recognized that authority on this issue was divided. That court chose the opposite interpretation under that state\u2019s law. <em>(Great No. Nekoosa v. State Tax, supra, </em>675 A.2d at pp. 965-966.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The SBE decision in <em>Finnigan </em>was supported by reference to the relevant statutes and regulations, and a reasoned analysis of the issues. Furthermore, the SBE reconsidered and affirmed its decision in <em>Finnigan II </em>and <em>NutraSweet. </em>Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>in <em>In re Appeal of Huffy Corporation, supra, </em>[1995-1999 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 403-031, where the SBE eventually determined it should abandon the <em>Finnigan </em>rule, the SBE did not conclude that <em>Finnigan </em>was legally deficient. In <em>Finnigan II </em>the SBE noted scholarly criticism of <em>Joyce </em>and determined that changes in the interpretation of federal law since <em>Joyce </em>led to the decision in <em>Finnigan. </em>At that time, the SBE believed that the <em>Finnigan </em>rule, if accepted by other states, would be the fairer method and would promote uniformity among the jurisdictions. <em>(Finnigan II, supra, </em>[1986-1990 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 401-797, p. 25,755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">Justice Holmes often said that the life of the law is experience. By the time of the <em>Huffy </em>decision, the SBE had approximately nine years of experience since <em>Finnigan II </em>in which to evaluate the operation of that rule. The SBE noted that, contrary to its expectation, <em>Finnigan </em>had not been met with universal acceptance. The FTB recognized that <em>Finnigan </em>remained a minority rule, which was contrary to the goal of uniformity and in fact, allowed the possibility of exposure to double taxation. <em>(In re Appeal of Huffy Corporation, supra, </em>[1990-1995 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 403-031, p. 29,257.) The FTB correctly stated that there were \u201ctheoretically good reasons for the initial implementation of the <em>Finnigan/NutraSweet </em>rule,\u201d but that the actual implementation did not result in the expected uniformity. Thus, after reviewing the state of the law in the years intervening between its decisions, the SBE returned to the <em>Joyce </em>rule without finding legal flaws in the <em>Finnigan </em>rule.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Finnigan </em>simply did not withstand the test of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">We find the SBE\u2019s decisions to be thorough and reasoned. The SBE launched the <em>Finnigan </em>rule in the expectation that it would be widely accepted. It adhered to the rule for over nine years, subsequently reevaluated its position in light of relevant intervening legal developments and changed its mind. All decisions were arrived at in an adversary forum, which presumes the existence of vigorous advocacy and careful consideration by a quasi-judicial decision maker. There is no reason to reject the application of <em>Finnigan </em>merely because the SBE has recognized that the passage of time did not result in its expected acceptance by other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">\n<em>Application of Finnigan to Citicorp\u2019s Return</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">Citicorp argues that we must order the FTB either to apply <em>In re Appeal of Huffy Corporation, supra, </em>[1990-1995 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 403-031, page 29,257 retroactively or prevent it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>applying <em>Finnigan </em>retroactively to assure treatment under the rule of <em>Joyce </em>for Citicorp\u2019s taxes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Finnigan </em>and <em>NutraSweet </em>did not discuss the retroactivity of the decision, but it is undisputed that the FTB, pursuant to Notice No. 90-3, has applied <em>Finnigan </em>retroactively.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">According to exhibits produced in the trial court, Citicorp\u2019s amended returns, although pertaining to the years 1985 through 1988, were filed in 1992 and 1993, after both <em>Finnigan </em>opinions and the FTB Notice No. 90-3. \u201cAs the Board notes, a refund case throws open the taxpayer\u2019s entire tax liability for the period in question [citation], and the Board may raise issues unrelated to the basis or theory on which the taxpayer is seeking a refund in order to defeat the claim. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Title Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 715, 732 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 842 P.2d 121].) Thus, the SBE may raise items regarding the taxpayer\u2019s return \u201cfor the timeframe encompassed in the refund claim period which might be set off against [the taxpayer\u2019s] refund claim . . . .\u201d <em>(Sprint Communications Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1254, 1260 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 399].) The FTB simply applied the law in effect during the time period in which Citicorp filed the amended returns in accordance with policy and procedures applicable to all reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">In general, tax legislation is not retroactive. (\u00a7 23058.) However, section 19503, which states that the FTB \u201cshall prescribe all rules and regulations necessary for the enforcement of . . . [the Bank and Corporation Tax Law, section 23001 et seq.]\u201d also provides that the FTB \u201cmay prescribe the extent to which any ruling [or regulation] shall be applied without retroactive effect.\u201d Although Notice No. 90-3 is not a formal regulation, it represents an exercise of the FTB\u2019s authority to prescribe rules and determine the effect of such rules. At the time Citicorp filed its amended returns seeking a refund, the FTB\u2019s position on the application of <em>Finnigan </em>was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">Unlike legislation, the general rule as to judicial opinions is that they are fully retroactive. The United States Supreme Court stated that in general, civil decisions \u201cmust be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>or postdate the announcement of the rule.\u201d <em>(Harper v. Virginia Dept, of Taxation </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 86, 97 [113 S.Ct. 2510, 2517, 125 L.Ed.2d 74]; <em>Newman v. Emerson Radio Corp. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 973, 978-982 [258 Cal.Rptr. 592, 772 P.2d 1059] [noting the \u201cgeneral rule that judicial decisions are given retroactive effect\u201d].) Retroactive application of <em>Finnigan </em>was an exercise of the prevailing rule regarding changes in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">We reject Citicorp\u2019s request that we order retroactive application of <em>In re Appeal of Huffy Corporation, supra, </em>[1990-1995 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) paragraph 403-031, so that it may benefit from the change that occurred after the trial court\u2019s judgment in this case. We find no basis for overturning the SBE\u2019s well-reasoned decision on the issue of prospective application of <em>Huffy. </em>The SBE relied in its analysis on the factors in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 97 [92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296] in reaching the decision that <em>Huffy </em>should be applied only prospectively. Although <em>Harper </em>cast doubt on the three-part test set out in <em>Chevron Oil, Harper </em>involved federal law and noted that state courts had a degree of freedom to \u201climit the retroactive operation of their own interpretations of state law . . . .\u201d <em>(Harper </em>v. <em>Virginia Dept, of Taxation, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 100 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2519].) The <em>Chevron Oil </em>factors, as discussed in <em>Huffy, </em>support the decision in that case. In <em>Chevron Oil </em>the court identified three factors to be considered when dealing with the issue of nonretroactivity. \u201cFirst, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, [citation], or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed, [citation].\u201d The second factor considers whether in light of the \u201chistory . . . purpose and effect\u201d of the rule in question its operation will be furthered or retarded by retrospective application. The third factor weighs \u201cthe inequity imposed by retroactive application\u201d and whether it would produce \u201c \u2018. . . substantial inequitable results . . . \u201cinjustice or hardship\u201d . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, </em>404 U.S. at pp. 106-107 [92 S.Ct, at p. 355].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">The SBE decision in <em>Huffy </em>clearly established a new principle of law and overruled past precedent on which taxpayers relied. The history, purpose and effect of the rule indicate an agency attempt to lead a movement to nationwide uniformity that ultimately failed. However, the <em>Finnigan </em>rule was adhered to and relied upon for tax planning purposes for the years between <em>Finnigan </em>and <em>Huffy. </em>Although denying retroactive effect to <em>Huffy </em>results in a decreased refund for Citicorp, it is not clear that all taxpayers would benefit from retroactive application. The rule in <em>Finnigan </em>itself was advocated by the taxpayer. An undesirable result for one taxpayer is not a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>rejecting a reasoned decision of the SBE that examined the broad negative effects of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">The SBE merely followed the normal rule of full retroactive application when it decided <em>Finnigan. </em>The fact that it made an exception in <em>Huffy </em>does not require a special rule for Citicorp. We decline the invitation to adjust the agency\u2019s reasoned resolution of the application of its own rules.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">\n<em>Finnigan Does Not Violate Constitutional Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Citicorp argues that the <em>Finnigan </em>rule violates the commerce clause, the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. In discussing an attack on the California three-factor formula for apportionment of the income of a unitary business located in California, the United States Supreme Court noted that the California formula not only met the court\u2019s approval, but \u201chas become . . . something of a benchmark against which other apportionment formulas are judged.\u201d <em>(Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 170 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2943].) In its discussion of a commerce clause and due process challenge to the three-factor formula, the Supreme Court stated the standard that the formula must meet to avoid violation of those constitutional provisions. The first test is one of \u201cinternal consistency\u201d which means that \u201cthe formula must be such that, if applied by every jurisdiction, it would result in no more than all of the unitary business\u2019 income being taxed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 169 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2942].) Citicorp does not argue that the <em>Finnigan </em>rule violates the principle of internal consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">The only evidence supporting Citicorp\u2019s argument was the testimony of its tax counsel. Jeffrey Serether, vice-president and state and local tax counsel for Citicorp and its subsidiaries, testified that he reviewed, but had not prepared, the tax returns filed by the South Dakota affiliate for the four years at issue. He stated that Citibank (South Dakota) \u201creports a franchise tax for financial institutions\u201d to South Dakota, which it calculates based on a three-factor apportionment formula. (S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 10-43-22.1.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the four years in question, Citibank (South Dakota) apportioned 100 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>of its income to South Dakota. There was no further detail regarding South Dakota taxes or filings by Citicorp affiliates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">Citicorp\u2019s argument implicates the second factor in the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis, that of \u201cexternal consistency,\u201d which means that \u201cthe factor or factors used in the apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated.\u201d <em>(Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 169 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2942].) \u201c[T]he taxpayer\u2019s burden of proof on [the issue of showing a violation of the \u2018external consistency\u2019 test] is \u2018steep if not insurmountable.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1768, 1785 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 761].)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There was no evidence indicating that application of <em>Finnigan </em>distorted the percentage of income fairly allocable to California. Rather, the evidence reflected the reasonable apportionment of sales generated in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">Citicorp\u2019s constitutional challenges are also based on its contention that <em>Finnigan </em>results in exposure to multiple taxation of the income of the out-of-state affiliate. Exposure to duplicative taxation resulting from a lack of uniformity among the states does not present a constitutional issue. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the fact that companies doing business in more than one state may be exposed to different taxing rules. The court recognized the differences that exist between the various states in how taxes are calculated. \u201c[W]hile some States such as Iowa assign sales by destination, \u2018sales can be assigned to the state ... of origin, the state in which the sales office is located, the state where an employee of the business making the sale carries on his activities or where the order is first accepted, or the state in which an interstate shipment is made.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 267, 278, fn. 13 [98 S.Ct. 2340, 2347, 57 L.Ed.2d 197].) Prevention of such possibilities of duplicate taxation would require adoption of a national uniform code, a task the court found better suited to an exercise of legislative than judicial power. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 279-280 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 2347-2348].) Plainly, the Constitution does not mandate that every state treat every item of income alike and assign the apportionment of sales in a uniform manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>The Supreme Court has stated that the Constitution does not \u201c \u2018invalidate] an apportionment formula whenever it may result in taxation of some income that did not have its source in the taxing [s]tate . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 169-170 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2942], italics omitted.) An apportionment formula will only be struck down where the challenger proves \u201c \u2018by \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that the income attributed to the state is in fact \u201cout of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted ... in that State,\u201d [citation] or has \u201cled to a grossly distorted result,\u201d [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 170 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2942].) Citicorp has not sustained this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">Although constitutional limits on a state\u2019s ability to tax interstate businesses exist, they allow the states \u201cwide latitude\u201d to choose a method of apportionment. <em>(Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, supra, </em>437 U.S. at p. 274 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2345].) The main restrictions on a state\u2019s ability to tax are: (1) a minimal connection between the activities of the business and the taxing state; and (2) the \u201cincome attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to \u2018values connected with the taxing State.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 272-273 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2344].) Thus, when a state\u2019s method of apportionment represents \u201ca rough approximation of a corporation\u2019s income that is reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State,\u201d no constitutional violation exists. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 273 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2344].)

The FTB determined that the sales were business income, subject to apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>by means of the apportionment formula. <em>(Robert Half Internat., Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1023 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 453].)  The main thrust of Citicorp\u2019s claim that the gains are nonbusiness income is that these sales of corporate property were not made in the regular course of its business of banking. The parties disagree as to whether the transactional test or the functional test is used to determine the nature of nonbusiness income. We note that the issue is presently pending before our Supreme Court. <em>(Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 914 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 768], review granted Mar. 1, 2000, S085091.) The resolution of the issue of whether there are two tests is unnecessary in this case because the questioned gain on sales produced business income under either the transactional or functional test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">The nonbusiness income of a unitary business is not apportionable and is allocated according to situs. (\u00a7\u00a7 25123-25127.) Nonbusiness income is defined as \u201call income other than business income.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (d).) The definition of business income is: \u201cincome arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations.\u201d (\u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-7\">The \u201ctransactional\u201d test of business income is represented by the first part of the statutory definition, regarding income arising from transactions \u201cin the regular course\u201d of business. The \u201cfunctional\u201d test is derived from the second part of the definition, regarding property acquired, managed and disposed of as \u201cintegral parts\u201d of the regular business. <em>(Robert Half Internat., Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1024.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, the administrative regulations provide that \u201cincome of the taxpayer is business income unless clearly classifiable as nonbusiness income.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 25120, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">Citicorp argues that there is only a single transactional test of business income and that its sale of corporate realty did not occur in the regular course of its banking business. It also argues that even if there is a separate functional test, the acquisition, management and sale of the properties was not an integral part of its business.  Proper characterization of the nature of the income is primarily a factual issue. <em>(Robert Half Internat., Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1028.) We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>review the facts relating to the purchase, use and sale of each of the four properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">In 1961, Citibank, N.A., financed and constructed a 39-story office building at 399 Park Avenue in New York City for the purpose of housing corporate personnel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> During the years in issue, it was the corporate headquarters of Citicorp and Citibank. In 1987, Citibank sold floors 17 through 39 of the building as part of a planned restructuring of its real estate holdings. At the time of the sale, personnel of Citicorp affiliates occupied all of the floors, and continued to occupy the floors remaining after the sale. Corporate Realty Services, a department of Citibank that manages premises occupied by Citicorp and its affiliates, managed the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">In 1907, Citibank purchased a nine-story office building at 55 Wall Street in New York City for the purpose of housing corporate personnel. Citibank financed the acquisition of this building. Personnel of Citibank and affiliate companies occupied three of the nine floors at the time of the 1987 sale of the building. Corporate Realty Services managed the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">The third building was a 59-story office building in New York City known as Citicorp Center. Citibank financed and constructed the building in 1978 for the purpose of housing Citicorp and Citibank personnel. In 1987, it sold floors 23 through 59 as a part of the restructuring of its real estate holdings. Citibank and its affiliates occupied 28 floors, or approximately 47 percent of the building, at the time of sale and 24 percent of the floors sold. From 1978 until the early 1980\u2019s, Corporate Realty Services managed the building. In the early 1980\u2019s, Citibank hired an outside agent to manage the building. Portions of the buildings were leased to third parties, including accounting firms and attorneys who did business with the bank. Citicorp characterized all dealings with third parties as \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-8\">Citibank purchased the fourth property in 1954, consisting of a residential building and undeveloped land in Osaka, Japan. Citibank financed the purchase, and Corporate Realty Services was responsible for managing this property. Corporate personnel used this property when they were in Japan. In 1987, a Japanese branch of Citibank sold the building and land, known as ISU House and the Osaka land. Corporate Realty Services managed the building during the relevant years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>Additional facts contained in the exhibits produced in the trial court include the fact that Citibank financed the purchase of all of the properties. Corporate Realty Services, in addition to managing the buildings, also had responsibility for leasing office space in the buildings. As noted previously, prior to the sale, Citicorp included costs and income from the properties as business income, reporting the value of the four properties as business property and the income from rentals as business income. The following facts were stipulated to regarding tax treatment of cost of and income from the buildings. \u201cDuring the income years in issue and prior to the sale of each building, or part thereof, [appellant] included the original cost of the office buildings located at 399 Park Avenue, 55 Wall Street, Citicorp Center and the ISU House and Osaka land in the denominator of the property factors used to determine the portion of [appellant\u2019s] business income attributable to California sources. During the income years in issue and prior to the sales of each building, or part thereof, [appellant] also included any rental income and expenses associated with the management of each building in determining [appellant\u2019s] business income attributable to California sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">According to the terms of the transactional test, Citicorp urges that we must look to the nature of the transaction to determine whether it occurred in the regular course of a taxpayer\u2019s business. The stipulated facts state that the sales of the properties were parts of a restructuring of Citicorp\u2019s real estate holdings. There is no evidence as to how often, or for what purpose, Citicorp was restructuring its real estate holdings other than the fact that the restructuring resulted in sales of four corporate properties in one year. There is no evidence regarding the extent of its real estate holdings. This is not the same situation as the example of a manufacturer who makes a one-time sale of a warehouse. (See, e.g., Keesling &amp; Warren, <em>California\u2019s Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purpose Act </em>(1967) 15 UCLA L.Rev. 156, 164 (hereafter Keesling).) Citicorp presented no evidence of the frequency, nature or extent of the real estate management activities of Corporate Realty Services. Citicorp argues that the sole function of its real estate management department was to manage property occupied by Citicorp affiliates. However, it references no evidence in the record as to the operations or function of the real estate department, other than the few stipulated facts in the record. The evidence was only that Citibank has a department devoted to management and leasing of real property. The evidence also supports a finding that Citicorp considered the income from the real estate properties to be business income prior to the sale. We conclude from the record in this case that Citicorp, with its separate department that acquires, manages, leases and ultimately sells corporate real property, produces business income when it engages in these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>The Citicorp corporate properties, financed by Citibank, occupied to a substantial extent by its personnel and managed by the realty services department of its wholly owned subsidiary, are integral parts of its business under the functional test. As noted by the trial court, the buildings were constructed or acquired to serve as important locations for Citicorp\u2019s operations. Citibank or its real estate department acquired, constructed, financed, managed, leased and eventually sold all of the properties after using them for significant, operating purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">We note that the functional test is not concerned with the frequency or extraordinary nature of a sale. Under that test, the gain is business income if the asset disposed of was used by the taxpayer in its regular trade or business operations. The functional test predates adoption of UDITPA and tracks the California definition of unitary income. <em>(Appeal of Borden, Inc. </em>(Feb. 3, 1977) [1971-1978 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rptr. (CCH) \u00b6 205-616, p. 14,897-57; Keesling, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 164.) As illustrated by the commentators, \u201cthe sale by a shoe manufacturer of one of its factories is hardly a transaction \u2018in the regular course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business\u2019 (which is selling shoes, not selling factories), but perhaps the \u2018acquisition, management and disposition\u2019 of the factory was an integral part of the business of making and selling shoes.\u201d (Keesling, <em>supra, </em>15 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">There can be little argument that Citicorp managed its corporate headquarters, other office buildings and the property in Japan as an integral part of its business. Although Citicorp repeatedly refers to itself as a bank, the stipulated facts indicate that Citibank is a bank, while Citicorp is a \u201cworldwide financial services organization which serves the financial needs of individuals, businesses, governments and financial institutions throughout the United States and in many other countries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-7\">Citicorp lists several cases from other jurisdictions which it argues are well reasoned, were ignored by the trial court, and provide support for its conclusion that a banking company that sells its corporate office can never be assessed for business income on the gain.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As noted in the case of <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Offerman </em>(1998) 349 N.C. 290 [507 S.E.2d 284, 289], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>those cases held that only a transactional test exists under UDITPA, and those state legislatures \u201cpromptly amended their respective tax statutes to explicitly include the functional test within their definition of business income.\u201d Other states have disagreed with the cases relied upon by Citicorp. (See discussion in <em>Polaroid, supra, </em>507 S.E.2d at pp. 290-293; <em>Texaco-Cities Service Pipeline v. McGaw </em>(1998) 182 Ill.2d 262 [230 Ill.Dec. 991, 695 N.E.2d 481]; <em>Nat. Realty &amp; Inv. Co. v. Ill Dept, of Rev. </em>(1986) 144 Ill.App.3d 541 [98 Ill.Dec. 802, 494 N.E.2d 924, 932] [under the functional test, all gain from the disposition of a capital asset is business income if the asset disposed of was \u201cused by the taxpayer in its regular trade or business operations\u201d]; <em>Ross-Araco v. Com., Bd. of Fin. &amp; Rev. </em>(1996) 544 Pa. 74 [674 A.2d 691] [if asset produced business income while it was owned by the taxpayer, gain on sale is business income].) Regardless, the record in this case establishes that the income from the sale of the properties derived from corporate activities satisfies either test in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">\n<em>Consideration of Gains on Sale of Office Buildings Is Constitutional</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">In two short paragraphs, citing <em>Allied-Signal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 768, 787-789 [112 S.Ct. 2251, 2263-2264, 119 L.Ed.2d 533] and <em>ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 307 [102 S.Ct. 3103, 73 L.Ed.2d 787], Citicorp asserts that the inclusion of gains from the sale of the buildings in the apportionment formula is unconstitutional. It contends that because Citicorp personnel did not occupy all portions of the buildings, the proceeds of the sale could not have been operational but must have been for investment purposes. Citicorp did not produce any evidence on this point other than the percentage of occupancy by Citicorp personnel. The fact remains that its property management division rented out portions of the buildings and that Citicorp claimed the rental income as business income. It does not appear that Citicorp attempted to separate out the various portions of the buildings when it initially reported them as business income prior to the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\"><em>Allied-Signal </em>did not involve the sale of corporate real estate but concerned a gain realized on the sale of a corporate taxpayer\u2019s shares of stock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>originally purchased in the open market, in an unrelated New Jersey company. (504 U.S. at pp. 774-775 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2256-2257].) The court considered the question of whether, by including the gain on the sale of stock as having been earned in the unitary business, New Jersey violated constitutional limitations on taxing value earned outside its borders. The court concluded that the activity at issue had no connection with the State of New Jersey and was completely unrelated to the unitary business. The court held that such capital transactions must \u201cserve an operational rather than an investment function.\u201d <em>(Id. at </em>p. 787 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2263].) The court explained: \u201cIt remains the case that \u2018[i]n order to exclude certain income from the apportionment formula, the company must prove that \u201cthe income was earned in the course of activities unrelated to [those carried out in the taxing] State.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">Similarly, <em>ASARCO. Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>458 U.S. 307, concerned gains from the sale of stock and dividends from subsidiaries which had no unitary business relationship with the taxpayer. The court merely accepted the proposition (hat if assets are part of the unitary business, the income from those assets may be treated like any other business income. It refused to allow consideration for tax purposes of dividend income \u201c \u2018[w]here the business activities of the dividend payor have nothing to do with the activities of the recipient in the taxing State . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 327 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3115].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">The principles discussed in the cited cases impose no limits on the disposition of a corporate headquarters and other corporate properties by a wholly owned subsidiary of the unitary business. \u201c \u2018The general rule, applicable here, is that a taxpayer claiming immunity from a tax has the burden of establishing his exemption, [\u00b6] \u2018This burden is never met merely by showing a fair difference of opinion which as an original matter might be decided differently. ... Of course, in constitutional cases, we have power to examine the whole record to arrive at an independent judgment as to whether constitutional rights have been invaded, but that does not mean that we will re-examine, as a court of first instance, findings of fact supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 175-176 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 2945-2946], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">The corporate office buildings in this case were not held as separate assets unrelated to the unitary business. Citicorp has not shown that the occupation and use of its office buildings had no connection to the California aspects of its multistate business. Citicorp included the costs and the income from all of the properties as business income prior to the sale. Inclusion of the gain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>disposition of the properties is consistent with the stated constitutional limits on a state\u2019s taxing authority. The disposition of the real estate was stipulated to be a part of Citicorp\u2019s restructuring of its real estate holdings, a program that was not described further. Based upon the foregoing, the FTB\u2019s decision to categorize the capital gains as business income is reasonable, within constitutional limits and is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">Because the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and the implementation of the rules was a valid exercise of the interpretive powers of the SBE, the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">Strankman, P.

(Table of Jurisdictions 62 West\u2019s Ann. Rev. &amp; Tax Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25120 at p. 295.) The South Dakota statute provides that financial institutions \u201cengaged in business within and without the state shall be taxed only on such business as is properly apportioned to this state. All net income shall be apportioned to this state by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>multiplying the net income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor, plus the payroll factor plus the receipts factor, the denominator of which is three.\u201d (S.D.

(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 25137-4-1.) The referenced regulation states that \u201c[a]ll income of banks and financial corporations shall be \u2018business income\u2019 unless the income arises from an investment or activity which is not a banking function.\u201d However, the evidence supported a factual determination that these gains arose as a part of the normal business activity of Citicorp group\u2019s unitary business operations. Citicorp offered no evidence that maintaining space for personnel was not a part of its banking functions. Citicorp argues that the second referenced regulation would actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>require business income treatment. FTB regulation No. 25120(c)(2) contains several illustrative examples of what may differentiate business from nonbusiness income. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 25120, subd. (c)(2).) Citicorp argues that it should get special treatment for the floors of the buildings it did not occupy. The examples do not help Citicorp. One states that a manufacturing plant that is continuously used in the business and subsequently sold generates business income. One of them posits a taxpayer\u2019s manufacturing plant that is closed, put up for sale, and rented out while being held for sale. The rental income and the gain on the sale were business income. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 25120, subd. (c)(2), examples B-D.) The examples in the regulation do not require reversal of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1323-10\"> Appellant\u2019s request for judicial notice is granted.
