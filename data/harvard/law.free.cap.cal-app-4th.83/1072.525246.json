Zywiciel appeals from an order that awarded Susan A. Zywiciel permanent spousal support of $500 per month, increased child support and modified his visitation rights. He argues there was insufficient evidence to award spousal support, and the award was based on a figure generated by a computer program instead of the judge\u2019s weighing of the prescribed statutory factors. We find ourselves forced to agree with him, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Philip and Susan Zywiciel were divorced after a 19-year marriage. The judgment of dissolution incorporated the Zywiciel\u2019s marital termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>agreement, which did not include spousal support but instead provided that the court reserved jurisdiction on the issue. Susan received primary physical custody of their two minor daughters and Philip visitation rights, although the parents shared legal custody. Philip agreed to pay child support until each daughter reached the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Six years later, Susan moved for spousal support, additional child support for the one child still living at home, and clarification of visitation rights. Her moving papers consisted of a form application for an order and a supporting declaration. In both the spousal support and child support sections of the form, next to the words \u201camount requested,\u201d the word \u201cguideline\u201d is typed in rather than a dollar amount. Susan declared she needed spousal support because there was a \u201cgreat disparity\u201d between her income and Philip\u2019s, and her expenses had increased because their older daughter\u2014\u25a0 no longer the subject of child support payments\u2014had been staying with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Philip declared, without contradiction, that the older daughter moved into her own condominium in early June, after a three-month stay, so that Susan\u2019s increased living expenses were short-lived and over. He did not oppose the request for child support for the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The hearing was so informal that it was difficult to recognize as a hearing. Susan and Philip and their attorneys met with the judge, and the attorneys and judge talked. Susan and Philip were sworn as witnesses, but neither was called to testify. At one point, Susan was asked a few questions about her education, but Philip was never called upon to speak. Most of the \u201chearing\u201d consisted of counsel providing figures and other information from the financial statements their clients had filed, which the judge plugged into the DissoMaster computer program used for calculating temporary spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">The numbers revealed that Susan had an average gross income of $2,133 per month for the previous year, including child support, which fell to $1,950 for the immediately preceding month when she switched to a job as a food broker. The reason for the change was obscured by the informality of the hearing, since counsel disagreed on the point and Susan was never called to testify.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Philip, a lawyer, had grossed approximately $5,857 per month during the prior year, but his income increased to $6,332 monthly when he, too, accepted new employment as a deputy public defender. Due to a mix-up, Philip\u2019s income and expense statements and his declaration were not in the trial court\u2019s file. Counsel gave the judge \u201cDad\u2019s numbers\u201d without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>objection from Susan\u2019s lawyer, who had been served with the papers and had a copy before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The only other relevant \u201cevidence\u201d was that Susan had worked as a grocery clerk while Philip was in law school, although he also held down a job. During the marriage, she worked part-time as a kindergarten school aide to earn her own spending money. After the divorce, she earned an AA degree in liberal studies, and had 30 units toward a BA degree. The problem with this \u201cevidence\u201d is that it came not from the parties, but from the attorneys, and was not sworn. This became a point of contention when a dispute arose over discussion of who had carried the burden of support in the early years of the marriage. Philip\u2019s attorney\u2014apparently forgetting both parties had been sworn\u2014offered to have his client sworn if the court wanted to resolve the issue, explaining \u201cI am just trying to refute [opposing counsel\u2019s] argument, which I objected to previously.\u201d But the court recognized the tangential nature of the point and directed him back to more pressing issues\u2014a wise decision in terms of resolving the matter, but one which leaves us with precious little in the way of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The trial judge awarded Susan spousal support of $500 per month, but did not explain why or how she arrived at that figure, except to say it was \u201cbelow the DissoMaster.\u201d She ordered a copy of the DissoMaster printout attached to the minute order, which reveals the guideline <em>temporary </em>spousal support would have been $755 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Family Code section 4320<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that in ordering spousal support, the court must consider all of the circumstances enumerated in subdivisions (a) through (l). The marital standard of living is relevant as a reference point against which the various statutory guidelines are to be weighed <em>(In re Marriage of Kerr </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 87, 94 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 374]), but it is not in and of itself sufficient to sustain an award of permanent support. <em>(In re Marriage of Smith </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 469, 486, 490 [274 Cal.Rptr. 911].) Likewise, a disparity in income, standing alone, does not justify an award of spousal support. <em>(In re Marriage of Aninger </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 230, 241-242 [269 Cal.Rptr. 388].) Yet these were the only reasons Susan advanced, arguing that she \u201ccannot maintain a semblance of the lifestyle that [the parties] had when they were married,\u201d and there was \u201ca large discrepancy in income.\u201d This would ordinarily be insufficient, and we cannot tell if there was more here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Moreover, in determining permanent spousal support, a judge may not abdicate responsibility by turning to the DissoMaster <em>temporary </em>support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>guideline, even if used only as a reference point. After the hearing in this case, we decided <em>In re Marriage of Schulze </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 519, 523-524 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 488]. In <em>Schulze, </em>we held that permanent support reflects a complex variety of factors established by statute and committed to the trial judge\u2019s discretion, in contrast to temporary support which is aimed at maintaining the status quo pending trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 527.) \u201cIf the trial judge <em>begins </em>with the proposed temporary figure and then makes adjustments (or merely uses some of the section 4320 factors to <em>justify </em>a figure based on the temporary order), the ultimate order is not <em>really </em>the product of a truly independent exercise of judicial discretion. [\u00b6] . . . [S]ection 4320 clearly contemplates a ground-up examination of the need for and appropriate level of permanent spousal support, rather than <em>beginning </em>with a figure pegged to a proposed temporary support order.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 526-527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Thus, we would have to reverse even if there appeared to be a basis for awarding spousal support because it appears that the judge impermissibly relied on the DissoMaster. Her <em>only </em>comment upon making the award was a reference to that program, and she ordered it attached to the minute order. Since there was no evidence offered on many of the section 4320 factors, we do not see how the judge could have made the award except by doing what <em>Schulze </em>enjoins\u2014beginning with the proposed temporary support figure and adjusting it downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Such \u201cevidence\u201d as was offered only went to <em>some </em>of the statutory criteria (e.g., the parties\u2019 earning capacity, Susan\u2019s contribution to Philip\u2019s education, Philip\u2019s ability to pay, and the duration of the marriage). Most notably absent was any mention of Susan\u2019s assets, her ability to engage in more remunerative employment, the tax consequences of permanent support to each party, the balance of hardships, and the goal that Susan become self-supporting within a meaningful amount of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">At oral argument, Susan\u2019s counsel assured us that the record contained this evidence, but he was wrong\u2014it does not. He said Susan\u2019s income and expense declaration listed her assets, but that is not accurate. The form declaration Susan filed left blank the spaces provided to list \u201ccash and checking accounts,\u201d \u201csavings, credit union, certificates of deposit and money market accounts,\u201d \u201cstocks, bonds and other liquid assets,\u201d and \u201call other property, real or personal.\u201d Since it appears Susan received the former family residence in the divorce, and still resides there, this alone is a significant omission. There may have been others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Counsel made several other representations about information in the record that just is not there. He said there was testimony Susan took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>lower paying job because she needed flexible hours that would allow her to return to school, which she was not able to do previously because she was raising the children. There was no such testimony, and counsel\u2019s argument (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 1) is not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">It may be that these matters were discussed between counsel and the trial judge in chambers. But they did not make their way into the record. We recognize the salutary ends that informal hearings can accomplish in dissolution matters. We understand the idea that informality may serve to defuse these often incendiary cases. But at some point-\u2014-preferably before the parties reach the Court of Appeal\u2014a record must be made. If the court is considering something other than the DissoMaster program, the record has to reflect that. If there is evidence pertinent to the issues the court is resolving, it has to be received. A hearing at which rancor is avoided accomplishes little if the problems between the parties are not resolved in a way that ensures finality, including the possibility of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">It appears to us that the trial judge should have denied the request for spousal support if it was sought solely to restore Susan to the lifestyle she enjoyed during marriage and equalize the parties\u2019 income. If there were other considerations, and if Susan presented evidence on all of the section 4320 factors for permanent support, this record does not reflect it. All it shows is that the court plugged the numbers into the DissoMaster temporary support guideline and made some sort of dead-reckoning adjustment. Since we can find no indication the judge considered section 4320 and exercised her independent judgment in arriving at her award, we cannot uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The order appealed from is reversed to the extent of it awarded $500 per month in spousal support. Appellant is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Crosby, Acting P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">On October 10, 2000, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Susan\u2019s lawyer said she switched jobs so she could go back to school, while Philip\u2019s said she just wanted a different occupation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">All further statutory references are to the Family Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
