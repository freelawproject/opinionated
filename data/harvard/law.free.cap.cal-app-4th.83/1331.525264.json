We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">On March 27, 1999, Geoff C. Jacobson was arrested in Rancho Cucamonga for driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Vehicle Code section 23152. A sample of his blood was taken and he surrendered his driver\u2019s license to the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>At Jacobson\u2019s request, the DMV held an administrative hearing to determine whether his driver\u2019s license should be suspended. At the hearing, the DMV offered documentary evidence including a document entitled \u201cSan Bernardino Co. Sheriff\u2019s, Scientific Investigation Division 7-Apr-1999 Report on the Receipt and Examination for Ethyl Alcohol.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The document lists four names, including \u201cJacobson, GE.\u201d Across from Jacobson\u2019s name, the document reflected a blood-alcohol level of .16 percent. The analyst is identified as \u201cWhite.\u201d Printed in ink with a rubber stamp at the end of the four entries is the emblem of the San Bernardino County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Department together with the name and address of the department\u2019s scientific investigation division.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Over Jacobson\u2019s objections, that document (SID report) was admitted into evidence. Relying upon that evidence of the chemical tests of his blood, the hearing officer found that Jacobson had been driving with a blood-alcohol level of .08 percent or more, and that his license should be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Vehicle Code section 13559, Jacobson filed a petition for a writ of mandate. His petition seeks an order directing the DMV to revoke the suspension of his driver\u2019s license on the ground that the hearing officer erred by admitting the SID report. The trial court granted the petition and ordered the DMV to revoke the suspension of Jacobson\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The DMV \"appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">Issue on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">In administrative hearings, \u201c[h] ears ay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but over timely objection shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (d).) The SID report is the only evidence of Jacobson\u2019s blood-alcohol level. The DMV concedes that Jacobson objected to its admission as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">The trial court decided that the blood-alcohol finding was not supported by substantial evidence because the SID report would not have been admissible in a civil action over objection. In particular, it reasoned that the SID report would not have been admissible under the official records exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1280) because the document was not properly authenticated <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1401, subd. (a)). Authentication was lacking, the court said, because the document bore neither a signature nor a seal. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1452-1453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>Although the DMV contends that the trial court erred in several respects by concluding that the SID report was not admissible, one issue is dispositive: whether the report had been sufficiently authenticated to merit admission into evidence. The DMV\u2019s sole argument on this issue is that the SID report bore a seal, that pursuant to Evidence Code section 1452 the seal is presumed to be genuine and its use is presumed to be authorized, and that the report itself was therefore sufficiently authenticated to be admitted into evidence. It is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">\u201cAuthentication of a writing is required before it may be received in evidence.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1401, subd. (a).) \u201cAuthentication of a writing means (a) the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is or (b) the establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1400), such as by a statutory presumption (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1999) Authentication and Proof of Writings, \u00a7 30.11, p. 628; 2 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (4th ed. 2000) Documentary Evidence, \u00a7 7, p. 139).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">The statutory presumptions (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1451-1454) affect the burden of producing evidence <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1450). If the facts support the existence of a presumption, \u201c[t]he burden is on the adverse party to introduce evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that the . . . official writing is not genuine in order to dispel the presumption of authenticity or genuineness.\u201d (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook, <em>supra, </em>Authentication and Proof of Writings, \u00a7 30.36, p. 638, italics omitted.) If the adverse party fails to come forward with evidence that disputes authenticity, the writing must be found to be authentic. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 604; 1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook, <em>supra, </em>Authentication and Proof of Writings, \u00a7 30.36, p. 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">The DMV relies upon the statutory presumption created by Evidence Code section 1452, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA seal is presumed to be genuine and its use authorized if it purports to be the seal of: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (b) A public entity in the United States or a department, agency, or public employee of such public entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">The critical issue here is whether that presumption arose, i.e., whether the emblem on the SID report constitutes a seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">The Evidence Code does not define \u201cseal,\u201d but the Code of Civil Procedure does: \u201cA seal is a particular sign, made to attest, in the most formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>manner, the execution of an instrument.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1930.) In particular, \u201c[a] public seal in this State is a stamp or impression made by a public officer with an instrument provided by law, to attest the execution of an official or public document, upon the paper, or upon any substance attached to the paper, which is capable of receiving a visible impression.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1931.) The execution of an instrument is its subscription and delivery. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1933.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">If a seal attests to the execution of a document, and if execution means subscription, then it follows that there can be no seal of a document that has not been subscribed. The SID report is not signed by anyone. Therefore, the emblem stamped upon it does not meet the statutory definition of a seal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The existence of a seal being the only grounds upon which the DMV challenged the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the report had not been properly authenticated, that challenge fails. Authentication being an indispensable prerequisite to the admission of documentary evidence (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1401, subd. (a)), the DMV has failed to show that the trial court erred by granting the petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Hollenhorst, Acting P. J., and Richli, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-10\"> There is no indication in the record that the document admitted was a certified copy. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1531.) Therefore, we assume for purposes of our analysis that the document was an original.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1225-10\"> Thus, a seal may be printed in ink by a stamp, as was done here. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 8207 [notary seals]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 68074.1 [seals of superior or municipal courts].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1225-11\"> Accordingly, we need not consider whether there is any evidence that the emblem meets the other aspects of the definition of a public seal, e.g., whether it was impressed upon the SID report \u201cby a public officer with an instrument provided by law . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1931.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
