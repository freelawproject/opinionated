In this criminal investigation of real party in interest Deputy District Attorney (DDA) Peter J. Longanbach (Longanbach),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the People of the State of California, through the Office of the California Attorney General (AG), petition for a writ of mandate/prohibition after respondent Superior Court of San Diego County (the court) upheld Longanbach\u2019s privilege claims to certain documents seized pursuant to search warrants issued for specified areas of the DA\u2019s office and Longanbach\u2019s residence. After conducting in camera reviews under Penal Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 1524, subdivision (c) to ascertain the validity of the claimed privileges for the sealed material taken from each location, the court ordered the privileged documents returned to Longanbach and reappointed a special master to review the contents of computer backup tapes in the DA\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>We stayed enforcement of the court\u2019s orders in this proceeding, issued an order to show cause (OSC) and now grant the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Longanbach is being investigated for possible crimes, including misappropriation of government property (\u00a7 424) and perjury (\u00a7 118), arising out of his employment with the DA\u2019s office. It is essentially alleged that he used the resources of the DA\u2019s office to further his own personal business interests. As part of the investigation, on February 7, 2000, the California Department of Justice (Justice) obtained search warrants for specified areas of the DA\u2019s office, including the office Longanbach occupied as a DDA, Longanbach\u2019s home and cars, and for another \u00e1ttomey\u2019s office. At the same time, the court signed an \u201cOrder for Special Masters for Execution of Search Warrants\" pursuant to section 1524, subdivision (c), assigning three special masters, one for each search location.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On February 8, 2000, agents from Justice executed the search warrants at the DA\u2019s office and at Longanbach\u2019s residence, accompanied by the respective special master assigned for each place. Longanbach was at his office within the DA\u2019s office when the agents arrived to search. His attorney, Lynne Lasry, arrived shortly thereafter and remained at the DA\u2019s office for the duration of the search, while Longanbach went to his residence with another of his attorneys, Edward Patrick Swan.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">During the search of the office Longanbach occupied at the DA\u2019s office, claims of privilege were made to various items, identified as Nos. 3100 to 3103, which were then sealed by the special master.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With the assistance of DDA Patricia O\u2019Mara and/or DDA Paul Morley, the agents seized Longanbach\u2019s personnel file and other materials on another floor of the DA\u2019s office, including item Nos. 3001 to 3039,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which were then claimed as privileged by Lasry, taken into possession by the special master and also sealed. Meanwhile, item Nos. 1900 to 1904 and 1906 to 1926, seized at Longanbach\u2019s home, were claimed as privileged and sealed by the special master there.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>On February 14, 2000, the special masters turned over to the court all of the sealed documents and items seized pursuant to the search warrants served on the DA\u2019s office and Longanbach\u2019s home. DDA Morley advised the court the DA\u2019s office was not asserting any rights or privileges at that time regarding the materials seized, and Morley and DDA O\u2019Mara explained that there were problems with obtaining data from the computer software and hardware that were seized. The court continued the matter several days to allow Longanbach to provide specific written claims of privilege, allowing him to reserve any section 1538.5 matters until a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On February 17, 2000, Longanbach filed his written claims of privilege to the sealed items. In addition to asserting the attorney-client privilege as the \u201cclient\u201d for documents \u201cprepared for or received from attorneys James P. O\u2019Neill (Nos. 1900-1903 and 1910-1917), Lynne Lasry (Nos. 1904, 1906-1907, 1925-1926, 3101 and 3103) and Robert C. Rice (Nos. 1908-1909 and 1918-1923),\u201d Longanbach claimed work product protection for writings he authored relating to legal issues (Nos. 1904, 1910-1912, 1914, 1916-1917, 1922-1923, and 1925-1926). He also claimed a compelled statement privilege applied to documents provided to the DA\u2019s office during an internal confidential personnel investigation of him, including a response to a demand for information by Assistant District Attorney Greg Thompson, and asserted a blanket privilege claim to item Nos. 3001 to 3039 taken from the DA\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">At a hearing the same day, after some discussion as to whether Longanbach had any standing to claim privileges with regard to the DA\u2019s CD-ROM\u2019s, hard drive, and materials printed from them, the court again continued the matter, setting a briefing schedule on the issues of standing and claims of privilege as to the seized material. Before the next contested hearing, the court conducted ex parte in camera hearings on March 22 and April 17, 2000, with Longanbach and his attorneys,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and thereafter sealed the transcripts of those hearings held to review Longanbach\u2019s specific assertions of privilege and/or objections to the items seized, including printouts of two of the DA\u2019s CD-ROM\u2019s, identified as item Nos. 3105-C and 3104-C.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">At the April 21, 2000 hearing, problems with the computer and disc printouts were again noted, and the court requested that DDA Morley cooperate to provide an accurate and complete printout of additional computer materials. The court also commented that the computer material reviewed in camera had contained material sensitive to the internal workings of the DA\u2019s office and permitted Morley to claim a limited privacy privilege for the DA\u2019s office as to such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>On May 5, 2000, the court held a hearing at DDA Morley\u2019s request to set up procedures for review of the DA\u2019s backup tapes to determine what information was responsive to the February 2000 search warrants. Morley represented that the AG and DA had worked out a procedure to review the computer directories of the five people targeted in the investigation, but that Longanbach\u2019s attorney objected, claiming attorney-client and work product privileges to the computer materials. After heated discussion as to the propriety of a former public servant claiming such privileges, in an abundance of caution the court reappointed the special master who had been appointed in connection with the execution of the search warrant at the DA\u2019s office, to obtain copies of the backup tapes and present them to the court for in camera review under section 1524. The court also stated it would soon issue its ruling on the claims of privilege made so far and allow the parties 14 days in which to seek writ review before the privileged documents were returned to Longanbach or the DA and the nonprivileged materials turned over to the AG. The court\u2019s formal order reappointing the special master was filed May 8, 2000, and its order ruling on the objections and claims of privilege made thus far was filed May 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The AG filed the instant petition for mandate and prohibition on May 25, 2000. In addition to granting a stay of enforcement of the court\u2019s May 8 and 12, 2000 orders, we directed the court to provide us with the sealed reporters\u2019 transcripts from the ex parte in camera review hearings held on March 22 and April 17, 2000, and all documents seized pursuant to the search warrants executed on February 8, 2000, for which Longanbach claims privilege. After reviewing the matter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we issued an OSC, requesting the parties specifically to address, among other things, the following two questions: \u201c(1) Where the special master procedures under Penal code section 1524, subdivision (c) have been erroneously or inadvertently employed for issuance of a search warrant \u2018for any documentary evidence in the possession or under the control of any person, who is a lawyer[,]\u2019 who is \u2018suspected of engaging or having engaged in criminal activity related to the documentary evidence for which a warrant is requested[,]\u2019 may the lawyer continue to receive the benefits of such statutory protection when the lawyer in essence is the purported \u2018client\u2019 for purposes of any in camera hearing on the applicability of the attorney-client privilege regarding files seized from his home and office[?] (See <em>PSC Geothermal Services Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1697, 1702, fn. 4 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 213]); and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>[W]here evidence has been obtained pursuant to a properly executed search warrant served on the \u2018client\u2019 in a possible attorney-client relationship, do the statutory attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protections apply to prevent the seizing authorities from initially reviewing the materials constitutionally taken? (See <em>Andresen </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 463 [96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627]; see also <em>Zurcher </em>v. <em>Stanford Daily </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 547 [98 S.Ct. 1970, 56 L.Ed.2d 525].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Supplemental briefs responsive to the above questions have been received and oral argument has been waived. The AG\u2019s petition essentially requests this court to grant a writ of mandate and prohibition ordering the superior court \u201cto surrender all of the documents seized pursuant to the search warrants to the [AG] and void the May 8, 2000 Order appointing a special master to review the contents of the [DA\u2019s] computer back-up tapes and for any and all further orders in the interest of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The AG contends it is entitled to writ relief because the court abused its discretion by upholding Longanbach\u2019s claims of privileges; that it erred as a matter of law in ordering returned documents pertaining to a criminal prosecution to Longanbach, a former prosecutor who is under criminal investigation, based on his invocation of attorney client and/or work product privileges; in erroneously permitting Longanbach, an attorney suspected of criminal activity, to employ the special master provisions of section 1524, subdivision (c) for his own protection; and in permitting the invocation of privileges in this case to thwart the AG from reviewing materials lawfully seized pursuant to a constitutionally valid search warrant. Essentially, these assertions present two questions: (1) whether a public prosecuting attorney, who is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation, may use claims of attorney-client privilege, work product protection and privacy to withhold from the investigating authorities review of documents and material seized pursuant to a validly issued and executed search warrant; and (2) whether such suspect public prosecutor is entitled to evidentiary protection similar to that provided by the special master provisions of section 1524, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Before we can answer these questions, we must address several threshold matters, including the nature of the office of a public prosecuting attorney, the nature of privileges and to what extent a public prosecutor can be a holder of the attorney-client privilege, the work product protection, and a claim of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">As this court noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 97 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 729]: \u201cThe district attorney is constituted by statute to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>all prosecutions on behalf of the state (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26500) and does so nominally in the name of the \u2018People.\u2019 [Citations.] District attorneys are not employees or mere agents, but public officers with public duties \u2018delegated and entrusted to them, as agents, the performance of which [duties] is an exercise of a part of the governmental functions of the particular political unit for which they, as agents, are active.\u2019 [Citations.] As our Supreme Court stated in <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 107 [130 Cal.Rptr. 257, 550 P.2d 161], \u2018[t]he district attorney is not an \u201cattorney\u201d who represents a \u201cclient\u201d as such. He is a public officer, under the direct supervision of the Attorney General [(Cal. Const., art. V, \u00a7 13)], who \u201crepresents the sovereign power of the people of the state, by whose authority and in whose name all prosecutions must be conducted.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 122, quoting <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Hance </em>(1908) 153 Cal. 162, 167 [94 P. 620].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The attorney-client privilege and the work product protection doctrine are both statutory creations. (\u00a7 1054.6; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2018; Evid. Code, \u00a7 954.) Evidence Code section 954 provides that \u201ca client holds a privilege to prevent the disclosure of confidential communications between client and lawyer. [A] \u2018client\u2019 includes a person who \u2018consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity\u2019 [citation], while \u2018confidential communications\u2019 include \u2018information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(People v. Gionis </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1207 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 456, 892 P.2d 1199].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Although the attorney-client privilege is not constitutionally based, it is the oldest recognized confidential communications privilege. <em>(Sullivan v. Superior Court </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 64, 71 [105 Cal.Rptr. 241].) It is grounded on public policy considerations and \u201cis in furtherance of the proper and orderly functioning of our judicial system, which necessarily depends on the confidential relationship between the attorney and the client.\u201d <em>(People v. Gionis, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1207.) The purpose of such evidentiary privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between a client and counsel so as to promote full and open disclosure of facts and tactics surrounding the case for which the relationship exists. <em>(People v. Flores </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 559 [139 Cal.Rptr. 546].) In enacting such privilege, the Legislature recognized that \u201c \u2018the benefits derived therefrom justify the risk that unjust decisions may sometimes result from the suppression of relevant evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 591, 600 [208 Cal.Rptr. 886, 691 P.2d 642], quoting <em>City &amp; County of S. F. v. Superior Court </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 227, 235 [231 P.2d 26, 25 A.L.R.2d 1418].) However, the privilege is not absolute and a person claiming an attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>privilege must show that the evidence sought to be protected is within the statutory terms. <em>(People v. Gionis, supra, </em>at p. 1208; see also <em>Vela v. Superior Court (1989) 208 </em>Cal.App.3d 141, 147 [255 Cal.Rptr. 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Attorney work product protection is a separate and distinct doctrine from the attorney-client privilege, and, as noted above, is codified in criminal cases to preclude evidence of an attorney\u2019s writings that reflect his or her \u201cimpressions, conclusions, opinions or legal research or theories\u201d from being disclosed during discovery to the opponent in litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2018, subd. (c); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054.6; see <em>Hickman v. Taylor </em>(1947) 329 U.S. 495 [67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451].) Thus, statements that merely reflect what a person said during an interview are not work product. <em>(Hobbs v. Municipal Court </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 670 [284 Cal.Rptr. 655].) Although the attorney in such relationship is the holder of the work product protection, under certain circumstances a client may assert such doctrine on behalf of his or her attorney. (See <em>BP Alaska Exploration, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1240, 1257 [245 Cal.Rptr. 682].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">While it is generally recognized that a public entity, similar to a corporation, has the right to assert the attorney-client privilege <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>City of Palmdale </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 363, 370 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 330, 853 P.2d 496]; <em>D. I. Chadbourne, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 723, 733 [36 Cal.Rptr. 468, 388 P.2d 700]; <em>Vela v. Superior Court, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 150), the right of an individual public prosecutor to do so is limited due to the nature of his or her position. Like an individual officer or employee of a corporation, \u201c[w]here the employee\u2019s connection with the matter grows out of his employment to the extent that his report or statement is required in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ordinary course of the corporation\u2019s business, the [public prosecutor] is no longer an independent witness, and his [or her] statement or report is that of the [DA] employer.\u201d <em>(D. I. Chadbourne, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, <em>supra, </em>at p. 737; see also <em>Gonzales v. Municipal Court </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 111, 117-121 [136 Cal.Rptr. 475].)  Thus, depending upon the circumstances, any possible claims of attorney-client privilege, work product protection or privacy regarding documents or statements prepared by a prosecuting attorney, such as DDA Longanbach, made in the course of his employment with the DA, would belong to the DA and not the individual DDA. As the court in <em>Shepherd </em>noted, because the district attorney does not have \u201ca \u2018client\u2019 as such,\u201d confidentiality regarding the fruits of investigations of a public prosecutor are governed exclusively by Evidence Code section 1040, which controls the assertion of claims for governmental privilege for official information. <em>(Shepherd v. Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 122-123.) Under such provisions, the court is required to balance the necessity for preserving confidentiality against the interests in disclosure. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 123-128; see also <em>In re Muszalski </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 475, 483 [125 Cal.Rptr. 281].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Moreover, while an individual\u2019s constitutional right of privacy (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1 [the California right is broader than the federal constitutional right <em>(City of Santa Barbara </em>v. <em>Adamson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 123, 130, fn. 3 [164 Cal.Rptr. 539, 610 P.2d 436, 12 A.L.R.4th 219])]) is properly considered by a court before dissemination of information asserted confidential (see <em>Britt v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844 [143 Cal.Rptr. 695, 574 P.2d 766]), no invasion of such right will be found absent a legally protected privacy interest, a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances and conduct constituting a serious invasion of such privacy. (See <em>Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35-37 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633].) \u201cLegally recognized privacy interests are generally of two classes: (1) interests in precluding the dissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information (\u2018informational privacy\u2019); and (2) interests in making intimate personal decisions or conducting personal activities without observation, intrusion, or interference (\u2018autonomy privacy\u2019).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 35.) An invasion of autonomy privacy may be overcome by a showing of a countervailing \u201ccompelling interest,\u201d while general balancing tests are used when a privacy interest is in bona fide dispute. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 34.) As noted above, because of the nature of the public officer positions occupied by the DA and a DDA, it would be difficult to find that a DDA has an individual legally recognizable privacy interest which can be claimed in his or her conduct of prosecutions for the DA or in any use he or she may make of government personnel or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Applying the above preliminary observations, we can only conclude that Longanbach, as a DDA, who was precluded from practicing law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>other than as a public prosecutor unless he obtained the approval of the DA (County of San Diego Board of Supervisors Incompatible Activity Rule), is not the holder of the attorney-client privilege for any materials generated as a DDA. Nor is he able to claim work product protection or a privacy interest for such. Longanbach simply has no legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to his actions as a public servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry as to the propriety of the court\u2019s proceedings under section 1524, subdivision (c). As our extensive legislative background in <em>PSC Geothermal Services Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 1697 <em>(Geothermal) </em>shows, section 1524 was amended in 1978 and 1979 in response to several broad searches of attorneys\u2019 offices and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Zurcher </em>v. <em>Stanford Daily, supra, </em>436 U.S. 547, which allowed searches of newspaper offices containing privileged information. <em>(Geothermal, supra, </em>at pp. 1702-1707.) As so amended, section 1524 provides in pertinent part: \u201c[N]o search warrant shall issue for any documentary evidence in the possession or under the control of any person, who is a lawyer . . . , a physician . . . , a psychotherapist. . . , or a clergyman . . . , and who is not reasonably suspected of engaging or having engaged in criminal activity related to the documentary evidence for which a warrant is requested unless [certain procedures have] been complied with . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).) These procedures require that the court appoint a \u201cspecial master,\u201d who is defined by the statute, to accompany the person serving the warrant. <em>(Id., </em>subds. (c)(1), (d).) The special master is to \u201cinform the party served of the specific items being sought and that the party shall have the opportunity to provide the items requested.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c)(1).) If the party fails to do so, the special master is authorized to conduct the warranted search. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the served party \u201cstates that an item or items should not be disclosed, they shall be sealed by the special master and taken to court for a hearing.\u201d (\u00a7 1524, subd. (c)(2).) At such hearing, the party served with the search warrant \u201cshall be entitled to raise any issues that may be raised pursuant to Section 1538.5 as well as a claim that the item or items are privileged, as provided by law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As we noted in <em>Geothermal, </em>Evidence Code section 915 was amended in 1979 to provide that \u201c \u2018in any hearing conducted' pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1524 . . . [the special master provisions] in which a claim of privilege is made and the court determines that there is no other feasible means to rule on the validity of such claim other than to require disclosure, the court shall proceed in accordance with subdivision (b),\u2019 i.e., hold an in camera hearing. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Geothermal, </em>at p. 1707, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We also recognized in <em>Geothermal that the </em>execution of a search warrant is not beyond the court\u2019s control, that it is within the discretion of a court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>utilize procedures similar to those provided for under section 1524, subdivision (c) when such does not apply and there are claims of privilege made to the disclosure of documents or materials seized pursuant to the warrant. <em>(Geothermal, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1708-1712; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Bauman &amp; </em>Rose) (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1757, 1766-1771 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 734].) We based such holding on \u201cthe court\u2019s duty to safeguard disclosure of privileged materials, its power to govern discovery of privileged materials and its power to control its orders so as [to] make them conform to law and justice.\u201d <em>(Geothermal, </em>at p. 1712.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In arriving at such conclusion we specifically noted that: \u201c[T]he search [involved there, where a search warrant issued to seize documents from the offices of environmental consultants hired by a law firm to assist in defending various lawsuits,] was not a typical search for evidence and the fruits of criminal activity. Nor was it a search limited to the ongoing investigation of possible wrongdoing. Rather, it appears to be a search designed, at least in part, to penetrate the defense theories of the case by obtaining communications among possible defendants, their attorneys and consultants. Unlike other searches, this search pits a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment protections against the prosecution\u2019s pursuit of a criminal investigation. The District Attorney and his investigators knew the materials they were seeking included privileged documents and work product. They invoked the power of the court to seize the documents in question; the items were seized pursuant to a search warrant, [\u00b6] The purpose of the constitutional requirement of a search warrant is to interpose a magistrate between the police and the person who is the subject of the search. Review by a magistrate provides \u2018an informed and deliberate review of the circumstances by one who is removed from ... the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 [Citation.] If probable cause to search is established, then the magistrate should issue the warrant and allow the search to proceed.\u201d <em>(Geothermal, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">To meet such conflicting responsibilities under the Fourth Amendment to issue search warrants and under the Sixth Amendment \u201cto protect the right to counsel,\u201d we reasoned the court could conduct \u201can in camera review of materials seized under the search warrant to determine whether the materials are covered by the attorney-client or work product privileges and therefore should not be disclosed to the government.\u201d <em>(Geothermal, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The proceeding we are presented with here, however, is vastly different from the one in <em>Geothermal. </em>Unlike the search in <em>Geothermal, </em>the ones here were not directed at obtaining privileged materials, but were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>limited to an ongoing investigation of possible wrongdoings of a public prosecutor and were carefully confined to searching for evidence and fruits of such alleged criminal activity. As such, we do not have the same strong Sixth Amendment implication in this proceeding as in <em>Geothermal. </em>Rather we are faced with the competing interests between the rights of a state to issue a warrant to search and seize when there is probable cause to believe incriminating evidence will be found to justify the invasion of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment <em>(Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, supra, </em>436 U.S. at pp. 554-560 [98 S.Ct. at pp. 1975-1979]) and the long-standing public policies and statutory rights that protect the privacy and confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 917, 954; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2018; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054.6.) Clearly, the special master procedures were adopted to address such competing interests.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Geothermal, supra, </em>25 Cal:App.4th at p. 1707.)  In essence, \u201cthe enactment of subdivision (c) of section 1524 shows the Legislature\u2019s careful and deliberate balancing of the sanctity of those relationships against law enforcement\u2019s right to search the offices of lawyers, physicians, psychotherapists and clergymen when the grounds for issuance of a warrant exist.\u201d <em>(Gordon v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1555 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 53].)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Moreover, with regard to the Fourth Amendment, \u201c[t]he Framers addressed the subject of personal privacy directly in [that amendment, by striking] a balance so that when the State\u2019s reason to believe incriminating evidence will be found becomes sufficiently great, the invasion of privacy becomes justified and a warrant to search and seize will issue.\u201d <em>(Fisher v. United States </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 391, 400 [96 S.Ct. 1569, 1576, 48 L.Ed.2d 39].) Further, in <em>Andresen </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, All </em>U.S. 463, the United States Supreme Court found no Fifth Amendment violation in the seizure of business records at an attorney\u2019s office, including those written by the attorney defendant whose office was searched. The court there framed the issue as \u201cwhether the seizure of these business records, and their admission into evidence at his trial, compelled [the defendant attorney] to testify against himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 471 [96 S.Ct. at p. 2744].) The court in answering no to this question explained that \u201c[the defendant attorney] was not asked to say or to do anything. The records seized contained statements that petitioner had voluntarily committed to writing. The search for and seizure of these records were conducted by law enforcement personnel. Finally, when these records were introduced at trial, they were authenticated by a handwriting expert, not by [the defendant attorney]. Any compulsion of [defendant attorney] to speak, other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>inherent psychological pressure to respond at trial to unfavorable evidence, was not present, [\u00b6] This case thus falls within the principle stated by Mr. Justice Holmes: \u2018A party is privileged from producing the evidence but not from its production.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473 [96 S.Ct. at p. 2745].) From this it follows that \u201cif a [person,] without being compelled to do so, creates inculpatory writings and the government obtains them without compelling the [person] to authenticate or vouch for those writings, the Fifth Amendment is not violated.\u201d <em>(People v. Sanchez </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1024-1025 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 111].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Citing Andresen, the court in <em>Deukmejian v. Superior Court </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 253 [162 Cal.Rptr. 857] recognized the enactment of the special master section in section 1524, subdivision (c) \u201cadds credence to what appears to be settled law that search warrants directed against attorneys\u2019 files in their offices are not per se \u2018unreasonable\u2019 as violative of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Deukmejian, </em>at p. 260.) We can thus glean from <em>Andresen </em>that the execution of the valid search warrants underlying this proceeding, which are not challenged, did not violate Longanbach\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and did not compel him to do anything regarding the documents and material seized pursuant to such warrants to implicate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, nor did it compel him to disclose communications that might be privileged under Evidence Code section 954.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The searches here are also unlike the one in <em>Geothermal, </em>and other reported cases we have researched, because they targeted a suspected public attorney who did not have any identifiable innocent clients to protect. Instead, it is the suspected public attorney himself who is seeking privileged protection as the client with his numerous relationships with other attorneys and work product protection for his own notes scribbled while talking to them. Even though it is generally recognized that \u201c[t]he fact that the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>is suspected of criminal activity does not lessen the client\u2019s interest in the confidentiality of his or her files, or obviate the privilege with respect to those files\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Bauman &amp; Rose), supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1766), such presumes that the client is a nonsuspect since the purpose of the legislation enacted to protect searches of law offices is to \u201cprotect the privacy of privileged communications and of other records of persons not suspected of criminal activities.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1609 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 20, 1979, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Here, after finding probable cause to issue search warrants for the DA\u2019s office and Longanbach\u2019s home, the court appointed special masters to oversee each search. Longanbach made claims of privilege through his attorneys at each location to certain materials seized pursuant to the warrants that were then sealed and taken to the court. The court held two ex parte in camera hearings before ruling on Longanbach\u2019s privilege claims. Because Longanbach is suspected of criminal conduct, i.e., he is the target of the criminal investigation for which the search warrants had issued, the special master provision of section 1524 does not apply to him and should not have been used for the search of his home. <em>(Geothermal, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 1702, fn. 4; <em>People v. Superior Court (Bauman &amp; Rose), supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1764.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In addition, although a special master was properly appointed for search of the DA\u2019s office, the special master was required by the statutory provisions to request the specific items being sought from the DA or his designated agents. As noted above, in such search the holder of any claim of privilege for documents or materials from the DA\u2019s office is the DA or his designated agents, not Longanbach. Except for a claim of official information privilege for certain material on computer backup tapes, the DA has specifically waived any privileges to items taken from the DA search in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">This brings us to several additional questions. Having determined that Longanbach as a public prosecutor may not claim privileges or privacy interests with regard to his work with the DA, we must now determine whether Longanbach, as an individual, may properly claim the attorney-client privilege or assert work product protection in this proceeding. We must then decide whether anything need be done to correct the procedures utilized by the court and special master below in affording Longanbach with protection against the execution of the search warrants for which he did not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Regarding Longanbach\u2019s claims of attorney-client privilege as the client, such would appear to pertain mainly to his relationship with Attorney Lasry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>who has been representing him in the underlying criminal investigation, and also to Attorneys O\u2019Neill and Rice who have represented him in various business dealings during his employment as a DDA. Longanbach\u2019s claim of work product protection for his own writings appears to be based on his assertion he is acting as his own attorney jointly with the other named attorneys. \u201cThe determination of the existence of an attorney-client relationship ... is one of law.\u201d <em>(Kraus v. Davis </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 484, 491 [85 Cal.Rptr. 846].) Where the evidence is conflicting regarding such relationship, it is generally for the trial court to determine and evaluate the factual basis for the claimed relationship. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, there is no conflict in the evidence respecting the factual basis of Longanbach\u2019s claimed attorney-client relationship with Lasry. It is clear from the record that Lasry was and is representing Longanbach in the current criminal investigation. The relationships with O\u2019Neill and Rice, as the trial court found, were with Longanbach as a general partner-client and each attorney representing the partnership. Longanbach\u2019s assertion that he was acting as his own attorney at various times is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">It is clear that settled law, legislative history, public policy and the practical considerations mentioned above lead to the conclusion that there is no Sixth Amendment problem with the initial precharging dissemination of documents relating to the relationships between Longanbach and Rice and O\u2019Neill, respectively. On the other hand, California affords a criminal suspect or defendant more rights than afforded an accused under the Sixth Amendment, attaching the right to counsel. We note, for example, California extends the right to counsel to preindictment lineups, which is not required by the Sixth Amendment. <em>(Kirby v. Illinois </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 682 [92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411]; <em>People v. Bustamante </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 88, 94-102 [177 CaLRptr. 576, 634 P.2d 927].) In light of <em>Bustamante </em>and out of an abundance of caution, we acknowledge Longanbach\u2019s strong privacy interest as a client in his relationship with Attorney Lasry outweighs the state\u2019s interest in obtaining the confidential communications of that relationship concerning the underlying criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">As to the documents claimed privileged due to relationships with O\u2019Neill and Rice, Longanbach\u2019s interests are not paramount to those of the state, which has seized them pursuant to a valid search warrant in its criminal investigation of Longanbach. To allow review by the AG of such documents at this stage of the proceedings does not violate Longanbach\u2019s Fourth, Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. <em>(Andresen v. Maryland, supra, </em>427 U.S. at p. 477 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2746-2747]; <em>Fisher v. United States, supra, </em>425 U.S. at p. 409 [96 S.Ct. at p. 1580].) Moreover, akin to seizing matters that a person could not be compelled to disclose under the Fifth Amendment, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>satisfied that Longanbach, as the client in the attorney-client relationship, was not required to disclose, nor was his counsel required to disclose, privileged material. Hence, Evidence Code section 954 was not implicated by the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Longanbach will have the ordinary protections under the Evidence Code and the procedures under the statutes relating to search and seizure to challenge the disclosure of such evidence should the state decide to charge him with the crimes for which he is under investigation. We express no opinion as to such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Our determination to only permit Longanbach the one attorney-client protection in response to the execution of the search warrants at this stage of the proceedings finds some support in <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Dal Cielo </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 4 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 923 P.2d 1]. Although such case concerned the use of an Evidence Code section other than the attorney-client privilege, Evidence Code section 1157,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to prohibit discovery of certain documents relating to the proceedings or records of hospital medical staff or peer review bodies, we find its holding and reasoning instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In Arnett, the Medical Board of California had issued an administrative investigative subpoena to secure hospital peer review committee records but was thwarted by the claim of privilege under Evidence Code section 1157. The high court found the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d had a \u201cspecific legal meaning, to wit, the formal exchange of evidentiary information and materials between parties to a pending action.\u201d <em>(Arnett v. Dal Cielo, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 20, 24.) The court also held that an administrative investigative subpoena that issued before the case was pending was not a discovery tool. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 24.) It thus essentially concluded the records sought via such subpoena were subject to disclosure at the investigative stage subject to formal discovery and the exercise of privileges after an action was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">By parity of reasoning, we believe that a search warrant issued before a criminal complaint is filed, as in this case, is similar to the administrative subpoena issued in <em>Arnett </em>to investigate crimes or fraud before the actual case there was filed. As such, a search warrant, like an administrative subpoena, is not a discovery tool as contemplated under the Evidence Code. Therefore, attorney work product protection, which applies in criminal cases as part of the reciprocal discovery chapter, would only be available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>prevent disclosure after a case is pending and would not be available to claim here to preclude the AG from initially reviewing evidence that is constitutionally seized under a properly issued warrant. (See also <em>Kizer v. Sulnick </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 431, 440-442 [248 Cal.Rptr. 712].) Although we decided differently in <em>Geothermal, </em>using the term \u201cdiscovery\u2019- in a common sense to mean the uncovering of evidence by any avenue, including seizing evidence under a search warrant, we did not have the benefit of the determination in <em>Arnett </em>that such term has a specific legal meaning. Further, as we have noted, the search in that case was of a wholly different nature from that which occurred in the case before us. This case does not raise any implication of an attempt to intrude upon the right to counsel in the defense of a criminal matter. (See <em>Geothermal, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1712.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">At the risk of repetition, but for the sake of clarity, we summarize our findings before finally resolving the matter before us. As we have found, Longanbach as a public prosecutor has no legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to his actions as a public servant and has no standing to claim any privileges or work product protection in any materials he generated as a DDA. Although Longanbach is entitled under California\u2019s greater right to counsel protections, as an individual, to claim the attorney-client privilege with regard to his relationship as client with Attorney Lasry stemming out of the very criminal investigation from which the search warrants issued, he is not entitled to thwart the dissemination of documents seized during the searches by claiming such privilege with regard to Attorneys O\u2019Neill and Rice. Nor is he entitled to claim work product protection based on self-representation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Because Longanbach is the target of an ongoing criminal investigation, suspected of wrongdoing while employed as a public prosecutor, we have also found he was not and is not entitled to the protections of the special master proceedings under section 1524, subdivision (c). Although the AG initially acquiesced in such procedures, we find Longanbach is not entitled to receive further benefits under the special master proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In conclusion, because the DA is the privilege holder with regard to the documents and materials seized from the DA\u2019s office, with the exception of those items the court identified in the ex parte in camera hearings as being protected by the attorney-client relationship between Lasry as the attorney and Longanbach as the client, Longanbach has no standing to claim any privilege with regard to other materials taken from that public office. Therefore, the court\u2019s order of May 8, 2000, reappointing a special master for Longanbach\u2019s protection to review the information from the computer backup tapes at the DA\u2019s office, is invalid and must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>As to the court\u2019s order of May 12, 2000 (clarified on May 26, 2000), we do not review each ruling of privilege. Rather, consistent with our above discussion, we uphold the court\u2019s rulings only with regard to item Nos. 1906 and 1907 seized from Longanbach\u2019s home, and item Nos. 3100, 3103,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 3033, and 3037 seized from the DA\u2019s office, which are supported by the record as being protected by the attorney-client privilege based on the relationship between Longanbach and Lasry in this criminal investigation. We also uphold the court\u2019s rulings on those items for which it overruled claims of privilege. In all other respects, the order is vacated. The sealed material is ordered to be released to the AG at the time this decision becomes final.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Let a writ issue directing the superior court to vacate its orders of May 8 and May 12 (clarified on May 26), 2000, and to enter new orders consistent with this opinion. This decision will become final as to this court 10 days after it is filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 24(d).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At that time, the stay issued by this court on May 26, 2000, will be vacated. In the interest of justice, no costs are awarded. (Cal.
