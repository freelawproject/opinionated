J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aae\">In this matter we are called upon to determine the propriety of the decision by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) to exercise jurisdiction over a disagreement concerning contribution rights and obligations among five members of a public joint powers agency where the injured worker was employed by the agency. We hold that the Board has no such jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Facts of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">Victor Valley Transit Authority (VVTA) is a joint powers agency created pursuant to Government Code section 6500 et seq. The members of VVTA are the County of San Bernardino and the Cities of Victorville, Adelanto, Hesperia, and Apple Valley. The purpose of VVTA, which was formed in 1989, was to serve as a central organizing instrument for public transit services in the High Desert area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">The joint powers agreement signed by the parties expressly confers upon VVTA the power to make contracts in its own name, a power which is also recognized by statute. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6508.) The parties to the joint powers agreement expressly declined individual liability for the VVTA\u2019s acts, including the payment of wages or workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>VVTA eventually entered into an employment contract with James Sophy (Sophy) under which Sophy was to serve as VVTA\u2019s transit manager. Sophy eventually filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Board found that he had suffered disability arising from his employment, and was entitled to certain benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The original opinion on decision of the workers\u2019 compensation judge found the employment status of Sophy vis-\u00e1-vis VVTA\u2019s member agencies (or at least some of them) to be murky, but ruled that he was at least an employee of VVTA. As Sophy had been carried on the payroll of the City of Adelanto, it was also ruled that Adelanto\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF), would be \u201cdesignated to provide benefits in the interim without prejudice to their right to seek contribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">After lengthy further proceedings, Adelanto and SCIF filed a \u201cPetition for ' Contribution and Change of Benefits Administrator\u201d in which they asserted that the evidence had shown that employees of the City of Victorville had provided all the stress which led to Sophy\u2019s disability, and that Victorville should accordingly take over primary responsibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">This petition led eventually to the rulings challenged here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The most significant ruling was that the Board, through the workers\u2019 compensation judge, had jurisdiction to construe the joint powers agreement and determine the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations pursuant to that agreement. In the purported exercise of this jurisdiction, the workers\u2019 compensation judge ruled that SCIF had a right of contribution from the member agencies, and jurisdiction to resolve the details of the dispute was reserved pending efforts by the parties to do so informally. These rulings were upheld by the Board and the instant petitions followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Article XIV, section 4 of the California Constitution vests the Legislature with \u201cplenary power\u201d to \u201ccreate, and enforce a complete system of workers\u2019 compensation, by appropriate legislation, and ... to create and enforce a liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability.\u201d The Legislature is also authorized to create an administrative body (i.e., the Board) \u201cto determine any dispute or matter arising under such legislation. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Pursuant to this grant of power, the Legislature enacted Labor Code section 5301, formally describing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and vesting it \u201cwith full power, authority and jurisdiction to try and determine finally all the matters specified in Section 5300.\u201d Labor Code section 5300, in turn, provides that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction (i.e., to the exclusion of the courts, except for purposes of review) over proceedings \u201c[f|or the recovery of compensation, <em>or concerning any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto. </em>[\u00b6] . . . For the <em>enforcement against the employer or an insurer </em>of any liability for compensation imposed upon him by this division <em>in favor of the injured employee. </em>. . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] For the determination of any other matter, jurisdiction over which is vested by Division 4 in the Division of Industrial Accidents.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">As a creature of the Legislature, the Board has no powers beyond those conferred on it. <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 264, 266 [125 P.2d 42]; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1949) 89 Cal.App.2d 821, 824 [202 P.2d 86].) The issue before us is whether the Legislature has conferred on the Board the jurisdiction to decide an issue of contract interpretation between parties to what is, roughly speaking, the governmental version of a joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">At first blush, <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> appears to answer the question firmly in the negative. In that case, the injured worker was characterized as the \u201cgeneral employee\u201d of one employer, and the \u201cspecial employee\u201d of another. An award was rendered in favor of the employee against the insurance carriers for both employers. Later, one insurer applied to the Commission for a \u201csupplemental adjustment of obligations between carriers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The Supreme Court held that the Commission properly found that it had no jurisdiction over the dispute. Distinguishing earlier cases which involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>the basic rendition of an award in favor of the employee (or his dependents) and the <em>enforcement of compensation benefits, </em>the court pointed out that the case before it involved only a dispute between carriers. \u201c[T]he right of action in the employee to enforce his claim was finally determined by the joint and several award in his favor. ... By such award the employee was assured of the scheduled payments. . . . Any controversy between the insurance carriers relative to the burden of payment of the award for which both have been held responsible concerns neither the employee nor the joint employers in their essential relationship.\u201d <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d at pp. 267-268; see also <em>United States F. &amp; G. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1931) 214 Cal. 468 [6 P.2d 243], in which the superior court was held to have jurisdiction over a dispute between an employer and an insurer when the employer claimed damages for breach of a contract to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Here, as in <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264, the dispute has nothing to do with Sophy\u2019s receipt of benefits; the Board\u2019s previous award, now final, ensures that <em>someone </em>will pay. Sophy is not concerned with <em>whom, </em>and neither, it is argued, is the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">However, in <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 79 [172 P.2d 884] <em>(Colonial), </em>the Supreme Court gave its apparent approval to a procedure notably similar to that which it had rejected four years earlier in <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264. <em>Colonial, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 79 dealt not with joint employers/carriers and a specific injury, as did the earlier case, but with <em>successive </em>insurance carriers in a <em>cumulative </em>injury situation. The net holding of <em>Colonial </em>was that although the employee could choose to join only one of his employers and a single carrier, and then receive an award against only that employer and carrier, the Commission (now the Board) had the jurisdiction to apportion the final responsibility among the several carriers in a later proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Colonial, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d at p. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Colonial, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d 79, did not overrule or otherwise expressly limit <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264. The later case does not even cite the former. Thus, the earlier case still appears to be good law on the point of the Board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to determine apportionment disputes between joint employers in a <em>specific </em>injury case.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Although <em>Colonial, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d 79, appears to be inconsistent with <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264, insofar as the later case allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>the Board to decide a dispute which has <em>no </em>effect on the employee, the Legislature\u2019s subsequent actions have approved the result. However, the Legislature has not <em>expanded </em>on the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In 1951 the Legislature added section 5500.5 to the Labor Code to codify <em>Colonial, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 79. (See <em>City of Torrance v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 371, 374 [185 Cal.Rptr. 645, 650 P.2d 1162].) In Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (a), the statute establishes a time limit on liability for multiple employers in cumulative injury or occupational disease cases; for claims filed after January 1, 1981, only those employers for whom the employee worked during the one year preceding the date of injury are liable for benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consistent with <em>Colonial, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 79, Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c) permits the employee to select <em>one </em>employer from whom to seek benefits. Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (e) provides that \u201cany employer held liable under the award may institute proceedings before the appeals board for the purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or right of contribution. The proceeding shall not diminish, restrict, or alter in any way the recovery previously allowed the employee, or his or her dependents, but shall be limited to a determination of the respective contribution rights, interest or liabilities of all the employers joined in the proceeding, either initially or supplementally.\u201d Thus, multiple employers of an employee who has suffered an occupational disease or cumulative injury <em>can </em>litigate apportionment and contribution before the Board. Multiple employers of an employee who suffers a <em>specific </em>injury cannot. <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264.) Presumably this is true even if the worker is performing services for more than one employer at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">It is not entirely clear why the Legislature limited the effect of Labor Code section 5500.5\u2019s grant of jurisdiction to cumulative or occupational disease cases. It may be that the Legislature focused on such cases because they are relatively more numerous than cases in which more than one employment leads to a single, specific injury. However, it is also true that there is commonly a fundamental distinction between cases involving successive employers\u2014as in the typical occupational or cumulative disease situation\u2014 and those involving joint employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">When the Board is called upon to decide an issue under Labor Code section 5500.5 involving successive employers, the focus is simply on whether the employee was exposed to injurious conditions in his various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>employments. If so, the apportionment becomes largely arithmetical. (See 2 Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed. 2000) Supplemental Proceedings, \u00a7 23.57, pp. 1443-1444.) However, if there are overlapping employments, such as the general and special employment involved in <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 264, the rights and obligations of the employers <em>inter se </em>will commonly be governed by contract. In these cases, the issues to be resolved may fall well outside the Board\u2019s specialized area of expertise, and jurisdiction would be appropriately withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">This case represents a perfect example of the problem. The Board has made an initial finding of liability among the members of WTA and will, if they cannot agree, make an apportionment or other order for contribution, adjusting the member agencies\u2019 rights among themselves. Yet the members have established their rights and obligations through a formal agreement adopted pursuant to the Government Code. With all due respect, it cannot be supposed that the Legislature intended that the Board\u2019s specialized jurisdiction should extend to the interpretation of such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">It is true that the grant of power contained in Labor Code section 5500.5 is not expressly limited to cases of <em>successive </em>employment, although this circumstance is commonly assumed to be contemplated by the statute. (See, e.g., <em>City of Torrance v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 375; 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed., Tancor ed. 2000) Supplementary Proceedings, \u00a7 31.13[2][a], pp. 31-37.)  However, in our view the Legislature cannot have intended that the Board should have jurisdiction over a purported \u201ccontribution\u201d in the situation before us.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   Furthermore, despite the expansions authorized by Labor Code section 5500.5, our reluctance to recognize the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is entirely consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>constitutional limitation on its powers. We stress again that the Legislature was empowered to create a system \u201cto create and enforce a liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.) That liability (towards Sophy) has been determined and an enforceable order of primary responsibility is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The Board\u2019s error may also be addressed in another way. Whether the scope of Labor Code section 5500.5 extends to joint employers or not, it is apparent that the Labor Code only considers contribution in the context of <em>multiple </em>employers. Here, there is in fact only <em>one </em>employer and the concept of contribution as such does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In his first set of findings, the workers\u2019 compensation referee found that Sophy was an employee of \u201cthe joint venture,\u201d or VVTA, although he also inconsistently referred to <em>plural </em>\u201cemployers.\u201d His second set of findings also refers to employment by \u201cthe joint venture.\u201d This is clearly a correct finding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   A joint venture is a distinct entity virtually identical to a partnership, and capable of contracting\u2014that is, acquiring obligations\u2014in its own name. (See Corp. Code, \u00a7 16201 [\u201cA partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.\u201d]; 9 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1989) Partnership, \u00a7 17, pp. 415-417.) Although joint venturers and partners are jointly and severally liable <em>to third parties </em>for the obligations of the joint venture or partnership (Corp. Code, \u00a7 16306), the partners are free to allocate responsibility among themselves as they see fit. (Advising California Partnerships (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2000) Planning a General Partnership, \u00a7 4.23, p. 123, citing Corp. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16103, subd. (b) &amp; 16401.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">VVTA, which is in the nature of a public joint venture, has the same distinctness in law and the same power to contract in its own name, for example to employ workers. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6507-6508.) It did so contract with Sophy. The issue in the case at this point is not whether Sophy can enforce the liability against the member agencies. The question is how the agencies agreed among themselves to bear any liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits due employees of VVTA or to secure the payment through insurance, and whether any such agreement has been breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">We hold that Labor Code section 5500.5 does not confer jurisdiction on the Board to resolve the dispute among VVTA\u2019s member agencies, and the Board has no inherent power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">This conclusion moots the objection by the County of San Bernardino that it has been deprived of the opportunity to litigate the issues of liability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>employment, and that VVTA did not represent its interests. We note that, as a rule, in contribution proceedings the parties who were not the subject of the primary proceedings are free to conduct discovery and litigate the issues of liability. (See <em>Rex Club v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1465, 1472 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 393].) However, this issue, like those of collateral estoppel and res judicata, must await the attention of the appropriate court of law if the parties cannot resolve their dispute among themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Finally, VVTA complains that the Board erred in refusing to refer the remaining issues to binding arbitration pursuant to Labor Code section 5275. That section states that specified disputes \u201cshall be submitted for arbitration,\u201d and among the disputes are \u201cInsurance coverage\u201d and \u201cRight of contribution in accordance with Section 5500.5.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5275, subd. (a)(1), (2).) As we have explained, any issues of \u201ccontribution\u201d are not within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under Labor Code section 5500.5, and this disposes of the arbitration question. As for \u201ccoverage,\u201d this issue is not appropriate for arbitration under the Board\u2019s practices for the same reason that contribution is not. As we understand the matter, there is no question that the policy issued by SCIF to the City of Adelanto may properly be resorted to as a source of payment to Sophy. Whether any <em>other </em>policies also arguably apply is subsumed within the question of the rights and obligations of the member agencies as against each other, and this is not a question which the Board may decide. Accordingly, the refusal to order arbitration, at least, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The order under review is annulled. The matter is remanded for such further proceedings as may be necessary in the case, but with directions to decline jurisdiction over contribution or indemnity issues. Petitioners to recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Richli, L, and Gaut, L, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">On October 11, 2000, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(E023309) (nonpub. opn.). This court denied the petition on September 26, 1998, and the decision is therefore final. Sophy\u2019s medical expenses in particular were, or are, extremely high; inter alia, he required a liver transplant as the result of a work-related exacerbation of an underlying illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">At this time, the only defendant parties clearly still in the case were VVTA and the Cities of Victorville and Adelanto; Hesperia and Apple Valley had earlier been dismissed, while the status of the County of San Bernardino was unclear.
