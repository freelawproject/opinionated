Oliver and John Enders Robinson, residing in the City of Richmond, State of Virginia, had been conducting the tobacco business in said City of Richmond and also in the City of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">On said 26th of August, said Oliver &amp; Robinson signed an instrument and acknowledged the same before a commissioner of deeds for the State of New York residing in said City of Richmond, whereby they purported to bargain, sell, transfer, assign and convey unto one Oscar S. Grady, the party of the second part named in said instrument, all their personal property and stock in trade and debts due for goods sold by them in \u2022 their business in the City of New York, in trust to reduce the same to cash and pay certain of the creditors of said Oliver &amp; Robinson. Said instrument was.sent by said Oliver &amp; Robinson to the City of New York after being signed and acknowledged by them, and was on the 1st day of October, 1880, delivered to said Grady, who thereupon executed an instrument accepting the said trust, and acknowledged the same before a notary public in said City and County of New York. The said Grady thereupon took possession of the property mentioned in said deed of assignment and proceeded to sell the property. The assignee did not file any bond or schedules as required by the assignment law of the State of New York. On the 14th day of October, in an action commenced in the Supreme Court by the Merchants and Planters\u2019 Savings Bank of Richmond against the said Oliver &amp; Robinson and one Mathews, mentioned in said assignment, an attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ment was duly issued against the property of the defendants in that action, under which attachment the sheriff of the City and County of New York, took possession of some of the stock in trade which Oliver &amp; Robinson had attempted to transfer to the siiid Grady. On the 23d of October, 1880, the said Grady, as assignee for the benefit of the creditors of Oliver &amp; Robinson, commenced this action against the said sheriff for the conversion- of the said property. Subsequently other attachments were issued against said defendants Oliver &amp; Robinson and Mathews.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The sheriff in his answer justified the seizure under the attachment upon the ground that the foregoing assignment was fraudulent and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">Upon the trial of this cause, these facts appearing, the complaint was dismissed and an order entered to that effect, upon which judgment for defendant was entered.

The fact that plaintiff accepted the instrument in writing at the City of New York does not alter it from a Virginia to a New York instrument. It was not necessary to the validity of the instrument that he accept it at all. It is a principle of equity that a trust shall never fail for the want of a trustee (Story on Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 1059).</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">(A) Personal property has no <em>situs, </em>but follows its owner, and a voluntary transfer of it, valid by the laws of the owner\u2019s domicile, is valid everywhere, except where the property is situated in another state or country from that of the owner\u2019s domicile, and the transfer is in conflict with the interests of the state where it is situated, or its citizens (Story on Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 379-384 ; 2 Kent\u2019s Comm. 429 <em>; Guillander </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>35 N.

The view that an assignment made by a resident of another state has no effect, and cannot transfer property situate in this state is not sustained by the eases of <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Crapo </em>(45 N. Y. 86), and <em>Hibernia Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Lacombe </em>(84 N.

Under the laws of Virginia plaintiff is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the property for value and without notice <em>(Wickham </em>v. Martin, 13 Gratt. 427 ; <em>Exchange Bank of Va. </em>v. Knox, 19 Gratt. 739 ; <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>18 Gratt. 394, and cases cited; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Greenhow, </em>15 Gratt. 153). And the deed, being valid under the law of Virginia, operated as a conveyance to the plaintiff of the property in this state, unless it was in conflict with the interests of this state or its citizens <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>20 N. Y. 112 ; <em>Peterson v. Chemical Bank, </em>32 N. Y. 44 ; <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>43 N.

Y. 29). No law of this state has been violated by the transfer. To render an assignment invalid by being contrary to the laws of a state, it is construed to mean contrary to the statute law <em>(Ockerman </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>54 N. Y. 29 ; <em>Zipsey </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Gray [Mass.] 243 ; <em>Bay </em>v. Rockford, 7 Gray [Mass.] 406 ; 26 Mo. 423 ; <em>Guillander v. Howell, 35 </em>N.

And the interest of none of its citizens has been prejudiced. The attaching creditors, who are residents of Virginia, and not the sheriff, are the real parties in interest, they having indemnified the sheriff before he took the property (Crocker on Sheriffs, \u00a7 412 ; <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>7 Cowen 739 ; <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>22 Wend. 566 ; <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>Id. 569 ; <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Schuyler, 2 </em>Hill 204 V; <em>Root </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>30 N.

Plaintiff was in possession of the property, before the attachments issued, and there was, therefore, no property in the present case subject to levy under the attachment <em>(Greentree </em>v. <em>Rosenstock, </em>61 N.

Y. 136 ; <em>Thurber </em>v. <em>Blanck, </em>50 N. Y. 84, 85 ; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Bank of the Republic, </em>35 N.

The insolvent laws of other states will not be enforced here, nor will contracts, although lawful where made, receive the assistance of our courts if they are against what our law defines as good morals or common honesty.

A general assignment is not necessarily to be governed by the domicile of the assignors (Assignment Act of 1877, \u00a7 2). The case of <em>Ockerman </em>v. <em>Cross </em>(54 N.

S. 135, \u00a7 2 ; <em>Doremus </em>v. <em>Lewis, 8 </em>Barb. 124 ; <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>2 N. Y. 365 ; <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>10 Paige 223 ; <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Wakeman, </em>11 Wend. 187 <em>; Leitch </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>4 N. Y. 211).</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">(C) The assignment makes no disposition of the proceeds of the collection of the debts. It simply disposes of the proceeds of the sales. A trustee is bound by any restrictions contained in the writing which creates the trust, and if these are inconsistent with the rights of creditors, the trust itself must fall to the ground <em>(Ogden </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>21 N. Y. 23 ; <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>Hulse, </em>Id. 168).</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">(D) The instrument attempts to control the disposition of the property. After giving in the first instance authority to the assignee to sell either at public or private sale, the assignment goes on to provide that in case <em>any </em>creditor shall require that the sale should take place at auction, that then <em>all </em>of the property shall be sold at public auction. This, as tending to vary or modify the duties which the law devolves upon the assignee, of necessity vitiates the assignment <em>(Jessup </em>v. <em>Hulse, </em>21 N. Y. 168 ; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>32 N. Y. 209 <em>; Schlussell </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>22 How. Pr. 18). As to whether a provision in an assignment requiring or directing an assignee to sell the property at public auction avoids it or not, see <em>Work </em>v. <em>Bilis </em>(50 Barb. 512) ; <em>Dunham v. Waterman </em>(17 N. Y. 9) ; also <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Leavitt </em>(6 N. Y. 510) ; <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>Hulse </em>(21 How. Pr. 168) ; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sterns </em>(32 N. Y. 209). See further, <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Halliday </em>(11 Wend. 223) ; <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Hempstead </em>(7 Paige 568).</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\">(E) If the assignment is void in part it is void <em>in toto (Hyslop </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>14 Johns. <em>458 ; Grover </em>v. <em>Wakeman, </em>11 Wend. 190 <em>; Russell </em>v. <em>Winne, </em>37 N.

Y. 596 ; <em>Rinchey </em>v. <em>Stryker, </em>31 N. Y. 140 ; and numerous other cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In the case of <em>Castle </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(78 N. Y. 131), which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>claimed by the appellant\u2019s counsel to sustain a different view, the thing attached was a chose in action, and it was found by the court that the point urged, that the transfer of said chose in action was fraudulent and void as against creditors and no title passed, was not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The main question involved in this case is as to whether the instrument called an assignment is to be construed according to the laws of Virginia or the laws of the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is urged upon the part of the appellant, that personal property has no <em>situs </em>but follows its owner, and that the voluntary transfer, if valid by the law of the owner\u2019s domicile, is valid everywhere except where the transfer conflicts with the policy of The state where the property is situated (Story on Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 379-884).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Numerous adjudged cases are cited in the plaintiff\u2019s points to sustain this proposition, and it must be conceded to be the law as established by the courts of this state. In all those cases the domicile and the place of the execution of the will or other instrument of transfer coincided. In the case at bar the assignment was executed in New York. Execution implies signing, sealing and delivering. All must concur before there is a complete execution of any sealed instrument. Execution of a deed or sealed instrument is defined to he the signing, sealing and delivery of the same (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, title, Execution).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The assignment in question was signed and sealed by Oliver &amp; Robinson in Virginia, but the execution of the instrument was not completed until it was actually delivered to and accepted by Grady, which took place in New York. Up to that time they undoubtedly had a right to recall and revoke the instrument, because until such delivery the instrument was not executed by them and consequently no transfer of property could take place. The execution of the deed of assignment and its acceptance by the assignee was not only a transfer of the property therein named, but it was a contract entered into by the assignee to perform his part of the trust therein reposed in him. It is a princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>pie of elementary law that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>governs the question as to the validity of the contract (Story on Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 242 <em>et seq.').</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">No case has been called to the attention of the court where a transfer valid by the law of the domicile, but which was void by the law of the place where it was executed and where the property was situated and where such transfer went into effect, has been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It is urged upon the part of the appellant that it was not necessary in order that this transfer should be valid that Grady should accept it at all, because it is a principle of equity that a trust shall never fail for want of a trustee. This principle is undoubtedly correct, but has no application to the case at bar, because no trust whatever was created until this assignment was executed, and it was not executed, as has before been said, until it was delivered to Grady; therefore, it would appear that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>must govern, and that the law of the domicile cannot override the law of the place of the execution of the instrument, the situation of the subject matter, and the place of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">It is not necessary to decide in this case whether an assignment of personal property made, signed, sealed and delivered in Virginia, valid by the laws of Virginia and invalid by the statute law of the State of New York, would pass the title to personal property in the State of New York, because no such question is presented by the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The General Assignment Act of 1877 evidently contemplates the making of assignments by non-residents of the State of New York, who are carrying on business within said state. It provides that every conveyance or assignment by a debtor of his estate, real or personal, or both, to an assignee for the benefit of creditors of such debtor, shall be in writing, etc., and shall be recorded in the County Clerk\u2019s office of the county where such debtor resided or <em>carried on Ms business </em>at the date thereof; and it further provides that an assignment by copartners shall be recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>in. the county where the principal place of said business is situated. This language evidently contemplates those cases where the assignor lives out of the state, and is intended to apply to every transfer of property situated in the State of New York made for the benefit of creditors, when the assignor had carried on his business within this state. The evidence in this case shows that Oliver &amp; Robinson, although residents of the State of Virginia, carried on their business in the State of New York, and an assignment of the property used in said business and situated in \u25a0 the City of New York must, therefore, be governed by the assignment law of the State of New York, especially where, as has already been seen, such assignment was executed within said state.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">It is conceded upon the part of the appellant that if this assignment is to be construed by the laws of the State of New York that it is not valid; and, therefore, it is not necessary upon this appeal to discuss that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">It is urged that as the attaching creditors were residents of the State of Virginia, as well as the assignors Oliver &amp; Robinson, that some different rule should prevail on that question, because they were both subject to the laws of Virginia. That this rule, however, does not apply to the case at bar is evident from the fact that no matter where parties are domiciled, the <em>lex loci contractus </em>must govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">It is urged upon this appeal that the attachments, the execution and the judgment roll were inadmissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">It is undoubtedly true that the admission of the attachments, without the affidavits upon which they were issued, was error, but it appears from the record that those affidavits were subsequently offered in evidence, and it appears that they upon their face conferred jurisdiction upon the court to issue the attachments, and this objection, therefore, <em>cannot- now </em>prevail. Whether the judgment was-regularly entered or not is entirely immaterial in this case, because the sheriff, if he was authorized to make this seizure under the attachment, must he protected by this attachment, and the subsequent failure to recover a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>judgment cannot make the sheriff liable for an action of trespass, certainly if the same is commenced as the one at bar was before any judgment could possibly be obtained \u2014this action being comm\u00e9nced within seven days after the commencement of the action in which the attachments were issued: and it was held in the case of <em>Hinckey </em>v. <em>Stryker (supra), </em>that the sheriff, in an action for wrongfully taking the property, has a right to show that the title of the purchaser from the debtors was fraudulent and void as against attaching creditors, even before judgment in the attachment suit. In other words, the question as to whether the sheriff is a trespasser or not must be determined by the condition of affairs at the time that he seizes the property. Any other rule would make the sheriff liable for the mis'conduct or negligence of the attorneys in subsequent proceedings taken after a levy, over which he would have ho control.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">For these reasons we are of the opinion that the question as to whether proceedings subsequent to the issuing of the attachment by which the 'plaintiff in the attachment suit obtained judgment were regular or not is entirely immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">' We are of the opinion, therefore, that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">J.' F. Daly and Yah Hoeseh, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
