The plaintiff appeals from the said order in so far as the same fails to protect the general right of plaintiff to draw .cables into any unoccupied duet upon the payment of the usual rentals and compliance with the usual terms, and protects the rights of plaintiff only as to ducts upon which the rentals had been theretofore paid, and only to the extent of drawing in 500 feet of cables; and in so far as said order does not restrain defendant from refusing, upon application duly made, to assign any unrented duct or ducts to said plaintiff upon terms at least as favorable as those accorded to its most favored tenant, and from withholding from plaintiff facilities equal in all respect to facilities accorded by said defendant to any of its tenants, and from delaying action upon requests made by said plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-8\"><em>F.

At least they have been the occasion of very 1 earned and voluminous briefs. The first is whether the plaintiff is entitled to admission to the electrical subway, and the other is whether, if it has such right, its remedy is by mandamus or by action in equity. The plaintiff really seeks double relief. First, it asks that its present occupancy of the subways shall not be interfered with, and, <em>secondly, </em>it asks for a mandatory injunction which will give it additional space. This seems to me to be an eminently proper case to leave matters in <em>status quo </em>until the cause can be tried, or, if the moving papers contain all the facts, until the rights of the parties can be passed upon by an appellate court. It appears that the plaintiff now occupies and has occupied ducts in defendant\u2019s subway since 1896, for which it has paid and the defendant \u2019has accepted rental. . It can do no one any harm if such occu- \u2022 pancy be continued until the trial. So far, however, as concerns the application to compel the assignment of additional ducts to plaintiff a different principle applies, which is that the court will seldom grant a mandatory injunction <em>pendente lite </em>unless the plaintiff\u2019s right is so clear that the denial of the right must be either captious or unconscionable. Such is not the case here. The temporary injunction as modified by the order of June 16, 1903, will, therefore, be continued, subject only to the further modification that -the defendant shall be enjoined from preventing the plaintiff from connecting up additional customers with the present system as already located in the subway.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">To the extent indicated the motion will be granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
