It is the successor of F. Reisch <em>&amp; </em>Brothers, who, on January 3, 1903, registered for use as a trademark the figure of a beer bottle, a shower of beer spouting therefrom, and the words \u201cBimini\u201d' just above and \u201cFountain of Youth\u2019 just below. The bottle label' also contains the word \u201cBimini.\u201d Combined with the bottle is the capital letter \u201cR,\u201d and a bird, described as a peacock, is perched upon the lower horizontal stroke of the letter. The bird of that mark, while given a somewhat prominent position therein, is not a dominating feature. On December 15, 1896, there was registered to Thomas McMullen &amp; Company, of New York,, as a trademark, the word \u201cPeacock,\u201d or a picture of a peacock, with the words \u201cYe Peacock Ale\u201d immediately above. It is. hardly necessary to suggest that in this mark the peacock is a. dominating feature. It is evident that the users of the mark intended that the goods upon which it was used should be known as peacock goods. In fact, they are so designated in the mark itself. This mark the Patent Office evidently found not to conflict with the registration of 1893 of F. Reisch &amp; Brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The mark which appellant now seeks to register clearly conflicts with the McMullen mark, as the dominent feature of each is a peacock. Notwithstanding this, appellant says \u201cit has a vested right to the use of the peacock,\u201d because of said registration in 1893 of its predecessor, to which it has succeeded. This contention is too broad. It undoubtedly has the right, as. against McMullen &amp; Company, to vend its goods under the mark registered by its predecessor, but it has no right so to-change it that it will conflict with a mark which was in use at the time of the change, and which did not conflict with the.prior registration. The decision is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
