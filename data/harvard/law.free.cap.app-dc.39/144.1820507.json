In a registering mechanism, the combination with a plurality of totalizers, each comprising a series of denominational elements, and a laterally extending rod on which all said elements are mounted in alignment, of a plurality of differentially movable totalizer operating racks also mounted in lateral alignment, connections permitting collective relative lateral movement between said totalizers and their said operating racks, means for causing to and fro relative movement be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tween said totalizers and their operating racks, thereby producing engagement of said totalizers and said racks for movement thereof together, keys for determining the extent of differential movement of said operating racks, devices carrying printing type and movable in both directions with said operating racks, and connections for forcing said type against a record material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The interference was originally declared on count 1 of the present issue. When it was found that Hopkins\u2019s earliest date did not overcome Cleal\u2019s filing date, Hopkins was ordered <em>to </em>show cause why judgment should not be rendered against him on the face of the record. Hopkins- thereupon filed a motion to dissolve the interference, on the ground that the issue had different meanings when applied to the devices of the respective parties, and also on the ground of unpatentability in view of the prior art. Cleal then made a motion to amend by adding certain counts. The primary examiner denied Hopkins\u2019s motion, but allowed Cleal to amend by adding counts 2 and 3 of the present issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The invention relates to a registering device for adding and listing numbers. While the device of Hopkins is a most complicated, ingenious, and useful invention, the issue here involved relates only to what is known as the totalizer. Hopkins shows a number of operating racks or actuators equal to the number of totalizing wheels or elements, as they are called, in each group of totalizers. For example, he shows nine of each actuating in alignment with each other, while Cleal shows nine elements in each group of the totalizers, and only four actuators. The sole question before us is whether the counts in issue each call for a number of actuators equal to the elements of each group of totalizers. The Commissioner of Patents found that the second count did call for an equal number, and awarded it to Hopkins, and that counts 1 and 3 did not call for an equal number, and accordingly awarded them to Cleal. Hopkins appealed from the award to Cleal, and Cleal took a cross appeal from the award to Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The issue of priority was properly disposed of below. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>question of patentability was for the Patent Office, and will not be reviewed here, and the award as to the counts in issue is correct. Counts 1 and 3 do not, upon any reasonable construction, call for an equal number of actuators with the number of elements in each group of totalizers. All that is embraced in these counts as bearing upon the issue is described as <em>\u201ca </em>plurality of totalizers, each comprising a series of denominational elements and a laterally extending rod on which all said elements are mounted in alignment, of a plurality of differentially movable totalizer operating racks also mounted in lateral alignment.\u201d This will admit of any number of actuators and. totalizing elements which Cleal might choose to accept, except that he would be barred by Hopkins\u2019s earlier claim from so amending as to call for an equal number. Count 2 expressly calls for <em>\u201ca </em>plurality of totalizers each comprising a series of denominational elements, and a rod on which said elements are mounted side by side in lateral alignment, of a plurality of totalizer operating racks also mounted side by side in lateral alignment, and <em>equaling in number the denominational elements of any one of the totalizers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Confining ourselves to the only question before us,\u2014the award of the counts in issue,\u2014the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
