Carr, as president.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-8\">The appellee also filed an additional affidavit, sworn to by its president, in which it was recited that the appellee, on October 13, 1903, for valuable consideration, purchased and succeeded to all the accounts, bills receivable, choses in action, business, good will, brands, name, and trademarks of James B. M. Kehlor, and has continuously since that date conducted the business as his successor, and that included in said transfer and succession was the said trademark \u201cBrilliant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-9\">On the filing of this application and affidavits, publication was made under the order of the Commissioner of Patents, giving notice to any person who believed he would be damaged by the registration, to file his opposition within thirty days after the publication of the said notice; and thereupon the appellant filed notice of opposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-10\">The grounds given by the appellant for opposing the registration of the said mark were: First, because prior to the com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>mo\" \"oment of use by the, said Kehlor Flour Mills Company of' the alleged trademark \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as applied to wheat flour, the said Sauers Milling Company commenced to use, and has. since continued to use, and has used for more than twenty-five years last past, the trademark named \u201cBrilliantine,\u201d as applied to wheat flour; Second, because said alleged trademark \u201cBrilliant,\u201d so applied, is descriptive of the goods in connection with which it has been applied by the said appellee, and being so descriptive, said appellee has not (by reason of the use by the Sauers Milling Company, for a period of twenty-five years last past, of the trademark named \u201cBrilliantine\u201d) been in actual and exclusive use of the trademark \u201cBrilliant,\u201d an equivalent, word, for a period of ten years next preceding February 20, 1905; and, Third, because said alleged trademark \u201cBrilliant,\u201d' applied to wheat flour, is geographical.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">The said Kehlor Flour Mills Company answered the said notice of opposition, the answer being duly verified by the president of the company. In this answer, the respondent admits; that the said word \u201cBrilliantine\u201d so nearly resembles respondent\u2019s said trademark \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as to be likely to be mistaken therefor by the public, and so nearly resembles the same as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the minds of the public, and to deceive purchasers; but it avers that the use of the word \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as a trademark, by the respondent, was long anterior to the use of the word \u201cBrilliantine\u201d by the said Sauers Milling Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">It denies that the word \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as applied to wheat flour, is descriptive of the goods; and it denies that the Sauers Milling Company used the name \u201cBrilliantine\u201d for a period of twenty-five years last past, or for any period; and if it has used the name at all, it avers that it was an infringement and violation of the respondent\u2019s exclusive right in its trademark \u201cBrilliant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">It also denies that the word \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as applied to wheat flour, is geographical.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-8\">Further answering, the respondent avers that the word \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as applied to wheat flour, is an arbitrary and meaning<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>less word, not geographical or descriptive, and that it is a valid, technical trademark, and is the exclusive property of the respondent, and has been continuously used in the respondent\u2019s business, and in the business of its predecessors from whom it \u2022derived title, since about March 19, 1868, as stated in its application herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-4\">That respondent is the successor in business of James B. M. Kehlor, from whom it acquired title to said trademark, \u201cBrilliant,\u201d he having used the said mark continuously upon flour of his own manufacture and selection, from June 25, 1878, until October 13, 1903, when.the respondent company was organized and the mark transferred to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-5\">It refers to the registration of the trademark \u201cBrilliant\u201d to Jenkins &amp; Hover, of Oswego, New York, No. 4518, April 3, 1877, and the assignment to James B. M. Kehlor, recorded in the Patent Office June 25, 1878, and registration to James B. M. Kehlor, No. 33,319, August 8, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-6\">In the testimony taken, William 0. Ellis, of St. Louis, was \u2022examined. He had been a stenographer with said James B. M. Kehlor and with the appellee corporation; and in response to a question, on pages 93 and 94 of the record, he stated that said firm claims the use of the trademark since about March 19, 1868, and that that date was based on the Jenkins &amp; Hover registration, in which they swore to use nine years prior to the date of their application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">In connection with his testimony, a copy of the assignment from Jenkins &amp; Hover to James B. M. Kehlor was filed, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">Eor value received, we hereby sell and assign to J. B. M. Kehlor, all our right, title, and interest in and to the trademark for flour, \u201cBrilliant,\u201d said mark having been registered by us in the Patent Office of the Hnited States, and certificate of such registration issued, numbered 4518, April 3, 1877, by the Commissioner of Patents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-9\">(Signed) Jenkins &amp; Hover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The Examiner of Interferences, in his opinion, holds that the evidence establishes the adoption of the mark by the Sauers Milling Company at least as early as 1874, and that Kehlor and his successors used the same since 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">He holds that there is not a particle of evidence in the case to show that Jenkins &amp; Hover were using the mark in 1873, or that they ever used the mark at any time. That the statements in the Jenkins &amp; Hover registration are not proof of actual use of the mark. He concludes that as the Kehlor Flour Mills Company adopted the mark as early as 1873, a year prior to any date established on behalf of the opposer, it follows that \u25a0said company is entitled to prevail; and he decided that the word \u201cBrilliant\u201d is not descriptive, and not geographical; and he therefore dismissed the opposition, and adjudged that the Kehlor Flour Mills Company was entitled to register the mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">On appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, the decision of the Examiner of Interferences was affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">The Commissioner of Patents held that there is no evidence of the use of the mark by Jenkins &amp; Hover prior to 1873. He held that the testimony shows that the mark in issue was first made by the firm of Alexander H. Smith &amp; Company, between 1861 and 1869; that said company became bankrupt in 1869, and the property was sold under deed of trust, and purchased by Kehlor, TJpdyke, &amp; Company. That company was succeeded by Kehlor Brothers, who in turn were succeeded by James B. M. Kehlor, and the latter was succeeded by the appellee, Kehlor Flour Mills Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">The appellant filed a petition in the Patent Office, for a rehearing by the Commissioner, which was denied; and thereupon the appeal was taken to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-8\"><em>Mr. Bruce 8.

This sale of the trademark to Kehlor, while it passed no title to Kehlor, amounted in law to an abandonment of the mark by Jenkins &amp; Hover, and, as the Sauers Milling Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>pany had been in the field at least four years with their mark, they must either be held to be alone entitled to registration of the mark, or Kehlor Flour Mills Company must be held to have no greater right to the mark than the Sauers Milling Company, and registration refused them. <em>Eiseman </em>v. <em>Schiffer, </em>157 Fed. 473; <em>McMahon Pharmacal Co. </em>v. <em>Denver Chemical Co. </em>113 Fed. 474; <em>Hegeman </em>v. <em>Hegeman, </em>8 Daly, 1, 7; <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Central City Soap Co. </em>26 Fed. 576; <em>Mayer Fertilizer Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. </em>35 App. D.

That he erred in not hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ing that the word \u201cBrilliant,\u201d applied as a trademark to flour, is descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Counsel for the appellant contend that their client was entitled to rely upon the statements of the appellee made under oath, that Jenkins &amp; Hover began the use of the trademark \u201cBrilliant\u201d as early as 1868. That they are entitled to assume that fact from the pleadings in this case, and that there is nothing in the record to contradict it.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Assuming that to be true, they contend that the assignment, from Jenkins &amp; Hover of the said trademark, to J. B. M. Kehlor, which was recorded in the Patent Office on June 25, 1878,. was invalid as an assignment, for the reason that an assignment of a trademark, and nothing more, being unaccompanied by tbe business or good will in which tbe trademark bad been used, is ineffectual for any purpose except to be evidence of an abandonment of tbe mark by tbe assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em>Jackson Corset Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>38 App. D. C. 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">This court held, in tbe <em>American Stove Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit Stove Works, </em>31 App. D. C. 306, tbat tbe registration of a trademark under tbe old trademark law, which was declared unconstitutional, is nevertheless evidence of tbe use of tbe trademark by tbe registrant; and tbe fact of tbat use in tbis case having been alleged by tbe appellee repeatedly, under oath, and tbeir claims based upon it, it must be assumed tbat tbe opposer bad a right to rely upon tbat fact in tbis case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">If tbe trademark \u201cBrilliant\u201d was used as early as 1868, by Jenkins &amp; Hover, and tbeir use of tbe same was not abandoned until 1878 by tbe assignment to Kehlor; and if no right to the use of tbe mark bad been received by Kehlor under tbe said assignment, then tbe appellee could have bad no exclusive right to tbe mark, or to have it registered under tbe application in tbis case, for tbe reason tbat tbe opposer was using tbe word \u201cBrilliantine\u201d as a trademark from 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Tbe facts claimed to be established by tbe appellant would make tbe mark free property, after its abandonment by said Jenkins <em>&amp; </em>Hover; and tbe appellee, not being tbe exclusive-user of tbe same, was not entitled to registration, and could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>prevent the opposer from continuing the use of the equivalent, word \u201cBrilliantine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Wo are disposed to think that the contentions of the appellant in this respect are well founded, and that said Sauers Milling Company has the right to assume the facts as stated in the answer of the Kehlor Flour Mills Company, and in its application herein, to be true, in the absence of anything in the-record to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The purchase of the mill and other property by appellee\u2019spredecessor, from Alex. H. Smith &amp; Company did not include the trademark of said firm, if any it had, and therefore adds nothing to appellee\u2019s title to exclusive use of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">A second point strongly urged is that the word \u201cBrilliant,\u201d' which is the principal feature of this trademark, is not a word' that is entitled to registration as a trademark, because of its. descriptive character when applied to flour. The testimony shows that it indicates bright flour that shows up well, and is-of a superior quality, as distinguished from the darker <em>brands; </em>and that the bright flour is considered of greater value, and more sought after by purchasers than the darker brands.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The dictionaries define the word as synonymous with bright or splendid, and when applied to flour, the evidence, as well as-reason, would seem to indicate that it meant the bright, white product of the wheat flour, after the darker portions of the-grain had been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">This court has had many cases before it where trademarks have been denied registration, because they were descriptive of the quality or character of the goods on which they were to housed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">In one of the latest cases, <em>Re Meyer Bros. Coffee &amp; Spice Co. </em>38 App. D. C. 520, this court held that a trademark for coffee, which consisted of a representation of a loving cup, in. connection with the word \u201ctrophy,\u201d should be denied registration, because the mark was descriptive of the goods, in that it indicated them to be of a superior quality, by reason of tile-presentation of a prize or \u201ctrophy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The authorities therein referred to, and others preceding' them, are many. Among them are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The word \u201cstandard,\u201d as applied to phonographs <em>(Re National Phonograph Co. </em>29 App. D. C. 142); the word \u201cself-loading,\u201d as applied to cartridges ( <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Peters Cartridge Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 505); the words \u201cshredded whole wheat,\u201d as applied to certain food preparations <em>(Natural Food Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>30 App. D. C. 348); the words \u201chealth food,\u201d as applied to bread, crackers, etc. <em>(Battle Creek Sanitarium Co. </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>30 App. D. C. 411); the word \u201csterling,\u201d as a trademark for ale, or for any other kind of goods <em>(Worster Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Rueter &amp; Co. </em>30 App. D. C. 428); the words \u201ccircular loom,\u201d as applied to conduits and coverings for electrical conductors (Re American <em>Circular Loom Co. </em>28 App. D. C. 446); the words \u201cball bearing,\u201d as \u2022describing the goods on which it was to be placed <em>(Re Schweinfurter Pracisions-Kugel-Lager-Werke Fichtel &amp; Sachs, </em>38 App. D. C. 279); the word \u201ccrystal,\u201d as applied to beer <em>(Re New South Brewery &amp; Ice Co. </em>32 App. D. C. 591); and the word \u201cnextobeer,\u201d as applied to malt beverages <em>(Re Central Consumers Co. </em>(32 App. D. C. 523), were all held to be descriptive of the goods on which they were to be used; and whether they are true descriptions, or whether they are deceptive, can make no difference with reference to their constituting valid marks for registration. They must either be true, or they are \u00abdeceptive, and would mislead the public, and for that reason would be refused registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Our review of the authorities, and consideration of this point, leads us to conclude that it was error not to hold the word '\u201cBrilliant,\u201d as applied to wheat flour, to be a word of description, and therefore not proper to be registered as a trademark. If it describes the flour of A as being bright, white, and of a superior or splendid quality, it must also describe the flour of B if of the same quality; and, being a word of description, any manufacturer of flour of the quality indicated by it has a right <em>to </em>use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We therefore conclude, on the whole case, that there is error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>in this record, and that tbe decision of tbe Commissioner of Patents must be reversed, and tbe opposition sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b567-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Shepard:</author>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">I concur in tbe opinion and judgment to tbe extent that \u201cBrilliant,\u201d as applied to flour, is descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Petition for rehearing denied Eebruary 10, 1913.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
