He contends that the district court failed to offer adequate reasons for imposing the five year term and that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. We review both contentions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 497 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">The district court\u2019s explanation for the five year sentence addressed Hopper\u2019s his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>tory and characteristics, the need to deter future crimes, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(6). Moreover, the record indicates that the district court listened to and considered Hopper\u2019s argument before imposing sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court adequately explained the reasons for the sentence. <em>See Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Hopper\u2019s reasonableness contention is in part predicated on the district court\u2019s alleged failure to address the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Because those factors were addressed, Hopper\u2019s contention is unavailing. Hopper\u2019s argument otherwise seeks to have this court reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, something this court will not do. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 343-44 (5th Cir.2011)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
