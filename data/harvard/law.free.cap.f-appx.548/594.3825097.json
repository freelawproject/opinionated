Freeman, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s decision awarding Defendant Patrick Rice $14,982.50 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred during a previous appeal to this Court. After review, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting Rice\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. For this reason, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-19\">A thorough history of the origin of this case is available in our previous opinion, <em>Freeman v. Rice, </em>399 Fed.Appx. 540, 541-44 (11th Cir.2010). For purposes of this appeal, a brief summary will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">This case began as a landlord-tenant action in the Small Claims Division of the County Court of Miami-Dade County, Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 541. Rice sued Freeman, who was his landlord, alleging breach of a residential lease. <em>Id. </em>at 542. The parties proceeded to a bench trial, and Rice was awarded $2,555. <em>Id. </em>This judgment was upheld on appeal, and the County Court later issued an Amended Final Judgment granting $14,165.90, which included attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>After Freeman unsuccessfully attempted to appeal the Amended Final Judgment, the County Court issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>a second final judgment awarding Rice an additional $4,161.34 in attorney\u2019s fees resulting from this appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Following the conclusion of the state court litigation, Freeman initiated an action in federal district court, seeking an injunction prohibiting Rice from collecting the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded to him by the County Court. The district court granted Rice\u2019s motion to dismiss and ordered that Freeman\u2019s complaint be dismissed with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 543. The next day, Freeman moved for leave to amend, which the district court denied. <em>Id. </em>After Freeman appealed the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend, we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We allowed Rice\u2019s motion to seek appellate attorney\u2019s fees out of time and transferred Rice\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees back to the district court. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who in turn recommended that Rice\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees be granted. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and awarded $14,982.50 in attorney\u2019s fees to Rice. Freeman now appeals the district court\u2019s award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u201cThis court reviews an award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion; nevertheless, that standard of review still allows us to closely scrutinize questions of law decided by the district court in reaching a fee award.\u201d <em>Villano v. City of Boynton Beach, </em>254 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Freeman\u2019s first argument is that Rice\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees fails to comply with the federal standards for pleading a breach of contract claim. Specifically, Freeman argues that Rice\u2019s Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees did not comply with the pleading standards established in cases like <em>Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), and <em>Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1256 (11th Cir.2009). In the same vein, Freeman argues that Rice was required to plead attorney\u2019s fees as a category of special damages pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Freeman\u2019s argument fails because Rice\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees was not a filing that is required to meet the pleading standards of Rule 9(g) or cases like <em>Iqbal, Twombly, </em>and <em>Vega. </em>Rule 7(a) lists the seven categories of pleadings allowed in federal court, and a motion for attorney\u2019s fees is not one of them. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(a). Rather, Rice\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees was governed by 11th Cir. R. 39-2(b) because they arose from an appeal to this Court. <em>See Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups, </em>554 F.3d 1340, 1356-57 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cRule 39-2 of this Court governs an award of attorney\u2019s fees and requires, absent statute or court order, the filing of a request in this Court, not the district court.... \u201d). Rule 39-2 provides that an application for attorney\u2019s fees to this Court requires: (1) a memorandum showing that the party seeking fees is legally entitled to them; (2) a summary of work performed supported by contemporaneous time records recording all work for which a fee is claimed; and (3) an affidavit attesting to the truthfulness of the information contained in the application and demonstrating the basis for the hourly rate requested. 11th Cir. R. 39-2(b). Freeman\u2019s argument lacks merit because he cannot show that Rice\u2019s motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>failed to meet any of these requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Second, Freeman argues that he had no notice that Rice would seek attorney\u2019s fees. According to Freeman, Rice did not file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees within 30 days after the County Court issued its judgment. Nor did Rice provide Freeman notice that he would pursue attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. As a result, Freeman argues that Rice is precluded from seeking attorney\u2019s fees at any later stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Freeman\u2019s argument would be correct if Rice were seeking attorney\u2019s fees from the original proceeding in County Court. Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.525 states that any party seeking a judgment of attorney\u2019s fees shall serve a motion no later than 80 days after the filing of the judgment. Rice did not seek attorney\u2019s fees from those proceedings, however, because he appeared <em>pro se </em>in the County Court. Rather, Rice is seeking attorney\u2019s fees from Freeman\u2019s previous appeal to this Court, which is governed by 11th Cir. R. 39-2(a), not the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. Eleventh Circuit Rule 39-2(a) states that an application for attorney\u2019s fees must generally be filed within 14 days after the time for filing a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc expires, or within 14 days after entry of an order disposing of a timely petition for rehearing, or denying a timely petition for rehearing en banc, whichever is later. The rule allows for exceptions, however, whenever the Court so orders. 11th Cir. R. 39-2(a). And in this case, we issued an order granting Rice\u2019s request to file a motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees out of time. As a result, Rice\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, while untimely, was nevertheless permissible. <em>See Common Cause, </em>554 F.3d at 1357 (\u201cIt is long established in this circuit that this court has the discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs for the work expended before it.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Finally, Freeman argues that the district court erred when it concluded that Rice was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the lease. Paragraph 25 of Rice\u2019s lease states that \u201c[i]n any lawsuit brought to enforce the Lease or under applicable law, the party who wins may recover ... attorney\u2019s fees from the party who loses.\u201d Freeman argues that none of the proceedings in this case \u2014 including his previous appeal to this Court \u2014 can qualify as a proceeding to enforce the lease or other applicable law because Rice never alleged any such violation in his initial County Court complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Even though Rice\u2019s initial complaint may not have stated explicitly that he was suing for breach of his residential lease, at this stage in the proceedings, it is indisputable that Rice\u2019s original action alleged breach of a residential lease. <em>See Freeman, </em>399 Fed.Appx. at 541-42 (\u201cIn 2005, Rice sued Freeman, who was his landlord, alleging breach of a residential lease.\u201d). In his Amended Complaint in the district court, Freeman acknowledged that Rice sued him \u201cfor an alleged breach of a residential lease agreement.\u201d Freeman also cannot cite to any authority or facts suggesting that Rice\u2019s suit involved anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>other than a suit to enforce the residential lease. As a result, we agree with the district court that attorney\u2019s fees here are appropriate under paragraph 25 of Rice\u2019s lease. The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. Freeman also argues that under Florida law, Rice failed to sufficiently plead a claim in County Court. State pleading rules, however, do not apply in federal court, even in cases based on diversity jurisdiction. <em>See Caster v. Hennessey, </em>781 F.2d 1569, 1570 (11th Cir.1986). In addition, to the extent that Freeman wishes to re-argue the merits of the state court proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to address this argument. <em>See Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 463, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006) (\"[Ujnder what has come to be known as the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
