He also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider that final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-27\">Smith was originally admitted into the United States on a B-l visitor visa and granted an authorization to remain until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>April 2008. In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security charged him as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) for staying in the United States beyond that original authorization. Smith admitted DHS\u2019s allegations and conceded removability. While those removal proceedings were pending, he filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The IJ denied Smith\u2019s application and ordered him removed. The BIA then affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings and denied Smith\u2019s appeal. Instead of seeking review of the BIA\u2019s decision in this Court, Smith filed a motion asking the BIA to reconsider its decision in light of \u201cnewly submitted\u201d evidence. The BIA denied that motion, finding that Smith had failed to demonstrate a factual or legal error in its earlier decision based on the record then before it. Smith had also failed to show that his new evidence, which was largely cumulative of his old evidence, was unavailable at the time of his removal hearing. Now, more than 30 days after the BIA issued its final order of removal, Smith petitions for review of that final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We review de <em>novo </em>our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">A petition for review must be filed with the court of appeals no later than 30 days after the issuance of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005). The period for filing a petition for review is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnot subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). The filing of a motion to reconsider neither affects the finality of the removal order nor tolls the 30-day period in which to petition for review. <em>Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1350-51. Because Smith petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s final order more than 30 days after the final order\u2019s issuance, we lack jurisdiction to consider that part of his petition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">As for Smith\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, we have held that a motion to reconsider a BIA decision must specify the errors of law or fact in the original decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)). A motion that merely reiterates earlier arguments fails to specify those kinds of legal or factual errors. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration because Smith merely reiterated arguments already presented to and considered by the BIA, failing to identify any specific errors of law or fact in its earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
