Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and as frivolous and failing to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A. We review such a dismissal de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-21\">Snarke argues that the district court erred in determining that his claims were barred pursuant to <em>Heck. </em>In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a \u00a7 1983 claim that would necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction is not cognizable until the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction \u201chas been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Snarke\u2019s claims are based on his arrest on June 11, 2011, and his imprisonment for 18 days thereafter in Ochiltree County, Texas. His arrest followed the observation, by a Gray County deputy sheriff, of two individuals who committed a theft from a Gray County Wal-Mart running to a stolen vehicle and departing with Snarke. Two hours later, officers in Ochiltree County stopped the same vehicle, with Snarke still in it, and identified one of the individuals in the vehicle as the individual who stole the vehicle. Officers arrested all three individuals. Eighteen days after the arrest in Ochiltree County, the charges there were dismissed, and, that same day, Snarke was transported to Gray County and charged with Engaging in Organized Criminal Activity based on the same arrest. Snarke pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to four years of imprisonment, which term he is currently serving. Because Snarke concedes that he pleaded guilty to the charge of Engaging in Organized Criminal Activity arising out of the same arrest and did not contest that the proof required to establish his unlawful arrest and detention claims necessarily implicates his conviction for Engaging in Organized Criminal Activity, he has failed to show the district court erred in concluding that his claims are barred by <em>Heck. See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Wells v. Bonner, </em>45 F.3d 90, 95 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
