We generally review only the order of the BIA, but we will consider the underlying decision of the IJ if it influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We consider both decisions in the instant case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Whether an alien has demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT is a factual determination that we review for substantial evidence. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). The substantial evidence test requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant must show a clear probability that she will be persecuted upon her return to her home country. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cA clear probability means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Ayala-Rivas asserts that, if she is returned to El Salvador, she -will be persecuted on account of her membership in a particular social group \u2014 her family. To establish a particular social group, Ayala-Rivas must show \u201ca group of persons that share a common immutable characteristic that they either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">The IJ and BIA did not err in concluding that Ayala-Rivas did not demonstrate that she was a member of a particular social group entitled to protection. The putative group of Ayala-Rivas\u2019s family is overly broad and does not establish a meaningful basis for distinguishing Ayala-Rivas from other people. Ayala-Rivas also has failed to establish either that society would perceive members of a family unit opposed to Mara Salvatrucha (MS) as a group or that her family is in a substantially different situation than anyone in the general population who resists MS or is perceived as a threat to its interests. Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the IJ and BIA\u2019s determination that Ayala-Rivas is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134; <em>Carbajah-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Ayala-Rivas argues that the IJ and BIA erred in denying her relief under the CAT. To obtain CAT relief, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that she will suffer torture if deported to her home country. <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1139; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The CAT defines torture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Ayala-Rivas presented no evidence of past torture or evidence that, if removed to El Salvador, it is more likely than not that she will suffer torture by the instigation or acquiescence of the El Salvadoran government. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3), (c)(2); <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Accordingly, Ayala-Rivas\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
