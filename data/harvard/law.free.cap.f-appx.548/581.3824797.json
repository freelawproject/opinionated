The district court denied Mr. Johns\u2019 motion without an evi-dentiary hearing, and Mr. Johns now appeals. Following a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">Mr. Johns pled guilty to a conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute at least 5 kilograms of cocaine and was sentenced to 240 months in prison, the mandatory minimum, followed by 10 years of supervised release. As part of his plea, Mr. Johns agreed to cooperate with the government, and the plea agreement in turn provided that \u201c[i]f ... cooperation [was] completed after sentencing <em>and </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Government determined] that such cooperation qualified] as \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 pursuant to Rule 35(b) ..., the Government w[ould] file a motion for reduction of sentence.\u201d D.E. 21 at 7-8 (emphasis added). Believing that he provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of his co-defendant Jerriek Williams, who later pled guilty, Mr. Johns filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to compel the government to file a motion for a downward departure to his sentence, a motion he later amended with the assistance of counsel. According to letters attached to Mr. Johns\u2019 motion, the government had refused to file the motion because it determined that Mr. Johns\u2019 cooperation did not \u201c \u2018play a large part\u2019 in Mr. Williams\u2019 decision to plead guilty.\u201d D.E. 105 at 3. The district court denied Mr. Johns\u2019 motion to compel, and he timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">At the outset, we address the government\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction over Mr. Johns\u2019 appeal. It is beyond dispute that \u201cdistrict courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). <em>See also United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Wade </em>to a Rule 35 motion). In addition, district courts have original jurisdiction \u201cin the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Although, as discussed below, the standard of review varies depending on how we characterize Mr. Johns\u2019 motion, the existence of our jurisdiction does not. The district court\u2019s order denying the motion was a final appealable order, and Mr. Johns filed his notice of appeal within 14 days of the entry of judgment. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">If Mr. Johns\u2019 motion is construed as invoking the district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence in the absence of a government motion pursuant to Rule 35, the district court\u2019s denial would call for <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). Similarly, \u201c[w]hether the Government breached a plea agreement is a question of law, to be reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008). On the other hand, we review the denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the N. Dist. of Cal., </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (\u201c[I]t is important to remember that issuance of the writ is in large part a matter of discretion with the court to which the petition is addressed.\u201d). We need not, however, decide which of these standards applies here because we hold that the district court\u2019s order passes muster under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Under Rule 35, the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a motion for a downward sentencing departure when the defendant provides substantial assistance within one year of sentencing. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Although federal district courts may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion, in order to prevail the defendant must make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that \u201cthe refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive,\u201d such as race or religion, or demonstrate that the refusal \u201cwas not rationally related to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>legitimate Government end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. The district court correctly found that Mr. Johns failed to make this threshold showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Mr. Johns argues with some force that he provided substantial assistance to the government following his sentencing. Yet he does not allege that the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion stems from any unconstitutional motive. Instead, he merely asserts that \u201c[flailing to give anyone credit for honest substantial assistance that led to the investigation and prosecution of another person is certainly not a legitimate government interest and violates constitutionally protected rights.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. But, as the Supreme Court has made clear, \u201ca claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance,\u201d even when coupled with \u201cadditional but generalized allegations of improper motive,\u201d \u201cwill not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Instead, a defendant must provide \u201can allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502. Because Mr. Johns does little more than recount the assistance he provided to the government, the district court correctly found that he failed to meet this standard, and thus he was \u201cnot entitled to a remedy or to even an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The district court also correctly found that the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement. Mr. Johns argues that his plea agreement created a binding obligation on the government to file a downward departure motion if he provided substantial assistance. But this argument ignores the plain language of the plea agreement, which provides that the government \u201cwill file\u201d a motion <em>only if </em>\u201cthe Government determines,\u201d in its sole discretion, that Mr. Johns\u2019 cooperation qualifies as substantial assistance. D.E. 21 at 7-8 (\u201c[T]he determination as to whether Defendant has provided \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 rests <em>solely </em>with the Government.\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the government here determined that Mr. Johns\u2019 cooperation did not amount to substantial assistance, it did not breach any express promise to file a downward departure motion. <em>See Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1499 n. 2 (declining to review the government\u2019s refusal to file a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 under contract principles where there was no evidence that \u201cthe government failed to comply with [an] explicit provision of the plea agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Finally, Mr. Johns asserts that the government acted arbitrarily and in bad faith in determining whether his cooperation amounted to substantial assistance. But, even if we disagreed with the government\u2019s assessment of Mr. Johns\u2019 cooperation, \u201ccourts are precluded from intruding into prosecutorial discretion\u201d by \u201cevaluat[ing] the assistance rendered by a defendant offering cooperation as a term of his plea agreement unless and until the government makes a ... motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1501. Accordingly, under the law of this circuit, a defendant may not challenge the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion on the grounds of generalized bad faith. <em>See id. </em>at 1501 n. 4 (explaining that, under \u201cthe [Supreme] Court\u2019s clear holding in <em>Wade </em>[,] ... judicial review of the government\u2019s decision not to file a 5K1.1 motion is appropriate only when unconstitutional motivation has been alleged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Johns\u2019 motion to compel the government to file a motion for a substantial-assistance departure pursuant to Rule 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
