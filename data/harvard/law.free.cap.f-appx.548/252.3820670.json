The district court enhanced Sanchez-Cruz\u2019s sentence based upon its finding that his prior California conviction for lewd acts with a child aged 14 or 15 was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Sanchez-Cruz argues that the offense for which he was convicted did not qualify as a crime of violence because the statute under which he was convicted was overly broad and did not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-20\">Sanchez-Cruz did not object on this basis in the district court. Accordingly, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). In 2006, Sanchez-Cruz was convicted under Cal.Penal Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u00a7 288(c)(1). Under a plain meaning approach, his conviction was for the enumerated offense of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n.l(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 552-53 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 6, 2013) (No. 12-10695). Sanchez-Cruz cannot demonstrate that the district court committed a clear or obvious error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Henao-Melo, </em>591 F.3d 798, 806 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
