Villanueva-Diaz, </em>634 F.3d 844, 852 (5th Cir.2011), in which we held that speculation that an alien would not have been removed is not sufficient to establish the prejudice required for a collateral attack on removal proceedings. Caballero-Cruz also preserves for possible Supreme Court review a foreclosed challenge to <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002), in which we held that deportation errors involving discretionary relief do not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
