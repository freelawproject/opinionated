The sentence was the mandatory minimum sentence, triggered by Salazar\u2019s 1992 conviction for cocaine possession. Salazar appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a reduced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"AMc\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentence is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Kelly, </em>716 F.3d 180, 181 (5th Cir.2013). Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines lowered the base offense level for crack offenses in accordance with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>Id. </em>at 180. However, because Salazar \u201cwas subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, the district court [was] not authorized to grant a reduction below that minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181. Salazar\u2019s claim for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582 thus lacks arguable merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-25\">Salazar contends for the first time on appeal that his mandatory minimum sentence is unlawful in light of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which held that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum sentence must be found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. He argues that <em>Alleyne </em>overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which recognized that the fact of a prior conviction did not need to be proved to a jury in order to provide the ground for increasing a statutory sentence. We need not consider this wholly new contention because it was not raised in the district court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Nonetheless, we note that the Supreme Court in <em>Alleyne </em>declined to revisit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres. Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
