The district court denied his IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Bledsoe is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-20\">Athough Bledsoe styled his motion as falling under Rule 52(b), it is the essence of a pro se prisoner\u2019s pleading, rather than the label attached to it, that controls how that pleading is characterized. <em>United States v. Santoro, </em>711 F.2d 41, 42 n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). As federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, Bledsoe must have statutory authority for the filing of his motion. <em>See Veldhoen v. United States Coast Guard, </em>35 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">Bledsoe\u2019s motion was not properly brought pursuant to Rule 52(b) because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>that rule does not set forth a procedural mechanism for challenging a conviction or sentence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Had his motion been construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court would have lacked jurisdiction to consider it because he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and we have not authorized him to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Further, Bledsoe\u2019s claims were not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense, and his claims were not foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. Consequently, his motion could not have been construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition brought via the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e) allows a district court to modify a sentence under certain narrow circumstances, none of those circumstances are applicable to Bled-soe\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c). He was also precluded from obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, as relief thereunder is reserved only for direct appeals. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, Bledsoe\u2019s motion did not qualify as a writ of coram nobis or audita querela. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 489 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Jimenez v. Trominski, </em>91 F.3d 767, 768 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Bledsoe\u2019s motion was, in essence, a meaningless, unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Because he has failed to show that the instant appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), Bledsoe\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"AC0\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
