The district court construed Jones\u2019s complaint as alleging excessive force during his arrest, unlawful entry into his home, unlawful arrest, racial discrimination, denial of medical care, and denial of reasonable bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">Jones has moved to supplement the record with a recording of the hearing conducted by the district court under <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-22\">Nonetheless, in this court, Jones offers only two unsupported assertions of unlawful entry and denial of medical care. These conclusional assertions do not establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 741 (5th Cir.2002). Jones also offers a lengthy recitation of general and familiar legal principles. But he does not attempt to apply these legal principles, even conelusionally, to the particular facts or defendants of his case or to the district court\u2019s grounds for dismissing his action. He has thus waived the issues relevant to his appeal by failing to brief them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(5th Cir.1987) (noting that the \u201crecitation of familiar rules ... without even the slightest identification of any error\u201d is the same as if the plaintiff has not appealed the judgment). His appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Because this appeal is frivolous, it counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), just as the dismissal of the underlying action did. See <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Jones is warned that if he accumulates one more strike by bringing another frivolous action or appeal he will not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action while incarcerated or detained unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
