Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2374, 185 L.Ed.2d 1091 (2013). In <em>Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d at 412, this court, relying upon its holding in <em>United States v. Joslin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 139, 141-43 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1847, 185 L.Ed.2d 851 (2013), rejected the argument that the Texas offense of \u201cburglary of a habitation\u201d is outside the generic, contemporary definition of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because it defines the \u201cowner\u201d of a habitation as a person with a \u201cgreater right to possession.\u201d Accordingly, the appellant\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
