Nowlin\u2019s assertions that he was not seeking mandamus relief, that the district court should have construed his petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, and that the district court should have filed and considered his mandamus petition as part of case number 4:04-CV-949-Y based on newly discovered evidence are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. Nowlin is WARNED that any future frivolous filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
