Scott appeals the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of his complaint based on a finding that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing his \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">Pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement is mandatory, and unexhausted claims may not be brought in court. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Generally, a prisoner\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense under the PLRA and prisoners \u201care not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910. However, we have interpreted <em>Jones </em>to allow a district court to sua sponte dismiss a case for failure to state a claim, predicated on failure to exhaust, \u201cif the complaint itself makes clear that the prisoner failed to exhaust.\u201d <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">We note that Scott\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint admitted that he had not filed a Step 2 request. However, Scott also made various arguments that his administrative remedies should be considered unavailable and deemed exhausted. For example, he argued that prison officials deliberately ignored his Step 1 request or placed it in a \u201cbacklog\u201d status. <em>See Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150, 154-55 (5th Cir.1982). In addition, the record does not contain a copy of the ARP procedures that the prison required inmates to follow, which is relevant to Scott\u2019s claim that officials failed to inform inmates that they could proceed with a Step 2 request if there was no timely response to their Step 1 request. <em>See Torns v. Miss. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>301 Fed.Appx. 386, 389 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-24\">In sum, we conclude that Scott\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies was not \u201cclear\u201d on the face of the complaint. Therefore, the district court\u2019s sua sponte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>dismissal is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for service on the defendants and subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
