He concedes this claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), and raises it only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Concerning Hoover\u2019s numerous challenges to his sentence, and although post-<em>Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). As with his challenge to his conviction, Hoover concedes that several of his challenges to his sentence are also foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">First, Hoover asserts the district court erred in determining his prior conviction for burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a) was a violent felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He contends the indictment charged him with the burglary offense in a manner incorporating Texas\u2019 unique \u201cgreater right of possession\u201d theory and that this overly broad definition of burglary is not a generic burglary under the ACCA. Hoover concedes this claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2374, 185 L.Ed.2d 1091 (2013), but he raises it to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Second, Hoover contends the court erred in determining his prior conviction for evading arrest with a motor vehicle under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.04(a) was a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. In <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>our court held that Texas offense was a violent felony under the ACCA because \u201cfleeing by vehicle poses a serious risk of injury to others\u201d. 568 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court, in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>subsequently held an Indiana conviction for resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight was a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2272, 2277, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (noting the Court\u2019s decision is consistent with <em>Harrimon). </em>And, our court has held <em>Sykes </em>did not overrule <em>Harrimon, </em>either explicitly or implicitly. <em>E.g., United States v. Standberry, </em>546 Fed.Appx. 381, 382, 2013 WL 5976454, at *1 (5th Cir. April 23, 2013) (holding <em>Sykes </em>\u2018focus on use of motor vehicle did not overrule Harrimon). Therefore, we are bound by <em>Harrimon. United States v. Holston, </em>471 Fed.Appx. 308, 309 (5th Cir.2012). Thus, the district court did not err in determining Hoover\u2019s evading-arrest-with-a-motor-vehicle conviction was a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Third, because the factual basis for ACCA sentencing enhancements was used to raise the statutory maximum sentence applicable to him, Hoover asserts these facts must be charged in the indictment and either proved to a jury or admitted by him. Hoover concedes this claim is foreclosed, and raises it only to preserve it for possible further review. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 213-14, n. 8, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (holding categorical approach to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony for ACCA purposes \u201craises no Sixth Amendment issue\u201d); <em>see also United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>(5th Cir.2006) (\u201c \u2018[Njeither the [ACCA] nor the Constitution requires a jury finding on the existence of the three previous felony convictions required for the enhancement\u2019 \u201d.) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Fourth, Hoover claims \u00a7\u00a7 924(e)(1) and (e)(2)(B)(ii) (the residual clause), which provide for a sentence enhancement on a prior conviction that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d are unconstitutionally void for vagueness. In <em>James, </em>the Supreme Court observed this residual clause \u201cis not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits\u201d. <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (citation omitted). Therefore, Hoover\u2019s claim is foreclosed by <em>James. United States v. Gore, </em>636 F.3d 728, 742 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
