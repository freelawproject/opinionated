No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (1966). Garriga invoked federal jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 704; the Declaratory Judgment Act (\u201cDJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201; and the federal question statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district court dismissed Garriga\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on two alternative grounds. First, the district court concluded that the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), barred its jurisdiction over discretionary decisions made under Chapter 12, Subchapter II of Title 8, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 to 1378, and because the CAA was codified as a historical note to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, the INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>discretionary decision bar applied. Second, the district court determined that the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, barred judicial review of decisions committed to agency discretion by law, and that the CAA gave the Attorney General such discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Maradiaga v. United States, </em>679 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see also Mejia Rodriguez v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>562 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2009) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over an alien\u2019s complaint requesting review of a US CIS action). \u201cPassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal.\u201d <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Under the APA, \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. The APA further states that \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court [is] subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. \u00a7 704. A reviewing court shall \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed\u201d and set aside agency actions found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d Id. \u00a7 706(1), (2)(A). However, the APA does not apply to the extent that \u201cstatutes preclude judicial review\u201d or \u201cagency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 701(a)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Section 245 of the INA governs adjustment of status applications. INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. It specifies that the Attorney General<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has discretion to adjust an alien\u2019s status if the alien applies for adjustment, is eligible to receive an immigrant visa, and is admissible for permanent residence. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). The CAA, codified as a historical note to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">That, notwithstanding the provisions of section 245(c) of the [INA], ... the status of any alien who is a native or citizen of Cuba and who has been inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States subsequent to January 1, 1959 and has been physically present in the United States for at least one year, may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien makes an application for such adjustment, and the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">CAA, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161, \u00a7 1 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, historical note).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Section 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1255 of this title, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchap-ter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i)-(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (2) (B) (i)-(ii). The language \u201cspecified under this subchapter\u201d refers to Chapter 12, Subchapter II of Title 8, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 to 1378. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1361 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">On appeal, Garriga argues that the district court had jurisdiction to review his complaint because INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), by its plain language, only applies to actions \u201cthe authority for which is specified under [Chapter 12, Subchapter II of Title 8, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 to 1378],\u201d and the CAA is not part of Subchapter II because it is codified as a historical note to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not reach this issue, however, because we conclude that the district court correctly determined in the alternative that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the APA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). The APA specifies that it does not apply to agency action that is committed to agency discretion by law, and the CAA expressly states that the Attorney General may, \u201cin his discretion,\u201d adjust any Cuban national\u2019s status if that alien meets certain requirements. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2); CAA, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161, \u00a7 1 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, historical note). USCIS clearly stated in its decision that it was denying Garriga\u2019s application \u201cas a matter of discretion\u201d because he showed a lack of good moral character. Because USCIS\u2019s action in Garriga\u2019s adjustment application is committed to agency discretion by the CAA, the APA does not provide the district court with jurisdiction. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2); CAA, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161, \u00a7 1 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, historical note). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Garriga\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"A7c\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. In the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, \u00a7 451, 116 Stat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002) (codified at 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 271), USCIS assumed the functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 also specified that any function transferred under the act \"shall be deemed to refer to the Secretary, other official, or component of the Department to which such function is so transferred.\u201d 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 557. Thus, references to the Attorney General refer to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\">. Garriga also makes passing reference to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under the federal question statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and the DJA. However, we will not address whether those statutes provide jurisdiction because Garriga made only passing reference to them in his initial brief on appeal. <em>See Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1145 (\u201cPassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
