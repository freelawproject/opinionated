The district court sentenced him to a total of 168 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Over one year later, Bautista filed in district court a pro se motion for an extension of time in which to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. His motion was not accompanied by a \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court denied that motion for an extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-21\">In this court, Bautista has filed a motion seeking leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, a motion requesting correction of the record, and an appellate brief. The district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Bautista\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>203 F.3d 162, 163 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Bautista\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED, and his motions for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and for correction of the record are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
