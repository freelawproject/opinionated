This appeal involves whether Florida\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law bars Picon\u2019s tort action against her employer. After careful review, we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the employer and reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">As explained later, Florida case law provides that, in certain circumstances, an employer, when sued by an injured employee, may be estopped from asserting the affirmative defense of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Because the central issue here is estoppel, we review what happened before the employee brought this tort lawsuit against her former employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">A. Picon\u2019s September 2011 Right Shoulder Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">Plaintiff Elizabeth Picon (\u201cPicon\u201d) worked for defendant Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. (\u201cGallagher\u201d) from December 31, 1991 until September 25, 2012. In September 2011, Picon first noticed pain in her right shoulder. The condition became worse, resulting in a loss of motion. By February 2, 2012, Picon considered the shoulder pain debilitating. Picon went to a doctor who diagnosed Picon\u2019s problem as tendonitis and informed Picon that the condition resulted from \u201cworking on the computer at her desk.\u201d Another doctor, who evaluated Picon several months later, believed that Picon\u2019s shoulder pain resulted from \u201crepetitive use of a mouse and the computer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>B. Picon\u2019s February 2012 Workers\u2019 Compensation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Gallagher had a workers\u2019 compensation policy that, pursuant to Florida workers\u2019 compensation law, covered bodily injury to an employee as a result of injuries or disease arising out of work performed in the course and scope of employment. On February 3, 2012, Picon and Gallagher reported her shoulder pain to Gallagher\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier (the \u201cinsurer\u201d). Gallagher\u2019s insurer began paying for Picon\u2019s medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">C. Insurer Paid Medical Benefits from February to August 2012</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Gallagher referred Picon to Concentra, a physical therapy clinic. Picon attended approximately 20 physical therapy sessions. This treatment did not alleviate Picon\u2019s pain. On March 7, 2012, Picon underwent an MRI and saw an orthopedist, Dr. Eliot Lang who diagnosed Picon as suffering from right shoulder adhesive capsulitis. Dr. Lang gave Picon a cortisone injection in the right shoulder and referred Picon to a surgeon, Dr. David Font-Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Picon saw Dr. Font-Rodriguez on June 12, 2012 and again three weeks later. Dr. Font-Rodriguez agreed with Dr. Lang\u2019s diagnosis of right shoulder adhesive capsu-litis, which he called \u201cfrozen shoulder.\u201d Dr. Font-Rodriguez discussed with Picon \u201c[operative and nonoperative treatment options ... along with risks and benefits of each choice, and realistic expectations of each.\u201d Dr. Font-Rodriguez\u2019s notes stated: (1) \u201c[Picon] will proceed with surgery as soon as she is medically cleared, and approved by the w/c carrier;\u201d and (2) \u201cthe carrier is asking her Rheumatologist if her condition is preexisting or related to a rheumatologic problem, clearly which it is not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Dr. Font-Rodriguez completed a \u201cFlorida Workers\u2019 Compensation Uniform Medical Treatment/Status Reporting Form,\u201d but did not answer the specific questions about whether Picon\u2019s shoulder injury was work-related and whether there was more than one contributing cause of the injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Font-Rodriguez did write \u201cneeds surgery ASAP! ... medication ... no use of right arm (light duty) ... no use of right arm ... no repetitive use ... no longer hours at work ... no driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">On July 25, 2012, Dr. Font-Rodriguez did send to Gallagher\u2019s senior claims representative, Jennifer Roth, a document stating: \u201csee 7/5/12 Adhesive capsulitis [a]s a condition is not caused by Diabetes, nor Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Most often it is secondary to trauma to affected area (injury, surgery, etc.) sometimes its idiopathic in origin (of unknown etiology).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">D.August 2012 Independent Medical Examination of Picon\u2019s Shoulder</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Gallagher requested that Picon undergo an \u201cindependent\u201d medical examination. Dr. Randall D. Blinn, a certified orthopedic surgeon, physically examined her, reviewed her 2006-2012 medical records, and prepared a report, dated August 23, 2012. Dr. Blinn\u2019s report stated that: (1) Picon\u2019s ability to move her right shoulder was \u201cstill severely limited with internal and external rotation which are both very painful;\u201d and (2) \u201cI do believe that this individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ual\u2019s problem with the right shoulder is most probably because of patient disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Dr. Blinn wrote that among the possible explanations for Picon\u2019s pain were: \u201cthe fact that she is a diabetic female in her sixth decade of life and the fact that she does have a collagen vascular disease and a history of chest pain.\u201d In Dr. Blinn\u2019s opinion, \u201c[i]t is not reasonable to state that using a mouse or a computer at a workstation in a repetitive fashion is the reason for this persons [sic] right shoulder problem.\u201d Dr. Blinn labeled Picon\u2019s case \u201cas an idiopathic case of frozen right shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Dr. Blinn did \u201cnot believe that any further treatment is necessary regarding the right shoulder under the workers\u2019 compensation date of accident of 2/2/2012.\u201d Dr. Blinn advised that \u201c[n]o restrictions are necessary regarding the same\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no impairment rating regarding the right shoulder and the February 2, 2012 date of accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">A. Picon\u2019s August 2012 Workers\u2019 Compensation Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">On August 13, 2012, Picon, through counsel, filed a \u201cpetition for workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d with the Division\u2019s Office of the Judges of Compensation Claims naming both Gallagher and its insurer. Picon\u2019s petition requested \u201cAuthorization for surgery as prescribed by Dr. Rodriguez Font [sic] on 6/18/12 (right shoulder manipulation)\u201d and \u201cAuthorization for a PCP to do the pre-ops as prescribed by Dr. Rodriguez-Font [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">B. The Insurer Does Not Authorize Surgery and Discontinues Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Under Florida law, Gallagher\u2019s insurer had 14 days to: (1) \u201ceither pay the requested benefits without prejudice to its right to deny within 120 days from receipt of the petition\u201d; or (2) \u201cfile a response to petition.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.192(8). However, the insurer did not pay for the surgery and did not file a response to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">On August 27, 2012, Picon\u2019s attorney contacted Gallagher\u2019s attorney \u201cand inquired whether surgery would be authorized.\u201d That same day, Gallagher\u2019s attorney responded by attaching Dr. Blinn\u2019s report and writing: (1) \u201cDr. Blinn ... indicates your client\u2019s shoulder condition is unrelated to her work activities\u201d; and (2) Gallagher\u2019s insurer \u201cwill not authorize the shoulder manipulation prescribed by Dr. Font-Rodriguez.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">That same day, Gallagher\u2019s Roth sent an email to an employee at Dr. Font-Rodriguez\u2019s office stating: \u201cBased upon our 8.23.12 IME with Dr. Blinn, surgery will not be authorized under workers\u2019 compensation. Please note that no further shoulder treatment will be authorized as Dr. Blinn did not feel her shoulder complaints were related to her job duties.\u201d Dr. Font-Rodriguez\u2019s employee sent this message on to Picon, writing: \u201cSorry this is the answer I received today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">C. Picon\u2019s September 2012 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">Thereafter, on September 17, 2012, Pi-con filed a complaint in state court alleging that Gallagher had acted negligently and that \u201c[o]ver the course of her employment between 1991 and February 2, 2012, the Plaintiff suffered on-the-job injuries during the work she performed as a consequence of the aforesaid negligence of the Defendant.\u201d Gallagher removed the ease to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">D. Picon\u2019s September 2012 Withdrawal of Workers\u2019 Compensation Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">On September 25, 2012, Picon voluntarily dismissed her workers\u2019 compensation petition. Picon\u2019s attorney stated that Pi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>con did so \u201c[r]elying upon the position taken by Gallagher Bassett that Ms. Pi-con\u2019s shoulder injury was not related to her employment.\u201d Picon paid for and underwent surgeries on her right shoulder on October 1, 2012 and November 26, 2012. Dr. Font-Rodriguez performed these surgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">After discovery, Gallagher filed a motion for summary judgment. Gallagher argued that Picon\u2019s negligence claim was barred by workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Specifically, Gallagher reasoned that: (1) Picon was its employee at all relevant times; (2) it maintained a workers\u2019 compensation liability insurance policy; and (3) Picon\u2019s sole vehicle to \u201cchallenge Dr. Blinn\u2019s finding is the workers\u2019 compensation court and a ruling by a Judge of Compensation Claims in her favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In opposition, Picon argued that summary judgment was inappropriate because Gallagher was estopped from asserting workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Picon reasoned that estoppel applied because: (1) Gallagher denied her surgery claim on the basis that her condition was \u201cunrelated to her work activities\u201d; and (2) Picon acted in reliance on Gallagher\u2019s position that her condition was \u201cunrelated to her work activities\u201d by bringing a tort claim, dismissing her workers\u2019 compensation petition, and paying for the necessary medical procedures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The district court granted Gallagher\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that under Florida law, workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity barred Picon\u2019s negligence claim. Picon appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">IV. APPLICABLE FLORIDA LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">In this diversity case, we apply the law of the forum state, Florida. <em>See James River Ins. Co. v. Ground Down Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1270, 1274 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">Under Florida law, when an individual suffers an accidental compensable injury \u201carising out of work performed in the course and scope of employment,\u201d the individual\u2019s employer must provide compensation for that injury or furnish the benefits through a workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.09(1). The workers\u2019 compensation system is the employee\u2019s only means of pursuing claims against her employer for injuries \u201carising out of work performed in the course and scope of employment,\u201d <em>see id., </em>subject to two narrow statutory exceptions, neither of which applies here. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.11(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">We review eight Florida appellate decisions that discuss the estoppel doctrine in an employee\u2019s lawsuit where the employer raised workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity as an affirmative defense. We then apply that Florida law in those decisions to Pi-con\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>A. <em>Elliott v. Dugger </em>(Fla. 1st DCA 1989)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In <em>Elliott v. Dugger, </em>542 So.2d 392 (Fla. 1st DCA 1989), the plaintiffs Robert Elliott (an employee at a state prison) and his wife sued the Florida Department of Corrections\u2019s Secretary and others for negligence after Mr. Elliott \u201cingested blood serum contaminated with the AIDS virus while on duty\u201d at a prison. <em>Id. </em>at 392-93. The Elliotts\u2019 complaint alleged that \u201cRobert Elliott was denied a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the basis that the infection of the positive serum did not arise \u2018naturally or unavoidably as a result of his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In their answer, the defendants \u201craised the affirmative defense of the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response, the Elliotts argued that the defendants were \u201cestopped from asserting the exclusivity defense on the basis that \u2018[p]laintiff timely filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits; his claim was denied by the state of Florida; plaintiff detrimentally and in reliance thereon instituted the subject action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Later on, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. <em>Id. </em>at 393. In response, the plaintiffs submitted Mr. Elliott\u2019s testimony stating that \u201chis claim for benefits was denied in a letter which he subsequently received in which it was stated that there were no benefits due under his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Elliotts were not able to locate that letter. <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Elliotts argued that \u201cthere were material issues of fact existing as to whether [the defendants] [are] estopped from raising the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as a defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Reversing, the First District Court of Appeal explained that \u201c[s]ummary judgment is particularly unsuitable in a case where the facts and circumstances indicate the possibility of an estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Florida appellate court declined to \u201cconstrue the meaning of the alleged <em>representation made by [the defendants] that no benefits were due claimant.\u201d Id. </em>at 394 (emphasis added). The court said that \u201crepresentation could have meant, for instance, either that the Department of Corrections was of the opinion that there had yet been no injury shown, or that it had taken the position that Elliott had no right to claim benefits because the injury was not a covered injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court went on that \u201cif [the defendants] denied workers\u2019 compensation coverage on the basis that Robert Elliott\u2019s alleged injury was not encompassed within the Act or on the basis that he was injured under other situations not covered by the Act, the Elliotts were free to pursue common law remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, summary judgment was inappropriate, in light of the existence of \u201cgenuine issues of material fact concerning the issue of estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, that factual issue was what was the employer\u2019s given reason for denying the workers\u2019 compensation claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">B. <em>Byerley v. Citrus Publishing, Inc. </em>(Fla. 5th DCA 1999)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Next was <em>Byerley v. Citrus Publishing, Inc., </em>725 So.2d 1230 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>where an employee, Audrey Byerley, sued her employer, Citrus Publishing, for negligence after she sustained injuries from tripping over a bench located on Citrus Publishing\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 1231. Ms. Byerley had \u201cpunched out for the day\u201d when the accident occurred. <em>Id. </em>The accident caused Ms. Byerley to suffer \u201ca compression fracture of the vertebrae in her back, pull[] her right groin muscle, frac-turen her left kneecap, and suffer[] numerous abrasions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHer total medical bills exceeded $30,000.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Ms. Byerley first \u201cfiled a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits which was denied by the employer and its workers\u2019 compensation carrier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Citrus Publishing did not pay any portion of Ms. Byer-ley\u2019s $30,000 medical bills or otherwise pay her workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cThe notice of denial stated: \u2018Injury did not arise out [of] the course and scope of [Byerley\u2019s] employment. Employee was clocked out and had exited the building, when she tripped over a bench on the pavement.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (alterations in original). After Ms. Byerley filed her tort complaint, the employer moved for summary judgment, asserting that \u201cByerley\u2019s exclusive remedy was worker\u2019s compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted summary judgment for the employer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Reversing, the Fifth District Court of Appeal reasoned that Citrus Publishing \u201ccreated a Hobson\u2019s choice for Byerley: the employer, through its insurance carrier, denied her claim for workers\u2019 compensation, and then, when Byerley elected to proceed in a tort action, argued that she could not sue because her exclusive remedy was the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that \u201cit would be inequitable for an employer to deny worker\u2019s compensation coverage on the ground that the employee\u2019s injury did not arise out of the course and scope of employment, then later claim immunity from a tort suit on the ground that the injury <em>did </em>arise out of the course and scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The Florida court reasoned that: (1) the employer had informed Ms. Byerley that it was denying her claim \u201cbecause it did not occur in the course and scope of her employment\u201d; (2) Ms. Byerley had \u201caccepted and relied on the denial, bore her medical expenses, then sued the employer in tort as permitted by the statute\u201d; and (3) the \u201celements of estoppel are shown\u201d and the employer was not entitled to summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">C. <em>Tractor Supply Co. v. Kent </em>(Fla. 5th DCA 2007)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">The third case, <em>Tractor Supply Co. v. Kent, </em>966 So.2d 978 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007), involved an employee, Kent, who worked for Tractor Supply Co. (\u201cTSC\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 979. Kent alleged that, while at work, he was exposed to hydrated lime dust, which can cause lung injuries and aggravate breathing disorders. <em>Id. </em>Kent filed a petition for benefits through the workers\u2019 compensation system, and his employer\u2019s insurer denied the claim, stating the condition complained of: (1) \u201cwas the result of a pre-existing medical condition and not the result of employment with TSC\u201d; and (2) \u201cwas the result of a prior worker\u2019s compensation claim that had been settled for continuing treatment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">Kent initially pursued remedies through the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>Id. </em>After discovery in that forum and just before mediation, Kent voluntarily dismissed his workers\u2019 compensation petition and filed a complaint in state court against TSC. <em>Id. </em>The workers\u2019 compensation claim thus \u201cwas withdrawn before it was adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>In the tort case, Kent moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether TSC was estopped from asserting workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity as an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted Kent\u2019s motion and TSC appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Reversing, the Fifth District Court of Appeal framed the issue as: whether the <em>Byerley </em>and <em>Elliott </em>decisions \u201cestablish that an employer such as TSC, who, through its comp carrier, denies a worker\u2019s compensation claim on the basis that the injury or illness was pre-existing, is then estopped from asserting worker\u2019s compensation immunity and exclusivity in defending against a civil tort action[?]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978 (footnote omitted). The Florida appellate court held that they do not. <em>Id. </em>at 980-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Florida appellate court read <em>Byer-ley </em>narrowly, stating that <em>\u201cByerley </em>holds that expressly asserting that an injury did not occur in the scope and course of employment estops the employer from defending a subsequent tort action on the ground that the claim arose in the course and scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Importantly, \u201c[i]t is not simply the denial, but rather the irreconcilable positions asserted, that led to the result in <em>Byerley.\u201d Id. </em>The irreconcilable position in <em>Byerley </em>was the insurer claimed Ms. Byerley\u2019s fall injury did not occur in the course and scope of her employment but later asserted workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity when she sued. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In contrast, in <em>Kent, </em>the Florida appellate court explained, TSC\u2019s insurer \u201cdid not assert that no employment relationship existed or that the incident occurred outside the scope of employment. Rather, the denial asserts that under the terms of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, the injury is one which is not deemed compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Florida appellate court explained that \u201c[t]here is no irreconcilable conflict in the employer here raising a pre-existing medical condition defense to a comp claim, but asserting it is, nevertheless, insulated from a civil suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 981. To the extent that Kent objected to the insurer\u2019s determination, the court held that \u201cKent could and should have litigated the defense of pre-existing injury/illness in the comp action\u201d as \u201c[a] pre-existing injury or illness is a recognized defense to a claim for comp benefits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">D. <em>Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. v. Mon-tiel </em>(Fla. 2d DCA 2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Shortly thereafter, Florida\u2019s Second District Court of Appeal decided <em>Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. v. Montiel, </em>985 So.2d 19 (Fla. 2d DCA 2008), the fourth case we review. In <em>Montiel, </em>the plaintiff \u201csuffered a back injury while unloading Coca-Cola products at a Tampa Kash N\u2019 Karry store.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. The appellate court stated that \u201c[ujnquestionably, the injury occurred in the course and scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Monteil\u2019s employer, Coca-Cola, \u201cpaid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to him for twelve weeks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Coca-Cola stopped doing so upon receipt of medical evidence indicating \u201cthat Mr. Monteil\u2019s condition no longer related to his work injury, but to a degenerative condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Monteil \u201cdid not claim further benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation statute\u201d and instead \u201csued Coca-Cola and Kash N\u2019 Karry for negligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">In the negligence action, Coca-Cola sought summary judgment on the basis of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. The trial court denied the summary judgment after the plaintiff argued that \u201cthe denial of further benefits estopped Coca-Cola from claiming workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Reversing, the Florida appellate court pointed out that, unlike in <em>Elliott </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Byerley, </em>\u201cMr. Monteil\u2019s injury was work-related. Coca-Cola never contended otherwise. Coca-Cola paid benefits for approximately three months. Indeed, Coca-Cola denied further benefits only when medical evidence indicated Mr. Monteil\u2019s condition no longer related to his work injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that it was not aware of a \u201cstatutory provision that, under these circumstances, strips the employer of the exclusivity defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHad Mr. Monteil thought himself entitled to further benefits,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthe statute provided a vehicle to seek relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.192 (\u201cAny employee may, for any benefit that is ripe, due, and owing, file with the Office of the Judges of Compensation Claims a petition for benefits which meets the requirements of this section and the definition of specificity in \u00a7 440.02.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">E. <em>Schroeder v. Peoplease Corp. </em>(Fla. 1st DCA 2009)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Our fifth case is <em>Schroeder v. Peoplease Corp., </em>18 So.3d 1165 (Fla. 1st DCA 2009), where plaintiff Schroeder, a truck driver, worked for Peoplease Corp. <em>Id. </em>at 1166. Schroeder was injured when he attempted to manually move a 2,000 pound load within his trailer causing the onset of heart problems and the need for emergency heart surgery. <em>Id. </em>Schroeder filed a workers\u2019 compensation petition. <em>Id. </em>\u201cPeo-please controverted the entire claim and filed a notice of denial which\u201d gave six reasons for denying the claim. <em>Id. </em>One of the reasons was \u201c[t]he present condition of claimant is not the result of injury arising out of and in the course and scope of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The other reasons related to whether a causal connection existed between Schroeder\u2019s work and his condition and whether his injury was a compensable one under the statute. <em>Id. </em>It was undisputed that Peoplease had paid no benefits, either medical or lost wages, since Schroeder\u2019s injury in 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">After the denial, Schroeder commenced a civil action against, <em>inter alia, </em>Peoplease and argued that, given its denial, Peo-please could not assert workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity as an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 1165-66. Peoplease sought summary judgment on the basis of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Peoplease filed an affidavit of its insurer\u2019s adjuster stating that the intent of the denial notice was \u201cneither to assert a lack of an employment relationship nor to allege that Mr. Schroeder\u2019s incident occurred outside the scope of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1167. Instead, the intent of the denial notice \u201cwas to dispute that Mr. Schroder\u2019s injury was compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state trial court granted summary judgment for Peoplease. The Schroeders appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 1167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Reversing, the First District Court of Appeal concluded that the case was akin to <em>Byerley </em>and <em>Elliott. </em>The employer, Peo-please tried to distinguish <em>Byerley </em>by arguing that in that case \u201cit was clear that the employee was not in the course and scope of employment because she had \u2018clocked out and had exited the building, when she tripped over a bench.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1169. The <em>Schroeder </em>court rejected the employer\u2019s argument that \u201cwhen the facts make clear that the employee suffered a workplace incident, then estoppel will never apply despite what the employee and carrier may have said in the notice of denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, like in <em>Elliott, </em>\u201cthere remain disputed issues of material fact as to the meaning of the language employed in the notice of denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1170. The court pointed out that \u201c[sjummary judgment is inappropriate where the wording of a document is ambiguous and interpretation involves questions of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c[wjhether estoppel is appropriate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>this case and whether the employer took irreconcilable positions is dependent upon the meaning to be accorded the notice of denial,\u201d the court reversed and remanded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">F. <em>Coastal Masonry, Inc. v. Gutierrez </em>(Fla. 3d DCA 2010)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Our sixth case is <em>Coastal Masonry, Inc. v. Gutierrez, </em>30 So.3d 545 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010), where the plaintiff, Gutierrez, was injured while \u201clifting concrete blocks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. Gutierrez filed a petition for workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer, Coastal Masonry, and the employer\u2019s insurer denied the claim \u201cin its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was \u201cundisputed that Coastal [Masonry] paid no benefits to Gutierrez.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The notice of denial gave several reasons, specifically: (1) \u201c[t]he claimant did not report the alleged injury to the employer in a timely manner\u201d; (2) <em>\u201c[t]he present condition of the claimant is not the result of an injury by accident arising out of and in the course and scope of employment\u201d; </em>(3) \u201c[t]here is no accident or occupational disease\u201d; (4) \u201c[t]he condition complained of is not the result of an injury\u201d; (5) \u201c[t]he claimant\u2019s medical condition is the result of a pre-existing condition or disease\u201d; and (6) \u201c[t]he claimant\u2019s medical condition is personal, preexisting and/or idiopathic in nature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">After receiving the notice of denial, Gutierrez \u201cvoluntarily dismissed his petition and filed a negligence action against Coastal [Masonry].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gutierrez\u2019s complaint alleged \u201cthat Coastal [Masonry] had denied his workers\u2019 compensation claim on the basis that the accident and injuries did not arise out of his employment and were not covered by workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Coastal Masonry admitted this allegation \u201cand further denied that Gutierrez was a Coastal [Masonry] employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cNotwithstanding [this] denial ..., Coastal [Masonry] denied that it had waived workers\u2019 compensation immunity and further asserted that immunity as an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Later, Coastal Masonry moved for summary judgment on the basis of workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity and the trial court denied the motion and found that Coastal Masonry was estopped as a matter of law from asserting the defense. <em>Id. </em>Coastal Masonry appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Affirming, the Third District Court of Appeal held that \u201cthe record shows that Coastal [Masonry] has taken inconsistent positions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. Specifically, it had \u201cdenied Gutierrez\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits stating that \u2018[t]he present condition of the claimant is not the result of an injury by accident arising out of and in the course and scope of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, Coastal Masonry \u201casserted as an affirmative defense that it was entitled to the exclusivity defense because the accident arose in the course and scope of Gutierrez\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellate court pointed out that Coastal Masonry\u2019s summary judgment position was inconsistent with the position it took in the workers\u2019 compensation forum and in its own answer in the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Having determined that the employer took inconsistent positions, the Florida appellate court next turned to \u201cwhether, as a matter of law, Coastal [Masonry] is es-topped from raising a workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court explained that the elements of estoppel are: (1) \u201ca representation by the party estopped to the party claiming the estop-pel as to some material fact, which representation is contrary to the condition of affairs later asserted by the estopped party\u201d; (2) \u201creliance upon this representation by the party claiming the estoppel\u201d; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(3) \u201ca change in the position of the party claiming the estoppel to his detriment, caused by the representation and his reliance thereon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The court determined that \u201cthe record established the elements of estoppel\u201d as Gutierrez \u201c(1) dismissed the worker\u2019s compensation claim; (2) incurred medical expenses; and (3) filed a negligence action to recover damages resulting from his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that estoppel applied as a matter of law to bar Coastal Masonry\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">G. <em>Mena v. J.I.L Construction Group Corp. </em>(Fla. 4th DCA 2012)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Next, we turn to <em>Mena v. J.I.L. Construction Group Corp., </em>79 So.3d 219 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012). The plaintiff, Mena, \u201cwhile constructing a home, ... fell to the ground from a second-floor roof truss\u201d and \u201csustained multiple injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221. Mena filed workers\u2019 compensation claims with his employer (\u201cJ.I.L.\u201d) and the subcontractor (\u201cSlorp\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 222. Both companies denied the claims. <em>Id. </em>Slorp\u2019s notice of denial stated that \u201cMena was employed by J.I.L., not Slorp.\u201d <em>Id. </em>JJ.L.\u2019s notice of denial said: (1) \u201cThere is no employer/employee relationship established\u201d; (2) \u201cFailure to report injury timely\u201d; (3) \u201cThe Employer/Carrier/Servicing Agent reserves the right to these and any other defenses that may become apparent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Eight months later, Mena voluntarily dismissed his workers\u2019 compensation petitions and \u201cfiled suit against J.I.L. and Slorp for negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both defendants asserted workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity as affirmative defenses. <em>Id. </em>When defendants moved for summary judgment, \u201cMena argued that J.I.L. and Slorp should be estopped from asserting worker\u2019s compensation exclusivity because of their previous denials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants, \u201cfinding that their previous \u2018general denials\u2019 were not inconsistent with their claims of entitlement to worker\u2019s compensation immunity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Reversing as to defendant J.I.L., the Fourth District Court of Appeal explained that when \u201cthe language employed in the notice of denial could give rise to more than one interpretation, such that it cannot be fairly determined whether the employer\u2019s positions are inconsistent, summary judgment is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. The court applied this principle to the case, noting that \u201cJ.I.L\u2019s denial suggested it was asserting that Mena was not its employee. At the very least, ... the meaning of the language employed in the notice of denial is unclear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Because \u201cissues of material fact remain with respect to whether J.I.L. asserted inconsistent positions and whether it should be estopped from claiming it is entitled to worker\u2019s compensation immunity,\u201d the court reversed \u201cthe entry of summary judgment in favor of J.I.L.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">On the other hand, the Florida appellate court affirmed summary judgment in favor of Slorp. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24. The court observed that \u201cSlorp maintained consistent positions in the worker\u2019s compensation forum and in Mena\u2019s civil action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, \u201cSlorp denied Mena\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation claim on the basis that Mena was employed by J.I.L. not Slorp, and that J.I.L. had coverage. Slorp\u2019s affirmative defense of worker\u2019s compensation immunity stated that Mena was acting in the course and scope of employment performing work subcontracted by Slorp to J.I.L.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>H. <em>Ocean Reef Club, Inc. v. Wilczewski </em>(Fla. 3d DCA 2012)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Most recently, in <em>Ocean Reef Club, Inc. v. Wilczewski, </em>99 So.3d 1 (Fla. 3d DCA 2012), two former employees (Wilczewski and Leon) of a beauty salon alleged that they were exposed to chemical fumes while at work, and as a result, had suffered \u201casthma-like symptoms, headaches and respiratory problems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The employees notified their employer of their injuries, but the beauty salon owner, Ocean Reef, did not notify its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. <em>Id. </em>The employees \u201cbrought a civil action for damages against Ocean Reef\u2019 at which point Ocean Reef \u201cnotified the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier of the claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The insurer \u201cdenied the claims contending that the illnesses did not occur in the course and scope of employment\u201d and noting that \u201cthe statute of limitations had run.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In the employees\u2019 civil action, Ocean Reef moved for summary judgment \u201carguing that Wilczewski\u2019s and Leon\u2019s injuries were work-related, and that, based on workers\u2019 compensation immunity, it was immune from suit as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The trial court denied the motion and Ocean Reef appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Affirming, the Third District Court of Appeal held that, as a matter of law, Ocean Reef was estopped from asserting workers\u2019 compensation immunity. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that because \u201cthe carrier\u2019s denial is absolutely clear on its face that the reason for the denial is \u2018[n]o accident in the course and scope of employment,\u2019 it is \u2018clearly irreconcilable\u2019 with the defense of tort immunity asserted by Ocean Reef.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the carrier\u2019s basis for denying the claim was imputed to the employer, Ocean Reef could not \u201ccontend that the injuries were, in fact, related to work and therefore covered by workers\u2019 compensation when it has clearly denied coverage on inconsistent grounds earlier.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">V. GENUINE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">These decisions make clear that, under Florida law, whether estoppel applies to prevent an employer from asserting the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity defense in a tort action may turn on what reasons were given for denying workers\u2019 compensation benefits. When the record reveals multiple possible explanations for the denial, or the language in the denial document is ambiguous and gives rise to more than one interpretation, issues of material fact exist over whether the employer\u2019s position is inconsistent so as to indicate possible estoppel. <em>See Mena, </em>79 So.3d at 222-23; <em>Schroeder, </em>18 So.3d at 1170; <em>Elliott, </em>542 So.2d at 393-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">That is the case here. Gallagher\u2019s insurer paid Picon workers\u2019 compensation for almost six months as a result of her right shoulder pain, suggesting that Gallagher\u2019s insurer considered the condition work-related. But when Picon requested the surgery recommended by Dr. Font-Rodriguez, Gallagher denied the request, relying on Dr. Blinn\u2019s opinion that her right shoulder problem was not work-related. Gallagher on appeal argues that Dr. Blinn meant only that Picon\u2019s work was not a \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d of her right shoulder pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The communications in the record between Gallagher and Picon or her attorney do not contain the words \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d or otherwise clearly reflect this position. Further, to some extent, Dr. Blinn appeared to focus on medical causation by saying Picon\u2019s injury was due to her age, diabetes, vascular disease, and chest pain, which may make Picon\u2019s problems preexisting.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>On the other hand, Gallagher\u2019s emails, viewed in the light most favorable to Picon, can be construed as denying the existence of an incident occurring in the course and scope of employment. For example, Gallagher\u2019s attorney wrote that Picon\u2019s \u201cshoulder condition is unrelated to her work activities.\u201d Likewise, Gallagher\u2019s senior claims representative Roth wrote that \u201cno further shoulder treatment will be authorized as Dr. Blinn did not feel her shoulder complaints were related to her job duties.\u201d Dr. Blinn himself wrote \u201cit is not reasonable to state that using a mouse or computer at a workstation in a repetitive fashion is the reason for this persons [sic] right shoulder problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We do not conclude that estoppel applies here as a matter of law. We determine only that there were genuine issues of material fact as to what were Gallagher\u2019s reason or reasons for the denial of Picon\u2019s request for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Accordingly, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant Gallagher as a matter of law based on its workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">YI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the grant of summary judgment for the defendant Gallagher and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\">.
