He maintains that the district court wrongly assessed a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his prior Maryland offenses of \u201cassault in the first degree\u201d and \u201cuse of a handgun in a crime of violence and the commission of a felony offense.\u201d The district court concluded that the offenses constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), and a \u201cfirearms offense\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-23\">Arevalo did not object to the 16-level enhancement in the district court. Thus, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). Arevalo must show that the district court committed an error that is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable debate.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009). He also must show that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. If he makes these showings, we have dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>cretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Arevalo argues that neither of his prior Maryland offenses merits a 16-level enhancement. He contends that the Maryland statute proscribing \u201cfirst-degree assault\u201d can be violated in more than one way and that one of the means of commission does not satisfy the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d; he asserts that the state court records do not establish which provision of the statute he violated and, therefore, there is no basis to resolve the appropriateness of the enhancement. Are-valo further contends that his prior Maryland offense of \u201cuse of a handgun in a crime of violence and the commission of a felony offense\u201d does not satisfy the definition of a \u201cfirearms offense\u201d because the Maryland statute, which, inter aha, does not except antique firearms or require that the firearm be operable, is broader than the generic definition of a \u201cfirearms offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The Government argues that both prior offenses merit the enhancement. It asserts that the Maryland offense of \u201cfirst-degree assault\u201d is categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the crime necessarily requires the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person; it argues that the state court records therefore do not need to be reviewed to decide whether the enhancement was properly applied. Moreover, the Government contends that the Maryland offense of \u201cuse of a handgun in a crime of violence and the commission of a felony offense\u201d is a \u201cfirearms offense\u201d; the Government argues that the Maryland statute\u2019s inclusion of antique or inoperable firearms does not render the statute broader than the generic definition of a \u201cfirearms offense.\u201d Alternatively, the Government asserts that the Maryland offense of \u201cuse of a handgun in a crime of violence and the commission of a felony\u201d satisfies the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Neither this court nor any other circuit court has held that, or analyzed whether, the Maryland offenses of \u201cfirst-degree assault\u201d or \u201cuse of a handgun in a crime of violence and the commission of a felony offense\u201d merit a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2. However, as this appeal involves only plain-error review, we need not decide conclusively whether the Maryland offenses satisfy the definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or \u201cfirearms offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. Our review of the parties\u2019 arguments and the law reveals that whether the district court appropriately applied the enhancement is \u201csubject to reasonable debate.\u201d Thus, Arevalo has not shown that any error is clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78. Because Arevalo has failed to show plain error, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
