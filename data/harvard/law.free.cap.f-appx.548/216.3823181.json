After the Department of State (DOS) denied her application, in 2009 Martinez filed this action under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a), which provides for declaratory relief from a final agency determination denying any right or privilege as a national of the United States, upon grounds of citizenship. In November 2012, DOS determined Martinez met her burden of proof to establish her United States citizenship and issued her a passport. As a result, DOS moved to dismiss this action on the grounds that the issuance of the passport mooted Martinez\u2019 claim for a declaration of citizenship under \u00a7 1503(a). Martinez challenges the district court\u2019s granting the dismissal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Martinez contends the district court erred in concluding her action was moot because DOS issued her a passport. She contends that DOS and Border Patrol Agents have the authority to revoke or confiscate a passport without prior notice or hearing. For that reason, she maintains she has a concrete interest in obtaining a declaration of citizenship under \u00a7 1503(a), which will not expire and can only be rescinded or modified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">Dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001). Martinez bears the burden of proof to show jurisdiction exists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">\u201cAn individual who claims a denial of a right or privilege as a national by any department or independent agency may seek a declaration of citizenship under \u00a7 1503(a).\u201d <em>Garcia v. Freeman, </em>No. 12-41458, 542 Fed.Appx. 354, 355, 2013 WL 5670856, at *1 (5th Cir. 18 Oct. 2013) (citation omitted); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a). Actions under \u00a7 1503(a) \u201cmay be instituted only within five years <em>after the final administrative denial </em>of such right or privilege\u201d. <em>Garcia, </em>542 Fed.Appx. at 355, 2013 WL 5670856, at *1 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a)(2) (emphasis added)) (citation omitted). \u201cThe requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Moore v. Hosemann, </em>591 F.3d 741, 744 (5th Cir.2009)). \u201cGenerally, any set of circumstances that eliminates [the] actual controversy after the commencement of a lawsuit renders that action moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(In her reply brief, Martinez concedes she is not asserting that an exception to the mootness doctrine applies.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">\u201cA district court does not have jurisdiction to review claims under \u00a7 1503(a) where plaintiff has not been denied a right or privilege as a national of the United States pursuant to a final administrative determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Martinez has not shown she was denied a right or privilege as a United States na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tional as a result of DOS\u2019 decision to issue her a passport because it may be used as evidence of her citizenship during its period of validity. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Martinez\u2019 contention that she still has a concrete interest in obtaining a declaration of citizenship fails for the same reason the plaintiffs contention in <em>Garcia </em>failed. \u201c[E]ssentially, she seeks an advisory opinion that could be used in the event an official challenges her citizenship in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>DOS issued Martinez a United States passport, and, therefore, she has not been denied a right or privilege of a United States national.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
