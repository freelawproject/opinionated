The district court enhanced Vega\u2019s sentence based upon its finding that his prior California conviction for lewd acts with a child under the age of 14 was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Vega argues that the offense for which he was convicted did not qualify as a crime of violence because the statute under which he was convicted was overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Vega preserved this error; accordingly, we \u201creview the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 278 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In 2001, Vega was convicted under CAL. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 288(a). Consistent with the plain-meaning approach we adopted in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 552 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), his conviction was for the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.2005). Vega cannot, therefore, demonstrate that the district court committed error. <em>See Neal, </em>578 F.3d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Because the above analysis is disposi-tive, we need not address Vega\u2019s arguments related to the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
