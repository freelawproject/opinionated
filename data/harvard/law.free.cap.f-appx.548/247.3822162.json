We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">DF Systems is an electrical contracting company owned and operated by Larry Dorman and his wife, Gladys Dorman. In 2000, DF Systems received a letter from one of its customers, requesting work to be performed by minority contractors. Lorie Dorman Schroder, the Dorman\u2019s daughter, formed E.L. Construction, Inc., in order to meet this request. DF Systems then convened a special board meeting and voted \u201cto advance money to E.L. Construction, Inc. for the [purpose] of getting this corporation started and pursue minority work.\u201d The minutes of this meeting do not establish the amount of money that DF Systems intended to advance to E.L. Construction, an interest rate for the money advanced, a repayment schedule, or any security taken. DF Systems did not enter into a written loan agreement with E.L. Construction, the purported borrower, and did not take an equity interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Unrelated to this transaction, in 2005 DF Systems wrote 19 checks to Jose Padilla, a long-time employee of the company who was forced to stop working due to a terminal illness, and three other checks to Reuben Padilla, Jose Padilla\u2019s son. DF Systems recognized these payments at a special board meeting but did not indicate that the checks were intended to be a loan. There was no written agreement, and the records do not establish a definite amount to be advanced, terms of repayment, interest rate, or collateral provided as a security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"A7u\">On its 2006 federal income tax return, DF Systems claimed a bad-debt deduction of $56,656 related to its payments to E.L. Construction and $25,320 related to its payments to the Padillas. After an audit, the Commissioner disallowed the deductions, concluding that DF Systems failed to establish \u201cthat these amounts were bad debts arising from true debtor-creditor relationships, based upon valid and legally enforceable obligations, that these amounts became worthless during the taxable year, or that you took all reasonable steps to collect the debts.\u201d Based on a disallowance of these deductions, the Commissioner found a tax deficiency in the amount of $30,728.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">DF Systems sought redetermination of the deficiency in the United States Tax Court. Following a trial, the tax court issued its decision. The tax court agreed with the Commissioner that neither of the monetary transfers were bona fide loans because no objective factors indicated that DF Systems had entered into a genuine debtor-creditor relationship with either alleged borrower. In reaching this conclusion, the tax court found Gladys Dorman\u2019s and Lorie Dorman Schroder\u2019s testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the contrary \u201cunconvincing.\u201d The tax court held that DF Systems had an income tax deficiency for the year 2006 in the amount of $30,728.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We review the tax court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Green v. Commissioner, </em>507 F.3d 857, 866 (5th Cir.2007). \u201c[WJhether payments or disbursements by a taxpayer are to be treated as debts for tax purposes is an issue of fact.\u201d <em>Piggy Bank Stations, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>755 F.2d 450, 452 (5th Cir.1985); <em>see also Saunders v. Commissioner, </em>720 F.2d 871, 873 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201cWhether a certain transaction creates a creditor-debtor relationship is a question of <em>fact....\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">A taxpayer may claim a bad-debt deduction under Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code only for a bona fide debt. \u201cA bona fide debt is a debt which arises from a debtor-creditor relationship based upon a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a fixed or determinable sum of money.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.166 \u2014 1(c). In order to determine the existence of bona fide debt, we have considered the following non-exclusive factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">(1) the names given to the certificates evidencing the indebtedness; (2) [t]he presence or absence of a fixed maturity date; (3) [t]he source of payments; (4) [t]he right to enforce payment of principal and interest; (5) participation in management flowing as a result; (6) the status of the contribution in relation to regular corporate creditors; (7) the intent of the parties; (8) \u201cthin\u201d or adequate capitalization; (9) identity of interest between creditor and stockholder; (10) source of interest payments; (11) the ability of the corporation to obtain loans from outside lending institutions; (12) the extent to which the advance was used to acquire capital assets; and (13) the failure of the debtor to repay on the due date or to seek a postponement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4M\"><em>Estate of Mixon, </em>464 F.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">DF Systems attempts to distinguish its situation from other cases applying the <em>Mixon </em>factors. It argues that the tax court\u2019s reliance on precedent \u201caddressing shareholder loans to corporations and loans between interrelated corporations\u201d caused that court to focus too narrowly on the form of the transaction and disregard the evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. <em>See Piggy Bank Stations, Inc., </em>755 F.2d at 452; <em>Texas Farm Bureau, </em>725 F.2d at 311. We agree that some of the factors may not apply to the arrangement with E.L. Construction because its terms were so incomplete. In addition, although DF Systems cites an unpublished decision applying the Ninth Circuit\u2019s shorter, slightly differently-worded list of factors, that list is almost identical in substance to our own and is arguably a good fit here only because it condenses the <em>Mixon </em>factors in a way that better meets the present circumstance. <em>See Todd v. Commissioner, </em>486 Fed.Appx. 423, 426 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Regardless of which list we use to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the transactions between DF Systems and E.L. Construction, nothing about the subsequent dealings between those companies indicates that there was a debtor-creditor relationship. We agree with DF Systems that the absence of a formal loan agreement is not determinative, but the absence of a formal loan agreement is certainly relevant. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>395 F.2d 508, 510-11 (5th Cir.1968). More powerful in our analysis is the purported loan\u2019s lack of real substance. <em>Id. </em>There was no initial fixed or determinable sum to be repaid, specified interest rate, repayment schedule, maturity date, or collateral taken as a security interest. The absence of these objective economic indicia of genuine debt greatly weakens the argument that a debtor-creditor relationship was intended. <em>See Alterman Foods, Inc. v. United States, </em>505 F.2d 873, 879 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">As for DF Systems\u2019 evidence, a notation in the minutes of the special board meeting that \u201cmoney\u201d would be \u201cadvanced\u201d to E.L. Construction does not establish the existence of bona fide debt. Moreover, the numerous debits and credits made under an E.L. Construction account in DF Systems\u2019 accounting records, which vary widely over time and amount, do not prove that E.L. Construction was making repayments on a loan. For instance, the recurring payments made to Chase Automotive Finances and non-corresponding credits from numerous companies, under the heading \u201cjob,\u201d suggest that DF Systems was paying E.L. Construction\u2019s expenses and collecting its revenues. In any event, these records are \u201clittle more than additional declarations of intent\u201d and do little to substantiate DF Systems\u2019 argument that it had a debtor-creditor relationship with E.L. Construction. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the tax court did not err in finding Gladys Dorman\u2019s and Lorie Dorman Schroder\u2019s testimony regarding the companies\u2019 intent unconvincing based in part upon cross-examination that revealed Schroder misunderstood the meaning of \u201csolvent\u201d and that E.L. Construction had very few assets. <em>See MacGuire v. Commissioner, </em>450 F.2d 1239, 1244 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Similarly, DF Systems offers no objective evidence to support its argument that it loaned the $25,320 to the Padillas. Instead, it again relies on the minutes of a special board meeting, a number of accounting entries in its journal, and the alleged uncontradicted testimony at trial. This evidence is subject to the same criticism as the evidence related to its dealings with E.L. Construction: it is subjective and there are no reliable indicia of genuine debt. <em>Alterman Foods, </em>505 F.2d at 879. Here, as with E.L. Construction, there was no initial fixed sum of money to be repaid, repayment schedule, interest rate, or collateral. Although Dorman\u2019s trial testimony that Padilla intended to repay the debt was uncontradicted in the sense that the Commissioner offered no witnesses to rebut it, the trial court did not err by finding it unconvincing in light of the other objective evidence. <em>MacGuire, </em>450 F.2d at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In evaluating whether a debt is bona fide, we \u201clook not to mere labels or to the self-serving declarations of the parties, but to the more reliable criteria of the circumstances surrounding the transaction.\u201d <em>Tyler v. Tomlinson, </em>414 F.2d 844, 850 (5th Cir.1969). The tax court did not clearly err in upholding the Commissioner\u2019s determination that DF Systems had a tax deficiency in the amount of $30,728 for the year 2006. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">. The Commissioner suggests that our precedents are unclear as to whether review of the debtor-creditor relationship is a question of law or fact, though DF Systems appears to accede to clear-error review. <em>See e.g., Estate of Mixon v. United States, </em>464 F.2d 394, 402 (5th Cir.1972) (stating that the evaluation of whether a monetary advance is debt or equity is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review); <em>Texas Farm Bureau v. United States, </em>725 F.2d 307, 312 (5th Cir.1984) (stating that the debt-capital contribution determination is a question of law except when the court is evaluating the debtor\u2019s subjective intent). We explained in <em>Saunders </em>why the clear-error standard is the correct one here. <em>Saunders, </em>720 F.2d at 873 n. 3. Review here is for clear error because DF Systems relies on the subjective intent of the parties to establish the existence of a bona fide debt. This is a question of \"pure fact.\u201d <em>Texas Farm Bureau, </em>725 F.2d at 312.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
