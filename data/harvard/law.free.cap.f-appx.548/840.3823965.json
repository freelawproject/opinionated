We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-29\">We review the Board\u2019s and the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and \u201cindependently] review ... the record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207-08 (4th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c\u2018Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla\u2019; it is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). In conducting this review, we conf\u00edne ourselves to the grounds on which the Board based its decision. <em>Daniels Co. v. Mitchell, </em>479 F.3d 321, 329 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Subject to the substantial evidence requirement, we defer to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations and \u201cevaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions.\u201d <em>Harman Mining Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>678 F.3d 305, 310 (4th Cir.2012). The ALJ is not bound to accept any medical expert opinion but \u201cmust evaluate the evidence, weigh it, and draw his own conclusions,\u201d giving consideration to \u201cthe qualifications of the experts, the opinions\u2019 reasoning, their reliance on objectively determinable symptoms and established science, their detail of analysis, and their freedom from irrelevant distractions and prejudices.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Elkay Mining, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 946, 949, 951 (4th Cir.1997), <em>superseded on other grounds as stated in Elm Grove Coal Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp.

Once the miner has established entitlement to the presumption, the employer \u201cmay rebut such presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not ... have pneumoconi-osis, or that (B) his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine.\u201d 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c)(4); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(a).</p>\n<p id=\"A_N\">Employer does not dispute that Swiney was employed in underground coal mines for fifteen or more years and that all of the chest x-rays were interpreted as negative for complicated pneumoconiosis. Employer does dispute that Swiney demonstrated that he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. Specifically, Employer argues that the ALJ erred in discounting the contrary medical opinions of its expert physicians on the issue of total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"A1T\">A miner may prove total disability through qualifying pulmonary function tests, qualifying arterial blood gas studies, a showing of corpulmonale with right-sided congestive heart failure, or medical opinions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2)(i)-(iv) (2013); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(c) (requiring miner to prove total disability in accordance with \u00a7 718.204). The ALJ must, however, consider any contrary probative evidence in deciding whether the miner has met his burden. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2); <em>see </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b) (\u201cIn determining the validity of claims ..., all relevant evidence shall be considered .... \u201d). \u201cIf contrary evidence does exist, the ALJ must assign the contrary evidence appropriate weight and determine whether it outweighs the evidence that supports a finding of total disability.\u201d <em>Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 171 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Upon review, we conclude that the ALJ complied with the Administrative Procedure Act and fully discussed and considered the opinions of Employer\u2019s physicians in finding that the medical opinions were insufficient contrary evidence to outweigh the qualifying arterial blood gas studies that the ALJ found established Swiney\u2019s total disability. <em>See Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 532 n. 9 (4th Cir.1998) (\u201cAn ALJ has discretion to disregard an opinion unsupported by a sufficient rationale\u201d). We are not permitted to reweigh the medical evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 536. Thus, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in finding that Swiney was entitled to the fifteen-year presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The burden then shifted to Employer to affirmatively \u201crebut such presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not ... have pneumoconiosis, or that (B) his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine.\u201d 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c)(4); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. 718.305(a); <em>Morrison v. Tenn. Consol. Coal Co., </em>644 F.3d 473, 479-80 (6th Cir.2011). Upon review of the evidence submitted in this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Employer failed to affirmatively rebut the presumption. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. 718.201(a)(2); <em>Harman Mining Co., </em>678 F.3d at 311. Thus, the ALJ did not err in awarding benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Accordingly, we deny Employer\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\"> This presumption was restored by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.L.
