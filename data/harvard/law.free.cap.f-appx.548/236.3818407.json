We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">While dining at P.F. Chang\u2019s China Bistro, Eman excused herself from the table and walked toward the restrooms. While crossing the tiled hallway that leads to the restrooms and the entrance to the kitchen, she slipped and fell, sustaining a lumbar injury. Her son, Hussein \u2014 who was trailing close behind \u2014 helped her to her feet, whereupon she noticed that her pants were wet with an unidentified liquid. There was no evidence of how long the allegedly hazardous condition had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">The restaurant provided employees with non-slip shoes, had a written policy regarding spills requiring employees to carry out inspections routinely around the dining area, and typically placed mats near the entrance to the kitchen. Eman and Hussein, however, stated that there was no mat there.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-20\">The Mohammads sued the restaurant and Zurich American Insurance Company (jointly \u201cP.F. Chang\u2019s\u201d) in state court alleging a violation of Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated Section 9:2800.6. P.F. Chang\u2019s timely removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, and the district court granted P.F. Chang\u2019s\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same standard as did the district court, viewing all disputed evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., </em>249 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-24\">Section 9:2800.6 governs merchant-premises liability and provides that a claimant has the burden of proving that</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201c[t]he merchant either created or had actual or constructive notice of the condition which caused the damage, prior to the occurrence.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2800.6(B)(2). Therefore, if the Mo-hammads have not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether P.F. Chang\u2019s either created the pool of unidentified liquid or had actual or constructive knowledge of its existence, we affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Mohammads presented no evidence to create an issue of material fact regarding whether P.F. Chang\u2019s created the condition that caused the injury. The Mohammads argue that a reasonable trier of fact could find that P.F. Chang\u2019s created the condition \u201cwhen P.F. Chang\u2019s\u2019 employees tracked substances from the kitchen on to the tile floor next to the bathroom\u201d and failed to place a mat at the problematic location. We, like the district court, conclude that no such issue of material fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In <em>Broussard v. Outback Steakhouse of Florida, Inc., </em>146 Fed.Appx. 710, 712 (5th Cir.2005) (per curiam), we addressed whether, under Louisiana law, failure to place a mat in an area where employees sometimes track water and debris from the kitchen created an issue of material fact sufficient to avoid summary judgment. We concluded that it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 713-14. The Mohammads try to differentiate this case on the basis that, unlike the situation in <em>Broussard, </em>there is evidence that there actually was a liquid on the ground at the time of the fall. <em>Id. </em>at 712. That argument ignores the central requirement of the statute: \u201c[Tjhere must be proof that the merchant is <em>directly </em>responsible for the spill or other hazardous condition.\u201d <em>Gray v. Wal-Mart La., L.L.C., </em>484 Fed.Appx. 963, 966 (5th Cir.2012) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Merely providing evidence that liquid substances sometimes end up on the floor of the kitchen provides no evidence that the liquid was transmitted from the kitchen to the hallway on the soles of an employees\u2019 non-slip shoes. Mere assertions, without significant probative evidence, are not sufficient to survive summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, for the same reasoning found in <em>Broussard </em>and cited by the district court, no issue of material fact exists regarding creation of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Nor do the Mohammads demonstrate an issue of material fact in regard to P.F. Chang\u2019s\u2019 actual or constructive notice of the spill. As evidence of notice, the Mohammads again point to Dupree\u2019s testimony that employees wore non-slip shoes and placed mats outside the kitchen entrance. Additionally, they provided a safety expert\u2019s opinion that the restaurant knew or should have known that grease residue could be tracked into the hallway by employees and that customers could walk across the same route and slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The Mohammads again rely solely upon mere assertions \u2014 by them or their expert \u2014 that spills in the kitchen <em>could </em>be tracked into the hallway as \u201cevidence\u201d of actual knowledge on the part of P.F. Chang\u2019s that it <em>was </em>tracked into the hall<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>way. That is insufficient to avoid summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Although the evidence shows no issue of material fact in regard to actual notice, we must examine whether it creates such an issue on constructive notice. In <em>White v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>699 So.2d 1081, 1084 (La.1997), the seminal case on this issue, the court held that there is a temporal requirement for constructive notice: \u201cThe statute does not allow for the inference of constructive notice absent some showing of this temporal element.\u201d A claimant must show not only that a hazardous condition existed but also that it existed for some period of time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">A claimant who simply shows that the condition existed without an additional showing that the condition existed for some time before the fall has not carried the burden of proving constructive notice as mandated by the statute. Though the time period need not be specific in minutes or hours, constructive notice requires that the claimant prove the condition existed for some time period prior to the fall. This is not an impossible burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1084-85.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, \u201cthe claimant must show that the substance remained on the floor for such a period of time that the defendant merchant would have discovered its existence through the exercise of ordinary care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1086.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The <em>White </em>court found the plaintiff to have \u201cfall[en] far short of carrying th[is] burden\u201d by \u201cpresenting] absolutely no evidence that the liquid was on the floor for any length of time.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Mohammads have similarly presented no evidence that the liquid in this case was on the floor for any length of time \u2014 let alone that that time was sufficient that the restaurant have discovered its existence through the exercise of ordinary care. As a result, there is no issue of material fact regarding constructive notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Because the Mohammads have not meet their burden to produce evidence regarding P.F. Chang\u2019s\u2019 creation of or notice regarding the hazardous condition, merchant-premises liability could not be found as a matter of Louisiana Law. The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
