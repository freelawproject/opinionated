Griffin, Jr., federal prisoner # 04667-017, appeals from the order of the district court denying his petition for habe-as corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Griffin argues that he was actually innocent of any offense because his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>dictment failed to specify a quantity of cocaine base, an omission that could not be cured by reference to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), as that subsection requires no specific minimum quantity as do the subsections governing larger amounts. He also contends that \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) was inapplicable because it makes reference to cocaine hydrochloride as a Schedule II substance and makes no reference to cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">A federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). The prisoner bears the burden of showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A petitioner\u2019s inability to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2255 is insufficient to meet this burden. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). Rather, a prisoner who wishes to proceed under the savings clause must establish that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Griffin cites to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013), and <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), in support of his arguments. Those opinions do not support a holding that Griffin\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court opinion indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense and that his claim was foreclosed when it otherwise should have been raised. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
