The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that Andres had filed her action more than ninety days after receiving her Notice of Suit Rights from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). The district court noted that Andres\u2019 suit was filed on November 10, 2010, and held that \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact regarding [Andres\u2019] receipt of the Notice of Rights letter in May 2010.\u201d Andres now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>\u201cA plaintiff alleging employment discrimination must file a civil action no more than ninety days after she receives statutory notice of her right to sue from the EEOC.\u201d <em>Duron v. Albertson\u2019s LLC, </em>560 F.3d 288, 290 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). \u201cThe ninety-day window is strictly construed and is a precondition to filing suit in district court.\u201d <em>Duron, </em>560 F.3d at 290 (quotations and citations omitted). Andres\u2019 suit would be timely only if she received the EEOC Notice of Suit Rights on or after August 12, 2010. Andres neither identifies evidence in the record showing that she in fact received the notice on or after this date, nor explains how the district court might have erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1041-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
