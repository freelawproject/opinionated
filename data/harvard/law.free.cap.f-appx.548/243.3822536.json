For the first time on appeal, McNealy contends he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to retain a defense expert in the field of computer forensics.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u201c[T]he general rule in this circuit is that a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because we conclude that \u201cwe cannot fairly evaluate the claim from the record,\u201d we decline to consider McNealy\u2019s claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821-22 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
