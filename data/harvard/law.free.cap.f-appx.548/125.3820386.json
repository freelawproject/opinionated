Hinojosa appeals the application of the ACCA enhancement, arguing that his prior conviction for assault on a public servant in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(b)(1) does not qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA. He first maintains that \u00a7 22.01 does not have as a necessary element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, nor does the statute involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). He also contends that in determining whether his pri- or conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the ACCA, the sentencing court should have taken into consideration the sentence available for the Texas offense of simple assault, without reference to any victim-specific enhancement factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We review the legal conclusions underlying a district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 924(e) de novo. <em>See United States v. Fuller, </em>458 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2006). A conviction for assault on a public servant pursuant to Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(b)(1) constitutes a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 355-56 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 609 n. 4 (5th Cir.2009) (noting that this court has applied case law under the residual clause of \u00a7 924(e) to analyze the definition of crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2, and vice versa). Moreover, we recently held that a conviction for felony assault pursuant to Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01 constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Espinoza, </em>733 F.3d 568, 573-74 (5th Cir.2013). Accordingly, applying <em>Espinoza </em>and the <em>Anderson </em>definition, Hinojosa\u2019s conviction for assault on a public servant pursuant to Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(b)(1) was a violent felony for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). Thus, he has not demonstrated that the district court wrongly determined his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In a separate yet related argument, Hi-nojosa argues for the first time, without citing any legal authority, that when determining whether an offense qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, sentencing courts should consider the maximum sentence generally prescribed for that offense (here, one year for simple assault), without any reference to any victim-specific sentencing factors. The argument that the district court should disregard certain elements of the offense, such as the identity of the victim, and consider the various sentences available under a disjunctive statute, such as \u00a7 22.01 which criminalizes misdemeanor assaults and felony assaults, runs afoul of Supreme Court authority and has no merit. Indeed, the Supreme Court recently reinforced the \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d including the focus on \u201cthe elements of the state statute of conviction.\u201d <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
