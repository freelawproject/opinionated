Williams, federal prisoner # 12952-021, moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. In his petition, Williams argued that he had been improperly denied compensation while working within the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). He also complained that despite his having obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, the BOP had claimed that any records verifying that certificate were forged, and thus he had not received proper credit for his GED.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-23\">Williams does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. Rather, he complains for the first time in this court that, as a result of his various transfers within the BOP, he has been denied the opportunity to have access to the district within which he was convicted and to pursue his actual innocence claim in that court. Absent from Williams\u2019s pleadings, however, is any discussion of the district court\u2019s determination that none of his challenges are properly cognizable under \u00a7 2241. Nor has he presented any meaningful challenge to the sanctions imposed by the district court. Accordingly, the IFP motion is DENIED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-24\">Further, the failure by Williams to address in his brief the district court\u2019s bases for dismissing his claims, \u201cwithout even the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis or its application to [his] suit ..., is the same as if he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because the appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits, the appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-25\">Williams is CAUTIONED that future frivolous filings will invite the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sanctions, which may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. He is further CAUTIONED that, in order to avoid the imposition of sanctions, he should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
