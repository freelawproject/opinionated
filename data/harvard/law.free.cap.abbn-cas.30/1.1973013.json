Lovell, under an agreement between himself and the plaintiff, which provided, among other things, that, \u25a0during a period of three years after the date of the contract, Lovell was to have the exclusive right to have impressions printed from certain plates belonging to Hurst, and that, during the same period, the latter should not publish, directly or indirectly, any works competitive to those covered by the terms of the contract; and for these exclusive rights, the agreement provided that Hurst should receive the sum of $90,000, for which sum Lovell should give, him thirty-six negotiable promissory notes, \u2022each for $2,500, payable at intervals of one month, respectively, each to be drawn to the order of Trow\u2019s Printing \u2022and Bookbinding Co., to be indorsed by them and by the \u25a0defendant Lange. The agreement also provided that this sum of $90,000 was intended not only to include the right to use the plates, but also a consideration for the relin\u2022quishment of competing business, and that, if the plates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>were destroyed before the termination of three years, it should not be considered as abating the payment of any portion of this sum. The agreement further provided forthe purchase by Lovell of a large amount of book stock and sheets, and that Lovell should be bound at the end of the three years, or at such earlier time as he might desire, to purchase all the plates covered by the contract for the sum of $75,000, in addition to the $90,000 before mentioned, and that, from the making of said purchase, Hurst should become bound to refrain from entering into any competing business for twenty-five years after the date thereof with certain exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Under this contract the thirty-six notes provided for in the agreement were delivered to the plaintiff, each made by Lovell and indorsed by the defendants as provided for in the agreement. Subsequently fifteen of these notes fell due and were paid at maturity, but the sixteenth and seventeenth notes of the series, which are the ones in suit in these actions, were not paid, as was .also the case with six others falling due thereafter. After the delivery of these notes to the plaintiff he transferred the two in question to Samuel J. Kerr, by whom these actions were originally commenced, but subsequently, in December, 1891, the notes were taken up by the plaintiff from Kerr, and he again became their sole owner, and remained so down to and including the time of the trial. On March gth, 1892, there being at the time seven notes of this series unpaid, including the two now under consideration, Hurst sent the following letter to Lovell : .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cLaw office of Andrew Gilhooly, Temple Court Building, 5 Beekman street, New York, March 9th, 1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201c John W.

I hereby give you notice that your rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>under the contract depend on the due payment of the obligations therein referred to, and the performance of the conditions therein named on your part, and these must hereafter be promptly made and performed by you. If the above note, dishonored on the yth inst., is paid without further delay, and no further default occurs, I ant prepared to waive any claim I may have to rescind the. contract; otherwise, I shall enforce my right to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201c Yours, &amp;c., Thomas D. Hurst.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">On April 4th Hurst reiterated the statements contained in that letter by another of that date ; and on April 9th, 1892, the note of April 7th having gone to protest, signed a letter prepared by his lawyer, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201c Law office of Andrew Gilhooly, Temple Court Building, 5 Beekman street, New York, April 9th, 1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201c John W.

W. LOVELL.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Meanwhile, and up to the 9th'April, 1892, Hurst had completely performed all of the terms of the before mentioned agreement on his part to be performed, and Lovell had enjoyed the exclusive use of the plates referred to in the agreement, and Hurst had refrained from publishing the books he had undertaken not to publish. The eleven notes returned, as before stated, were all notes maturing after April 9th, 1892. The eight notes maturing before that date, then outstanding and unpaid, were retained. Of these Hurst on April 9th, 1892, held and owned five, including the two in question in these actions, which actions were then pending ; and the remaining three were in suit by other parties against Lovell and the defendants herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">The foregoing facts appearing at the trial, the court, when all the evidence was in, at the request of the plaintiff, directed a verdict in his favor for the full amount of the notes with interest, to which the defendant excepted, and this exception raises the only question to be considered upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The direction was made at the close of the evidence, on \u25a0motion by both parties, for the direction of a verdict, one in favor of plaintiff and the other for the dismissal of the complaints and a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor, and neither party asked to go to the jury upon any question, thus submitting to the court for its determination any \u2022questions of fact that may have arisen upon the evidence in the case. This gave to the judge the office of the jury, .and brings up the question whether there was sufficient \u2022evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s decision (Green <em>v. </em>Shute, 15 <em>Daly, </em>358 ; Gilder <em>v. </em>Davis, 45 <em>State Rep. </em>690 ; Burrows <em>v. </em>Atlas SS. Co., 46 <em>Id. </em>533; Mayor, etc., <em>v </em>Sands, 39 <em>Hun, </em>519, 524).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Appellant contends that the rescission of the contract of March 4th discharged both the maker and the indorsers \u2022of the notes in suit from any liability thereon. This would be the case if the notices served by Hurst upon Lovell amounted to a rescission in the ordinary acceptance of that term (Graves <em>v. </em>White, 87 <em>N. Y. </em>463 ; 2 <em>Dan. Neg. Inst., </em>sec. 1306; Freeth <em>v. </em>Burr, <em>L. R. </em>9 <em>C. P. </em>208 ; Mersey Steel &amp; Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Naylor, <em>L. R. </em>9 <em>App. Cas. </em>434; Creighton <em>v. </em>Haggerty, 50 <em>Super. Ct. </em>9; Weeks <em>v. </em>Robie, 42 <em>N. H. </em>316; Mills <em>v. </em>Parkhurst, 126 <em>N. Y. </em>89; <em>Bishop on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 827; Conrow <em>v. </em>Little, 115 <em>N. Y. </em>394; Fowler <em>v. </em>Bowery Savs. Bank, 113 <em>N. Y. </em>450, and many others which might be cited). The question then arises as to what was really intended by the plaintiff\u2019s notice of April 9th, 1892. Did he thereby mean that he rescinded the contract <em>ab initio, </em>or only from and after April gth, 1892, the date of the notice ? And this depends upon the construction to be given to the words \u201c I hereby <em>terminate .and rescind </em>my said written contract,\u201d to be determined in the light of surrounding circumstances. Good writers \u2022often use the word \u201c rescind\u201d in the narrower sense to terminate a contract as to the future transactions Thus, in .a note at page 145, 28 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>Dr. Abbott says : \u201cThe word 1 rescind\u2019 is often and not improperly used to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>cutting off.\u2019\u2019 Thus Bispham <em>(Eq. Juris. </em>556, \u00a7 506) says a dissolution of the partnership is a rescission of the contract, meaning of course a rescission as to future transactions. The words <em>\u201c </em>rescission \u201d and \u201c rescind \u201d are used <em>simpliciter </em>by the highest authorities to indicate in some-cases partial rescission or termination, as well as to indicate in other cases annulment <em>ab initio. </em>Thus <em>Leake on Con. </em>(3d ed., 1892), p. 53, says: \u201c In a case of money lent under a special contract, which was afterwards rescinded by mutual agreement, it was held that the money still remains due, the rescission relating only to the further execution of the contract.\u201d Fry, J., says in Bluck <em>v. </em>Capstick <em>(L. R. 12 Ch. D. </em>863), in speaking of the dissolution of a partnership which involved the refusal by defendant, an incoming partner, to pay his bonds or premium after three months joint conduct of the business, the pretext for his-refusal being the allegation that plaintiff had not fairly performed on his part: \u201c I must have regard to the circumstances which have led me to the dissolution of the partnership...... The allegation of misconduct on the part of the plaintiff failed, and in my opinion the defendant has, in effect <em>rescinded </em>the partnership agreement without any excuse,\u201d and he thereupon went on to-decree <em>pa ment of the premium </em>agreeably to the terms of the partnership, thus showing that the rescinding spoken of was not an absolute rescission or annulment of the partnership <em>ab </em>initio, but a termination or rescission restricted to the future. This is made still clearer <em>by </em>the head-note, which states the case as one \u201c where a partnership is dissolved before its natural expiration,, etc., without payment of the premium . . . the part ner who has agreed to pay it\u201d (if his fault is the sole-cause of the dissolution) \u201c will be ordered to pay the whole of it, notwithstanding the dissolution.\u201d In 2 <em>Pars. on Cont., </em>7th ed. 677 (star paging), we find these words: \u201c And a suit for the recovery of damages for a breach of the contract is equivalent to a notice of rescission,\u201d citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Graham <em>v. </em>Halloway (44 <em>Ill. </em>385). In Mann <em>v. </em>Palmer (3 <em>Abb. Ct. App. D. </em>162) the head-note is \u201c Acquiescence in the rescission of the executory contract is not necessarily a waiver of an existing claim for profits made under it.\u201d Obviously, a single word, like the word rescind, cannot be wrenched from its context and construed alone in its unqualified, strict and technical sense in disregard of the surrounding circumstance. To ascertain the import of the notice, the intent must be gathered from the instrument considered as a whole. \u201c It is a cardinal rule in the construction of contracts that the intention of the parties is to be inquired into, and, if not forbidden by law, is to be effectuated. Too much regard is not to be had to the proper and exact signification of words so as to prevent the simple intention of the parties from taking effect, and where the language is susceptible of more than one interpretation, the court will look at the surrounding circumstances when the contract was entered into, the situation of the parties and of the subject-matter of the instrument\u201d(French <em>v. </em>Carhart, 1 <em>N. Y. </em>102 ; App\u2019d Bridger v. Pierson, 45 <em>Id. </em>604; Kenyon <em>v. </em>Knights Templars Ass\u2019n., 122 <em>Id. </em>247). And this rule has been applied even to the interpretation of charters and legislative enactments (McGaffin <em>v. </em>City of Cohoes, 74 <em>N. Y. </em>387). On the general question under consideration, see, also, Blossom <em>v. </em>Griffin (13 <em>N. Y. </em>569) ; Zimmer <em>v. </em>Settle (124 <em>Id. </em>37).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Under the light of these authorities, we think the circumstances surrounding the making and termination of the contract should be considered. It is undisputed from the 4th of March, 1890, the date of the contract, down to the 9th of April, 1892, Hurst had in all things performed his part of the contract, inasmuch as Lovell had enjoyed the exclusive use of the plates down to the latter date, and Hurst had refrained from publishing, as he agreed, any works in competition to those mentioned in the agreement. Hence, by virtue of such performance, Hurst had, on the 9th of April, 1892, earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>and had a vested right of action on all of said series of notes maturing prior to April gth, 1892, and then unpaid. None of these were returned at the time of the giving the notice; some of them were then in action. Lovell had, in violation of his contract, made default in the payment of eight of the series. In consequence of these repeated defaults on Lovell\u2019s part, Hurst was clearly justified on April 9 in terminating the contract, as to its unexpired part, and in holding Lovell upon his contract and notes \u25a0given thereunder, for the liability already incurred on his previous defaults (In re Kelly, 51 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>194; Cunningham <em>v. </em>Massena Springs, etc. R. R. Co., 63 Hun, 439, 443; Strack <em>v. </em>Hurd, 41 <em>State Rep. </em>777; Gardner <em>v. </em>Clark, 21 <em>N. Y. </em>399). In giving Lovell notice of such termination of the contract, Hurst was not confined to any particular form of words so long as their import was to terminate the contract in respect to its unexpired period. If, instead of using the expression \u201c terminate and rescind,\u201d Hurst had written that he h\u00e1d terminated the contract as of the date of the notice, or had coupled with the word \u201crescind \u201d words showing express reservation of his accrued rights, this would have meant simply that he terminated the contract only as to its unexpired period (McCreery <em>v. </em>Day, 119 <em>N. Y. </em>1 ; Roe <em>v. </em>Conway, 74 <em>Id. </em>201 ; Duncan <em>v. </em>New York Mutual Ins. Co., 46 <em>State Rep. </em>241). In the light of the surrounding circumstances, has he done anything else than this ?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">But it is claimed that we must give effect to all the words in the contract. We do this in this case by making the word \u201c rescind \u201d equivalent to the word \u201c terminate,\u201d and hence regard it as mere tautology and synonymous with <em>\u201c </em>terminate.\u201d The curious in such matters would see in this no more than a survival of that disposition which \u25a0draftsmen exhibited when the fee bill was in part regulated by the folio, and they became expert in the use of a large vocabulary of words having the same or similar meaning in order to increase the number of folios.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>It is quite true, as contended for by the appellant, that as a general rule, where there has been a breach of a contract, the party performing has the right to consider such breach as a basis for rescinding and abandoning the contract, or to treat the contract as subsisting and sue for the enforcement of the unperformed obligation, and the election to rescind the agreement bars the pursuit of the other alternative. Yet this is so only in cases where the contract is rescinded <em>in toto </em>and <em>db initio. </em>In such cases he cannot regard the contract as existing and not existing at the same time; he must choose between the two. But, as before shown, there are numerous cases in which the party performing the contract on his part may terminate it as to the future and still hold the delinquent party for its performance up to the time of its termination. In addition to what has been said, we may call attention to the familiar illustration of an ordinary lease for a number of years, where it is provided that the same shall continue-for a definite period of time, with instalments of rent to-be paid monthly. If the lessee neglects to pay these monthly instalments, the landlord may allow the lease to go on to the end and sue for the whole rent due, or he may, at any time, by the commencement of summary proceedings, obtain possession of the leased property and thus recover for the rent due up to the time of the dispossession. And we have no doubt whatever but that the contract under consideration falls within the latter class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Again, all the facts in this case were undisputed. If conflicting inferences were to be drawn from these facts, the action of the parties in requesting the court to direct a verdict made it the judge of those inferences to the same extent that the jury would have been had not such requests been made; and we think there is quite sufficient in these cases to warrant the judge in drawing the inference he did in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s contention. 11</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">But, it is claimed on behalf of appellant that, even conceding Lovell might be held upon the notes due and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>unpaid at the time of the rescission, the indorsers were thereby discharged because of the modification of the contract between Lovell and Hurst, inasmuch as the only liability of the defendants to the plaintiff is as sureties for Lovell, the sole party to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">It is difficult to see how a cancellation of a contract is a modification of it. The terms of the contract were in no way changed by such termination, and if Lovell was not discharged from the obligation he incurred before the \u2022rescission, we cannot see how his sureties could be. As before shown, all the unpaid notes, up to the date of the rescission, had been fully earned by Hurst by the performance of the contract on his part, and Lovell had had all the benefits of the contract up to.its rescission ; and in our opinion the notes were in the nature of rent for the plates, etc., and the defendants were liable for its payment. We fail to perceive any force in the argument that \u2022the defendants were injured by such rescission; on the contrary it appears to us that it was greatly to their advantage, as in consequence of it they were relieved from a large liability which, if the contracts had been allowed to continue, they or their principal, Lovell, would have had to meet, with no resulting advantage to the indorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The contention that the sureties were released because of an extension of time granted the principal, is not well founded. Such a contention is based solely upon the letters written by the plaintiff to the defendant, which, instead of extending his time to pay the notes, really were intended to press upon him the necessity for immediate payment. The mere failure to sue upon the notes when due never releases the indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">BlSCHOFF, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b66-9\">PRYOR, J. (dissenting)</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">I am unable to concur in the prevailing opinion.. The notes in suit were given in execution of the agreement of the 15th of June, 1892 ; but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>contract was \u201c rescinded\u201d and \u201c annulled\u201d by the mutual \u2022consent of the parties; and by consequence, all rights acquired under it ceased and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A rescission of the contract imports <em>proprio vigore </em>a relinquishment of every benefit and a dissolution of every obligation dependent upon it; and by the act of rescission each party is restored to his original position and relation. It is a contradiction in terms to assert a right under a rescinded contract; \u201c and neither party can thereafter invoke it against the other \u201d (McCreery <em>v. </em>Day, 119 <em>N. Y. </em>1; Graves <em>v. </em>White, 87 <em>Id. </em>463, 466; Brewster <em>v. </em>Wooster, 131 <em>Id. </em>473 ; Fullager <em>v. </em>Reville, 3 Hun, 600). By rescission of the contract, of which they were an incident, the notes became incapable of enforcement. Otherwise, however, had they been reserved from the operation of the rescission ; but of that there is no hint,\u2014the words being \u201c wholly rescinded and annulled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u2019 Note on the Legal Effect of Promissory Notes or Acceptances given for payments expected to become DUE UNDER CONTINUING OR OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">It is becoming a common practice in executory contracts that contemplate the lapse of a considerable period before complete performance, to stipulate for the giving of notes by the party expected to make the payments, these notes being usually required to be given at the outset, or from time to time in advance of any payment having become \u25a0actually due. A common form of such contracts is to provide that the contractor who is to furnish from time to time supplies or materials or labor, or it may be the vendor in a land contract, shall be paid specified instalments as time passes or as deliveries progress, and then to add a provision to the effect that the other party shall simultaneously with the execution of the contract give his promissory notes corresponding with such instalments, payable in a \u25a0series of periods corresponding more or less with the anticipated progress of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Three views seem to have been taken of the legal effect of such notes. One is, that they are merely modal, and only intended to dispense with notice of performance and demand of payment by providing that the duty of the \u25a0employer or debtor party in respect of the paying an instal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ment in case it be actually earned, shall be to have the-money at the place of note-payment, at the peril of having-his note dishonored'if he wishes a few days indulgence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">A second view is that the note is to be read as if written into the contract, and subject therefore, to be restrained in. legal effect (as between the parties and their privies) by the stipulations and conditions contained in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">A third view, and the one usual I believe among business men, and the one approved in effect by the best considered cases, is that the giving of separate notes, absolute in terms, manifests an intention to accomplish more than a. similar promise embodied in the contract, viz.', to make the sum payable absolutely and at all events, without conditions ; and to leave a breach of the contract on the part of the holder of the note to be redressed by an action for damages, or in modern practice by recoupment or counterclaim for damages in case the note is sued on by the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The business reasons which make this view advantageous are easily seen. The contractor can use the notes by negotiating them and thus getting means to carry out a contract he could not otherwise undertake, and the transferee for value before maturity can recover notwithstanding-\u00bb he had notice of the contract under which they were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Moreover, the contractor, if he continues to hold the notes, cannot be put off by disputes raised by the maker respecting the sufficiency of performance, but the maker must pay all that fall due, and is protected as to the future by his right to terminate his liability as to those which have not fallen due by terminating the agreement itself on the ground of forfeiture, if such ground exists, and, protected as to the past if he chooses to refuse payment of any already due, by his right to a cross action, or to a recoupment, for the damages he has sustained by the alleged past insufficiency of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Whether this third view is sanctioned by the law as well as commended by its business advantage for contractors who choose to require notes, may be best determined by inquiring what is the legal effect of a note given on an executory consideration when no such continuing contract exists, and what is the effect of the voluntary giving of a note byway of advance on a continuing contract which does not call for notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The principle established at common law that a promise is a sufficient consideration for a promissory note, notwithstanding the subsequent breach of the promise, is doubtless what led to the adoption of this system of independent notes to secure payment of instalments. The cases are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>harmonious, but considered together they appear to afford adequate support for the following conclusions :</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">1. A note absolute in terms may be <em>delivered </em>upon art oral condition which is to prevent its taking effect until performance of the condition (Seymour <em>v. </em>Cowing, 4 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Dec. </em>200), but if delivered absolutely, an action lies, upon it even though it was given upon an executed consideration which has wholly failed, or upon an executory consideration which has never been performed ; because a promise is a sufficient consideration for q promise ; and the breach of the consideration-promise is matter for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">2. A note may be made to contain a condition in its own terms, or by a supplementary written agreement contemporaneous with it expressly restraining its effect, or may be modified by a subsequent agreement founded on a consideration ; and in such case the note itself is as between the parties, not an absolute note, but qualified by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">3. An absolute note, given voluntarily by way of an advance or payment on account, under a contract which\u2019, does not by its.terms require the giving of a note, is nevertheless, a waiver of the right to insist that the terms of the contract make performance a condition precedent of the-payment thus secured by the note, or to insist that the payment of the money secured by the note was dependent on. Hhe stipulation to perform ; so that a breach of the stipulation in the contract will not be, even as between the parties, a bar to an action on the note, but at most a counter-cause of action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">4. The same effect follows where the note is stipulated for in the contract. The requirement and the concession of an absolute note, separate from the contract, and having no reference to it and no condition expressed, is in itself a manifestation of intention of both parties to make an independent obligation not conditioned on performance of even express conditions in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">5. Until recent times the breach of the executory consideration for an' absolute note could in no case be set up in an action on the note. It was an independent cause of action to be presented by an independent suit. Since the establishment of the doctrine of recoupment and the adoption of the provisions of the Codes of Procedure, allowing any cause of action on contract to be a counter-claim in any action on contract between the same parties, the maker of the note when sued upon it may set up, not in bar, but -as a counter-claim, any cause of action he has against the payee of the note ; and there seems some authority for saying that a breach of the contract relating to the considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of the note might, under the present provision of the New York Code, \u00a7 508, be pleaded as a \u201c partial defense \u201d by way \u25a0of recoupment or mitigation of damages, without stating it formally as a counter-claim.\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\n<em>Notes of Cases.'</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">I. <em>Absolute note on executory consideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">II. <em>Note i&gt;i terms conditional.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">III. <em>Note with contemporaneous qualifying agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">IV. <em>Note voluntarily given in advance or on accotmt, under a con-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\n<em>tinuing contract.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">V. <em>Notegiven tinder requirement therefor, in continuing contract. </em>'VI. <em>Rescission.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">I. <em>Cases on absolute notes given upon an executory consideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">1. <em>Note for an executory consideration </em>subsequent.] Chapman <em>v. </em>Eddy, 13 <em>Vt. </em>205.

But when each party takes a separate instrument to secure the undertaking of the other, it is conclusive that they are independent. Here the defendant gave his unconditional note, and took of the plaintiff his promise afterwards to execute a deed. With that promise he was then content and to that he .must look. He can not now by parol add conditions to the note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">2. <em>Performance to accompatiy payment of note.] </em>McMath <em>v. </em>Johnson, 41 <em>Miss. </em>439.

The consideration of the note was a contract by which plaintiff transferred to defendant the agency for a gas company, and also agreed, thereafter, to purchase of the defendant all the gas that he might use and not to purchase from the <em>company.\u2014Held, </em>that the failure of the plaintiff to buy all his gas from defendant, did not operate as an entire failure of consideration for the note, but merely a partial failure, for which defendant was only entitled to a reduction of the .amount recoverable upon the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">22. <em>Damages may be recoupedl] </em>Stacy <em>v. </em>Kemp, 97 <em>Mass. </em>166.

The accommodation indorser of a note given for chattels sold, cannot, at law, avail himself of a breach of warranty as to the quality of such chattels, by the way of defense, recoupment, or counter-claim. Such a defense does not rest upon a failure of the consideration of the contract on which the action is founded, but is the setting-off of one distinct claim against another.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">24. <em>Rights of bonafide transferee for value before maturity l\\ </em>Maas. <em>v. </em>Chatfield, 90 <em>N.

The heater worked unsatisfactorily and not as <em>warranted.\u2014Held, </em>that the note was subject to a condition precedent; and that such condition not having been performed, plaintiff could recover nothing-upon the note, except what might be left over after putting the heater in working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The court say: \u201c The rule of law that between maker and payee conditions precedent can be proved by parol is unquestioned, even where the face of the note is absolute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">27. <em>Note containing executory condition st(bsequejitl\\ </em>Hawley <em>v. </em>Bingham, 6 <em>Oreg. </em>76.

The answer expressly admitted the making of the note, as set forth in the complaint, and set up as new matter in defense, an alleged agreement under which the note was <em>given.\u2014Held, </em>that the defendant was concluded by admission in the answer and could not show, upon the trial, that the obligation sued on was not a promissory note, but a conditional agreement for'the payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">29. <em>Performance to precede payment of note.] </em>Johnson <em>v. </em>Morrison First National Bank, 24 <em>Ill.

In an action on a promissory note, a plea was interposed to the 'effect that the note was given for seed oats, in connection with an agreement that it was not to be paid until the crop matured and the payee had sold a certain quantity of the oats raised, at a stipulated price; that plaintiff, as assignee, had notice of such agreement, and that such sale had not been <em>made.\u2014Held, </em>that the plea set up a good defense, as the promise by payee to sell the oats raised and of the maker to pay the note were dependent covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">III. <em>Note with contemporaneous qualifying agreemejit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">30. <em>Connected agreement for, </em>collaterals.] Coffin <em>v. </em>Grand Rapids Hydraulic Co.

The note was given pursuant to a written agreement for money loaned, with certain bonds of the defendant company attached as collateral. The agreement also provided that the defendant might substitute for these bonds others to be issued by it, which the plaintiff agreed to buy at a certain price before the maturity of the <em>loan.\u2014Held, </em>that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>having failed to issue the new bonds, the agreement did not bar an action on\" the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">31. <em>Restriction as to use of note.] </em>Simpson Centenary College <em>v. </em>Bryan, 50 <em>Iowa, </em>293. Action on a note. Defendants answer set up that the note had been given as a part of an endowment fund for plaintiff (a college) under an agreement that such fund should not he diminished, and should be only used for specified objects ; and alleged that plaintiff had violated this <em>agreement.\u2014Held, </em>on demurrer to answer, that the defense was good.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The court say : \u201c The note cannot be enforced if the agreement of the plaintiff upon which its consideration is based has been violated by the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">32.

In an action on a promissory note, an answer setting out a contract which provides in express and unequivocal terms, not only that the note should not be paid until the completion of a railroad within a time limited as therein provided, but that the note should be held by a trustee and not delivered until such conditon was complied with, and alleging that the plaintiff did not carry out his contract, discloses a good defense and is sufficient on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">33. <em>Condition, as to payment.] </em>Hall <em>v. </em>Henderson, 84 <em>Ill. </em>611. TVhere a promissory note is given for a draft assigned by the payee of the note to the maker, and an agreement executed at the same time, that in the event the maker of the note could not \u201c collect or realize \u201d on the draft, he was to be released from the payment of the note, no recovery can be had by the paj'ee on the note if the .maker has been unable to realize anything on the draft.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">34. <em>Executory agreeme7it to return other note.] </em>Trauer <em>v. </em>Stevens, 11 <em>Cush. (Mass.) 167. </em>Assumpsit upon notes. The only defense was .a failure of consideration, to prove which the defendant produced .a receipt given for the notes, stating that for the notes received from defendant, plaintiff was to send defendant a certain other note \u2022of his in balance of the settlement between <em>them.\u2014Held, </em>that the defense of want of consideration failed ; the promise of plaintiff to \u2022deliver up the note was a sufficient consideration for the notes in \u2022suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The court say: \u201cThe only ground of defense that can be plausibly urged is, that this was a conditional promise, and the condition not performed upon which it rested. But as it seems to the court, the note was given upon a good consideration, and the delivery of the other note was not a condition precedent to the recovery of the note in suit. The stipulation, to send defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>his other note, was an independent stipulation, executory in its character. The two promises were to be performed at different times, and this also shows them to have been independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">To same effect, with substantially the same facts, see Waterhouse <em>v. </em>Kendall, 11 <em>Cush.

On the trial of an action by an indorsee \u2022against the maker, the defendant was allowed, for the purpose of \u2022showing a failure of consideration, to give parol evidence that by an oral agreement, when- the note was made, the note should be given up in a certain event, and that event had happened. <em>Held, </em>that the admission of such evidence was error. Such evidence \u25a0cannot be considered even upon the question of failure of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">37. Accommodation.] In President, etc. of Union Bk. <em>v. </em>Crine, <em>21 Abb. N.

In an action upon a promissory note against an indorser, defendant set up in his answer that he indorsed the same as security for a debt due from the maker to plaintiff, upon the agreement of the latter with defendant to discontinue a suit brought for the recovery \u2022of the debt; that in violation of such agreement, plaintiff thereafter proceeded to judgment and execution against the maker, thereby causing him to fail and depriving him of an opportunity to pay the note\". <em>Held, </em>a valid defense, and that the defendant could show the failure of consideration for his indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>39. <em>Subsequent agreement for renewal.] </em>In State Loan and Trust Co. <em>v. </em>Helmer, 12 <em>Hun, </em>35 (Daniels, J.), a subsequent agreement presumably in writing, that the maker might give a renewal note at maturity of the one sued on, followed by tender of the renewal note and refusal to receive it, was <em>held, </em>on demurrer, a good defense.

Where upon entering into an executory contract, one party gives his notes payable at future dates for instalments of the consideration, and performance by the other party is not made a condition precedent to the payment of the notes,\u2014the promise of performance on his part being independent, although mutual,\u2014 non-performance by the party to whom the notes are given will constitute no defense to his action upon the notes, although the notes in suit may have become due after a failure to perform on his part. <em>So held, </em>in an action upon notes given under a written agreement for the settlement of two actions,\u2014by which the defendants were to pay $6000 in instalments by notes payable at future dates,, and when $3000 of the notes were paid, the plaintiffs were to discontinue one of the actions, and were to give defendants a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>release, which was not to be operative, however, until all the notes were paid, and when all were paid the second action was to be discontinued,\u2014where defendants attempted to defend the notes in suit upon the ground that the plaintiff had refused to give the requested release after the $3000 had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">S.

The purchaser of a stock and business may maintain an action in equity to rescind the sale and enjoin the enforcement of the purchase notes, for fraud on the part of the seller, and to recover damages for the fraud, where he can not by his own act rescind because of his inability to make restoration by reason of his having disposed of the original stock.
