The plaintiff owing to her tender years was not chargeable with that same degree of care and prudence which the law exacts from adults,'and even if she was <em>sui juris </em>she could only be held to such degree of care and caution as would reasonably be expected of a person of her age (citing Byrne <em>v. </em>N.

The complaint should have been dismissed, because (1.) the premises are not alleged to have been in possession of or under the control of defendants (citing Wolf <em>v. </em>Kilpatrick, 101 <em>N. Y. </em>146, 151; Clancy <em>v. </em>Byrne, 55 <em>Id. </em>129, 133 ; Cunningham <em>v. </em>Bay State Shoe &amp; L.

Y. </em>201, 208) ; (3.) it is not alleged that defendant placed the stone there or omitted any act or duty upon which to predicate a charge of negligence (citing Edwards <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 98 <em>N. Y. </em>245, 257; Robbins <em>v. </em>Jones, 15 <em>C. B. N. S. </em>221 : Jaffe <em>v. </em>Harteau, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>398, 401).</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-7\">II. The plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence (citing Tucker <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central, etc. R. R. Co., 124 <em>N. Y. </em>308).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\"> By the amendment of Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 2244, effected by L. 1893, c. 705, a tenant defending summary proceedings, may now set up any new matter constituting a legal or equitable defense or counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b340-8\">Pryor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arx\">Assuming, the back-yard to have been reserved by the landlord for the common use of the tenants (Peil <em>v. </em>Reinhart, 127 <em>N. Y. </em>381), that the rock was a nuisance, and that the landlord let the premises with knowledge of the nuisance, then, beyond question, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>would be responsible for the injury to the plaintiff if in noway caused by her own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">But, the fatal defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case is that neither by allegation in the complaint nor by proof on the trial does it appear that the defendants were the landlords or in control of the premises. True, the receipts for the rent were by John E. Norris, <em>Agent; </em>but, agent for whom ? It may be that the premises were held by the plaintiff\u2019s father as sub-tenant; that they passed out of the possession and control of the defendant owners before the existence of the nuisance and for a term extending beyond the demise to the father; that the nuisance was created by the immediate landlord, and that no notice of it, actual or constructive, was imparted to the defendants ; entirely consistent with the evidence is this state of fact; and surely, it is ineffectual to affect the defendants with a liability for the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">It is conceded, however, that the defendants were owners of the premises ; but that fact alone did not make them responsible for a nuisance which they are not shown to have created or suffered to continue. \u201c A landlord out of possession is not responsible for an after-occurring nuisance unless, in some manner, he is in fault for its creation or continuance. His bare ownership will not produce that result \u2019\u2019(Babbage <em>v. </em>Powers, 4 <em>Silvernail, </em>211, 215, <em>note; </em>Wolf <em>v. </em>Kilpatrick, 101 <em>N. Y. </em>146, 151). But, ownership is the solitary fact in the case upon which defendant\u2019s liability is. founded.'</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">That the complaint should have been dismissed is evident; without argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The respondents insist, further, that the complaint should have been dismissed for the contributory negligence of the plaintiff; because it was her own act that caused the rock to fall. The so-called turn-table cases are clearly against the contention, the principle they establish being that where a person maintains upon his premises anything dangerous to life or limb, and of a nature to invite the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>trusi\u00f3n of children, he owes them a duty of precaution against harm, and is liable to them for injury from that thing, even though their own act, if not negligent, puts in operation its hurtful agency (Barrett <em>v. </em>Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 91 <em>Cal. </em>296; Lynch <em>v. </em>Nuerdin, <em>L. R. </em>1 <em>Q. B. </em>29; Sioux City &amp; Pacific R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Stout, 17 <em>Wall. </em>657; Kansas, etc. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Fitzsimmons, 22 <em>Kansas, </em>686; Evansich <em>v. </em>Gulf Coast, etc. R. R. Co., 57 Texas, 126; Koons <em>v. </em>St. Louis &amp; Iron Mountain R. R. Co., 65 <em>Mo. </em>592 ; Nagel <em>v. </em>Missouri Pacific R. R. Co., 75 <em>Id. </em>653 ; Williams <em>v. </em>Kansas City, Springfield and Memphis R. R. Co., 96 <em>Id. </em>275 ; A. &amp; N. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Bailey, 11 <em>Nebraska, </em>332 ; Kunz <em>v. </em>City of Troy, 104 <em>N. Y. </em>344, 351).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It follows, therefore, that though the toying of the plaintiff with the rock was the occasion of its fall, contributory negligence is not a necessary inference, but may be negatived by a contrary inference, that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. Being eleven years old, and not of infirm or inferior faculties, she was <em>sui juris </em>and responsible for the observance of care\u2014not, however, the care of an adult, but only for a degree of care proper to her age and condition (Kehler <em>v. </em>Schwenk, 144 <em>Pa. </em>348; Swift <em>v. </em>R. R. Co., 123 <em>N. Y. </em>645, 650; Byrne <em>v. </em>Staten Island Rapid Transit R. R. Co., 83 <em>Id. </em>620). The intimation in Tucker <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central, etc. R. R. Co. (124 <em>N. Y. </em>308) that an infant <em>sui juris </em>is held to the care of an adult was inadvertent, and is opposed 'equally to reason and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">It is not the contributory act merely, but the contributory negligence of a plaintiff that defeats his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Although the complaint be bad in substance, there must still be another trial, for an amendment may be allowed and further evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Bookstaver, P. J., and BlSCHOFF, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Order affirmed so far as it reverses the judgment, and reversed so far as it dismisses the complaint, and new trial ordered, costs to abide \"event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
