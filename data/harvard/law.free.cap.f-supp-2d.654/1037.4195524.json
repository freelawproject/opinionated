(\u201cCadence\u201d). The Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cCAC\u201d) also names as defendants Cadence\u2019s former CEO, Michael J. Fister (\u201cFister\u201d), Senior Vice President and CFO Kevin Palatnik (\u201cPalatnik\u201d), former Executive Vice President and CAO William Porter (\u201cPorter\u201d), and former Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations, Kevin Bushby (\u201cBushby;\u201d collectively with other individuals, \u201cIndividual Defendants,\u201d and with Cadence, \u201cDefendants\u201d). Docket No. 39, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29. Plaintiffs, including lead plaintiff Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, are entities that purchased or acquired Cadence\u2019s publically traded securities during a period when, they allege, Cadence\u2019s share prices were fraudulently inflated. <em>See </em>CAC \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-15\">This Court now considers a Motion to Dismiss (\u201cMotion\u201d) filed by Defendants. Docket No. 43. Plaintiffs have submitted an Opposition, Docket No. 45, and Defendants have submitted a Reply, Docket No. 47. Having considered the papers of all parties, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 Motion, and the CAC is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-16\">II. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78t(a), and a regulation promulgated thereunder, Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 176-82. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants did this by improperly accounting for two of Cadence\u2019s major transactions that took place in the first half of 2008, by recognizing revenue in those quarters that Cadence had not yet earned, thereby overstating Cadence\u2019s earnings and inflating its stock prices. <em>See generally </em>CAC. It is undisputed that Cadence committed several accounting errors in the first and second quarters of 2008 (\u201cIQ\u201d and \u201c2Q,\u201d respectively), which required it to restate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>financial results for those quarters. <em>See </em>Mot. at 2. Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead that the errors were caused by fraud. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">\n<em>A. An Overview of Cadence and its Accounting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Cadence is a Delaware Corporation that develops electronic design automation software and hardware for electronics companies. CAC \u00b6 25. It is a publically traded company, traded on the NASDAQ. <em>Id. </em>Cadence\u2019s headquarters are located in San Jose, California, although it has additional offices around the world. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 59(e), 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Since 2006, Cadence has been marketing its technology through \u201cEDA cards,\u201d which augment an internet-based delivery mechanism for Cadence\u2019s software, and which allow its clients to utilize Cadence\u2019s technology for periods of time that are determined on a license-by-license basis. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 36. These cards are primarily offered in connection with two different types of licenses: term licenses and subscription licenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 36. These two types of licenses are different, both in terms of the scope of rights that they allow the licensee, and in terms of accounting recognition. As described in Cadence\u2019s 10-K for the fiscal year of 2007, a term license allows Cadence\u2019s customers to \u201c[a]ecess and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement, generally two to four years, with no rights to return.\u201d Appendix to CAC, Docket No. 40, Ex. 6 (\u201c2007 10-K\u201d) at 30. In other words, a term license allows a customer to use a defined set of software. <em>See id. </em>Subscription licenses, on the other hand, are more open ended, and allow both the \u201caccess and use [of] all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement,\u201d and the additional right to \u201c[u]se unspecified additional software products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">The accounting treatment for term and subscription licenses differs dramatically in terms of when revenue is supposed to be recognized, according to both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and Cadence\u2019s internal accounting policies (which purport to follow GAAP). <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. For a term license, revenue \u201cis recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. That is, a term license can give Cadence the ability to recognize revenue from the license right away, or at least within the quarter that the license was entered into. Revenue from a subscription license, on the other hand, must be recognized ratably over the entire term of the license. <em>Id. </em>As a rough hypothetical: If Cadence were to enter into one subscription license and one term license, each lasting for two years and each for $8 million, Cadence could immediately recognize an $8 million revenue for the term license. However, it would only be able to recognize $1 million of revenue per quarter for the subscription license. The party to the subscription license would also be allowed access to future technology made available over the two-year period, while the party to the term license would be more restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">Needless to say, the determination of whether a large license constitutes a term or subscription license may have substantial effects on the revenue that Cadence recognizes over a given quarter. The core of this suit is the accounting treatment of two transactions. Cadence has acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>edged that two licenses were incorrectly treated as term licenses even though they were in fact subscription licenses. One error occurred in the first quarter of 2008, and another error occurred in the second quarter of 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">B. <em>The First Quarter of2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Plaintiffs trace the chain of events that led to both of the accounting errors back to the third quarter of 2007. According to Plaintiffs, this is when Cadence began pulling revenue forward by \u201cshift[ing] its licensing model from subscription to term licenses to permit Cadence to immediately recognize a substantial portion of its licensing revenue up front, rather than rat-ably.\u201d Opp\u2019n at 3; CAC \u00b6 60. The \u201cshift\u201d involved persuading customers to enter into term, rather than subscription, licenses when negotiating new or renewed licensing contracts. CAC \u00b6 60(d). This sometimes entailed concessions that further depleted Cadence\u2019s future maintenance or service revenue streams. <em>Id. </em>However, it allowed Cadence to recognize revenue immediately, thereby boosting earnings in the short term. According to Plaintiffs, this created a \u201crevenue bubble,\u201d since Cadence had a limited client pool and could not enter into new contracts indefinitely; this strategy therefore traded long-term income stability for short-term gain. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 61. Plaintiffs contend that Cadence began to feel the negative effects of the revenue bubble during IQ of 2008, when it recognized that it would not be able to make its revenue guidance for 4Q of 2007, and lowered its guidance for 2008. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 37. Cadence stock fell by 33% after it announced these results, and several analysts expressed pessimism regarding the company. <em>Id. </em>at 38-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">During IQ of 2008, Cadence entered into a $24.8 million licensing agreement with an unspecified customer (the \u201cIQ agreement\u201d). Plaintiffs believe, based on the restated financial reports and several confidential witnesses from Cadence, that the contract was most likely entered into with a Japanese company, possibly Fujitsu. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cadence accounted for this transaction as it would a term license, i.e., by recognizing all $24.8 million of the revenue in IQ of 2008, rather than ratably over the term of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 55. However, the license was actually entered into in contemplation of another software arrangement that was not finalized until 3Q of 2008 (the \u201c3Q agreement\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56, 116; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 39 (\u201cDec. 10 Press Release\u201d) at 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Cadence would later conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-11\">[T]he term license arrangement executed during the first quarter and the subscription license arrangement executed during the third quarter collectively represented a multiple element arrangement. Because the subscription arrangement provides the customer with the right to use unspecified additional software products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement, Cadence determined that the revenue relating to this multiple element arrangement should be recognized during the term of the arrangement, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjP\">Dec. 10 Press Release at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">Plaintiffs also allege that the agreement contemplated certain \u201cincubation technolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>gy,\u201d which had not yet been released in IQ. CAC \u00b6 55. Contemplation of rights to a future technology further suggests that the license was more properly classified as a subscription, rather than term, license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Plaintiffs contend that this misclassification was deliberate, and that Individual Defendants knew that the IQ agreement should have been classified as a subscription license. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 56. Plaintiffs point out that, but for this error, Cadence would not have met its revenue projections for the IQ. <em>Id. </em>Management recognized that this was a large and important transaction for the company; indeed, Porter reflected during a conference call, before the error was revealed, that \u201cone customer accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue.\u201d <em>Id.-, </em>Appendix to CAC, Ex. 10 (\u201cIQ Conf. Call\u201d) at 4. Plaintiffs contend that this was the largest deal of IQ. CAC \u00b6 57.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">This first error led to many of the statements that Plaintiffs now claim were false and misleading. For example, on April 23, 2008, Cadence issued a press release stating that it had $287 million in revenue, and only suffered a $0.07 per share loss during IQ. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 42; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 9. On that same day, Fister and Porter hosted a conference call in which they repeated the erroneous financial results. CAC \u00b6 45; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 10. Two days later, Cadence filed its 10-Q for IQ, which again repeated the results. CAC \u00b6 51; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 14 (\u201cIQ 10-Q\u201d). All of the statements were false, because the revenue for the IQ agreement should not have been recognized at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">C. <em>The Second Quarter of2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">In 2Q of 2008, Cadence made a similar error, this time with respect to a $12 million transaction (the \u201c2Q agreement\u201d). CAC \u00b6\u00b6 93, 135-39. Plaintiffs do not identify any details regarding this transaction, or regarding the identity of the customer. However, Cadence later stated that the transaction involved a customer who was simultaneously cancelling a subscription license and executing a term license arrangement and hardware arrangement. Dec. 10 Press Release at 11. Cadence later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-10\">determined that, despite the cancellation of the subscription arrangement, the customer did not intend to substantively cancel its right to access future new technology because at the time the subscription license was cancelled the customer intended to reestablish its right to access future new technology at a later time. Accordingly, ... $12.0 million of revenue originally recognized in the second quarter of 2008 relating to the term license and hardware arrangement should be recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, consistent with the way in which revenue was recognized on the cancelled subscription arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">Plaintiffs claim that this error was the result of an intent to mislead the market and inflate Cadence\u2019s revenues. CAC \u00b6 94. Once again, Plaintiffs point out that, but for the error, Cadence would have missed its projections for 2Q. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 95. Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants were motivated to create a \u201crosy picture,\u201d to enhance its ability to take on debt that it needed to acquire a competitor, Mentor Graphics. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>This led to a number of allegedly fraudulent and misleading statements, similar to those identified by Plaintiffs with respect to IQ. For example, Cadence repeatedly and incorrectly stated financial results that incorporated the improperly recognized revenue \u2014 in press releases, in its 10-Q for 2Q, and in conference calls. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 91; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 19; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 20; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 24 (\u201c2Q 10-Q\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also in 2Q, Cadence again lowered its guidance for 2008 from $1.8 million to $1.4 million. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 74-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">D. <em>Subsequent Events and Disclosures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">On October 15, 2008, Cadence announced that Fister was resigning as President, CEO, and director of Cadence, that Bushby was resigning as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations, and that Porter was resigning as Executive Vice President and CAO. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 105; Appendix to CAC, Ex. 31 (\u201cOct. 15 Press Release\u201d) at 97-98. As Plaintiffs noted, \u201c[n]one of them appeared to be at retirement age, as Fister was 53, Bushy 52, and Porter 53, in 2008. At the time of the termination, none of them announced any other personal or professional opportunities that they were going to pursue.\u201d CAC \u00b6 108. The resignation of six executive officers (including three non-parties to this suit) was also reported in the announcement. Press Release at 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">One week later, on October 22, 2008, Cadence issued another press release, this time announcing that it had discovered the error regarding the IQ agreement, and that it was initiating an accounting review and postponing its 3Q financial results. Appendix to CAC, Ex. 32 (\u201cOct. 22 Press Release\u201d) at 89. The announcement read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-10\">Cadence initiated the review after preliminarily determining during its regular review of its third quarter results that approximately $24 million of revenue relating to these contracts was recognized during the first quarter of 2008, but should have been recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts commencing in the second quarter of 2008. Cadence expects to restate its financial statements for the first quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2008 to correct the revenue recognition with respect to these contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-12\">The restatements were eventually released on December 10, 2008. <em>See </em>Dec. 10 Press Release. In addition to exploring the impact of the error with respect to the IQ agreement, Cadence claimed that the review uncovered the error with respect to the 2Q agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-13\">Cadence suggested that the errors were, at least in part, the result of a communication and control failure. It announced that \u201cthe Company has identified a material weakness relating to the insufficient design and ineffective operation of certain internal controls over the recognition of revenue from term license agreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its first restated 10-Q, Cadence describes the material weakness in more detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-14\">The material weakness relates to both the insufficient design and ineffective operation of certain internal controls over the recognition of revenue from term license agreements. Specifically, the material weakness is comprised of the following components:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-15\">\u2022 Controls were not adequately designed to facilitate communication of all information pertinent to the negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>with customers between the sales and sales finance organizations and the personnel responsible for determining the appropriate recognition of the revenue related to such license agreements. As a result, controls relative to the sales and sales finance organizations reviewing, analyzing and evaluating available information pertinent to revenue recognition for term license agreements were not operating effectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-4\">\u2022 Controls were not adequately designed to detect or prevent the inappropriate issuance of evaluation licenses to customers for incubation technology. Incubation technology is not commercially available for release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">IQ 10-Q at 89. The 10-Q claims that, because of these weaknesses, management did not detect that the revenue from the IQ agreement was improperly recognized. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Cadence also announced several remedial measures that it would undertake to correct the deficiencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-7\">\u2022 Individuals who are part of the sales process will be required to take enhanced comprehensive, ongoing compliance training specific to our policies and procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-8\">\u2022 We will require additional analysis, communication, and accompanying documentation from our sales and sales finance organizations relating to recognition of revenue for term license agreements, with particular emphasis on transactions when factors are present that increase the risk that the transaction could be deemed to be a subset of a multiple element arrangement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-9\">\u2022 We will enhance our existing processes and controls with respect to evaluation licenses that are applied to all technology being evaluated by customers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-10\">\u2022 We will make certain personnel changes and increase supervision and training to effectuate the changes discussed above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">After additional adjustments, Plaintiffs calculate that Cadence\u2019s product revenue was overstated by 14.2% for IQ, and by 10.4% for 2Q. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 58,125. Immediately following the announcements, Cadence\u2019s stock dropped by 22%. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-13\">III. <em>Legal Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">A. <em>Motion to Dismiss Under 12(b)(6)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-15\">In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court must \u201caccept the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Gompper v. VISX, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 893, 895 (9th Cir.2002). The court\u2019s review is generally \u201climited to the complaint, materials incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which the court may take judicial notice.\u201d <em>Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-16\">B. <em>Pleading Standard Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-17\">Plaintiffs here seek to state a claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 176-80. This statute makes it unlawful for \u201cany person ... [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and Exchange] Commission may prescribe .... \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). One such rule prescribed by the Commission is Rule 10b-5, which states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person ... [t]o engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5(c). Plaintiffs must plead five elements to establish a violation of Rule 10b-5. Plaintiffs must demonstrate \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation or omission of fact, (2) scienter, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) transaction and loss causation, and (5) economic loss.\u201d <em>In re Daou Sys., </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir.2005). Plaintiffs\u2019 pleading with respect to these elements, and scienter in particular, \u201cmust satisfy the dual pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA.\u201d <em>Zueco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., </em>552 F.3d 981, 990 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">To allege fraud under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201ca party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind may be alleged generally.\u201d However, the PSLRA imposes a more exacting standard with respect to pleading falsity and scienter in the context of securities fraud. <em>Zucco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 990-91. In particular, in order to plead scienter, \u201cthe complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this title, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). The \u201crequired state of mind\u201d for establishing securities fraud is the knowing, intentional, or deliberately reckless disclosure of false or misleading statements. <em>See Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1014-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">The \u201cstrong inference\u201d standard does not require that the \u201cinference that tire defendant acted with scienter ... be irrefutable, i.e., of the \u2018smoking-gun\u2019 genre, or even the most plausible of competing inferences .... \u201d <em>Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, \u201cto determine whether a complaint\u2019s scienter allegations can survive threshold inspection for sufficiency, a court governed by [the PSLRA] must engage in a comparative evaluation; it must consider, not only inferences urged by the plaintiff ... but also competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 127 S.Ct. 2499. The plaintiff must plead facts such that \u201ca reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499. The Ninth Circuit has set out a \u201cdual inquiry\u201d to determine whether a \u201cstrong inference\u201d exists: First, \u201cdetermine whether any of the plaintiffs allegations, standing alone, are sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter; second, if no individual all\u00e9gations are sufficient, ... conduct a \u2018holistic\u2019 review of the same allegations to determine whether the insufficient allegations combine to create a strong inference of intentional or deliberate recklessness.\u201d <em>Zucco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">IY. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">Defendants\u2019 Motion focuses primarily on whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently plead scienter. Defendants do not here challenge the sufficiency of the CAC with respect to the connection between the false statements and the purchase of securities, loss causation, or damages. Plaintiffs have plead a number of facts that they hope can support a strong inference of scienter. The Court will address each of these facts separately below, and then assess these facts holistically.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>A. <em>Violations of GAAP and Internal Accounting Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Plaintiffs point to the fact that Cadence violated GAAP, as well as its own policies, to support an inference of scienter. Opp\u2019n at 13-14, 16-17. Cadence has admittedly done both of these things, as evidenced by the financial restatements. However, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that \u201cthe mere publication of inaccurate accounting figures, or a failure to follow GAAP, without more, does not establish scienter.\u201d <em>Provenz v. Miller, </em>102 F.3d 1478, 1490 (9th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Instead, \u201cplaintiffs must allege facts showing that ... the defendants knew specific facts at the time that rendered their accounting determinations fraudulent.\u201d <em>Rudolph v. UTStarcom, </em>560 F.Supp.2d 880, 889 (N.D.Cal.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">In order to establish scienter in this particular case, Plaintiffs must plead facts that supports an inference that Defendants were actually aware that (or reckless with respect to whether) the accounting was incorrect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In particular, Plaintiffs must plead facts that suggests that Defendants were aware that it was inappropriate to classify the IQ and 2Q agreements as term licenses. Defendants would have known this only if they were aware of certain details of the transactions. With respect to the IQ agreement, there must be a strong inference that Defendants knew (or at least suspected) that the IQ agreement was entered into in contemplation of a future subscription license, or that it involved a technology that was not yet released for commercial use. With respect to the 2Q agreement, Plaintiffs must allege facts that suggest that Defendants knew (or at least suspected) that the licensee intended to retain certain rights to use future technology, which it had enjoyed under a subscription licenses that it simultaneously cancelled. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations must, when taken as a whole, give rise to a \u201cstrong inference\u201d that Defendants were aware of these details' \u2014 otherwise, Defendants would have no way of knowing that the licenses were improperly classified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">B. <em>Confidential Witness Accounts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">The CAC is liberally peppered with the claims of, and asserted \u201ccorroboration\u201d by, seven confidential witnesses (\u201cCWs\u201d). The Ninth Circuit recently recounted the standards for evaluating complaints that rely upon CWs under the PSLRA. \u201cFirst, the confidential witnesses whose statements are introduced to establish scienter must be described with sufficient particularity to establish their reliability and personal knowledge. Second, those statements which are reported by confidential witnesses with sufficient reliability and personal knowledge must themselves be indicative of scienter.\u201d <em>Zucco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 995. Conclusory allegations that a defendant \u201cmust have known\u201d about particular wrongdoing are, standing alone, generally insufficient. <em>See Zucco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>The CAC provides a detailed background, history, and the title for each of the CWs. CAC \u00b6 45. For example, CW1 is a former Sales Administrator for Cadence, who held that position for fifteen years, and received and entered orders from Cadence\u2019s Sales/Finance organization. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 45(a). CW2 is a former Vice President of Finance, who served for eight years, and who reported to a Controller that reported to Palatnik. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 45(a). The Court finds that the description of each CW is adequate to support the generalized accounts that they provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">The next question is whether the CW accounts are actually indicative of scienter. No CW resembles a \u201cwhistle blower,\u201d or alleges that anyone within Cadence instructed them to do anything wrong. At most, several CWs suggest that several of the Individual Defendants \u201cmust have known\u201d about the transactions generally, or must have approved of the transaction or the accounting for them at some level. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59. To support this, the CWs describe the general accounting or approval practices within Cadence, as well as the various roles of the Individual Defendants. <em>See, e.g., </em>CAC \u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">No CW specifically ties any Defendant to the accounting determinations at issue. Several CWs suggest that the revenue recognition determinations would have been made in the San Jose office, and-according to CW3, it was the Revenue Accounting group in particular who \u201censured the revenue was documented as ratable or upfront.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59(b). This group was overseen by a Vice President of Finance who reported to Palatnik. <em>Id. </em>CW4 states that, \u201cgiven the size of the contracts\u201d in question, \u201cdefendants had knowledge of them by at least approving the deals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59(e). CW2 suggests that deals of this magnitude \u201cwould definitely\u201d have been reviewed by Porter as well as Palatnik. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59(a). CW7 states that \u201cPorter or Palatnik \u2018signed off on big stuff in terms of revenue recognition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59(e). There is no indication of what \u201csigning off\u2019 or approval within Cadence \u201cwould have\u201d entailed, or what level of detail the Individual Defendants would have likely been exposed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">Similarly, CW1 and CW7 describe Cadence\u2019s forecasting bookings and financial reporting systems, which they claim the senior executives had access to. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 62. However, there is no description as to the level of detail in these systems (except to state vaguely that \u201cCadence had always been \u2018very meticulous\u2019 about deals coming in\u201d), or whether the key facts that rendered Cadence\u2019s accounting inaccurate were actually included in these reports, or even whether these facts \u201cwould have\u201d normally been reflected in the systems. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 62(a). None of the CWs suggest that these systems reflected that either of the licenses at issue were or should have been subscription licenses at any time. The mere fact that these systems would have reflected that a $24.8 million deal was in the pipeline, and that it involved either a term or subscription license, would not have raised a red flag for Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Finally, several CWs claim that various Individual Defendants often worked closely with, or \u201cput [their] time in with customers.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 65. For example, CW2 states that Fister was commonly involved in deal negotiations with customers and that Bushby was definitely involved in helping negotiate deals with customers. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59(a). These statements do not link any Defendant with any particular customer or deal, however. The closest that any CW comes is to suggest that \u201cFister and Porter regularly met with Japanese Customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 65(a). These statements do not offer any more than a basis for speculating that Individual Defendants may have worked, at some level, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>deals that involved the licenses that were incorrectly classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">In summary, the CW reports do not provide any concrete allegations that Individual Defendants actually knew about the accounting errors, or that they were familiar with the key details of the IQ or 2Q agreements, such that they could have identified them as subscription contracts. Their value to Plaintiffs is diminished by this lack of detail \u2014 it is difficult to discern exactly how familiar any Individual Defendant \u201cmust have been\u201d with the key transactions, particularly given the fact that Individual Defendants may have only been connected to the IQ and 2Q agreements through a long chain that \u201cinvolved multiple personnel and levels of review.\u201d CAC \u00b6 98.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Standing alone, these accounts cannot support a strong inference of scienter. However, the Court will consider these accounts as part of its holistic review of the entire CAC, in Part IV. F, <em>infra. See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 322, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (\u201c[Cjourts must consider the complaint in its entirety .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">C. <em>The Size and Importance of the IQ and 2Q Agreements, and Individual Defendants\u2019 Position Within Cadence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Plaintiffs argue that the restatements of revenue may, in and of themselves, provide evidence of scienter. Opp\u2019n at 14-16. They point to the size of the transactions in question \u2014 the largest in IQ and among the largest in 2Q \u2014 as well as the Individual Defendants\u2019 positions within the company, and their hands-on approach to dealing with clients. <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit has previously rejected complaints that allege that \u201cfacts critical to a business\u2019s core operations or an important transaction generally are so apparent that their knowledge may be attributed to the company and its key officers.\u201d <em>Zucco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 1000 (quoting <em>In re Read-Rite Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>335 F.3d 843, 848 (9th Cir.2003)). This argument is sometimes referred to as the \u201ccore operations inference.\u201d <em>See South Ferry LP v. Killinger, </em>542 F.3d 776, 784 (9th Cir.2008). On its own, this inference generally does not suffice to state a claim under the PSLRA, however the Ninth Circuit has spelled out two exceptions, which Plaintiffs argue are both applicable to these facts. Opp\u2019n at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">First, the inference may be combined with allegations regarding management\u2019s role in the company that are \u201cparticular and suggest that the defendants had actual access to the disputed information .... \u201d <em>Zucco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 1000 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiffs recite several comments from CWs and Individual Defendants alike to suggest that Individual Defendants \u201cspent time\u201d with customers. <em>See, e.g., </em>CAC \u00b6 65. They also describe the general roles that Individual Defendants had within the approval process, largely through CW accounts. <em>See </em>Part IV. B, <em>supra. </em>The Court has already discussed this information, and it concludes that, in and of itself, Plaintiffs have insufficiently described roles that would give rise to a strong inference that Defendants possessed the relevant facts. None of these statements suggest that any defendant was deeply involved in the details of any particular transaction, or was involved with the customers in question, such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>they were likely to know first hand the facts that were key to categorizing the IQ and 2Q agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">The second exception that may allow plaintiffs to rely on the \u201ccore operations inference\u201d allows an inference of scienter \u201cwhere the nature of the relevant fact is of such prominence that it would be absurd to suggest that management was without knowledge of the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1001. This is not such a case. This is not a situation in which key customers threatened to halt or discontinue key contracts, such that the management must have been put on notice. <em>Cf. Berson v. Applied Signal Tech., Inc., </em>527 F.3d 982 (9th Cir.2008) (finding it \u201cabsurd\u201d to suggest that management was unaware of major government stop-work orders, where company relied exclusively on government for revenues). Rather, this is a case in which the details of licensing negotiations, and the relationship of license agreements with other arrangements, affected the way that the agreements should have been accounted for. As the Ninth Circuit stated in <em>Zucco Partners, </em>the \u201cmisrepresentations are largely definitional, [so] the falsity of the original representations would not be immediately obvious to corporate management\u201d unless they were familiar with the details of the underlying agreements. 552 F.3d at 1001 (rejecting core operations inference and contrasting Berson). Consequently, the Court concludes that the core operations inference cannot apply here, although the Court shall consider the size of the misstatements and the fact of the restatements in the context of the entire CAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">D. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motive to Manipulate the Accounting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Plaintiffs point out that Defendants had a strong incentive to meet Wall Street expectations and Cadence\u2019s own guidance. Opp\u2019n at 18-19. As previously noted, Cadence would have missed its own guidance in IQ and 2Q if it had not been for the accounting errors. <em>See </em>Part II. B-C, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiffs also claim that Cadence needed to present a \u201crosy picture\u201d in order to acquire the debt necessary to consummate the acquisition of Mentor Graphics. CAC \u00b6 69-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">Although the CAC here articulates a coherent explanation for why Defendants may have committed fraud, this is not enough to state a claim for securities fraud under the PSLRA. \u201c[A]llegations of a motive to present better financial statements to secure credit or to engage in similar business activities are insufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter.\u201d <em>In re Calpine Corp. Secs. Litig., </em>288 F.Supp.2d 1054, 1087 (N.D.Cal.2003) (citing <em>Lipton v. Pathogenesis Corp., </em>284 F.3d 1027, 1038 (9th Cir.2002); <em>In re Vantive Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>283 F.3d 1079, 1097 (9th Cir.2002)). These facts certainly make the inference of scienter more compelling than it otherwise would have been, but they do not suffice to make a strong showing of scienter. <em>See In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Although facts showing mere recklessness or a motive to commit fraud and opportunity to do so may provide some reasonable inference of intent, they are not sufficient to.establish a strong inference of deliberate recklessness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">E. <em>The Resignation of Executive Officers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">Plaintiffs claim that the resignation of six executive officers in October of 2008, which came one week prior to Cadence\u2019s announcement that it would need to restate its financial statements, strengthens the inference of scienter. Opp\u2019n at 22. \u2018Where a resignation occurs slightly before or after the defendant corporation issues a restatement, a plaintiff must plead facts refuting the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>assumption that the resignation occurred as a result of [the] restatement\u2019s issuance itself in order for a resignation to be strongly indicative of scienter.\u201d <em>Zucco Partners, 552 </em>F.3d at 1002 (citing <em>In re U.S. Aggregates, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>235 F.Supp.2d 1063, 1074 (N.D.Cal.2002)). In other words, \u201ca plaintiff must allege sufficient information to differentiate between a suspicious change in personnel and a benign one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Here, Plaintiffs cite a number of facts suggesting that the three Individual Defendants who resigned were forced out. For example, none of the three were at retirement age, and none announced post-resignation plans. CAC \u00b6 108. However, as Plaintiffs have amply demonstrated, Cadence\u2019s performance leading up to the restatement had not been stellar, and immediately after the resignations, an analyst commented that the \u201cleadership paid the price for its poor performance this year.\u201d Appendix to CAC, Ex. 33. It is therefore quite plausible to infer that the resignations, however forced, were the result of the company\u2019s poor performance and management. This could have been accentuated by the discovery of an innocent or negligent accounting failure, just as it could have followed the exposure of fraud. The Court finds that the resignations were not, in and of themselves, strongly indicative of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">F. <em>\u201cHolistic\u201d Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">When taken collectively, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not raise a strong inference that Defendants intentionally falsified Cadence\u2019s financial reports. The fact that the IQ and 2Q agreements were quite large does lend credence to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, as one would expect Cadence personnel to be more thorough in such situations. Plaintiffs have also established a coherent motive to commit fraud. Finally, Plaintiffs have certainly created a strong inference that Defendants were aware of the IQ and 2Q agreements generally. However, the inference of scienter is fatally undermined by Plaintiffs\u2019 inability to connect any of the Individual Defendants, or any particular person at Cadence, with the IQ and 2Q agreements, except in remote or speculative ways that may or may not have entailed knowledge of the specific facts that rendered the accounting classifications incorrect. This deficiency leaves a gap, for which Plaintiffs provide little more than motive and opportunity to bridge. There is little basis to infer that any Defendant had knowledge of the facts that rendered the recognition of revenue improper (unless one were to presume that the Defendants had knowledge of all of the details that surround all of the company\u2019s major agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-11\">The Court finds that the inference of a specific intent to defraud the public remains weaker than the inference that, as Cadence claimed, there was simply a control deficiency within the troubled Company, which was not discovered until the accountants started reviewing the 3Q agreement that, as it turned out, was connected with the IQ agreement. Plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action, for violation of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, is therefore DISMISSED.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-12\">G. <em>Control Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">Plaintiffs also bring a claim against Individual Defendants for control liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>U. S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). Under this section, \u201ca defendant employee of a corporation who has violated the securities laws will be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff, as long as the plaintiff demonstrates a primary violation of federal securities law and that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator.\u201d Zu<em>cco Partners, </em>552 F.3d at 990 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">\u201cSection 20(a) claims may be dismissed summarily ... if a plaintiff fails to adequately plead a primary violation of section 10(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re VeriFone Sec. Litig., </em>11 F.3d 865, 872 (9th Cir.1993)). Plaintiffs have failed to plead a primary violation of securities laws or regulations. Plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action for violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">V. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Because Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that give rise to a strong inference that Defendants intentionally falsified Cadence\u2019s financial data, the Consolidated Amended Complaint is hereby DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Plaintiffs may file a Second Amendment Complaint within thirty (30) days of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">.

Plaintiffs point out that when the financial report for IQ of 2008 was restated, the reported revenue for Japan was most strongly affected. CAC \u00b6 59.

With respect to the scienter of Cadence itself, although the Ninth Circuit has apparently left room for Plaintiffs to plead \"collective scienter\u201d in some narrow circumstances, it has strongly suggested that Plaintiffs must state facts that support a strong inference that \"at least <em>some </em>corporate official knew of the falsity ....\u201d <em>See Glazer Capital Mgmt., LP v.
