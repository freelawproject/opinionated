The testimony was in conflict whether the statutory signal by whistle or bell had been given, and on that subject the justice presiding at the trial instructed the jury, after referring to the condition of the case, as follows: \u201cNow these are the circumstances under which you are to determine whether the statutory signal was sufficient to give reasonable warning to travelers of the approach of the train. If you conclude that the mere statutory duty was not adequate warning to the travelers on the street, then you ask yourselves the further question, Did the persons in charge of the train give such other signal as would give reasonable warning?\u201d And again, further on in the charge, the jury was told, \u201cIf you think they did not give such warning as the statute requires, <em>or as you think was required </em>by all the circumstances over and above the statutory warning, and that the accident resulted from their neglect to give this warning, then you have a basis on which the defendant could be held responsible in this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">This instruction that left it as a question to be decided by the jury whether, as applied to the features of the case before them, the blowing.of the whistle and the ringing of the bell in the manner prescribed in the act, was plainly erroneous. It is in direct opposition to the principle settled by the Court of Errors in the ease of <em>New York, &amp;c., R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Leaman, 25 Vroom </em>202, 207. The concluding paragraph of the opinion read in that case thus enunciates the adjudged rule: \u201cWhen the prescribed audible signals are given in conformity with the statute, whether they are heard or heeded by a traveler crossing the track or not, the company is absolved from negligence so far as concerns this kind of audible warning of the approach of its trains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Ifc follows, as a necessary consequence in the present case, that the jury having been misinstructed in this important particular, there must be a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
