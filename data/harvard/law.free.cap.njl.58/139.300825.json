WILLIAM S. HANCOCK, COMPTROLLER OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, ET AL.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b171-6\">The title of an act being \u201cAn act to fax intestates\u2019 estates, gifts, legacies and collateral inheritance in certain cases <em>\"\u2014Held, </em>that the title did not express a purpose to tax real estate devised, and the provisions of the act for that purpose were therefore invalid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b171-8\">Argued at February Term, 1895, before Justices Dixon and Lippincott.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-9\">For the prosecutor, <em>James M.

L., p. </em>206), and the act revising and amending the same in <em>Pamph. L. </em>1893, <em>p. </em>367.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">The present tax was levied upon real estate in the city of Newark devised to the prosecutrix in fee-simple by the will of her stepfather, who died seized May 4th, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">The only question raised is whether the provisions of these acts for imposing a tax upon a <em>devise of lands </em>are within the object expressed in the title. If they are not, they are invalid under our constitution. <em>Dobbins </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>21 <em>Vroom </em>496.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">Of the four subjects \u2018of taxation mentioned in the title\u2014the first, \u201cintestates\u2019 estates,\u201d and the last, \u201ccollateral inheritance,\u201d exclude transfers by will <em>(Horner </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>387, 413); the second, \u201cgifts,\u201d indicates delivery in the life<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>time of the donor (8 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Encycl. L., p. </em>1313), and the third, <em>\u201c </em>legacies,\u201d is confined to personal property (13 <em>Id. </em>9). None of them embraces lands devised, and hence the provisions of the statutes for imposing a tax upon such devolutions of property must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The defect here indicated is avoided in the act of May 15th, 1894, but as that does not apply to property passing by will before the approval of the act, it does not affect the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The tax must be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
