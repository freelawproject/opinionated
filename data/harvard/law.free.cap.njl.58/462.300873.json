The motion was overruled, and the state was permitted to supply the omitted date by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">The court is of opinion that the judicial course taken at the trial was wholly unobjectionable. The date was a mere form, in nowise incorporated with the crime as a constituent part of it. Such a slip as this was cured by the provision in the act relating to Criminal Procedure, which declares <em>\u201c </em>that no indictment for any offence shall be held insufficient for omitting to state the time at which the offence was committed, in any case where time is not of the essence of the offence.-\u201d <em>Gen. Stat., </em>p. 1128, <em>pl. </em>42.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">The forty-third section of the same statute authorizes amendments to be made in such instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
