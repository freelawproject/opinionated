Nothing short of personal examination by him and his decision based thereon will warrant him in attempting to fix upon the owner the obligation which the ordinance is intended to impose. Without such an examination he has no authority to decide, and his decision has, therefore, no binding force. Hence, such inspection becomes an essential fact, to be alleged in the complaint against the owner, and to be proved upon his trial for failing to obey the determination of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In the proceedings under review, it was neither alleged nor proved that the building inspector had inspected the building of the prosecutrix. Consequently, they are irregular, and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">As the city was not a party to the complaint, no costs will be awarded against it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
