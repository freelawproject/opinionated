His title' rests upon an election held April 4th, 1893, in Road District No. 1 of the township in accordance with an act approved March 1st, 1893. <em>Pamph.

It follows from this decision that the election upon which the relator\u2019s claim de-. pends did not give him a legal title to the office, without which, of course, he cannot obtain a writ of <em>mandamus </em>to put him in possession. <em>High Extr. Rem., ch. </em>1, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The rule to show cause must be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
