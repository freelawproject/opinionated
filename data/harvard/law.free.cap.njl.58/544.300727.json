McCALLUM, ASSESSOR OF THE BOROUGH OF CHISELHURST, v. THE COUNTY BOARD OF ASSESSORS OF CAMDEN COUNTY.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-6\">A resolution by a board of assessors adding one lump sum to the value of real estate, and another to that of the personal estate contained in a duplicate, receives no support from section 140 of the General Tax law <em>{Gen. Stat., p. </em>3309), and is without authority and void.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\">On <em>certiorari </em>in matter of taxation.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b576-8\">Argued at November Term, 1895, before Justices Garrison and Lippincott.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-9\">For the prosecutor, <em>John F.

Stat., p. </em>3309), the board of assessors may, upon the establishment of certain facts with respect to the value of the property contained in any duplicate, <em>\u201c </em>add thereto such percentage as shall appear to them just and proper.\u201d In the ease in hand, the action of the board consisted in the adoption of a resolution that <em>\u201c </em>$50,000 be added to the assessment of real estate and $1,000 be added to the assessment of personal property of the borough of Chiselhurst.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">There appears to have been no attempt to follow the rule laid down by the legislature, and no authority can be found anywhere for any action not founded upon a strict compliance therewith. <em>Trask v. Carragan, </em>8 <em>Vroom </em>264; <em>Weehawken </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>7 <em>Id. </em>86; <em>West Hoboken </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>9 <em>Id. </em>173, 175; <em>Clark Thread Co. </em>v. <em>Kearny Township, </em>26 <em>Id. </em>50.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The motion to quash the <em>allocatur </em>rests upon no apparent foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The action of the defendant in the respect above mentioned is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
