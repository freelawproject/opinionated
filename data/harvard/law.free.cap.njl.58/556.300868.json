We see no reason for taking the opinion of a second jury on the disputed questions. If the contention of the defendants be correct, viz., that there was no case for a jury, that may with propriety be set up on proceedings in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">The applications for a new trial are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
