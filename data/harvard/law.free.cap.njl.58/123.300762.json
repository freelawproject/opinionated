THE OCEAN GROVE CAMP MEETING ASSOCIATION.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b155-5\">A <em>certiorari </em>directed to the judges of a Court of Common Pleas commanding them to send up, under their seals, a certain judgment pronounced by them is not obeyed by filing in this court a narrative of the action signed by the attorneys in the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b155-7\">Argued at February Term, 1895, before Justices \u2019Van Syckel, Magie and Garrison.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-8\">For the prosecutor, <em>Samuel A.

There is on file, as shown by the printed case, a paper signed by the attorneys, giving, as they understand it, a history of'the action. Such narrative cannot, however, constitute the basis upon which this court can either approve or condemn the course of judicial conduct below.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">Our writ is explicit; it states what is to be sent up, by whom, and how. It is difficult to see by what process of reasoning the direction \u201c that you send under your seals \u201d addressed to judicial officers with respect to a judgment pronounced by them can be interpreted to mean <em>\u201c </em>a state of faot that may be agreed upon by the attorneys in the case.\u201d The question is not one of form; it is fundamental in every view that can be taken of the function and practice of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Staten Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>316, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The writ will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
