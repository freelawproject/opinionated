SHIMER ET AL., PROSECUTORS, v. THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF PHILLIPSBURG ET AL.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-4\">To authorize a lease of the real estate owned by the town of Phillipsburg to be made to a private person, the common council must first pass an ordinance directing such lease to be executed ; it cannot be done by resolution.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b538-6\">Argued at November Term, 1895, before Justices Depue, Van Syckel and Gummere.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-7\">For the prosecutors, <em>Sylvester C. .Smith </em>and <em>John I. B. JBeiley.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-8\">For the defendants, <em>George M. Shipman </em>and <em>William H. Walters.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"ANnK\">Van Syckel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atj\">The common council of Phillipsburg, by resolution, granted a lease of a tract of land owned by the town to one Jacob B. Smith for business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The object of this writ is to set aside the action of the common council.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The charter of the town gives the \u201c inhabitants of the town of Phillipsburg, by their corporate name the right <em>i </em>to purchase, receive, hold and convey any estate, real or personal, for the public use of said corporation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">The power given to common council is that it shall be lawful for the common council, by a majority of votes, to pass and enforce by-laws and ordinances \u201c to regulate, manage and control the finances and property, real and personal, of the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">A lease is a conveyance of real estate, and the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>convey is vested in the inhabitants of the town in their corporate name.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The management and control of the real estate is lodged in the common council, and the only mode pointed out for exercising that power is by ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">This excludes the right to proceed by resolution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>6 <em>Vroom </em>205; <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>25 <em>Id. </em>102.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">It is necessary that the common council shall, before any conveyance is made, authorize it to be done by ordinance passed in due form. That is a right which belongs to the council under the authority given to manage and control the real estate of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The proceedings taken to lease the land in question did not conform to the requirements of the town charter, and must therefore be set aside, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In <em>State, Gregory, pros., </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>5 <em>Vroom </em>390, this court, on <em>certiorari </em>prosecuted by a taxpayer, set aside the resolution of the board of aldermen of Jersey City directing the purchase of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Mr. Justice Depue, who delivered the opinion of the court in that case, said that a contract entered into with a municipal corporation, in violation of the provisions of its charter as to the mode of entering upon the contract, is void, although it relates to a subject-matter with respect to which the corporate authorities have capacity to contract. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
