The note had been deposited by the holder, in a bank at Brooklyn for collection, and upon its dishonor, a notice of protest was put in the post-'office at Brooklyn by a clerk of the bank, acting for the notary, directed to the defendant, \u201c 13 Cliambers-st., New York.\u201d In an action against the defendant, <em>held, </em>that,the service of notice was sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b105-9\"><em>Held also, </em>that the addition of \u201c 13 Chambers-street,\u201d to the indorsement, must be regarded as a direction as to the place where notice was to be sent in case of the dishonor of the note, and that the service of notice was therefore in compliance with the directions of the indorser.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b105-10\">Notice of protest sent to the post-office, where the indorser usually receives his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>letters, although in a different town from that in which he may reside, ia a valid and sufficient service.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b106-5\">In an action by the indorsee of a promissory note against the indorser, service of notice of protest upon the indorser is not excused by showing that the indorser and maker had been partners in business, and the note was given for a partnership debt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b106-6\">(Before Duer, Mason, and Campbell, J.

Silliman as notary public of the Long Island Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-13\">It appeared in the cross-examination, that the witness was not a notary public, but was' in the habit of protesting notes and serving notices of .protest at the request of Mr. Silliman, the notary, and that he had protested the note in suit, and served the notice of protest, at his request; that he did not know the reputed place of residence of the defendant,- and was guided by the indorsement upon the note in the service of notice. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>knew some years before that the defendant lived in-Brooklyn, and had \u2019never-heard of -his-removing from that city. After proof of the amount of interest, the plaintiff .rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">It appeared in evidence, on the part of the .defendant, that the defendant has resided in Brooklyn for a number of years, and resided there at the time of the protest of the note in suit; but that he carried on business in New York, and received-his letters - at the post-office -in that city. It- also .appeared that at that time his office, was at .75 Nassau-street, although formerly it was at 13 Chambers-street. \u25a0 The defendant rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">The plaintiff, then-proved, that in the fall of 1845 the defendant and Edward Lynch,-the maker'of the note, became partners in the carrying on of a distillery, and continued to be partners until January, 1846; and. that in the Course-of that,business, they were in the habit of giving notes made by Lynch and indorsed by the defendant; that the note \u2018in suit was given for materials and labor furnished during the partnership, towards the erection of the distillery. This evidence was objected to by-defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The' plaintiff again rested his.case; when the defendant\u2019s coun-sel called-Mr..

Although his residence was in Brooklyn, yet his place of business was in the city of New York; and it is also in evidence that he received his letters from the post-office in New York. It has been held, and we think correctly, that notice of protest of a note should be sent to the post-office where the indorser usually receives his letters, although in a different town from that in which he resides. <em>(Ransom v. Mack, 2 </em>Hill, 591.) The object of giving notice is to apprise the party of the'fact as soon as possible, and an indorser would have just reason to complain if he should be held by a notice directed to a post-office to which he is not in the habit of resorting, though in the same town where he resides, instead of the place from which it is known that he receives his letters, but which is out of the geographical bounds of the township in which he resides. Besides, the addition by the defendant of the words \u201c13 Chambers-street,\u201d beneath his indorsement, could have no other meaning than a direction as to the place where notice should be sent in case of the dishonor of the note, and the notice put in the post-office addressed to him, as was the notice in this case, to No. 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Chambers-street, was given strictly in compliance with his directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The referee erred in admitting proof of the original consideration of the note, for the purpose of rendering the defendants liable as partners. <em>(National Bank </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>1 Hill, 577.) The plaintiff, who was a mere indorser of the note, could not sue on the original consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Yet as the defendant Husson was liable as indorser, the report of the referee was right and must be confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
