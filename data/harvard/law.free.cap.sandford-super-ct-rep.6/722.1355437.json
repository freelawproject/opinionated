The answer stated that plaintiff contracted with defendant to blast off the rock and stone, to enable cellars to be made and buildings erected on the premises, and, among other things, defendant was to have the rock obtained in blasting. Defendant '\u2019accordingly went on and continued blasting the rock by plaintiff\u2019s direction and assent until forbidden by him. And that by the contract the rock and stone belonged to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-10\">The reply alleged that the defendant offered to do the mason work for three houses on these premises, for $3100, and plaintiff then said to him, that he would give -him the contract for such mason work, if he pleased plaintiff in some buildings he was erecting for plaintiff. No binding bargain was made, but defendant immediately commenced blasting the rock and stone. In a short time, defendant notified plaintiff he would not build the houses, and the latter not being pleased with his work on the other buildings, contracted with one Courter for the mason work of the three houses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-11\">The cause was tried by a referee, who reported that the defendant entered on the lot, which was vacant and unoccupied, in the expectation entertained by both parties, that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>have the contract for building the houses, and he commenced and continued the excavation under this expectation, till about the time notice was given to him to cease. That in so entering, it was at the risk of his not obtaining the contract, and not having obtained it, he was liable to the plaintiff for the value of the stone taken away, which the referee found\u2019was $49.33. That the defendant was not liable for a malicious trespass, and therefore the referee reported in favor of the plaintiff for $49.33 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-5\">Each party claimed to recover costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b735-6\"><em>H.

The answer admits the plaintiff\u2019s title unequivocally. It attempts to justify what has been done, by a contract made with the plaintiff to blast the rock on his land and remove it out of his way so that he might build houses there, and as part of his reward for his labor, the rock removed was to be the defendant\u2019s. This sets up no title to the rock in the land, nor to any part of the freehold. It is a contract to do certain acts on the plaintiff\u2019s land, as his laborer or servant, and for his benefit. If there were such a contract, the defendant had a right to enter on the land to do the Work. If there were none, his entry was a trespass. His claim is no more than a license. It does not savor of title. His claim to the stone is not that he had any right or title to them as stone or rock in the plaintiff\u2019s soil, or as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>a part of the soil. Before they were blasted out, he could not mark out or designate any portion of the rock or stone which was his or would ever become his under the contract. His claim of right to them was a mere corollary to the execution of his contract to do labor for the plaintiff, and arose from its execution. It was thus a claim to the rock after it was removed and blasted, not to rock attached to the freehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>1 Code Rep. N. S. 172, to which we were referred, the defendant\u2019s claim was, that the title to the growing shrubs, roots, &amp;c., was in him, and had never been out of him or in the plaintiff. It was as much a claim of title to a part of the freehold, as if it had been made of a'city lot reserved out of his sale and conveyance of a larger tract to Powell. If, in that case, Rust had conceded that Powell owned the shrubs, roots, &amp;c., and had justified upon a contract by which he was to remove them from Powell\u2019s land in order to turn it to some other use, and was to have the shrubs as a part of the price of his labor in removing them, the case would have been like the one before me, and I think the learned and respected court which passed upon it would have held the defendants entitled to costs. The statement of right in the answer is not as strong as that made by one entering upon and claiming land under an executory contract of sale, which it is held does not constitute a claim of title. <em>(Dolittle </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>7 Barb. S. C. R. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The fact that the plaintiff\u2019s lots were vacant and unoccupied, gives him no right to costs. The rule on which he relies was applied to wild lands, under the old system of pleading, but it is now inapplicable, because if the defendant do not in his answer deny the plaintiff\u2019s possession or title, he need give no proof on-the subject. Here neither was denied, so that no proof of title became necessary in consequence of the land being unoccupied. The cases cited show that where the possession of wild land is put in issue, the title is also in issue, because the plaintiff, to show possession, must prove his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The defendant is entitled to the costs of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
