That he, the plaintiff, claims that the appointment made by his father, James Thomson, is illegal and void, and that he is entitled to his portion of the personal estate in like manner as if his father had died without making any appointment, and that he has demanded the same of the surviving trustee, which he refused to give and assign over to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-6\">The defendant demurred to the complaint, insisting,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-7\">1st. That James Thomson, the second, the father of the plaintiff, had the right and power, under his father\u2019s will, by law, to make the will and appointment alleged in the complaint to' have been made by him. 2d. That the will and appointment alleged in the complaint to have been made by James Thomson, the second, is a valid will and appointment in law, and the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought and demanded by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-8\">The cause by consent was referred to Hon. Samuel Jones, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>late chief justice of this court, as sole referee, to hear and determine the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0BO\">The referee reported, that the complaint does state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action; that James Thomson, the father of the plaintiff, had no power under his father\u2019s will to make the appointment set forth in the complaint; that the appointment of James Thomson, the father of the plaintiff, set forth, in the complaint, is an invalid appointment and'utterly illegal and void; and that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\">Judgment having been entered on this report, in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant appealed to the general term. \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-7\"><em>Geo. S. Stitt, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-8\">I. The complaint asks that defendant be ordered to assign to the plaintiff, his portion of the personal estate, the same as though James Thomson the 2d had made no appointment. Is the appointment valid ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-9\">This question involves two others. 1st, does the appointment 'contravene the intention of the testator, James Thomson the elder ? or 2d, does it create a perpetuity or an unlawful limitation?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-10\">As to the 1st question:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-11\">II. The will gives the power to James Thomson the 2d, to select any of his <em>children </em>or <em>grandchildren </em>as the persons to whom certain funds shall be transferred, and to fix the \u201c time or age\u201d and \u201c manner\u201d and \u201c shares,\u201d &amp;c., when and in which such transfer shall be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-12\">III. The appointment in question designates the time or age, by directing the trustee to convey to each son a moiety, when each shall have attained a certain age, (45.) This is the appointment, or clause in the appointment, on which this case depends. The subsequent clause, providing for the contingency of the death of the son of the appointor, has nothing to do with this case. The complaint asks for a present vested right. Now 'as the will of the elder James gives the son unrestricted power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>as to Eie designation of the age at which his child shall be entitled to a transfer of the fund, the appointment is plainly in accordance with the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">IY. To consider the 2d question. Is the appointment illegal, as creating an illegal limitation ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-6\">In Cruise\u2019s Digest, the rule is laid down in sections 32 to 35 of Oh. 24, Title 32, that a valid remainder may be limited upon an estate for life given to an unborn person, and that a limitation for life to one, and at his death, for life to an unborn person, is good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-7\">Y. The power in James Thomson the 2d, is a power in gross, and could be barred and extinguished by a fine and other modes of conveyance. (See Sugden on Powers, pp. 71, 73.) Therefore there was not an absolute limitation of the estate, beyond one life in being. We must bear in mind that the will and the appointment are to be construed and governed by the laws in existence at the death of the testator, James Thomson the elder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-8\">YI. The estate given to James Thomson the 2d was not a mere life estate. The power of appointment given to him by the will, in connection with the life estate, vested in him an interest, different from, and of more value, than the life estate, in the benefits which the exercise of the power enabled him to bestow. (Sugden on Powers, 72.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-9\">YII. If the clause in the appointment providing for the contingency of the sons not living to the age of 45 years, be bad and invalid, then the sons have a vested interest in the funds in question, and the appointment in question in this case is valid. <em>(Burrill </em>v. <em>Sheil, </em>2 Barbour\u2019s Rep. 457.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-10\">. YIII. Where a perpetuity is attempted in a will, the courts will not, if they can avoid it, construe the devise void, but expound the will in such a manner as to carry the testator\u2019s intentions into effect as far as the rules respecting perpetuities will allow.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-11\">This is the doctrine of cy pr\u00e9s. (Bouvier\u2019s Law Diet., Cy pr\u00e9s.) This doctrine applies to wills of personal as well as real estate. <em>(Attorney General </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>1 Vern. R. 248; Story\u2019s Eq. Juris. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>1169; <em>Inglis </em>v. <em>The Trustees, </em>&amp;c., 3 Peters R. 99; 3 Ves. Jr. 141, <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Whitchurch; Gott </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>7 Paige, 535.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-5\"><em>W. H. Jansen, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-6\">I. The appointment of James Thomson, under the will of his father, is bad, because it suspends the power of alienation beyond the period the testator could haye tied up his estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">At common law, there could be no limitation of chattels personal, but the gift of them carried the absolute property. (2 Black. Com. 897; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 352, 420.) But this rule had been so far relaxed, that a limitation over might be made previous to the revised statutes, but such limitations were always more jealously watched than limitations of real estate. The utmost extent to which they had gone was to limit a remainder upon a life estate, although there was a general disposition in the courts to place limitations of real and personal property upon the same foundation, and which since, the revised statutes have done. (Vide <em>Jackson, </em>ex. dem., <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>16 John. 585, 586.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-8\">The position is then taken, that the law relating to the two kinds of estates, which is to govern in the decision of this question, is the same, and is argued upon that assumption. As the testator died in 1825, the law existing previous to the Rev. Stat. will govern in a great measure, if'not entirely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-9\">By the law, as it then existed, real estate could only be tied up for one or more lives in being, and 21 years and 9 months after the time of the testator\u2019s death. (Cruise\u2019s Dig. vol. 4, page 1.61; 2 Cow. 333.) Assuming that personal property could be limited only in the same way, the testator could only in this case render inalienable the fund during that time \u2014 and his son, James Thomson, by appointment, could do no mo re.. But in this case, by the appointment of the son, the estate has been rendered inalienable during the lifetime of the appointor and his mother, and from and after their death, until the plaintiff and his brother arrive at the age of forty-five years, which will be about twenty-six years after the death of the appointor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>His mother, in the case of the plaintiff, and of twenty-eight years in the case of the plaintiff\u2019s brother Henry, which is, as before said, a longer period than'an estate at that time could be rendered inalienable. <em>(Routledge v. Dorrell, </em>2 Ves. Jr. 359 ; 1 R. S. 724, \u00a7 65.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">When a trustee has the legal estate, and there is a duty to perform which would carry the inalienability of the fund beyond the time permitted, the estate in him is illegal and void, and those entitled to it take as if no such term existed. Estates can no more be rendered inalienable through trustees than in any other manner. (14 Wend. Rep. 265; 16 Ibid. 61; 7 Paige, 221, 521, 542; 1 R. S. 723, \u00a7\u00a7 60, 68.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-7\">Whether we consider the law in regard to the legal estate in this fund,- and the power of alienating it by those who hold the legal and equitable estates, either as it existed previous to the revised statutes, or under the revised statutes if they affect the question, the absolute power of alienation has been suspended longer than for one or more lives in being, and twenty-one years and nine months afterwards, and consequently is void. The fact that the sons may die under the age of 45 years, does not alter the case. The possibility of the trust continuing makes the limitation void. <em>(Hawley </em>v. <em>James, </em>16 Wen. 171; <em>De Barante </em>v. <em>Gott, </em>6 Barbour, 503; Sugden on Powers, 353.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-8\">The limitation here is thus: \u201c To trustees, during the life of my son James, and my widow; then an estate in trust, for years to the unborn sons of my son James, ending when they become forty-five years; then and thereafter, provided they reach the age of forty-five years, I give them the fund in fee; but if they die under the age of forty-five, I give the said fund to the next of kin, living at the time of their death.\u201d Here, then, wre have two life estates \u2014 a term of years to unborn children, an absolute estate fixed upon, the contingency of their living out that term, and a further remainder limited to next of kin, provided they do not live out the term of years. The sons get the property and vested interests therein, only provided they become forty-five years of age. Until that time the trustees are directed to keep it. <em>(Coster </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>14 Wend. 265, 316, 322 ; <em>Garrick </em>v. <em>Lord Camden, </em>14 Ves. 372.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\">If the sons do not live to that age, the next of kin take it, not by the law of the statute of distribution, but by power of the appointment. The distribution over to such next of kin, then, not coming by inheritance, through the sons, or by any vested interest of theirs, is a limitation over or contingent estate, and the next of kin take as purchasers and not by the statute of distributions. They take the fund from the hands of the testator, by the appointment of his son James, with his authority. As before said, according to the rule laid down by Sugden, such a limitation upon an estate to an unborn person, is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\">II. The appointment is also bad, because it gives a different estate to the sons from that directed by the testator. In his will he directs that the trustees shall transfer and pay over the fund to the sons, \u201c at such time and age, in such manner and in such shares and proportions\u201d as his son James should appoint. Here, then, it is clear that the testator intended the fund should go to the children of his son James, in any event. He intended that there should, immediately upon the death of his son James, be a vested and absolute property in the children who survived him, capable of being transmitted by inheritance or disposed of by will or deed; and for fear that there might be no such children in whom the fee could vest, he limited a remainder to his brothers and sisters, and their children. Instead of this, the appointor has made a new estate; he has created a new trust term. He has directed the trustees to keep the property for a period of years, upon an active trust, and if the plaintiff die under 45 years of age, then to transfer and pay over the fund to his next of kin, living at the time of his death. This is a new estate, a new trust term, given to the trustees, quite different and more extensive than the one given under the will of the testator. The appointor has given the fund, not to the children, but to the trustees. Their interest in the fund is contingent ; until the happening of that contingency, their right is only to the income and profits. Even upon that contingency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>they do not get tbe fund, tbe estates limited thereupon being void. The estate appointed to the children, on condition of, their attaining the age of 45 years, and in default thereof, the remainder to their next of kin, living at the time of their death,, are contingent remainders, limited upon an estate for years. A contingent remainder cannot b\u00e9 so limited. (2 Black. Com. 171.) They are also void as being too remote. The remainder, to the next of kin is .void, because it depends upon two contingencies. The one that James Thomson should have sons; the, other that they should die under 45 years of age. (2 Black. Com. 170.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\">As to sustaining the appointment <em>cy pr\u00e9s, </em>see 2 Ves. Jr. 357 <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>2 Ves. 640; and <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>Ambl. 740.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-6\">III. The appointment is bad, because it is upon <em>condition, </em>which the will does not authorize. (Vide <em>Pawlet </em>v. <em>Pawlet, </em>1 Wils. 224; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Dunt, </em>2 Ibid. 337.) .Here the fund is not left to one merely upon condition, but to both. A life estate might have been given possibly to one, had the remainder been absolutely given to the other. But it is not so left; the fund is given to both, upon condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-7\">IY. The appointor undertakes to appoint the whole fund, and yet, but contingent interests are \u25a0 given to the children, which is bad. <em>(Snape </em>v. <em>Turton, </em>Cro. Car. 472; also 1 Vern. 84.) And he has appointed to persons not the object of the power. (1 Atk. 561, 63, 64.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-8\">Y. The term at \u201c such time and age,\u201d was intended by the testator to refer to a time or age under 21 years. The term, 21. years and 9 months, must be taken in connection with birth and infancy. (See Sugd. Purch. 2d ed. page 556 and. authorities.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-9\">It may be proper to suggest to the court, that the real estate of the testator was devised and appointed precisely in the same way as the personal, except that the widow of the appointor has a life estate therein; that it is perhaps of the value of $300,000 ; that it is spread over this city and other places, diminishing in value in some places, though rising in others; and that the suspension of the power to sell, to give leases for any considerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>time, and to build upon unimproved or badly improved property, is of great detriment. That, although .in this action the court cannot decide upon that part of the will, yet the principle will be decided.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b564-5\">Oaklet, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">delivered the opinion of the court, affirming the decision of the referee and the judgment at the special term, on the grounds stated in the syllabus of the case. T^he Chief Justice\u2019s opinion was oral, and accidentally there was no note of it taken when it was delivered. The argument which led the court to the conclusion adopted, is contained in substance in the points of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
