The defendant pleaded <em>nil debet, </em>concluding to the couutry, and a special plea of confession and avoidance, fouuded on the above-quoted statute of June 17th, 1864, and asserting that the fees for which he was sued were fees collected .under the said general regulations of the treasury, of February, 1857, and such as he had a lawful right to retain; the whole, with commission's of 3 p. c. on moneys collected and accounted for, amounting to but $2322.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">Upon the first plea issue was joined; to the second, the plaintiff filed a general demurrer, and. the defendant his joinder therein. The Circuit Court overruled the demurrer, and thereupon, without disposing of the issue to the country, rendered judgment for the defendant. Thereupon the goverrtment brought the judgment here; the general question in the case being whether, in view of the 2d section of the act of June 17th, 1864, the collectors of the customs mentioned in that act were entitled to retain for their own use moneys received by them from the owners of steamers, and from engineers and pilots, by virtue of the 31st section of the act of August 30th, 1852. A minor point of pleading (arising from the fact that the court below did not send the case to the jury on the issue joined on the first plqa) being also raised.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-7\">\n<em>Mr. B. H. Bristow, Solicitor-General, for the United States, plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">1. There is clearly kept up in the treasury regulations of 1857 the distinction between the moneys collected under the act of 1852, and other collections enumerated in the regulations. We do not maintain that the collector has retained more than the maximum compensation allowed by the act of 1864, but only that the amount thus retained by him is made up partly from rnoueys which he was not entitled to appropriate to his own use. He does not pretend to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>derived any right to such moneys from the treasury regulations, or from any prior statute, but rests his claim upon the act of 1864, and insists that under it he is entitled to appropriate to his own use certain moneys which by prior statute and the treasury regulations were specifically required to be' paid into the treasury as- other revenue, and were clearly appropriated to other uses. What is there in the language of the act of 1864 to indicate an intention on the part'of Congress to repeal the provision of the act of 1852 in this respect? It cannot be argued that so much of the act of 1852 as appropriates the moneys in question-to another use, and requires them to be paid into the treasury \u201c as other revenue,\u201d is repealed otherwise than by implication. The act of 1852 is not referred to in the act of 1864, and there is nothing in the statute itself to indicate that the subject-matter of the former act was present in the .mind of the legislature when the latter was adopted. No.r is the latter in any sense repugnant to the former. The act of 1852 relates exclusiv\u00e9ly to the payment, by owners of steamers, engineers, and pilots, of certain sums of money as compensation for the services of inspectors, and.the only connection of collectors therewith is in the duty imposed upon them to. receive the money and pay- it into the treasury as. other revenue. The act of 1864 relates exclusively to the compensation of collectors, and the chief purpose in view was to change the maximum compensation of collectors of the enumerated districts. Bull effect can be given the latter without in any respect disturbing the former. The- two may well subsist together, and in such case repeal by implication cannot be allowed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-5\">2. <em>Nil debet </em>is not a sufficient plea to an action of debt on a bond setting out the condition and breach, and it may he conceded that the plaintiff\u2019 below should have demurred to this. plea. However, an issue having been framed on that plea the court ought not to have treated that issue as immaterial, and rendered judgment for the defendants on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>whole case upon sustaining the demurrer to the last plea, but should have allowed the parties to go to the jury upon the issue joined on the first plea.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>Mr. A. G. </em>Riddle, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATY\">submitted that the case was a plain one every way, and he presented arguments which need not be here printed, a.s they were in substance adopted as true by the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b475-15\"> 10 Stat. at Large, 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-17\"> 13 Stat. at Large, 134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b477-18\"> 3 Id. 695.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> Henderson\u2019s Tobacco, 11 Wallace, 652; The Distilled Spirits, Id. 366.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-7\">The CHIEF JUSTICE</author>\n<p id=\"Aye\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The question is whether the description of fees now collected under the general regulations of the Treasury Department of February, 1857, includes the sums collected under these regulations for licenses to steamers, and as compensation for the inspections and examinations made for the year unde'r the Steamboat Act of August 30th, 1852, in addition, to the fees for issuing enrolments and licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">These sums are collected as fees under the regulations, and are not distinguished from the collector\u2019s fees proper, except by the circumstance that they are described as a compensation for inspections and examinations. The provision, that these sums shall be quarterly accounted for and paid over to the United States, does not distinguish them from fees and emoluments to be accounted for under the act of the 17th of June, 1864, or under the regulations of the Treasury Department of February, 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The language of the regulations is, that the fees are to be charged, aud collected, aud accounted for, and paid over to the United States by collectors, in the same manner as other revenue. This language obviously means that they are to be accounted for in all cases, and paid over, unless retained under authority of law. The act of June 17th, 1864, authorizes the collector to retain the fee3 and a commission.of three per cent, on moneys collected and accounted for, paying over to the Treasury only \u201ethe excess beyond two thousand five hund] ed dollars; and there is no distinction in the regulations between the fees- for admeasurement, licenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>&amp;c., and the fees for licenses as a compensation for inspections and examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We thiuk, therefore, that the collector was .authorized to retain all descriptions of fees paid him not in .excess of two thousand five hundred dqllars. It follow.s that the demurrer was properly ove.rrul\u00e9d; and, as the defendant did not think it proper to reply, but allowed judgment to be entered upon the plea, the other plea of <em>nil debeti </em>became immaterial, and the judgment was properly entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">It is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
