' The sole question in the' case was, whether the defendant, Cain, was within the protection of these laws.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-8\">\n<em>Mr. B. C. Cook, for the plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-9\">Cain had no connected title deducible of record, either in' law or equity, t\u00f3 the premises in question. The title must be connected; it must be deducible of record. Qain in fact had no <em>title </em>in equity at all; though he may have had <em>interest </em>in equity. No title in equity could have arisen until he/had paid all his notes, for not till then could he have come into chancery and demanded a conveyance. He.held, in short, but that inchoate interest which might or might not ripen into an equitable title. Reference by the court to decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> will show that no other view can be taken consistently with fhem.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-10\">Further. All the claim that Jacquemart had to the laud arose from McGuire\u2019p deed to Thiriat. That deed conveys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>to Thiriat, in trust for Jacquemart indeed, but with a <em>habendum </em>whose effect was obviously to give the estate to Thiriat alone.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\">Then these lands, if Jacquemart\u2019s at all, were Jacquemart\u2019s alone. His wife did not have any ownership in them. The bond was executed by <em>him </em>alone if by anybody. But \u2022the power of attorney does not authorize the sale of the lands of either Mr. or Madame Jacquemart alone, but only the lands owned by them jointly.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-7\">Filially, <em>Ren\u00e9 Marie </em>is quite a different name from <em>Jean.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-8\">\n<em>Mr. Jackson Grimshaw, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-19\"> Revised Statutes of 1845, \u00a7 8, chapter 24; Id. 8 and 11, chapter 66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\"> Steele <em>v. </em>Magie, 48 Illinois, 397; Stow <em>v. </em>Steel, 45 Id. 328; Nicoll <em>v. </em>Ogden, 29 Id. 377.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\"> Brown <em>v. </em>Combs, 5 Dutcher, 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b494-15\"> Dodge <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 14 Wisconsin, 630.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b494-9\">Mr. Justice DAVIS.</author>\n<p id=\"AUTq\">delivered the opinion of, the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">The. limitation laws of Illinois relied on by the defendant, in substance, declare that whoever has resided on a tract of land for a period of seven successive years prior to the commencement of an action of ejectment, having a connected title in law or. equity deducible of record from the State or the United States, can plead the possession in bar of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">It is objected' that the entire title of the defendant is not evidenced by acts of record, but this is hot necessary. If the source or foundation of the title is of record it is available to every person claiming a legal or equitable interest under it who can connect himself with it by such evidence as applies to the- nature of the right set up.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Is the right set up by Cain, then, within the purview of the statute ?</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">It is conceded to be, if the bond was executed under a valid power of attorney, coupled with full payment of the purchase-money, and the obligor had the legal title to the land. This concession was necessary, because it is too plain for controversy that a union of these elements would constitute a complete equitable title, which a court of chaucery, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>proper application, would' perfect into a legal title. But there are other principles by which an equitable title can be tested, and, in their application to this case, relieve it of all difficulty. If a party has done all that could reasonably be expected of him to perform.his part of the agreement, it will be considered, in equity, as having been done. Cain is within this condition. He purchased the land from Cockle, paid him all he agreed to pay, except the sum of $66, and this he was ready and willing to pay, but Cockle would not receive it, on the plea that it was rumored his principal was dead. Was not this offer equivalent to payment? What more, under the circumstances of this case, would a court of equity require? It would be a harsh rule to say that the purchaser should lose his land because he did not institute inquiry, in France, to ascertain whether the rumor of Jacquemart\u2019s death was well founded or not. There was no revocation of the power, and Cockle was the proper person to receive the money, unless Jaequemart were dead; and there is nothing in the record to show that Cain ever received any information on the subject, except what was contained in the reply of Cockle when he offered to pay him the money. Naturally a man in the predicament of Cain would rest in security, until advised by Cockle that he could safely pay the money to him, or until some one having authority called upon him for payment. This was never done; and,-after sixteen years\u2019 residence on the land, he is called upon to surrender it because he did not employ unusual means to ascertain the proper parties to whom the small balance due on the land should be paid. If there were no limitation law in Illinois applicable to this ease, the action of ejectment would, on proper application, have been enjoined until Cain could, through a court of equity, have perfected his title so as to make it available as a legal defence in a court of law. If, then, Cain had such a title as a court of equity would recognize and convert, by its decree, into a legal title, it must be considered a title in equity within the meaning of the statute. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive what the law does mean by a title in equity if this be not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>one. It ifrust be something less than a legal title, else these wordsin the statute can have no effect. The law was designed to protect both kinds of title alike, and, unless equal influence is extended to both, there is a practical repeal of a portion of the statute. In no proper sense can it be said that Cain broke his agreement. It'is true he did'not formally tender the money to Cockle, but this would have been a useless act, as Cockle told him, on his application to pay, that he could not receive the money. Besides, he had good right to suppose, from what had-previously occurred, that the offer to pay Cockle'was- as valid as the offer to pay Jacquemart.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Why then, has not Cain, having shown a record foundation, brought himsfelf within the scope of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">It is urged, as an additional reason against this, that Jacquemart did not own the legal title, becaus\u00e9 one of the <em>mesne </em>conveyances .made in 1823 was to Thiriat in trust for Jacquemart. This is true, but Thiriat died in 1845, and Jacquemart; the beneficial owner of the land, assumed to have the right to sell it in July, 1848, when he executed his letter of attorney to Tillon aud Cutting, with power of substitution. Nothihg is heard from the heirs df Thiriat for a period of nineteen years from the death of their ancestor, when, in 1864, they convey, as do also the heirs of Jacquomart, the tract of land in controversy to the plaintiff! After such a -lapse of time, in. the absence of any proof on the subject; it is difficult to resist the conclusion, that some undue influence must have been used to procure these conveyances; but, be this as it may, the title of Cain is not less an equitable one on account of them, and, if so, the statute will not allow his possession, rightfully obtained aud continued the requisite length of time, to be disturbed. Without discussing the effect of the deed of Thiriat\u2019s heirs, in its application to this case, it is' enough to say that a court of equity, looking through forms to the substance of things, would find a way to protect Cain\u2019s purchase;</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u2022 It is urged, as an additional reason why this defence cannot prevail, that the bond is in the name of Jacqueimart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>alone, while the power was to convey the joint property of husband and wife. There would be some force in this position, if the original deed to Thiriathad been in trust for the wife as well as the husband; blit', as. this was not the case, the joinder of the wife could only have been intended to alienate any supposed, right of dower in the event that she survived her husband. She had no present title to the land, either legal or equitable; and, although Cockle was empowered to use her name, as well as her husband\u2019s, in any instrument of sale he might execute, the failure to do so cannot, in any event, operate to invalidate the bond for a deed which he gave to Cain.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">It is hardly necessary to notice the objection, that Jacquemart\u2019s name is incorrectly given in the contract of sale. Cockle testifies'that this was a. mistake, and it is the business Nof a court of equity to see that Cain is not harmed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"AyR\">On the whole case we are of the opinion that the defendant is within the protection of thp limitation laws of Ulinois, which he invok\u00e9d for his defence, and which he had a right to do, for that purpose, although the title used to accomplish this object could not be employed by a plaintiff in an action of ejectment-, who can only recover when he has the paramount legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In conclusion, it is proper to state that we have examined the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois, to which we: have been referred as affecting the question at issue, and do not find anything decided which militates against' the views we have presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b494-16\"> Collins <em>v, </em>Smith, 18 Illinois, 163; Poage\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Chinn\u2019s Heirs, 4 Dana, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
