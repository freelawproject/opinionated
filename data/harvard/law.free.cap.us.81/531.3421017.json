The owners were to bear the marine risk, the United States the war'risk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-9\">Under the charter-party the vessel was, in July, 1865, at Brazos St. lago, Texas, and was, by the quartermaster there, ordered to receive on board certain troops and stores, and to proceed as soon' as this was done to New Orleans, Louisiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-10\">The bar at the mouth of the harbor of Brazos is difficult and dangerous, and when the vessel was ready to proceed on the voyage the wind was high and the water on the bar low. The quartermaster, being informed of the difficulty, ordered a tugboat to aid in taking the vessel over the bar, and in tow of this tugboat and in charge of a pilot in the service of the United States the vessel proceeded to the bar and attempted to cross, but struck, and the hawser of the tow having parted, the vessel swung round inside the bar and returned to the landing. In this attempt she received injuries which, if time could have been allowed, could have been repaired in two days, and at a cost of $500 or $600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-11\">The quartermaster again ordered the vessel to proceed to eea. This order was given with a full knowledge of tb\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>danger of crossing the bar, and against the, judgment of both the master of the vessel and the pilot; but the <em>exigencies of the </em>service, in the judgment of the quartermaster, required the attempt to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">The master, under this order of the quartermaster, again attempted to cross the bar in tow'of the steamtug, and under charge of the government pilot, as before, but struck heavily and was finally dragged over the bar by the tug, aided by her own steam-power. In this attempt she sustained such damage that she was compelled'to use her steam-pump to save her from sinking, and the troops and stores being discharged, she was towed to New Orleans by a government transport.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">The repair of the damages so sustained in crossing the bar cost $6890, of which the government paid $4283, and refused to pay any further part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-7\">The said vessel was laid up and detained in making the said repairs in all forty-five and a half days, for which time the <em>per diem </em>allowance stipulated in the charter-party at $182.25, amounted to $8292.37, of vvhich the government paid $2281.06, as wages and board of the master and crew who were employed in aiding in the repairs of the vessel; ind refused to pay any further amount on account of the 6aid <em>per diem. </em>Thereupon Morgan filed a petition in the Court of Claims for the whole amount claimed and unpaid. That court dismissed the petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-8\">\n<em>Messrs. N. Chipman, Carlisle, and McPherson, for the claimants:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-9\">'The injury was caused by a war risk; the imminent danger of the country at that moment and the urgent necessitj7 of sending troops forward to New Orleans without delay. The quartermaster had \u201c a full knowledge of the danger of crossing the bar.\u201d He knew he was going into the jaws of destruction; but \u201cthe exigencies of the service\u201d \u2014 those same exigencies which compel men to walk up to the cannou\u2019smouth \u2014 compelled him to give the desperate order. The order was obeyed and the catastrophe followed. What was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>all this but the risks of war, \u201cwar risks?\u201d Such risks the United States were to bear.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-6\">\n<em>Mr. C. H. Hill, Assistant Attorney- General, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b552-7\">Mr. Justice DAVIS</author>\n<p id=\"AJU\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u2019 These claimants cannot recover, on the ground that the injuries to their vessel were occasioned by the tortious act of the quartermaster at Brazos in compelling their master, against his better judgment, to proceed to sea; nor would their condition be improved if the vessel had been actually impressed into the service of the United States, for in neither case would the Court of Claims have jurisdiction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Congress has wisely reserved to itself the right to give or withhold relief where the claim is founded on the wrongful proceedings of an officer of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The case, therefore, rests wholly on the contract of affreightment, and the inquiry is, which of the parties to it must hear the loss caused by the stranding of the claimants\u2019 vessel on the bar at the mouth of the harbor of Brazos.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The stipulations in the contract applicable to this subject leave no room for doubt how the question should be answered. The United States, being in a state of war, found it necessary to hire the injured vessel for the purpose of ti\u2019ansporting troops and munitions of war to different- ports and places, and' entered into a contract with her owne'rs to carry this purpose into effect. The vessel was to be officered and manned by the owners, who agreed at all times to keep her in repair and fit for the service in which she was engaged. In no sense were the United States the owners of the vessel, for they had nothing to do with her management, and only reserved to themselves the right to say how she should be loaded and. where she should go. In the condition of things then existing it became necessary to make provision for two classes of perils. This was done; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>United States assuming the war risk, while the owners of the boat agreed to bear the marine risk. If, therefore, the stranding of the boat in going over the bar was owing to a peril of the sea, her owners, and not the government, must bear the loss. That the high wind and low stage of water were the efficient agents in producing this disaster are too plain for controversy. They were the proximate causes of it, and .in obedience to the rule \u201c <em>causa pr\u00f3xima non remota spectatur\u201d </em>we cannot proceed further in oi\u2019der to find out whether the fact of war did not create the exigency which compelled the employment of the vessel. If it did, it was known to the owners when the charter-party was formed, who, with this knowledge, became their own insurers against the usual sea risks, and must'abide the consequences of their stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">There is a certain degree of hardship in this case growing out of the peremptory order of the quartermaster to proceed to sea, but this is outside of the contract, and, if worthy of being considered at all, must be addressed to another department of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-11\"> Reed <em>v. </em>United States, 11 Wallace, 591; United States <em>v. </em>Kimbal, 13 Id. 636</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
