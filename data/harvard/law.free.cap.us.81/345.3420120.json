That night, though cloudy and with occasional spits of rain, was not very dark nor windy. The sea was open and comparatively smooth. About midnight, the wind being north-northeast, the North Hampton approached New Haven, and by the captain\u2019s order steered straight east-northeast for the New Haven lighthouse; a right course apparently for her to steer when about to enter the harbor. She soon-saw the lights of a steamer, which she inferred, and rightly, was the Continental coming down and out of the harbor. After the Continental came down the harbor, she changed her course to go down the Sound towards New York. \u201cWhen she first changed her course,\u201d said the captain of. the North Hampton, who was examined as a witness, \u201cshe headed directly for the North Hampton, which,\u201d said he, \u201cI could tell by her range of lights, they being exactly in.range after she got her course.\u201d He continued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cAfter a little her course varied, a little southerly. She was then, when she hauled up, on her course westerly, distant about three miles. I continued going our course east-northeast until I was distant from the Continental, I should judge, about three-quarters of a mile. She was then bearing a very little on our port bow, nearly ahead. I then gave one blast of the whistle and changed my course on? point easterly to east by north. I received no response to that whistle for, I should say, nearly or quite a minute. I then heard two blasts of the Continental\u2019s whistle, which I immediately answered by one whistle, rung two bells, to stop the boat, and in the meantime told the pilot to heave the wheel hard aport.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">Notwithstanding this the two steamers came violently together, the Continental striking the North Hampton on her port side a little abaft midships, nearly square on, and rum ning through her in such a way that she went down' in half an hour; her passengers just escaping with their lives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">The defence set up by ihe Continental for this collision was, the fact that the' North Hampton had had no \u201ccentral range of two white lights;\u201d for want of which, as th-e Continental alleged, she took the steamer for a sailing vessel, and starboarded her helm instead of porting it. On the subject of the North Hampton\u2019s lights generally, one of the boat\u2019s hands of that vessel who had. been at the wheel prior to the collision, and left it when he saw the steamer coming down the Sound, testified thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">\u201cI found the bow light burning brightly. The side lights were also burning brightly. The stern light I found burning dim. There were two lanterns in one box. They showed as one light. I went aft and lowered it down. After I got the box down, I went into the door where the space is, out of the draft, so they would not blow out, and when there picked up the wicks of both lights, one after another. After that was done; I took them to the staff and put them in the box and hoisted them up. I heard the North Hampton blow one whistle. I was aft then, at the .time of this first whistle, was just stepping inside the passage-way with the lights, as near as I can recollect. After an interval there was a reply with two whistles from the Continental. I was then coming out of the passage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>way, as near as I can remember. The North Hampton blew one whistle again, directly after. I was then in the act of hoisting the lights at that time., After hoisting up the lights 1 saw the Continental\u2019 coming for us, and I ran forward on starboard side. I got part of the way forward, when the vessels came together and the concussion knocked me down.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">It appeared from the testimony of those on board the Continental that they had, in point of fact, mistaken the North Hampton for a sailing vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">The lookout of the Continental \u2014 her forward deck lookout, who had no other duty than that of lookout \u2014 \u201c not seeing the vessel itself, but seeing a green and white light\u201d\u2014 which he judged to be then a mile or a mile and a half distant \u2014 reported, five or six minutes before the collision, \u201c Sail off starboard bow,\u201d and was answered at the pilot-house, \u201cAye, aye!\u201d-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">The wheelsman, who heard the lookout\u2019s report, saw also a green and white light, \u201c but no red light then four or five minutes before the collision, as he judged, and a mile of a mile and a half off, the North Hampton\u2019s lights bearing pretty much the whole time, until it was too- late to avoid the collision, about three points on the Continental\u2019s bow.\u201d <em>He thereupon starboarded his helm so as to keep her off.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">The captain, who had been on the line for thirty years, and who was in the pilot-house with the wheelsman, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">\u201cI saw the North Hampton\u2019s green.and White light; she had no stern light; sometimes in \u00e1 sailing vessel they come forward and stick out a white light when they get frightened; sometimes they have a light forward to overhaul the anchor-chain.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-9\">The captain added:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-10\">\u201cA lookout reports.a Steamer as a steamer, and \u00e1 vessel as a vessel; all he knows by. is the lights; at night, he reports four lights as a steamer, and two lights as a vessel.

That\u2019s his orders.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-11\">On board the Continental there happened to be, going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>down tbe Sound thqt night, one Horton, for seven years a Hellgate pilot. He had been.in the pilot-house, and saw \u00e1 green and white light \u2014 the'white light forward, but he saw no aft light. The vessel on which they were'seemed to him, he testified, to be a sailing vessel. He said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">\u201cI guessed she was a sailing vessel because she did hot have any stern light; I could not see her hull when I first saw her. It is generally the case for.a vessel coming into port to take a light forward, to get her chain and anchor ready, to drop anchor. I wont away from the pilot-house to the lower cabin after I saw the lights. From the time I left the pilot-house till the collision was five or six minutes. After the collision, I saw a stern light halfway up the flag-mast.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">As already mentioned, the .Continental was starboarded under the impression that the North Hampton whs a sailing vessel, and with a view of keeping out of her way.' The North Hampton being in fact a steamer, and knowing that the approaching vessel was one, ported. A collision came of course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">The owners of the North Hampton having libelled the Continental in the District Court of Connecticut, that court dismissed the libel, considering that the North Hampton was in fault; having had no stern-light, and running in direct violation of law, which required, her to have a central range of two white lights. The Circuit Court affirmed this decree, and the owners of the North Hampton brought the case here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-9\">\n<em>Messrs. C. Donohue, C. R. Ingersoll, and J. S. Beach, for the appellants:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-10\">Assuming that the steamer could see only the bow and side-lights of the propeller, it was a fault on her part to act as if they were the lights of a sailing-vessel. A white light is prohibited to a sailing vessel under way. She is forbidden to carry any other light than the green light on her starboard side, and the red light on her port side. Sea-going steamers are required \"to carry the single white light with the side colored lights. Coasting and inland water steamers carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the colored side-lights with the bow and stern white lights. The lights, therefore, which the steamer saw, were lights which a sea-going steamer must carry, but which a sailing-vessel <em>must never carry. </em>And the steamer assumed that the vessel carrying it was not the kind of vessel which the lights declared it to be, but was the kind of vessel which the lights declared it not to be. This was recklessness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">If a steamer sees a light which does not clearly iudicate the character of the vessel carrying it, she has no right to jump to the conclusion that it is carried by a vessel of any particular class, and especially not of that class which is forbidden to carry such a light. It. is her duty to ascertain the truth'by all the cautionary means in her power. She must use all necessary vigilance to discover whether the strange light is a fixed light or not \u2014 and if fixed, whether it is on a vessel in motion or at anchor \u2014 and if on a vessel in motion, what is the course- of that vessel as indicating whether she is moved by the wind or by steam. She must look for the strength of the light keen as distinguishing a regulatiou-light from an ordinary hand-lantern, commonly used about a vessel\u2019s deck \u2014 and watch for the sails of the vessel \u2014 her hull\u2014 the noise of her paddles, and the lights of her saloon, if a steamer \u2014 and for all the usual indications characterizing the different classes of vessels. And if this inquiry caunot be made without slackening her speed, she must slacken her speed. If not without blowing her whistle, as a signal, she must blow her whistle. She has no right to go on at all if she is in any reasonable doubt on the subject. If, without exercising all reasonable precautions, she insists upon going on, and a collision occurs, she takes the risk, and the fault is justly visited upon her. In the case of <em>The Gray Eagle,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that vessel was held to be in fault because she did not, by watching the bearings of the light of another vessel coming towards <em>her </em>\u2014 The <em>Perseverance </em>\u2014 discover that the light was in motion, an I therefore could not be upon a vessel at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>anchor. And she was condemned as in fault, although the Perseverance was carrying a light she had no right to carry. And such is the law of negligence everywhere. If a man goes upon a railroad track with shut eyes and deaf ears and is run over, it is in vain for him to complain that the whistle was not blown. In the present ease no precaution whatever was taken by the steamer to discover the character of the approaching vessel. For it was manifest to the steamer, or should-have been, that the vessel was approaching, and was bound into New Have', harbor. The steamer knew that the propeller was due at that place at that time. The two boats were accustomed to meet on every trip of the propeller, and were perfectly well known to each other. It was therefore the steamer\u2019s duty to look out for the propeller, just when and where the lights of this approaching vessel appeared. But at least there was reason for a doubt, and, if so, it was clearly her duty to settle that doubt. But those on board did not allow any doubt whatever to enter their mind. They assumed at once.that it was a sailing-vessel thus coming toward them, right in the eye of the wind, aud they adhered to that assumption stubbornly, until it resulted in disaster.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-6\">2. The character of the light was manifested to the steamer, beyond any question, by its bearings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">Those bearings are given to us by the wheelsman of the Continental as three points on the starboard bow when the light was first seen, aiid they continued the same without alteration until the collision, or until it was too late to avoid the collision. Now these bearings ought to have told those navigating the steamer, that the vessel carrying those lights was directly approaching the steamer. Otherwise they would have changed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">3. And the wind, it is admitted, was north-northeast. The vessel with the lights, therefore, was approaching <em>directly in the eye of the wind. </em>And yet the captain of the Continental swears that he supposed the North Hampton to be a sailing-vessel all the while, and the court below tells us that he was justified in that supposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">Again: the wind being north-northeast, a sailing-vessel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>in order to' show her green light to the steamer, must have been on her starboard tack, and could not have lain closer to the wind on that tack than a northwest course. This course would have been nearly at right angles to the steamer\u2019s course, and, if the vessel sailing on it was first seen three points on the steamer\u2019s starboard bow, every minute would carry her further out of the steamer\u2019s way, and would of course change the bearings of her lights, and the relative distance between her lights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">4. The orders which the captain of the steamer testifies he had given to his lookout,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and upon which the lookout seems to have acted, on this occasion, shows him to have had a very-confused notion of the object of the regulation lights, and indicates a habit of inattention to their particular significance. It is not surprising that a lookout, receiving such orders, should report the propeller as a sail, and is certainly not to be wondered at that the officer who could give them should adopt such a report as infallible, and shut his eyes and ears to any further evidence on the subject;</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-7\"><em>Messrs. E. H. Owen and T. C. </em>Doolittle, <em>contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">The North Hampton was running in open violation of statutory requirement and of the well-settled rules of\u2019navigation adopted for the purpose of preventing collisions, in that she had no \u201c after light.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\">It is probable that at no time was the after light such as the statute requires, for it is clear that it had been a poor, defective light for some time previous to its being.taken down. But however this may have been, it was taken down at the exact moment that it was specially needed to be up, and kept down until'the Continental was completely misled by the want of it, and a collision became inevitable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-10\">The statute, by positive requirement, makes a central range of white lights obligatory in inland waters. The requirement applies to all vessels under steam except \u201c ocean-bound steamers.\u201d And there is the greatest reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>requirement, for without the central rauge of white lights-the true course and direction of an approaching steamer cannot be had in narrow work. With nothing but the \u2022colored lights, steamers may b'c approaching nearly end on, and so as to involve the risk of collision, when oiio of them is not visible.- The colored lights are to be so constructed as to shine from a point right ahead to two.points abaft the .beam, sq that one steamer approaching another on nearly a parallel course, a very little off either hand, would only seo one colored light, and could not thereby determine hoi near the two were approaching .\u201c end on.\u201d The bow light alone would not enable the approaching steamer to determine this fact without the aid of the after light,'giving thereby a central rauge of two white lights. If approaching directly end on, the two white lights will be .in range, .and if not, they will be \u201c open.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">It is no excuse for-the North Hampton that her stern light, having become dim, had been temporarily removed for the purpose of being trimmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">The absence of the necessary range of lights did in fget deceive, and could not fail to deceive, those in charge of and navigating the Continental. The North Hampton was taken to b.e.a sailing-vessel; she was reported as such, and the movements made on the part of the Continental were based upon that idea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">It is no answer to say that those navigating the Continental, <em>upon reflection, </em>might,have known that the North Hampton could not have beeu a sailing-vessel, because a sailing-vessel does not, carry a white light forward, and because, .with that wind, a sailing-vessel could not have- been heading as she was. Although sailing-vessels are not permitted by law to carry a white light, yet it was proved to be not unusual in the night, when making preparations fqr landing, to have a light on the forward deck in getting lines and chains ready. As she did not have the-lights which steamers are required to carry, the Continental was not bound to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>sume, from the mere fact that a white light was seen at her bow, that the vessel whose lights were seen was a steamer. There is no evidence that <em>\u201c </em>ocean-bound steamers,\u201d which carry a white light forward, ever frequent or are ever seen navigating any part of the Sound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">The North Hampton was also in fault in not having a lookout. The fact that she had one is not asserted on the other side. This was gross negligence. She was bound by law to have one. It was necessary for her guidance. The master and pilot had other duties to perform which rendered them incompetent.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The fact that the Continental was seen by the master and pilot does not obviate the objection. If she had had a vigilant lookout, the lights of the Continental and her direction would have been more carefully reported, and the collision might have been avoided. A Vigilant lookout in the night, in a thoroughfare, is an absolute and inflexible necessity. No one can tell what might have been the effect of having a vigilant lookout forward.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">The North Hampton was clearly in fault for sounding one blast of her whistle, and in attempting to cross over and pass the Continental on her left or port side, thus throwing herself right across the bows of the latter vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">The Continental was properly navigated and was' not in any respect in fault. She was pursuing her lawful and proper course on her voyage. She had all the lights required by law properly set and burning brightly. She had a competent lookout properly stationed and faithfully attending to his duty. She had a competent engineer at his post who answered all the orders from the pilot-house promptly.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-14\"> 14 Stat. at Large, 228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b363-15\"> 13 Id 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> 9 Wallace, 505; see also Nelson <em>v. </em>Leland, 22 Howard, 48; The Louisiana <em>v. </em>Isaac Fisher et al., 21 Id. 1; The Birkenhead, 3 W.

When employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>navigation ships and vessels should be kept seaworthy and be well manned and equipped for the voyage, and in cases where they are not seaworthy or not tvell manned or equipped, and a collision ensues between such a vessel and one without fault in that respect, the owners? of the vessel not seaworthy or not well manned aud equipped cannot escape responsibility, if it appears that the unseaworthiness of the vessel or the want of a competent master or of a sufficient crew or of suitable tackle, sails, or other motive power, as the ease may be, caused or contributed to the disaster; and as the owners of the vessel appoint the master and employ the crew, they are also held responsible for their conduct in the control and navigation of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Controversies growing-out of collisions are cognizable in the admiralty, and when prosecuted in that jurisdiction, the rules of decision are different in several respects from those which prevail even in similar controversies when prosecuted in the courts of common law. Where the collision occurs exclusively from natural causes and without any fault on the part of the owners of either vessel or those intrusted with their control and management, the maritime rule, as defined by the Federal courts is, that the loss shall rest where it falls, on the principle that no one is responsible for such a disaster when produced by causes over which human skill and prudence could exercise no control.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Admiralty courts everywhere have now adopted that rule, but it cannot be applied Where both or either of the vessels are in fault \u2014 as where the vessel of the respondent is alone in fault the libellant is entitled to a decree for his damages, and the converse of the proposition is equally, true, that if the vessel of the libellant is alon\u00e9 in fault, proof of that fact is a sufficient defence to the libel, but if both vessels a're in fault, then the damages must be equally apportioned between the offending vessels. Much uncertainty often attends the inquiry by which of those rules a given controversy should be determined, aud where the evidence is conflicting the issue presented is frequently one of doubt and difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Full damages are claimed by the libellants in this case, upon the <em>ground </em>that the steamboat of the respondents was alone in-fault, or if that theory cannot -be sustained, then they, contend-that both steamers were in fault and that the damages should be , divided. On the other hand, the respondents contend that the vessel of the libellants, the propeller, was wholly in fault, and that the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the libel should be affirmed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Daily trips were run by the propeller between the ports of New Haven and New York, carrying passengers and freight, and she was on her return trip from the latter poi\u2019t, and near the entrance to the harbor of her home-port when she was struck by the Continental, the steamboat of the respondents, on her port side, abaft her midships, and damaged to such an extent that she sunk in half an hour. Corresponding trips were run by the steamboat, of the respondents between the same ports, the Continental, however, usually' leaving the port of New Haven on the same day that the propeller, the North Hampton, left New York on her return trip to the port where both steamers belonged. Accustomed as they were to start on their respective trips at stated hours, each knew pretty nearly when they would meet and where they would pass each other on the route, except when one or the other was detained by stress of weather or oth\u00e9r special circumstances, and the proofs exhibited furnish no reason to suppose that either of the steamers met with any detention during-this trip. Testimony was taken on both sides and. both\u2019parties having been heard, the Di\u00e1triet Court entered a decree for the respondents. Prompt appeal was taken by the libellants to the Circuit Court, but the Circuit Court affirmed the decree of the District Court, anti the libellants appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Before the Continental came out of the lower harbor her lights were seen by those on board the propeller when the two steamers were four or five miles apart. Distant from each other as they then were, the better opinion is that they were not at that time on courses which involved any risk of collision, but the Continental, shortly after she came out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the lower harbor, hauled up as usual on her Sound course, heading more directly towards her ultimate destination, and from that moment the course of the two steamers was such that the rules of navigation as well as the dictates of common prudence made it the duty of each to adopt proper precautions to prevent a collision. Beyond doubt they were approaching each other nearly end on, within the maritime meaning of that phrase, and under such cireumstauces all must admit that the rules of navigation require that \u201c the helms of both shall be put to port, so that each may pass on the port side of the other.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Extended argument to establish that theory of fact does not appear to be necessary, as it agrees with the first finding of the District judge and is supported by all the attending circumstances as well as by the weight of the direct testimony. Evidently the two steamers were far enough apart at that time to have adopted whatever precautions were necessary to have prevented a collision, and it is clear that if each had obeyed the rules of navigation, they would have passed each other in safety. Fault is imputed to the steamboat Continental, because she did not portlier helm as required by the rules of navigation established by the act of Congress, but the respondents contend that they were deceived and misled as to the character of the approaching vessel and consequent nature of their duty by the failure of those on board of the propeller to display proper lights, as they also were required to do by the same Congressional regulations, as amended by a subsequent act.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Evidence to that effect was given by one of the witnesses called by the libellants. He testified that he was at the wheel prior to the collision; that he saw the Continental coming down the harbor and spoke to another seaman to take his place; that the seaman spoken to did as requested; that he went and called the master and the mates; that he looked-at the lights; that the bow light and both the side lights were burning brightly, but that the stern light, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>consisted of two lanterns and showed as one light, he found was \u201cburning dim;\u201d that he went aft and took down both lanterns and went forward in the passage-way on the starboard side and having picked up the wicks carried the lanterns back and put them in the box where they belonged ; that he stepped forward into the passage-way to get out of the draft, so that the wind might not blow the lights out, and he further states that he heard the propeller give one whistle just as he was stepping into the passage-way with the lanterns; that he also heard two whistles from the Continental in reply just as he was returning to replace the lights in the box; that the propeller, just as he was hoisting the lanterns, again blew one whistle; that after he replaced the lights he saw the Continental approaching the propeller, when he ran forward part way and was*knocked down by the concussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Such a disaster could not have occurred without fault on the pai\u2019t of one or both vessels, as they had an open sea and good weather, and the night, though cloudy, was not very dark, as fully appears from the fact that those on board the propeller saw the lights of the Continental when she was at least four miles distant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Coasting .steamers are required to carry a central range of two white lights as well as the red and green lights prescribed for ocean-going steamers, the after light to be carried at least fifteen feet above the light at the head of the vessel, and the requirement of the act of Congress in respect to it is that it shall \u201c show all around the horizon.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Signal lights are required by the acts of Congress in order that they may be seen by an approaching vessel in season to enable those in charge of the vessel to adopt the necessary precautions to prevent a collision with the vessel whose lights are so displayed, and when it appears that they were burning so dinily as not to fulfil the purpose and object for which they are required, they cannot be regarded as constituting a compliance with the prescribed requirement.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Apply that rule to the present case and it is quite clear that the propel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Jer was in fault, and it appears that the District and Circuit Courts both came to the conclusion that she was solely in fault and denied to the libellants all claim for damages, either as owners of the propeller or as bailees of the cargo. Whether that decision is correct or not must depend upon the evidence, as it is clear that the absence of one or more of the lights required by the act of Congress will not necessarily cast upon the delinquent party the entire consequences of such a disaster. Absence of lights in a case falling within the acts of Congress renders the owners of the vessel liable for the consequences resulting from the omission, but it does not confer any right upon the other vessel to disregard or violate any rule of navigation or to neglect any reasonable or practicable precaution to avoid a collision which the circumstances afford the means and opportunity to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Steamers displaying proper signal lights are in that respect without fault, but they have other duties to perform to prevent collision besides complying with that requirement, and if they neglect to perform such other duties they will not be held blameless because they displayed proper lights as required by the act of Congress upon that subject.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Some conflict undoubtedly exists in the testimony as to the precise manner in which the two steamers were approaching each other after the Continental came out of the harbor and hauled up upon her Sound course, but the better opinion we all think is that they were approaching, each other nearly eudon, or substantially in that manner, as found by the District Court. Inquiry as to what their respective courses were before that time would be useless, as the respondents do not claim that either the lookout or master of the steamboat saw the propeller or her lights before the steamboat was put upon her Sound course. Unquestionably the lights of the propeller might have been seen earlier, but it is clear that they were not, if the witnesses are to be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Lookouts are required to be vigilant, and it is not doubted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>if proper vigilance had been exercised in this ease those on board the steamboat might have ascertained the character of the approaching vessel in season to have adopted every necessary precaution to have avoided a collision. They must have expected to meet the propeller about that time, and under the circumstances they had no right to assume with-out a closer scrutiny that the approaching vessel was a sail-vessel because she did not show a stern light. She did show a bow light, which might well have satisfied them that the vessel was not a sail-vessel, as it is more reasonable to suppose that the stern light of a. steamer has become dim or extinguished than that a sail vessel will show a. light not required nor authorized by the prescribed regulations. \u2019Proper scrutiny as to the character of the approaching vessel would or should have induced greater caution on the part of the master of the Continental, and if any doubt remained after such scrutiny was made the steamboat should have slackened her speed or have stopped until every reasonable degree of uncertainty was overcome. Navigators have no right arbitrarily to assume under all circumstances that every vessel approaching which does not show both the signal lights and the central rarige of two white lights is a sail-vessel which is bound to keep her course, and that if she does not she may be run down and sunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Prior to the enactment of the sailing rules neither steamers nor sail vessels, except on the lakes, were required to carry lights of any kind, and yet the rules of navigation were substantially the same as those prescribed in the existing acts of Congress. Lights are now required, but the omission of one vessel to comply with the requirement will not excuse the other from the exercise of all due and reasonable care to prevent a collision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Viewed in the light of these suggestions, as the case must be, the court is fully satisfied that those in charge of the steamboat did not exercise due care and vigilance to ascertain the character of the approaching vessel, and that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>they had done so they would have been enabled to have adopted reasonable precautions to have prevented the collision. Consequently the court is of the opinion that both vessels were in fault, and that the damages should be equally apportioned between the offending vessels.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Where two steamers are approaching each other in an open sea on a night when the lights of a vessel may be seen five miles, the defence that one of the steamers mistook the other for a sail-vessel cannot be admitted as valid, unless it is established by full proof; and where, as in this case, it appears that the approaching steamer showed a bow light in addition to the red and green lights, the court will be still less inclined to give credence to the theory as a valid defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Decree reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity to. the opinion of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> Union Steamship Co. <em>v. </em>N.
