A Southern State passed in 1865 a statute of limitations enacting that in computing the time in which any civil suit, proceeding, or appeal should be barred by any statute of limitation, the term of time from the 17th April, 1861, to the 1st March, 186-5, should not be computed. It then passed another, enacting that the time from 1st March, 1865, to 27th February, 1866, should not be. The courts of that State were closed to loyal suitors by the rebellion between the 17th April, 1861, and the 27th February, 1866. On suit brought in May, 1866, for a cause of action which arose in 1862, and which but for this deduction of time would have been barred in one year from 1862, by older statutes of limitation, the defendant asked the court to charge that if the jury believed that the right to bring the suit accrued more than one year before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>1st of March, 1865, their verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Meld, </em>in view of previous decisions of this court and of Congressional legislation (referred to <em>infra, </em>p. 218), that it could not be inferred that the court meant to declare the State statutes consistent with the Federal Constitution, when it simply told the jury that in computing the statute of limitations they ought to exclude the time between the 17th of April, 1861, and the 27th February, 1866, and that if the cause of action arose in 1862, it was not barred.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-6\">2. Although a certificate of the presiding justice of the highest court of a State, that there was drawn in question the validity of an act of the State, on the ground that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and that the decision was in favor of its validity, is entitled to much weight, yet where evidently that court had nothing before it but an exception taken and signed in the subordinate court which was clearly insufficient to raise such a question, or to show that it was decided in a way to give this court jurisdiction, such certificate is not conclusive to show that a Federal question was raised in the case.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-8\">When a certificate of the presiding justice of the highest court of a State mentions that a certain Federal question was raised and decided in his court, and does not state that any other was, this silence justifies the conclusion that none other was; especially when a decision on the matter where a second Federal question is alleged to have been passed on may have been well decided on many other grounds not Federal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-9\">3. A Federal question cannot be assumed to have been raised and passed on in a State court so as to give jurisdiction to this court, under the 25th section, when nothing appears in the record to show on what grounds the decision of the matter in which the Federal question is alleged to be involved was made.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">Error to the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of West Virginia;

And further, that all the grievances complained of in the declaration were acts arising from participation, direct and implied, in the said rebellion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">The court sustained the declaration, and issue being tendered to the country on the general issue and the first three of the special pleas, and the. court having, without assigning any reasons, decided the three remaining ones to be bad, on general demurrer, the case came on to be-tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">The plaintiff having shown the imprisonment, the defendant offered in evidence, \u201c both in mitigation of damages and as justification of the acts complained of,\u201d the already-mentioned pardon of the President. This pardon had five conditions annexed to it: (1.) That Caperton should take a certain oath. (2.) That he should not acquire slaves, &amp;c. (8.) That he should pay certain costs. (4.) That he should not claim certain property, or its proceeds. (5.) That he should notify the Secretary of State iii writing that he accepted the pardon. It was shown that Caperton had given the required notice and had taken the required oath. What had been done in the other matters did not appear. The court excluded the pardon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-11\">The defendant then requested the court to charge as folows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-12\">\u201c1st.

All that now was shown by the record as to the action of that court or the reasons of it, appeared in a certificate from its clerk, thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-9\">\u201c The court having maturely considered the transcript of the record of tfie judgment aforesaid, together with the arguments of counsel thereupon, is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that there is no error in said judgment; therefore it is considered by the court that the judgment aforesaid be affirmed, and that the defendant in error recover from the plaintiff in error, damages according to law, together with his costs about his defence in this behalf expended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-10\">\u201cAnd the court doth certify that in the aforesaid judgment there was drawn in question the validity of the statute of the State of West Virginia, passed March 1st, 1865, entitled \u2018An act in relation to the statutes of limitation,\u2019 on the ground that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States; and the decision of this, the highest court of law and equity in this State in which a decision in said suit could be had, was in favor of the validity of said statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-11\">From the affirmance by the Supreme Court of Appeals the ease was brought here, on the assumption that it came within the 25th section of the Judiciary Act, quoted <em>supra, </em>pp. 5, 6. A motion to dismiss for. want of jurisdiction having been made, the question of jurisdiction was argued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\n<em>Messrs.

By the laws of Virginia, existing prior to the 1st of March, 1865 (when a ne'w statute was passed), all right of Bowyer to sue Caperton had completely gone at the expiration of a year from July, 1862, the time of the alleged trespass \u2014 gone, therefore, long before this act of 1865 was passed, or this suit of 1866 was brought. Caperton thus had an ascertained and fixed privilege, immunity, and right, such as subsequent legislation could not deprive him of without his consent.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Yet the court below decided that the State of West Virginia could by a retrospective statute divest the, right to the defence, which' was thus complete under the previous statute, and could give a new right of action. We set up below and maintain here that such a decision is in the face of the fifth amendment to the Constitution, which says that \u201c no person shall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d The judgment of the Court of Appeals having been in favor of the validity of the statute thus drawn in question by us, our right to come here under the 25th section is clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">2. Our right is equally clear, because that court affirmed the ruling of the court below declaring our fifth special plea-bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">1. \u201cUse,\u201d says Vattel,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> \u201cappropriates the term of <em>civil war </em>to every war between members of one and the same political society. . . . The sovereign indeed never fails to term <em>rebels </em>all subjects openly resisting him; but when these become of strength sufficient to oppose him, so that he finds hilnself compelled to make war regularly on them, he must be contented with the term of <em>civil war.\u201d </em>- The terms <em>rebels </em>and <em>pirates </em>were freely applied by George III and the British Parliament to the Americans who were engaged in defending themselves and their families and property against Great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Britain between 1775 and 1783. Yet when it was argued before this court as to that war, that till the Declaration of Independence, it was only a civil war, there was uttered from its bench this language:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\"><em>\u201c </em>But why is not a defensive war against Great Britain (call it, if you will, a civil war) to be conducted on the same principles as any other? If it was a civil war, still we do not allow it to have been a rebellion. America resisted and became thereby engaged in what she deemed a just war. It was not the war of a lawless banditti, but of freemen fighting for their dearest rights, and of men lovers of order and government. Was it not as necessary in such a war as in any between contending nations that the law of nations should be observed.\"<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">Suck language is no less applicable to the war waged by men. pf -the Southern States from the spring of 1861 to the spring of 1865, a war \u201c which all the world acknowledges to be the greatest civil war known in the history of the human race.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> \u201c That civil war,\u201d said this court,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> \u201c was carried on upon a vast scale against the government of the United States for more than four years. . . . The power which carried it on was recognized as supreriie in nearly the whole of the territory of the States confederated in insurrection.\u201d The two cases last cited and others occurring in the interval between them,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> may be regarded as consistent with the law of nations, as declared by Vattel,<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> that \u201c whenever a numerous party thinks it has a right to resist the sovereign, and finds itself able to declare that opinion, sword in hand, the war is to be carried on between them in the same manner as between two different nations.\u201d The government of such party, whether called as by publicists a government <em>de facto </em>or denominated as by this court a government of parar mount force, must, this court has said,<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> \u201cnecessarily be obeyed in civil matters by private citizens who, by acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>obedience, rendered in submission to such force, do not become responsible as wrpngdoers for those acts, though not warranted by the laws of the rightful government.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">Now here Caperton set up below in his fifth plea a claim to be exempt from liability under the <em>laws </em>of war, which exempts ,one engaged in war for certain acts done in the prosecution thereof. The court below denied this right absolutely by sustaining the demurrer to the pleas setting up that defence. Is this a right or claim set tip under an am thority exercised under the United States? It certainly is if international law is a law of the United States, of the <em>nation, </em>and not of the several States. Whether this is so wa,s the question in the McLeod ease, A.D.1841, in New York, growing out of the buruiug of the Caroline. The Supreme Court of that State decided that the State had jurisdiction to try and hang McLeod, notwithstanding Great Britain had recognized the act as done under her orders, and asserted that-the British government, not McLeod, was responsible for what was done.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Under the ruling of that court McLeod was put on trial, but' the Attorney-General of the United States was sent by our government and was present at the trial with the necessary documents to put the question on record so it could be taken up, and the nation saved from a war with Great Britain, by this strange decision of a State court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">That the understanding of the administration and of well-informed persons at the time was, that this, the Supreme Court of the United States, had jurisdiction of the judgment of the Supreme Court of New York, is clear from a notice of the trial of McLeod in the National Intelligencer of May 22d, 1841. The editors alluding to this trial there say :</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\">\u201cWhatever the.decision, whether for releasing or remanding the prisoner, an appeal will probably be taken to the Court of Errors, from which a further appeal lies, in cases of this nature, to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Mr. Choate, in a speech delivered on the 11th of June, 1841, in the United States Senate, maintains the same position.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">\u201cThe clear course of the government, therefore, was to do what it did, to have McLeod\u2019s case fairly tried, and if needful, to have his ease brought into the National tribunals.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">The well-known relations between Mr. Choate and Mr. Webster, then- Secretary of State, make it plain that the views of this great constitutional lawyer upon the jurisdiction of this court, on a right set up as Colonel Caperton\u2019s here was in this fifth plea, under international law, under the laws of war, agreed with ours.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-8\">This indeed must be the law, or the General Government is at the mercy, on a question of foreign relations, of - the action of a State, or of its courts. So in the ease of the late civil war, parties for acts done in prosecution of that war are liable or not liable for acts so done, just according to the whim or prejudice of any State court. Is it possible that this court'has no jurisdiction over these questions to secure that conformity which is essential to the administration of justice ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-9\">The validity of this right under the law of nations, part of the law of the United States, the-court below decided against.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-10\">3. This court has jurisdiction on yet a third ground. The Constitution of the United States gives power to the President \u201cto grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States.\u201d The pardon was a valid exercise of authority under the United States. And the decision of the Circuit Court is against its validity or against the exemption set up under it. If the pardon could be pleaded in bar, there was error in the court\u2019s declaring plea eighth bad. If it could not be so pleaded, then the court erred in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>admitting the pardon in evidence under the general issue in mitigation of damages, and the error brings us. within the 25th section.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>Messrs. J. Hubley Ashton and B. Stanton, contra, and in support of the motion to dismiss:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">1. It is no matter whether the act of the. legislature of West Virginia of March 1st, 1865, is constitutional or not. The decision as to the effect of the war on the old statute of limitation was right independent of that statute, and of any statute. That this is so was declared by this court at December Term, 1867, in <em>Hanger </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>and in other cases since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">Besides, on the 11th of June, 1864, Congress passed its \u201c act in relation to the limitation of actions in certain cases,\u201d in substantially the same form as the West Virginia law of March 1st, 1865. That act applied to all cases, and all places, when no suit could be brought by reason of resistance to the laws or the interruption of judicial proceedings. It did not in terms apply to the time that had elapsed prior to its passage. The legislature of West Virginia, acting upon its own knowledge as to the time that the courts there had been suspended, did. but fix the precise time that the old statute should be suspended, and in terms made it applicable to the time that had elapsed, prior to its passage. This court, in <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Kahn,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>held that Congress had power to pass such a suspending act to operate retrospectively, and also that the act was a remedial statpte, entitled to a liberal construction, and such as should be held to operate retrospectively, although it did not do so in terms. It also held that the act was applicable to suits pending in the State courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">It would be extraordinary to hold a declaratory act of a State legislature, which in reality but defined and limited the suspension of the statute of limitation, created by the action of the courts and legislature of the General Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ment; and existing independent of the State statute, unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">2. Then does the case come here under the 25th section, because the Circuit Court of Monroe County declared the fifth special' plea bad? We say the Circuit Court of Monroe County, because there is no evidence that the Court of Appeals ever passed on that part of the case. Contrariwise, it rather seems that they did not. Judging by the certificate <em>(supra, </em>p. 222), no Federal question was raised but that relating to the new statute of limitations. If it was shown that the Court of Appeals did decide against its validity, <em>haud constat </em>that a Federal question was thus passed on. They may have decided the plea bad for other reasons, as <em>ex. gr., </em>for being argumentative, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-7\">But what is the plea at best? It is simply that Caperton acted under the authority of the rebel government, and that therefore he is justified. But this involves no question upon the validity or construction of the Constitution of the United States, or of any treaty, law, authority, or commission derived from the United States, nor upon the validity of any State law on account of its being in conflict with any provision of the Constitution of the United States, or any treaty, law, authority, or commission, derived from the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-8\">It is said that it involves a question of international law. If it does, this can give this court no jurisdiction. The law of nations is not embodied in any provision of the Constitution, nor in any treaty, act of Congress, or any authority, or commission derived from the United States. It is true that the courts of the United States, like the courts of the States, and of all other civilized countries,'recognize the law of nations as binding upon them; and it is argued that as the government of the United States is charged with the management and control of our foreign relations, the courts of the United States <em>ought </em>to have the power of deciding in the last resort, all questions of international law, otherwise difficulties may arise with foreign nations on account of erroneous decisions by the State courts which the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ernment of the United States could not provide against. But whatever force the argument of convenience might have in a case arising between the United States and a foreign nation, it has very little in a case arising out of a defunct rebellion. It is no great hardship for parties who have plunged the country into a bloody and protracted war, and who have been pardoned for crimes the greatest known to the law \u2014 treason, murder, arson, and robbery among them \u2014 to be required to make redress for the injuries which their neighbors have sustained at their hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">The case of McLeod, in the Supreme Court of New York, is referred to. The decision of that court was the subject of much criticism at the time. It was disapproved by Mr. Webster, who was then Secretary of State, and by Mr. Crittenden, Attorney-General of the United States, and many other distinguished jurists. Whether it was right or wrong is not important for our present purpose. But no attempt was made to bring the case before this court for revision. And it seems probable, that if the administration had supposed that this court had appellate jurisdiction from the New York courts in that case, that the case would have been brought before this court. The administration was seriously embarrassed by the decision. There was great danger of the country being plunged into a war with Great Britain, on account of its failure to surrender McLeod. Still, the courts of New York were permitted to maintain their jurisdiction and try McLeod for murder. The country was relieved from further controversy by the jury finding him not guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">What is still more conclusive as to the opinion of the jurists of the country, as to the appellate jurisdiction of this court on questions of international law is, that immediately after the McLeod ease was disposed of, an act of Congress passed, to give the courts of the United States jurisdiction in similar cases that might thereafter arise. That act was passed August 29th, 1842. It provided that a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>might be issued by any judge of this court, or any District judge of the United States, where any <em>\u201csubject or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>\u2022citizen\u201d </em>of a foreign state., and \u201cdomiciled therein,\u201d was imprisoned for any act done or committed under the au* thority of any foreign state or- sovereign, the validity or effect whereof depended on the laws of nations. But this law can have no- application t-o the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">It is assumed by the other side that whenever the established government in a .civil war exercises the powers and rights of a belligerent, and applies to the contest the rules and usages of war, that it thereby grants to the parties in rebellion all the rights and immuhities of a party to a public international war; that if it sends or receives a flag of truce, exchanges prisoners, or blockades the ports of the im surgent government, it thereby makes the insurgents a belligerent power, which has a right to demand all the rights and immunities .of an independent nation in a public international war. This is an error. It is one of the essential attributes of sovereignty which belongs to every independent nation, to determine for itself, how it will deal with rebels and insurgents against its authority and government. It may treat one of its insurgent citizens as an enemy and hold or exchange him as a prisoner of war, and another as a rebel and traitor and hang him for treason. Writers on international law say indeed that the rules and usages of civilized modern warfare, which are applicable to international wars, are equally applicable to civil wars. But they also say, that when an insurrection or rebellion is suppressed, the government may prosecute the parties that are engaged in it, and puuish them for treason and rebellion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">The case now before the court cannot, in short, be distinguished from <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hickman,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where it was held that \u201c the proportions and size of the struggle did not affect its character,\u201d that there was no rebel government <em>de fado </em>in any such sense as to give any legal efficacy to its acts,\u201d and that the judgment of a rebel court was illegal and void, and could not protect the judges and marshal from an action for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>3. As respects the pardon, the certificate from the Court of Appeals shows that it was not spoken of there at all. If it was so spoken of, the court perhaps thought that it had rightly been deemed insufficient either as evidence or plea, because it did not appear .that more than two conditions had been observed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-17\"> Code of Virginia, 1860, p. 638, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-15\"> 6 Wallace, 532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b237-16\"> 9 Id. 687.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b237-17\"> 11 Id. 244.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"> Battles <em>v. </em>Fobes, 18 Pickering, 532; 19 Id. 578; Wright <em>v. </em>Oakley, 5 Metcalf, 405; Davis <em>v. </em>Minor, 1 Howard\u2019s Mississippi, 189; Couch <em>v. </em>McKee, 6 Arkansas, 495.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> <em>\u00a7 </em>292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> Penhallow et al. <em>v. </em>Doane\u2019s Administrators, 3 Dallas, 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\"> Prize Cases, 2 Black, 669.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"Aqy\"> Thorington <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 Wallace, 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-10\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\"> The Circassian, 2 Wallace, 148; The Venice, Id. 258; Mrs. Alexander\u2019s Cotton, Id. 419; Mauran <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 6 Id. 13, 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-11\" label=\"\u01c1\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\"> <em>\u00a7 </em>294.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-12\" label=\"\u00b6\">\n<p id=\"A3\"> Thorington <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 Wallace, 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-13\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\"> People <em>v. </em>McLeod, 1 Hill, 377.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-14\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> See National Intelligencer of June 17th, 1841.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-15\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b244-12\"> As to this see also Webster\u2019s Private Correspondence, vol. 2, p. 104 letter of May 16th, 1841, to Fletcher Webster, and p. 112, letter of January 14th, 1842, to Mr. Beinar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-16\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> 11 Wallace, 493.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-17\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> 9 Wallace, 197.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-18\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-6\">Mr. Justice CLIFFORD</author>\n<p id=\"AuE\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Special jurisdiction only is given to this court by virtue of a writ of error to a State court, and unless the record shows that the case falls within the conditions annexed to the right of a party to invoke the exercise of the jurisdiction, the writ of error must be dismissed. Primarily those conditions are two: (1.) That it shall appear that some one of the questions specified in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, or the second section of the amendatory act, did arise in the case. (2.) That the question which did so. arise in the case was decided by the court in the way therein required to give this Court jurisdiction to re-examine the question, and the rule is settled that unless both those things appear the jurisdiction does not attach.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">On the sixth day of August, 1866, the plaintiff brought an action of trespass for false imprisonment against the defendant in the State court, in which he alleged that the defendant, on the twenty-ninth of June, 1862, with force and arms, seized the plaintiff and incarcerated him in a dungeon, and imprisoned him therefor twenty-four days, separated from his home and family, and that he subjected him to great danger and many hardships, and seriously impaired his health and put him to great pain and distress, both of body and mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Service having been made the defendant appeared and demurred to the declaration, and filed seven other pleas, as follows: (1.) That he was not guilty in manner and form as alleged. (2.) That the action was. not brought within one year next after the right to bring the same accrued. (3.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>That the action was not brought within two years next after the right to bring the same accrued. (4.) That more than two years had elapsed after the right to bring the action accrued, and before the present limitation act of the State was passed. (5.) That the plaintiff and defendant were citizens of the same State, and that the whole time prescribed as a limitation had elapsed before the present act modifying the pre-existing law was 'passed. (6.) That the supposed grievances were acts done by the defendant as provost marshal under the military orders of the State, in time of actual war, as more fully set forth in the plea. (7.) That the President, on the seventh of September, 1865, granted the defendant a full pardon and amnesty for all offences by him committed, arising from participation, direct or indirect, in the rebellion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Subsequently the plaintiff filed a joinder to the demurrer, joined the issue tendered under the plea of not guilty, and filed a replication to the six special pleas as follows: (1.) That the action is not barred as alleged, and tendered an issue to the country. (2.) That the action is not barred as alleged in the second special plea, and also tendered an issue to the country. (3.) That the action is not barred as alleged in the third special plea, and tendered an ifesue to the country. (4.) Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth special pleas, and the defendant demurred to the replication of the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s first special plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Nil the issues of law were determined by the court in favor of the plaintiff', that is, the court overruled the demurrer to the declaration, sustained the demurrers of the plaintiff to the fourth, fifth, and sixth special pleas of the defendant, and also overruled the demurrer of the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s replication to the defendant\u2019s first special plea, which left nothing for trial but the issues of fact, which were submitted to a jury, and the jury found all the issues of fact in favor of the plaintiff, and that the defendant was guilty as alleged in the declaration, and assessed damages for the plaintiff' in the sum of eight hundred and thirty-three dollars. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff', and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the defendant excepted and removed the case into the Court of Appeals of the State, where the judgment was in all things affirmed. Whereupon the defendant sued out the present writ of error and removed the cause into this court for re-examination under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Jurisdiction, it is claimed by the defendant, may be sustained in this case upon three grounds, which will be separately considered: (1.) Because the judge told the jury that, in computing the time of the statute of limitations, they ought to exclude from the computation all that period of time between the seventeenth of April, 1861, and the twenty-seventh of February, 1866, as that ruling, as he contends, was equivalent to a ruling that the recent acts .passed by the State upon that subject are valid laws, which he denies. (2.) Because the court sustained the demurrer of the plaintiff to the fifth special plea of the defendant, setting up belligerent rights as a defence to the action. (3.) Because the court excluded the pardon granted to him by the President when offered in evidence under the plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">1. Two acts of limitation have recently been passed by the State legislature. By the first, which was passed on the first day of March, 1865, it was enacted that, in computing the time within which any civil suit, proceeding, or appeal, shall be barred by any statute of limitations, the period from the seventeenth day of April, 1861, to the date of the passage of the act, shall be excluded from such computation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By a subsequent act passed on the twenty-seventh of February, 1866, it is provided that, in computing the time within which any civil suit, or proceeding in trespass or case, shall be barred by any statute of limitations in certain counties, including the county in which this suit was brought, the period from the first day of March, 1865, to the date of the passage of the act shall be excluded from such computation.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Two prayers for instruction upon that subject were also presented by the defendant which were refused by the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>but it is not- necessary to reproduce them, as the question involved is as fully raised by the instruction given to the jury as by the refusal to give those instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Exception was taken by the defendant to the refusal to instruct\u2019 and to the instruction given, but the grounds of the exception are not stated, nor are the reasons for the ruling given by the court. Such an exception is not sufficient to show that any one of the questions mentioned in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act was either raised or decided in the manner therein required to give this court jurisdiction under a writ of error to a State court. Unless both those things appear; that is, unless it appears that the question was raised and that it was decided in the way required, the jurisdiction does not attach, and it is clear that the exception is not sufficient to show that either occurred at the trial. Nothing further was done upon the subject in the court of original jurisdiction, but the cause was removed into the Court of Appeals of the State, where the judgment was affirmed. Appended to the judgment in that co'urt is a certificate signed by the clerk and certified by the presiding justice of the court, that there was drawn in question the validity of the act of the State passed March, 1865, in relation to the statute of limitations, on the ground that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the Uuited States, and that the decision of the highest court of law and equity in the State was in favor of its validity. Evidently that court had before it nothing but the exception taken and signed in the subordinate court, which is clearly insufficient to raise such a question'or to show that it was decided in a way to give this court jurisdiction in such a case. Undoubtedly such a certificate is entitled to much weight, as showing that the question was decided by the court which gives it, and in the manner required to give jurisdiction, but it -is not conclusive to show that the question was raised in the case, as the latter question may depend upon the construction of the pleadings, or, as in this case, upon the proper construction of the language of the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Necessary implication, it is said, will suffice, which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>be granted, but it can hardly be said in ibis case that it must necessarily be implied that the judge instructed the jury that the State statute was consistent with the Federal Constitution. What he did tell the jury was that a certain period of time should be excluded from the computation in determining the issues of fact presented by the pleadings, whether the action was barred by the one or two years' limitations. Three years before that this court bad decided that the period during which the courts of the State\u2019 where the defendant resided were closed, by reason of the insurrection and rebellion, should not be deemed and taken as a part of such a limitation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Congress allowed one year from the date of the act to the time allowed for suing out writs of error and taking appeals in districts where the sessions\u2019 of the courts had been suspended or interrupted by insurrection or rebellion, and this court decided that the act of Congress was a remedial, and not a restraining one, and applied the rule laid down in the prior ease, that in computing the five years allowed for the purpose, the period for which the courts were closed by insurrection or rebellion, must be excluded from the computation.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Provision was also made by Congress that the time during which any person was-beyond the reach of legal process, by reason of resistance to the execution of the laws, or the interruption of the ordinary course of judici proceedings, shall not be deemed or taken as any part of the time limited bylaw for the commencement of any action, civil or criminal. Objection was taken to the validity of that provision, but this court unanimously held it to be constitutional.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Prior to these decisions, founded upon acts of Congress, this court had decided, as before remarked, that the period during which the courts were closed by the insurrection must be excluded from every such computation, and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>court has twice since that decided in the same way, every justice of the court concurring in the opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Enemy creditors cannot prosecute their claims subsequent to the commencement of hostilities, as the rule is universal and peremptory that they,are totally incapable of sustaining any action in the tribunals of the other belligerent. Absolute suspension of the right to sue and prohibition to exercise it. exist during war, by the law of nations, but the restoration of peace removes the disability and, opens the doors of the' courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Tested by these considerations, this court is of the opinion that the judge of the State court may well have, followed the decisions of this court in the instruction he gave to the jury without having intended to express any opinion as to the constitutionality of the State law, and that it does not appear with sufficient certainty that the supposed Federal question did arise in the case, or that it was decided in the manner required to give this court jurisdiction under a writ of error to a State court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">2. Next ground assumed is that the 'court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the plaintiff to the fifth special plea of the defendant, setting up belligerent rights as a defence to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Unquestionably it does appear that the plaintiff demurred to that plea and that the court sustained the demurrer , to the plea, but it .nowhere appears that the court held the plea bad for the reason.supposed by the defendant. On the contrary, the plea is very defectively drawn, and it may be that it was. held bad for many other sufficient reasons, and the fact that the certificate filed by the chief justice makes no mention of this point justifies the conclusion that it was not decided by the court of last resort. Questions presented in a subordinate court are frequently waived-iu the appellate court, and it is plain law that questions not presented in the court of last resort do not give jurisdiction in a case like the one before the court. Such a question may be raised in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>bill of exceptions, but sufficient of the proceedings must be stated to show not only that it was raised, but that it was decided in the manner required to give the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">3. All that remains to be considered is the question respecting the pardon. By the bill of exceptions it appears that the defendant offered the pardon, both in mitigation of damages, and as a justification of the alleged wrongful acts, and it appears that the plaintiff objected to the introduction of the instrument and that the court sustained the objection, and that the pardon was excluded. Enough appears to show for what purpose the pardon was offered, but nothing appears to show upon what grounds it was rejected at the trial or that the question was ever examined or decided by the Court of Appeals. Eive conditions are embodied in the paraon, but the record shows that the defendant complied with the ffrst and fifth, and it does not show that he has ever violated any one of the others. No mention is made of that ruling in the certificate of the chief justice, nor is there anything in the record to show that the exception was presented to the Court of Appeals, unless that may be inferred from the fact that the Court of Appeals found that there was no error in the record and affirmed the judgment. Questions not decided in the State court, because not raised or presented by the complaining party, will not be re-examined in this court on a writ of error sued out under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Such is the settled practice, and the act of Congress provides that it must appear that the question presented for decision in this court was raised in the State court, and that the decision of the State court was given as required by that section.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Repeated decisions have established that rule, and inasmuch as the point has been several times ruled at the present session, we forbear to extend the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Dismissed for want op jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\"> 1 Stat. at Large, 85; 14 Id. 386.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> Sess.
