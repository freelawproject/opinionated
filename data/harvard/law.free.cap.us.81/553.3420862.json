M. and J. M. Smith,\u201d </em>and charged to them on the land-book of the State aforesaid for the year 1860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">The rebellion being suppressed the <em>Smiths </em>\u2014 never <em>having offered as </em>\u201c <em>holders of a valid lien </em>\u201d <em>or otherwise to </em>redeem\u2014 brought suit in proper form against Turner to recover certain arrears of the ground-rent. Turner claimed title to the lot free of rent under the sale for taxes, made by authority of the several acts of Congress, already, mentioned, for imposing and collecting a direct tax. The decision of the court where the suit was brought was <em>against </em>the title thus set up, that is to saj', it was in favor of the Smiths, and their rent, and this decision being affirmed in the highest court of the State,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the case was here for review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-8\">\n<em>Mr. F. L. Smith, for Turner, plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-9\">The length of time in which Moore mid those who succeeded him were in possession, that is to say, the lapse of time from 1821 (when Hannon died and Moore resumed possession of his house) to 1864, when this sale was made, is sufficient to raise a presumption of either a re-entry in 1821 with all the requisite forms of the common law, or of a re-lease then or afterwards by Hannon\u2019s heirs. After such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a term as forty-two years, almost any presumption necessary to sustain 'a party in possession will be made. By such a re-entry or release, a merger' took place,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and there ceased to be two separate estates in the one property. The house and lot, free of ground-rent, thus became Smith\u2019s; and being regularly sold to Turner, he was owner of it discharged of all incumbrance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-6\">This would all be so on principles of common law, but the fourth section of the act of June 7th, 1862, gives a disincumbered estate to the purchaser, even if the owner of the fee held it incumbered to its entire value. The estate may indeed be defeated by the holder of any valid lien,.being a loyal person, if he redeem in the mode specified in the acts. But no such redemption is pretended. In any aspect, therefore, the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-7\">\n<em>Mr. C. W. Wattles, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-8\">1. The case showed only that the <em>owner </em>of the rent charge took possession of the premises. A re-entry with common-law formalities cannot from this be inferred, nor a release from the heirs of the owner of the ground. The only inference is an act of trespass by the owner of the rent and.a violation by hinr of the rights of his tenant. And this inference is made a certainty by Moore\u2019s conveyance of the rent <em>eo nomine </em>in 1825 to Irwin, as a thing then existing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-9\">No time will run against a rent charge, so as to divest title or extinguish it. The limitation applies only to the recovery of rent in arrears by distress or action. The estate itself remains for all time unless merged or extinguished. The principle is elementary. The case then is that\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-10\">1st. Of a title, to the land in Hannon\u2019s heirs, in fee simple (subject to the rent), at the time of the tax sale; a corporeal hereditament; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-11\">2d: Of a fee simple titl\u00e9 to the rent charge in the Smiths; an incorporeal hereditament.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-12\">Hence there were two separate and distinct estates; one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>of them, the land, was sold for the tax; the other, the rent, remained intact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-6\">It would, indeed, be a forced construction to say that an incorporeal hereditament is a lien, incumbrance upon, or a right, title, or claim to land, in the sense contemplated by the act, for tfye rent may have been held by a citizen most devoted to the cause of the United States, and residing in a State not in insurrection; who could have no notice of a contemplated sale of his property, either directly or by the terms of the act, as it does not provide for a tax upon such Bpecies of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-7\">2. The land was sold for less than two-thirds of'its value. This made the sale void. The act of 1863 requires the tax commissioners to bid off the land to the United States \u201cat a sum not exceeding two-thirds of the assessed value.\u201d They did no such thing. The assessed value was $3500. Two-thirds of that sum is $2333.33. They sold it for $1750. Literally construed, indeed, the language \u201c <em>authorized </em>to bid off\u201d may be but permissive, and not mandatory. But it is a general rule of construction that where power is conferred by statute on public officers in language which, literally construed, is but permissive, the lartguage will be coustrued as peremptory whenever the power is conferred for the benefit of the public or of individuals. And by no court has this doctrine been declared more emphatically than by this. Witness the case of <em>Supervisors </em>v. <em>United States,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which words so little mandatory in form as the words \u201c <em>m.ay, if deemed Advisable,\u201d </em>were construed as imposing a positive and absolute duty; the court citing cases from old reports like Skinner and Salkeld; \u201c leading cases on the subject,\u201d which it declares \u201c have been followed in numerous English and American adjudications,\u201d to this day. In the present case the authority was conferred for the benefit of the government of the United States, representing the whole public; \u2022md the government had a right to claim,its exercise by the commissioners as a duty imperative on them. Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>could not, by the act of 1863, have intended to leave the commissioners to say what lands should be bid off and what not; any more than it could have so intended by the act of 1862, in which, certainly, it did not so intend. It meant, in all cases, to take the land for the United States if it could be obtained on the terms specified in the act, and to deny authority to the commissioners to sell it to any other purchaser.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 294.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\"> Ib. 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\"> 12 Stat. at Large, 640.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\"> 18 Grattan, 835.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-13\"> Chester <em>v. </em>Willes, 1 Ambler, 246.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"> 4 Wallace, 435.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-7\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b578-6\">Mr. Justice MILLER</author>\n<p id=\"AMl\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Two propositions are relied on to defeat the title under the sale for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">1. That the land was sold at the tax sale for less than two-thirds of its assessed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">2. That the plaintiffs below, in whose favor the judgment was rendered, were the owners of a rent charge on the land, which was not extinguished by the sale for the.unpaid taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">1. The first of these propositions is founded on the amendment tp the seventh section of the act of June 7th, 1862, passed February 6th, 1863. The latter act undoubtedly was intended to be a substitute for the seventh section of the former, and to supersede it entirely. In a case of doubtful construction it is, therefore, important to consider what changes are made by the latter in regard to the matter now-in controversy. By the original section the commissioners who were, appointed for the collection of the tax were required, at the tim\u00e9 and place of sale, to cause the lots and lands to be severally sold to the highest bidder for a sum not less than the tax, penalty, and costs, and 10 per centum per annum interest on said tax, pursuant to notice, aud to strike off the same severally to the United States at that sum, unless some person should bid the same or a larger sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The amendment says that'the commissioners shall be required, \u201c at the time and place of sale, to cause the same to be severally sold to the highest bidder for a sum not less than the taxes, penalty, and costs, and 10 per centum per annum interest on said .tax, pursuant to notice; in all cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>where the owners of said lots or parcels of ground shall not, on or before the (lay of sale, appear in person before the board of commissioners and pay the amount of said tax, with.10 per centumdnterest thereon, with costs of advertising the same, or request the same to be struck off to a purchaser for less than two-thirds of the assessed value of said several lots or parcels' of ground, the said commissioners shall be authorized, at said sale, to bid off .the same to the United States at a sum not exceeding two-thirds of the assessed value thereof, unless some person shall bid a largei sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The -first act and the second are alike in the provision that the laud shall be sold to the highest bidder for a sum not less than what is due on it for tax, interest, and cost. This, in both cases, refers to bids by others than the United States. In reference to bids made by the commissioners on behalf of the United States, there is a change. The first, statute made it imperative that the commissioner should strike off the land to the United States at the amount of the tax, interest, and costs, unless others bid that or a larger sum; and it is a fair inference that the commissioners were not authorized to,bid at all for the land, unless it be called a bid,to strike it off to,the government, when no one else would take.it, for the tax, interest, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The second statute makes a material change in this part of the law. When the owner does not pay, or request the same to be struck off to a purchaser for a less sum than two-thirds of its value, the commissioners are authorized to bid off the- same to the United States at a sum not exceeding two-thirds of such assessed-value.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The intention .in making this change seems to us to be to remove-the restriction'by which the United States must either take the land for the taxes, or. let it go to whoever would pay the taxes, or any greater sum, if-he was the highest bidder. After the amount due was offered the government was, by,the first statute, no longer a competing , bidder, and the owner was at the mercy of private bidders. Under the new statute the commissioner could become a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>competitor after the amount of the tax was bid, with two limitations. First, he should not bid against a purchaser whom the owner, by request, preferred. And, secondly, he should not bid beyond two-thirds of the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Instead of being bound to bid that sum, he was <em>authorized </em>to bid any sum not <em>exceeding </em>that, and could not bid that if the' purchaser requested that it might be struck off to a friend for less than that sum. If the language had been that he was authorized to bid it off at two-thirds, it would be a forced and unnatural construction of the section to hold that the words were imperative. The language which would express that idea would be that he was required to do it, or that he should not bid it off for a less sum. But here, while he is authorized to bid, that bid may be for any sum not exceeding two-thirds its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">But the sale in this case comes within the first categoiy. The United States did not bid at all. A private person bid a sum sufficient to piay the tax, interest, and cost, and the commissioner let him have it, and we see nothing in the statute which forbids it. Certainly we cannot infer because the United States authorized the commissioner in a defined contingency to bid off the land <em>for </em>a sum not <em>exceeding </em>two-thirds its value, that he was therefore bound in all cases to make it bring that <em>much.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\"We think there was error in the Appellate Court of Virginia in holding the sale void because this was not don\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">2. In the act of August 5th, 1861, apportioning the tax of $20,000,000 among the States, according to population, provision -is made for its collection out of the lauds within those States, if not.paid by the States. Under the provisions of that act it might admit of some doubt whether the tax was in its essence a tax on the land, and on all the various estates into which the fee may have been divided, or was a tax on the o.wner of the land, and levied on the interest of the owner in it, .and on no other subordinate or incorporeal interest. But no tax was ever collected, or any land sold under that act. The States.which, in the war for the support of which this tax was levied, supported the General Gov <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>eminent, assumed and paid the portion allotted to each. 'With regard to the States which were in insurrection, Congress passed a new law for the assessment and collection of their portion, under which the sale in this case was made That act, the statute of 1862, to which we have already referred, directed the commissioners to whom the collection of the tax was intrusted, to take the last assessment \u00f3f the value of the lands made in each State for State taxation as the basis on which the tax charged to that State by the act of 1861 should be apportioned among the several lots and parcels within that State, and a penalty of fifty pep cent, was added in each case for non-payment. The President was directed to declare by his proclamation what States or parts of States were in insurrection, and \u201c thereupon the said several lots or parcels of land became charged respectively with their respective portions of said direct tax, and the same, together with the penalty, became a lien thereon, without any further proceedings whatever.\u201d Section three gave a time in which this tax might be -paid, and section four proceeds to say that \u201c the title of, in, and to each and every parcel of land upon which said tax has not been paid as above provided, shall thereupon become forfeited to the United State's, and upon the sale hereinafter provided for shall vest in the United States, or in the purchaser at such sale, in fee simple, free and discharged from <em>all liens, </em>incumbrances, right, title, and claim whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">There is nothing in the statute which requires the tax commissioners to hunt up the owner, or'to make the tax out of personal property of his, or which may be found upon the land. It is clearly a direct tax on the land, and on all the estates, interests, and claims connected with or growing out of the land. All this was forfeited to the United States on uon-payment of the taxes, and passed with the sale to the purchaser, subject alone to the right of redemption, which the lawallowed. In that respect it was a defeasible title, but in all other respects perfect, complete, and entire. The lauguage of the statute is explicit to this purport, and the policy and necessity of the government, which could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>look after the fugitive and hostile owners, required such \u00e1 tax, and such a mode of collecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the sale being a valid one the rent charge of the. defendant in error was cut off and destroyed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
