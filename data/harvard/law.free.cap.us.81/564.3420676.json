On the trial evidence being given, on the one hand, tending to show that in a statement furnished by A. in professed pursuance of the agreement, he had not included this money lent to B. &amp; C., and on the other that at the time of the agreement he had agreed that he <em>would </em>put it in, an instruction was held to be correct which told the jury, that if at the time of the agreement between the partners, A. had assented to treat this money as an advance and to fund it, B. &amp; O. would not remain personally liable on the original loan, if it had in truth been made to them personally; and that the fact that A. did not include the amount in his <em>statement </em>of advances made was not material, provided, as already said, that at the time of the agreement he had in fact <em>agreed </em>to include it. .</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-14\">Error to the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois; the case, as assumed by the court from a bill of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ceptions covering thirty 8vo. pages, in long primer type, without any assignment of errors, having been thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">Richard Gregg sued <em>W. </em>S.

But it seemed that there existed at-that time in Peoria, \"where the transaction occurred, and where all the parties resided, a partnership formed, to build a railroad, styled Kellogg, Moss &amp;,Co., of which the plaintiff \u00e1nd defendant, and Kellogg and others were members, and that the money furnished by Gregg had been used for the benefit of this partnership, which had now spent its funds and failed in its enterprise. The defendant alleged that the money had been advanced by the plaintiff' to the <em>partnership, </em>and on <em>its </em>credit, and not on the individu\u00e1l credit of Kellogg and Moss; and that if this were not so at the time, that the plaintiff afterwards (on the 1st ,of December, 1857) had agreed that this sum, with others advanced by him to the partnership, should become capital in the partnership busir ness, and thus increase his share of the capital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-14\">The plaintiff proved the signatures to the letter, and that the sum mentioned in it was received by Kellogg, partly in .money and partly in drafts, which answered the purpose; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and, in the further progress of his case, offered to prove by a competent witness that only a few minutes after Kellogg had obtained the money, he told the witness that he had received the money from the plaintiff', and had \u201cfixed Elder off'/\u2019 and that Elder had gone home. On objection by the defendant the court excluded the testimony, and the exclusion was the subject of the first bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\">Testimony was given on both sides on the point above stated to have been the grounds on which the defendants chiefly put the case, to wit, that the $10,000 had been advanced, originally to the partnership, and on its credit; and if not, that by the agreement of 1st December, 1857, the plaintiff had agreed that it should become capital in'it. It was not denied that all the partners of the firm of Kellogg &amp; Co., had, on the 1st of December named, made an agreement reciting that some of the members had advanced money and funds beyond their shares in the partnership, and agreeing that \u201c each and every member of the said firm should-make a statement of . . . advancements made to said firm, together with 10 per cent, interest from the dates of them, which after the said 1st of December, 1857, should remain as the capital stock of the firm, and represent the capital stock of each individual member of the firm, and fix their interests therein respectively and <em>pro ianto.\u201d </em>But Gregg swore that he had never funded this debt; that he had made out the statement in accordance with the agreement of December 1st, 1857, and that this $10,000 was not included in that account. Other testimony, however, tended to prove that when the agreement of 1st December was made Gregg did <em>agree </em>to put in this $10,000, and that it was one condition on which other partners signed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-7\">The evidence being closed the court charged fully saying, among other things, to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-8\">\u201cIf the evidence satisfies you that the plaintiff, at the time the agreement of the 1st of December, 1857, was made, assented to treat this $10,000 as a part of his advances to the firm of Kellogg, Moss <em>&amp; </em>Co., and to have the same funded, as contemplated in said agreement, such assent on his part is binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>upen him, and releases Kellogg &amp; Moss from their promise to pay the said sum or see the same paid. It is a substitution of the liability of the new firm to ultimately reimburse this amount as a part of the capital put into the old firm by the plaintiff for the individual liability of Kellogg &amp; Moss, to him. But it is for you to say, under the evidence, whether such assent or agreement to fund was, in fact, made or not. If made, the defence is made out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">\u201cNor is it material whether the plaintiff afterwards included this amount in his statement of advances to the old firm or not. It is enough that he agreed to do so. Granting that Kellogg &amp; Moss were liable to make it good to him in December, 1857, still, if the plaintiff agreed that the sum for which they were so liable should be carried over to his capital stock with Kellogg, Moss &amp; Co., then the agreement is binding on the plaintiff, because this sum bad already clearly been put into the affairs of the firm, and either the plaintiff or Kellogg &amp; Moss were entitled to have it charged up as part of the assets furnished and sunk in the past business.of the firm.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">Verdict and judgment having gone for the defendant the case was now brought here, where it was submitted on a printed brief of</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ad8N\">\n<em>Mr. O.

That there was error in the exclusion of the testimony to show what Kellogg had said a few minutes after obtaining the money; that this ruling was erroneous, because the plaintiff had a right to prove the admission of one of the joint promisors as to the receipt of the money, made at about the time of or immediately after the transaction took place; a position which the learned counsel sustained by an able argument; relying on <em>Lowle </em>v. <em>Boteler,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> Bachman </em>v. <em>Killinger,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> Cady </em>v. <em>Shepard,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and other cases in Massachusetts and elsewhere, though he admitted that the rule was different in New York, and perhaps in some other States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>2d.

The record presents a bill of exceptions of thirty printed pages of testimony, which is certified to be all that was given on the trial, and the arguments address themselves to the entire merits on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">\u00a5e have felt very much inclined'to dismiss the writ of error or affirm the judgment without an attempt to look up the questions of law which might possibly be involved in the record, for the number of cases coming to this court in which the bill of exceptions embodies all the evidence offered, and counsel, tempted by this, argue before us the whole case as ff the verdict concluded nothing, requires a decisive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">As far as we are. able to see there are but two questions of law raised by the reeord.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The first relates to the exclusion of a single item of evidence offered by the plaintiff, and the second to the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">The plaintiff having-proved the signatures to the letter of December. 23d, 1856, and that the sum mentioned in it was received by Mr. Kellogg, offered in the further progress of his case to prove by a competent witness that only a few minutes after Kellogg had obtained the money he told the witness that be had received the money from the plaintiff\", and had. \u201cfixed Elder .off,\u201d and that Elder had gone home. The exclusion of this testimony is the occasion of the first bill of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"AoQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>We have a learned argument on the vexed question of the admissibility of the deelai\u2019atio'ns of one partner, or joint obligor, against the other. But we are of opinion that the ruling of the court presents no error which should reverse the judgment, because its rejection worked no harm to the plaintiff. The execution of the paper was not denied, nor was it coptroverted, except by the general form of the pleading, that Kellogg had received the money. It had already been proved by several other witnesses and was at no time made a point in the case. The whole controversy before the jury turned on the question whether the money so received was advanced by Gregg on the credit of Kellogg and Moss alone, and if so, whether he had afterwards agreed to convert it into capital. The admission of Kellogg that he had received the money from Gregg gave no light- on either -of these questions. The judgment should not be reversed for the rejection of this testimony, whether it was in strict legal principle admissible or not.-</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The brief of the plaintiff proceeds to argue that the evidence before the jury does not sustain either of the. allegations of advancing the money to the partnership, or the agreement of\u2019 the plaintiff to convert it into capital, of the partnership. With this we can have nothing to do. \" It was the province of the jury to determine whether eith\u00e9f of these allegations was proved, for either of them was a valid defence to this action, and they have found in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">It is argued, however, that the instructions of the court on this branch of the subject were erroneous \u2014 to the prejudice of the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">We have examined carefully the points of the charge objected to as well as the other parts of it, and, without elaborating the matter, we are of opinion that it puts this, the turning-point of the case, to the jury on fair grounds, and we can see no objection to the legal propositions stated by the court and excepted to by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Judgment ae\u00e9irmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
