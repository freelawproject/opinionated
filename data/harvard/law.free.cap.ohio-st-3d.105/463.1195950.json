The property in question \u2014 identified in the Cuyahoga County Auditor\u2019s records as parcel number 471-17-025 \u2014 is known as the Greenbrier Ice Rink.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 2} At issue here are tax years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, when the city owned the property but leased it to an entity known as Voinovich-Carney Ice Facilities Group or \u201cVC Ice.\u201d VC Ice was an Ohio limited-liability company that marketed itself to the city as \u201can ice facilities development and management firm specializing in structuring entities which, with partners, it operates through autonomous investment vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">{\u00b6 3} The lease signed by representatives of the city and VC Ice in 1995 called for VC Ice to pay the city a rental fee of $60,000 annually for ten years. In return for the payments, VC Ice was entitled under the lease to \u201cuse and occupy\u201d the ice rink and to operate and maintain the rink as an ice-skating facility for the paying public. The lease also indicated that any employees hired by VC Ice to operate the ice rink would be VC Ice employees, not public employees, and VC Ice was required under the lease to pay for liability and property insurance as well as all utility charges for the rink. In addition, VC Ice was obligated by the terms of the lease to pay \u201call taxes * * * whatsoever, including all governmental charges of whatsoever name, nature or kind, which may be levied, assessed or charged * * * against the land * * * or * * * any building or buildings, or any other improvements now or hereafter thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">{\u00b6 4} VC Ice terminated its lease with the city in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">{\u00b6 5} In 2000, the city sought an exemption under R.C. 5713.08 for real property taxes owed or paid on the property for 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. The city\u2019s application identified three statutory provisions as grounds for the exemption request: (1) R.C. 5709.08, which exempts from taxation any \u201cpublic property used exclusively for a public purpose\u201d; (2) R.C. 5709.081, which exempts certain publicly owned athletic facilities; and (3) R.C. 5709.12, which exempts some public property used for charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">{\u00b6 6} The Tax Commissioner denied the exemption request, finding that the property \u201cwas used for a private purpose during tax years 1996 through 1999.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>According to the Tax Commissioner, VC Ice used the ice rink \u201cfor its own business purposes\u201d rather than a public purpose. VC lee \u201cused the property to generate approximately $439,523.00 in gross revenue,\u201d the Tax Commissioner explained, and he noted that the property \u201cwas to be run as other for-profit recreational facilities, such as private health clubs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">{\u00b6 7} The city then appealed under R.C. 5717.02 to the Board of Tax Appeals. The BTA in turn affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision, finding that VC Ice had \u201cleased the premises from the city with a view to profit.\u201d Users of the ice rink were charged market rates to skate there when VC Ice operated the rink, according to the BTA, and the \u201centire reason for the lease was to cut costs and make the facility more profitable.\u201d Explaining that \u201c[r]eal property used in carrying on a private or proprietary function in competition with other enterprises engaged privately in similar activities is not entitled to exemption,\u201d the BTA affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision for all four years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 8} The city has now appealed to this court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIn reviewing decisions of the BTA, we determine whether the BTA\u2019s decision is reasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Standards Testing Laboratories v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 10. \u201cIt is not the function of this court to substitute its judgment for that of the BTA on factual issues,\u201d although any facts determined by the BTA \u201cmust be supported by sufficient probative evidence.\u201d <em>Bethesda Healthcare, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 420, 2004-Ohio-1749, 806 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 10} Any statutes exempting property from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19. \u201c[T]he burden rests on the one claiming an exemption to demonstrate that the property qualifies.\u201d <em>True Christianity Evangelism v. Zaino </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 117, 742 N.E.2d 638. That burden falls on the party seeking an exemption because \u201ctax exemption is in derogation of the rights of all taxpayers and necessarily shifts a heavier tax burden upon the non-exempt.\u201d <em>Joint Hosp. Serv., Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 153, 155, 6 O.O.3d 371, 370 N.E.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 11} The city argues first that it is entitled to a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.08, which exempts from taxation any \u201cpublic property used exclusively for a public purpose.\u201d To qualify for a tax exemption under the statute, (1) the property \u201cmust be public property, (2) it must be used for a public purpose, and (3) the use must be exclusively for a public purpose.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 12} We have said in past cases that \u201cwhenever public property is used by a private citizen for a private purpose, that use generally prevents exemption.\u201d <em>Whitehouse v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 178, 181, 648 N.E.2d 503. The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>explained more than 30 years ago remains true today: \u201cWhen * * * private enterprise is given the opportunity to occupy public property in part and make a profit, even though in so doing it serves not only the public, but the public interest and a public purpose,\u201d the property no longer meets the R.C. 5709.08 requirement that the property be. \u201cused exclusively for a public purpose.\u201d <em>Cleveland v. Perk </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 161, 166, 58 O.O.2d 354, 280 N.E.2d 653 (holding that areas of a city-owned airport that were leased to private entities for commercial enterprises were not exempt from real property taxes). And we have also noted that \u201cone who is in the possession and control of property and is occupying, managing and operating the same as lessee is often to be treated as the owner thereof.\u201d <em>Carney v. Cleveland </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 56, 58, 18 O.O.2d 256, 180 N.E.2d 14 (holding that aircraft hangars built by private persons on public land were not exempt from taxes).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 13} The record before us supports the BTA\u2019s findings that (1) the city-owned ice rink in Parma Heights was leased to VC Ice during the years in question and (2) VC Ice hoped to profit from its operation of that ice rink. Tellingly, VC Ice said in its 1995 proposal to the city, \u201c[W]e sincerely plan to make a profit,\u201d and that same proposal touted VC Ice\u2019s intent to increase revenue at the rink, keep prices at a competitive level, and expand the customer base. Also, that marketing proposal suggested that VC Ice intended to rent the ice rink \u201cfor birthday parties, corporate functions, tournaments and fund-raisers,\u201d and VC Ice\u2019s financial documents in the record before the BTA show that at one point during the years in question, more than 57 percent of the company\u2019s income from the operation of the ice rink was generated by the private rental of the rink. Other factors also undercut the city\u2019s claim that the property was devoted to a public purpose during the years in question, including the lease terms entitling VC Ice to \u201cuse and occupy\u201d the rink, the language in the lease giving the responsibility for the \u201coperation and management\u201d of the rink to VC Ice, and the city\u2019s agreement that employees at the ice rink would not be treated as public employees while the lease was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 14} And though the city is before us seeking a tax exemption, it was VC Ice that agreed in the lease to pay all taxes on the property. \u201cThe obvious purpose of the grant of tax exemption to governmental bodies [in R.C. 5709.08] is to confer a benefit upon them.\u201d <em>Cleveland v. Perk, </em>29 Ohio St.2d at 168, 58 O.O.2d 354, 280 N.E.2d 653, fn. 3. Yet under the terms of the lease signed by the city and VC Ice, any rebates of taxes paid by VC Ice \u201cshall belong to Lessee [VC Ice].\u201d That arrangement \u2014 like various other provisions in the lease \u2014 suggests that VC Ice\u2019s use of the ice rink was not consistent with the text of or purposes underlying R.C. 5709.08, which is designed to help governmental bodies rather than private commercial interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In response to all of this, the city contends here that VC Ice never intended to profit from its operation of the ice rink. Instead, VC Ice\u2019s sole objective was the public-spirited one of providing a better ice-skating facility for the benefit of area residents, the city argues. The BTA found otherwise, however, explaining that \u2018VC Ice leased the premises from the city with a view to profit.\u201d Probative evidence in the record supports that finding, and of course we always give wide discretion to the BTA in evaluating the credibility of witnesses and the weight that should be given to any evidence presented to it. As a result, we conclude that the city has not met its burden of showing that it is entitled to an R.C. 5709.08 tax exemption for the years when the ice rink was leased to VC Ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 16} To be sure, we have noted that \u201cin some situations a non-public use can be so incidental and so <em>de minimus </em>that it does not defeat an R.C. 5709.08 exemption.\u201d <em>Whitehouse, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 181, 648 N.E.2d 503 (holding that a private farmer\u2019s use of village-owned land was \u201csufficiently incidental\u201d when the village retained full control over the use of the property, received no rent from the farmer, had no lease or other written contract with the farmer, and allowed him to farm the land solely in order to save mowing and maintenance expenses for the village). See, also, <em>Bd. of Edn. of South-Western City Schools v. Kinney </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 184, 24 OBR 414, 494 N.E.2d 1109 (holding that the renting of an apartment and the operation of a privately run snack shop and pro shop at a city-owned golf course did not defeat the city\u2019s request for a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.08, because the renter\u2019s presence served the public purpose of deterring vandalism at the public course and no evidence indicated that the two shops generated any profit).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 17} Those cases do not call into doubt the lawfulness or reasonableness of the BTA\u2019s decision in this case, however. The lease agreement gave VC Ice the right to use and occupy the property, and it called for VC Ice and its own employees to play a central \u2014 not an incidental \u2014 role in the operation of the city\u2019s ice rink. And though the company might not have realized the profits that it had hoped to generate under the lease, any tax exemption for the property will\u2014 under the terms of the lease \u2014 benefit VC Ice rather than the city. The city\u2019s ongoing effort to secure that tax exemption for VC Ice undercuts the city\u2019s claim that the lease served solely a public purpose that benefited only the city and its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 18} For all of these reasons, we find that the BTA\u2019s decision to deny an R.C. 5709.08 tax exemption to the city was reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 19} We also conclude that the city is not eligible for an R.C. 5709.081 tax exemption. That statutory provision grants a tax exemption to real or personal property that is \u201cowned by a political subdivision\u201d and is used as a \u201cpublic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>recreational facility for athletic events.\u201d The statute requires that any such property meet various conditions to qualify for the exemption, and among those conditions is a requirement that the property be \u201ccontrolled and managed\u201d by the political subdivision. R.C. 5709.081(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 20} In denying the city\u2019s request for a tax exemption, the BTA noted that VC Ice was entitled under the lease to set rental fees at the ice rink, was responsible for maintaining the interior of the rink, and was obligated to pay rink employees and all utility and insurance expenses. Those findings are supported by the record, and we note as well that VC Ice marketed itself to the city as an \u201cice facilities development and management firm\u201d and promised to \u201cimplement its lease by use of * * * [various] management services for rink operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 21} The BTA could rightly find from these and other statements in the record that the property was not controlled and managed by the city while the lease was in effect. Indeed, when the lease was terminated by VC Ice in 1999, a memo prepared by the city\u2019s law director announced that the city would \u201cresume operation of the ice rink\u201d in an \u201corderly transition\u201d from \u201cV.C. Ice (the private operator of our Ice Rink since July 1995).\u201d The city has not met its burden of showing that it controlled and managed the ice rink while the lease was in effect, and therefore the Tax Commissioner and the BTA properly denied the city\u2019s request for an R.C. 5709.081 exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 22} We likewise find that the city is not entitled to the \u201ccharitable purposes\u201d tax exemption described in R.C. 5709.12. That provision grants a tax exemption to publicly owned property that is \u201cused exclusively for the accommodation or support of the poor.\u201d R.C. 5709.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 23} No language in the lease or in other documents in the record before the BTA suggests that VC Ice or the city sought to use the property for charitable purposes in support of the poor, and indeed the city typed the word \u201cNo\u201d next to the words \u201cProperty used for Charitable Purposes\u201d on the form requesting a tax exemption from the Tax Commissioner for the year 2000 (not at issue here), when the lease with VC Ice was no longer in effect. (The city later filed the application at issue here in which it did claim the charitable exemption for the property for 1996 through 1999.) And though R.C. 5709.12(D)(1) confers certain tax benefits on private nonprofit corporations that are \u201cexempt from federal income taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 100 Stat.2085, 26 U.S.C.A. 1, as amended,\u201d testimony before the BTA in this case established that VC Ice was not a 501(c)(3) entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 5709.12(B) also grants a tax exemption for real property \u201cbelonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d Even if the city can be considered an institution, however, it is not eligible for this exemption either. \u201cWhether an institution renders sufficient services to persons who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>unable to afford them to be considered as making charitable use of property must be determined on the totality of the circumstances * * <em>Bethesda Healthcare, Inc., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 420, 2004-Ohio-1749, 806 N.E.2d 142, at \u00b6 39. In this case, the city has identified no evidence in the record suggesting that its lease with VC Ice conferred a charitable benefit on anyone. VC Ice said itself in written materials supplied to the city in 1995 that it \u201csincerely plan[ned] to make a profit\u201d from its operation of the ice rink. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny the city\u2019s request for a charitable exemption was sound, and the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it affirmed that decision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b621-8\">Joseph D. Carney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4y\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Janyce C. Katz, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Tax Commissioner.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 25} The city has failed to carry its burden of proof on its request for a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.08, 5709.081, and 5709.12. The Tax Commissioner properly denied that request, and the BTA\u2019s decision to do the same was reasonable and lawful and was supported by the evidence in the record. We therefore affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-7\">Moyer, C.
