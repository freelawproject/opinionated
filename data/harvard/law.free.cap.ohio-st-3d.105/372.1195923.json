Because the court of appeals erred in granting summary judgment on behalf of appellees, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">{\u00b6 2} In 1984, the Shiloh Park Subdivision was created in Mentor, Ohio. The property was conveyed subject to various easements, restrictions, covenants, and conditions. In 1994, appellant, Richard A. Duncan, purchased a parcel in the subdivision at a sheriffs sale for $1,000. Duncan\u2019s parcel contains a large drainage creek in which Mentor has easement rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">{\u00b6 3} In August 2002, Duncan applied to build a single-family residence on that portion of his subdivision parcel adjacent to the city\u2019s easement. The city engineer requested that Duncan provide topographic information and details concerning groundwater in the event Duncan\u2019s plan included a basement. Duncan never provided the requested information. Duncan noted that although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>had discussed a sale of his parcel with abutting property owners, they would not likely agree on a price. Even though Duncan had purchased the property for $1,000, he was asking $11,000 from Mentor to purchase the land. The city noted that if Duncan\u2019s offer were more reasonable, the city might respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 4} On January 30, 2003, appellee Municipal Planning Commission of Mentor denied Duncan\u2019s application to build a residence on the property. The planning commission determined that the subdivision\u2019s declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions had designated Duncan\u2019s parcel a common area and not a buildable lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 5} On February 28, 2003, Duncan filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Lake County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, the Mentor City Council, the Mentor Planning Commission, and the council and commission members, to commence appropriation proceedings \u201cto determine the amount by which the value of [his] use of the property has been diminished as a consequence of the City\u2019s unconstitutional enforcement against Duncan\u2019s property of its zoning ordinances or other ordinances.\u201d Duncan alleged that he had been denied \u201ceconomically viable use of his land (totally and/or partially).\u201d Duncan attached an affidavit verifying the facts alleged in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 6} After the court of appeals denied appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Duncan\u2019s complaint, appellees answered and moved for summary judgment. Appellees claimed that no taking of Duncan\u2019s property had occurred because they did not apply any zoning ordinance in denying his application to build a house and they had not denied Duncan all economically viable use of his land. In his memorandum in opposition, Duncan claimed that he is being denied a permitted use of his lot. He specified by affidavit that he did not provide the requested topographic information to the city because he was told it was not yet required. Duncan also stated in his affidavit that he had read the covenants before he purchased the property and that the lot had never been owned by any homeowners\u2019 association.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 7} On September 20, 2004, the court of appeals granted appellees\u2019 summary-judgment motion and denied the writ. The court of appeals held that the planning commission\u2019s reliance on restrictive covenants in a subdivision declaration was insufficient to warrant an appropriation action because the commission was not enforcing any governmental regulation when it rendered its decision\u2014 i.e., the private nature of the covenants in the subdivision declaration precluded a taking by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 9} Duncan asserts that the court of appeals erred in granting appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion and denying his claim for a writ of mandamus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Summary judgment is appropriate if (1) no genuine issue of any material fact remains, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can came to but one conclusion, and construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 10} In order to be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, Duncan has to establish a clear legal right to compel appellees to commence an appropriation action, a corresponding clear legal duty for appellees to institute this action, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Savage v. Caltrider, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 363, 2003-Ohio-6806, 800 N.E.2d 358, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Mandamus: Appropriation</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 59, 63, 765 N.E.2d 345; Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Section 19, Article I, Ohio Constitution. \u201cMandamus is the appropriate action to compel public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings where an involuntary taking of private property is alleged.\u201d <em>Shemo, </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 63, 765 N.E.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals determined that Duncan\u2019s mandamus claim was not yet ripe because the planning commission\u2019s denial of Duncan\u2019s application to build a single-family home on his lot did not constitute a final determination concerning the application of regulations to the property. The court of appeals reasoned that the planning commission\u2019s decision was based on the private restrictive covenants of the subdivision declaration rather than on the application of any Mentor zoning ordinance. According to the court of appeals, \u201c[t]he proper forum for relator to litigate the question of the interpretation and application of the subdivision declaration would be the Lake County Court of Common Pleas in a declaratory judgment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 13} The court of appeals erred in so holding. In finding that Duncan\u2019s claim is not ripe, the court of appeals relied on <em>Williamson Cty. Regional Planning Comm. v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126, and <em>Karches v. Cincinnati </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 12, 526 N.E.2d 1350. In <em>Williamson, </em>473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126, the Supreme Court of the United States held that \u201ca claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Karches, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 12, 526 N.E.2d 1350, paragraph two of the syllabus, this court held that \u201c[a] prerequisite to a determination that an actual controversy exists in a declaratory judgment action is a final decision concerning the application of the zoning regulation to the specific property in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 14} Neither <em>Williamson </em>nor <em>Karches, </em>however, involved a mandamus action. <em>Williamson </em>concerned a federal civil rights action under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code, and <em>Karches </em>involved declaratory-judgment actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 15} Moreover, the planning commission has reached its \u201cfinal decision\u201d concerning Duncan\u2019s application: it has denied the application. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. BSW Dev. Group v. Dayton </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 338, 341-342, 699 N.E.2d 1271 (taking alleged by city\u2019s denial of demolition permit).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 16} Furthermore, the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that the subdivision declaration constituted a purely private matter was erroneous. Under Mentor Code of Ordinances 152.012, \u201cNo land shall be subdivided within the corporate limits of the City of Mentor until: [A] The subdivider shall submit plats as described by this chapter; [B] Said plats have been approved as provided herein; and [C] The approved plats are recorded in the County Record of Plats.\u201d Cf. R.C. 711.09(A)(1) (\u201cwhen a city planning commission adopts a plan for the major streets or thoroughfares and for the parks and other open public grounds of a city or any part of it, * * * then no plat of a subdivision of land within that city or territory shall be recorded until it has been approved by the city planning commission and that approval endorsed in writing on the plat\u201d). Because some municipal approval of the subdivision is contemplated, restrictive covenants contained in the subdivision declaration are not completely \u201cprivate.\u201d Cf. <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, \u00b6 28, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.Rev.1999) 371 (\u201cA \u2018restrictive covenant\u2019 is a \u2018private agreement, usu. in a deed or lease, that restricts the use or occupancy of real property, esp. by specifying lot sizes, building lines, architectural styles, and the uses to which the property may be put\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, insofar as Mentor approved the creation of the subdivision and applied covenants contained in the subdivision declaration to deny Duncan\u2019s application to build a single-family residence on his property, a compensable taking might have occurred. This conclusion is consistent with comparable authority. See, e.g., 1 Sackman &amp; Van Brunt, Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d Ed.2004) 1-243, Section 1.42[2], citing <em>Price v. Keene </em>(1982), 122 N.H. 840, 451 A.2d 382 (\u201cthe city\u2019s approval of a subdivision plan which eliminated a landowner\u2019s right-of-way to her property was a \u2018taking,\u2019 entitling the landowner to just compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 18} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for further proceedings. Genuine issues of material fact remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>regarding whether there was a compensable taking, e.g., whether the planning commission\u2019s application of subdivision covenants to deny Duncan\u2019s application substantially advanced legitimate state interests and whether that action denied Duncan all economically viable use of his property. See <em>State ex rel. Trafalgar Corp. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-6406, 819 N.E.2d 1040, \u00b6 25, quoting <em>Shemo, </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 63, 765 N.E.2d 345 (\u201ca compensable regulatory taking could \u2018occur <em>either </em>if the application of the zoning ordinance to the particular property is constitutionally invalid, i.e., it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, <em>or </em>denies the landowner all economically viable use of the land\u2019 \u201d).

However, I write to emphasize that we are simply finding that summary judgment was premature. We are not taking a position on the merits of the case. Issues of whether the covenants applied to Duncan, Duncan\u2019s knowledge of the covenants when he purchased the land for a mere $1,000, and the purpose of the covenants for a common area all involve concerns about the state\u2019s legitimate interest in regulating use of the land. Similarly, the city\u2019s offer to purchase Duncan\u2019s property may be evidence of the economic viability of the land. These issues need to be resolved on remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
