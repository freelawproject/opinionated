For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that the notice provision is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">{\u00b6 2} The board, through letters dated March 16,1999, notified appellees, Scott D. Shell, D.V.M., and Douglas Paroff, D.V.M., that they were charged with violations of Ohio statutes and administrative rules regarding their treatment of race horses with anabolic steroids. The letters stated that, after an investigation, the board had determined that the veterinarians had committed two separate violations: (1) administering anabolic steroids for nontherapeutic purposes and (2) failing to maintain appropriate medical records for the treated horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">(\u00b6 3} The letters further informed the veterinarians of the opportunity to request a formal hearing to contest the charges. At their request, a hearing was held on five dates in January and April 2000. After taking testimony from witnesses and reviewing the evidence and arguments, the hearing examiner issued a detailed report and recommendation to the board, with extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, on May 1, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">{\u00b6 4} The hearing examiner recommended that the board dismiss the charges regarding administration of anabolic steroids, finding that those charges had not been proven. The hearing examiner concluded, however, that the board had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>proven that the veterinarians violated the record-keeping requirements of the Ohio Administrative Code, finding that the records did not include all of the information required. The hearing examiner recommended that the veterinarians\u2019 licenses be suspended for ten days, with the suspensions stayed, provided the veterinarians complete a one-year probationary period, with additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 5} In an order dated July 20, 2001, the board fully adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction. The veterinarians appealed the ruling, and the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas affirmed the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal to the court of appeals, the veterinarians raised two assignments of error \u2014 the first, a due-process challenge asserting that it is unfair to apply the record-keeping rule to racetrack-horse veterinarians, and the second, an argument in part urging that the board\u2019s order was void because an inspection had been conducted without prior notice in violation of R.C. 4741.26(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Eleventh District Court of Appeals unanimously reversed the trial court judgment on the veterinarians\u2019 second assignment of error, concluding that R.C. 4741.26(A) requires that the board \u201cgive a licensed veterinarian five days notice before inspecting a place of business, even if the inspection is in conjunction with an investigation.\u201d The court of appeals held that the first assignment of error was moot in light of its ruling on the second and remanded the cause to the trial court, instructing that court \u201cto determine what effect the failure to give [the veterinarians] prior notice of the inspection had on the sustainability of the accusations for which [the veterinarians] were disciplined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 8} The cause is now before this court pursuant to our acceptance of the board\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 9} The sole issue presented is whether R.C. 4741.26(A) requires the board to give five days\u2019 written notice prior to conducting an inspection of a licensed veterinarian\u2019s place of business when that inspection is part of an investigation. The board readily concedes that it did not give the veterinarians five days\u2019 notice but contends that when, as here, an inspection is part of a surprise investigation, the terms of R.C. 4741.26(A) clearly allow the board to inspect without providing notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 4741.26(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe state veterinary medical licensing board shall enforce this chapter and for that purpose shall make investigations relative thereto. Except as provided in this division, in making any inspection pursuant to this chapter, the board may enter and inspect, upon written notice of not less than five days and during normal business hours, any licensee\u2019s, permit holder\u2019s, or registrant\u2019s place of business. If the board has knowledge or notice, pursuant to a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>complaint or any other written knowledge or notice by any person as verified by the signature of that person, of a violation of section 4741.18, 4741.19, or 4741.23 of the Revised Code, it shall investigate and, upon probable cause appearing, shall direct the executive secretary to file a complaint and institute the prosecution of the offender. In conducting any investigation for a suspected violation of this chapter, the board or its authorized agent does not have to provide any prior written notice to the licensee, permit holder, or registrant as long as the board provides a written authorization for the investigation and the board or its authorized agent provides the licensee, permit holder, or registrant with a copy of the authorization at the time of the investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 12} The above statute clearly provides that prior to conducting an <em>inspection, </em>the board must provide five days\u2019 written notice, subject to whatever exceptions appear later in the statute. Furthermore, the statute also clearly provides that when conducting an <em>investigation, </em>the board need not provide notice. The words \u201cinspection\u201d and \u201cinvestigation\u201d are not defined in R.C. Chapter 4741.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 13} In concluding that five days\u2019 written notice is required even when an inspection is part of an investigation, the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cR.C. 4741.26(A) clearly provides that \u2018[e]xcept as provided in this division, in <em>making any </em>inspection pursuant to this chapter, the board may enter and inspect, <em>upon urritten notice of not less than five days and during normal business hours, </em>any licensee\u2019s, permit holder\u2019s, or registrant\u2019s place of business.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) The section of the statute relied upon by [the board] never mentions inspections; rather, it simply states that <em>\u2018[i]n conducting any investigation for a suspected violation of this chapter, </em>the board or its authorized agent does not have to provide any prior written notice to the licensee, permit holder, or registrant as long as the board provides a written authorization for the investigation and the board or its authorized agent provides the licensee, permit holder, or registrant with a copy of the authorization at the time of the investigation.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIf this court were to interpret R.C. 4741.26 in the manner proposed by [the board], we would be adding language to the statute that does not exist. <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 338, 340, 1997-Ohio-278 [673 N.E.2d 1351]. This court also would be required to interpret the terms \u2018inspection\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 as being interchangeable, which, even according to [the board], they clearly are not. <em>Kimble v. Kimble, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-6667 [780 N.E.2d 273] at \u00b6 6 (holding that an undefined term in a statute \u2018must be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>{\u00b6 16} The board strongly disagrees with the reasoning of the court of appeals. The board urges us to adopt the hearing examiner\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4741.26, which is set forth below:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cR.C. 4741.26(A) provides for three separate types of inspections and/or investigations by [the board]. First, the statute authorizes what are generally known as \u2018compliance inspections.\u2019 These inspections require five days written notice to the veterinarian that [the board], or its investigator, may enter the veterinarian\u2019s office during normal business hours to conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cNext, R.C. 4741.26(A) provides that [the board] may investigate alleged violations of R.C. 4741.18, R.C. 4741.19, or R.C. 4741.23 upon a written complaint or other written knowledge or notice by any person. R.C. 4741.18, R.C. 4741.19, and R.C. 4741.23 address the unlawful practice of veterinary medicine and specific prohibitions against licensed veterinarians. All three statutes carry criminal penalties. See R.C. 4741.99. Investigations of these potential crimes by [the board] require a prior written complaint or other writing signed by a person filed with [the board].</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cFinally, R.C. 4741.20(A) [sic, R.C. 4741.26(A) ] provides that [the board] may investigate matters involving alleged violations of R.C. Chapter 4741 or the Rules of [the board]. R.C. 4741.26(A) provides that no prior written notice need be given to the licensee, but only that written authorization for the investigation be provided to the licensee at the time of the investigation by [the board] or its authorized agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 20} In line with the hearing examiner\u2019s view, the board urges that since the inspection in this case was conducted as part of a surprise investigation and was not simply a compliance inspection, the board was not required to provide the five days\u2019 written notice. The court of appeals rejected this interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 21} It appears that the First District Court of Appeals is the only other appellate court that has considered the issue in this case. In <em>Ohio Veterinary Med. Bd. v. Singh </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 23, 711 N.E.2d 740, that court determined that when an inspection is conducted as part of an investigation, contemporaneous notification suffices. The court stated, \u201cThe element of surprise is obviously an important factor in conducting investigations to determine whether a veterinarian has violated a provision in R.C. Chapter 4741.\u201d Id. at 29, 711 N.E.2d 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 22} The court of appeals in the case sub judice specifically took issue with the <em>Singh </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the inspection-notice provision of R.C. 4741.26(A):</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201cWe understand that the element of surprise is important when conducting an investigation. However, our reading of R.C. 4741.26 leads this court to conclude that [the board] must give a licensed veterinarian five days notice before inspecting a place of business, even if the inspection is in conjunction with an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 <em>24} </em>\u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe language in R.C. 4741.26 is clear and unambiguous. The statute prohibits inspections of a place of business conducted without five days prior notice. Also, R.C. 4741.26 does not provide an exception for inspections conducted as part of an investigation. Accordingly, if [the board] needs to inspect a place of business as part of an investigation, it must give the licensed veterinarian five days prior notice. Stated differently, while [the board] is not obligated to give advance notice that an investigation is underway, [the board] must give prior notice of any inspection conducted as part of that investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cObviously, notice may give an unscrupulous person an opportunity to conceal or otherwise dispose of evidence. This is, unfortunately, an issue for the General Assembly to remedy, as we are limited to interpreting R.C. 4741.26(A) as written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 27} The board focuses especially on the words \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this division\u201d to dispute the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of R.C. 4741.26(A)\u2019s notice provision. The board urges that if the portion of the statute expressly dispensing with the notice requirement for an investigation is not read as an exception to the notice requirement for an inspection, then the \u201c[e]xcept as provided\u201d language becomes an \u201cunfulfilled promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 28} The board\u2019s position on this point has some appeal, principally because if we hold, as the court of appeals did, that the express exception to the notice requirement for investigations does not apply to inspections, then there is no exception to follow up on the statement \u201c[ejxcept as provided in this division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 29} For that reason, it does seem plausible, perhaps even probable, that the General Assembly did intend the notice provision not to apply when the board conducts investigatory inspections. However, the strongest indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent is the language it uses in a statute. See <em>Storer Communications, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 193, 194, 525 N.E.2d 466; <em>State ex rel. Foster v. Evatt </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 65, 29 O.O. 4, 56 N.E.2d 265, paragraph seven of the syllabus (\u201cThe question is not what did the General Assembly intend to enact, but what is the meaning of that which it did enact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">{\u00b6 30} This case distills to two fairly simple competing positions. On the one hand, in the veterinarians\u2019 favor, R.C. 4741.26(A) firmly states that five days\u2019 written notice is required for an inspection. When coupled with the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>there is clearly a difference between an inspection and an investigation (even if the two are related, and even accepting the board\u2019s premise that an inspection is an integral part of an investigation), the statute obviously is not a model of clarity if it is supposed to remove investigatory inspections from the ambit of the notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">{\u00b6 31} On the other hand, as the board points out, a peculiar consequence that results from holding that the notice provision applies to all inspections is the \u201cunfulfilled promise\u201d of the exception that is mentioned in the second sentence of the statute. The board also suggests that another peculiar consequence is that if the exception to the notice requirement for an investigation does not apply to an investigatory inspection, then the statute permits the board to begin an investigation with no advance notice but requires the board to provide five days\u2019 written notice before conducting an inspection as part of that surprise investigation. However, we are not convinced that this result is peculiar. Because an inspection is generally more intrusive than an investigation, it is conceivable that the General Assembly may have determined that a more stringent notice requirement is appropriate for an inspection even when that inspection is connected to a surprise investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 32} Upon weighing these competing positions, we feel constrained to hold, as did the court of appeals, that R.C. 4741.26(A) simply does not except investigatory inspections from the ambit of the notice requirement. The board has only those powers explicitly delegated by statute and must operate within whatever limitations are contained within its enabling statutes. See <em>Johnson\u2019s Mkt, Inc. v. New Carlisle Dept. of Health </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 28, 36, 567 N.E.2d 1018; <em>Ohio Cent. Tel. Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 180, 182, 1 O.O.2d 464, 140 N.E.2d 782 (an administrative body may exercise only the powers and authority conferred by the General Assembly).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 33} Furthermore, as the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cWhen interpreting statutes, courts must give due deference to those interpretations by \u2018an agency that has accumulated substantial expertise and to which the General Assembly has delegated enforcement responsibility.\u2019 <em>Weiss v. Pub. Util. Comm. of Ohio, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 15, 17-18, 2000-Ohio-5 [734 N.E.2d 775]. Nevertheless, \u2018[i]f the meaning of a statute is unambiguous and definite, then it must be applied as written and no further interpretation is appropriate.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Herman v. Klopfleisch </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 581, 584 [651 N.E.2d 995].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 35} Finally, the veterinarians urge this court to consider their due-process arguments regarding the record-keeping requirements and invite this court to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment on those alternate grounds. Those arguments were found moot by the court of appeals and not addressed. We likewise decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Based on all of the foregoing, we find that the notice given for the inspection in this case was deficient. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, including the instructions on remand to the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b578-5\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Av1l\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b578-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 37} I must dissent. On the one hand, the majority finds R.C. 4741.26(A) to be clearly written but then says that there are two competing views of the statute\u2019s meaning. Such patent ambiguity calls for interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 38} When interpreting a statute, we must read the statute as a whole rather than take single sentences out of context. R.C. 4741.26(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe state veterinary medical licensing board shall enforce this chapter and for that purpose shall make investigations relative thereto. <em>Except as provided in this division, </em>in making any inspection pursuant to this chapter, the board may enter and inspect, upon written notice of nohless than five days and during normal business hours, any licensee\u2019s, permit holder\u2019s, or registrant\u2019s place of business. If the board has knowledge or notice, pursuant to a written complaint or any other written knowledge or notice by any person as verified by the signature of that person, of a violation of section 4741.18, 4741.19, or 4741.23 of the Revised Code, it shall investigate and, upon probable cause appearing, shall direct the executive secretary to file a complaint and institute the prosecution of the offender. <em>In conducting any investigation for a suspected violation of this chapter, the board </em>or its authorized agent <em>does not have to provide any prior written notice </em>to the licensee, permit holder, or registrant <em>as long as the board provides a unitten authorization for the investigation </em>and the board or its authorized agent provides the licensee, permit holder, or registrant with a copy of the authorization at the time of the investigation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">{\u00b6 40} First, the statute gives the board overall responsibility to make investigations to enforce the chapter. As a routine matter, inspections are to be done only after notice is provided, but there is an exception to the five-day notice requirement. The third sentence, although not involved in this case, explains that the board has the power to investigate upon a complaint for violations of R.C. 4741.18 (fraud in obtaining a license), R.C. 4741.19 (unlawful veterinary practice), or R.C. 4741.23 (specific prohibitions). Furthermore, the statute provides that no prior written notice is required for investigations of suspected violations of the chapter as long as, at the time of the investigation, written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>authorization is provided. Such authorization seems to be in the nature of an administrative search warrant, and thus, some inspections will be unexpected when they are part of investigations based upon a suspected violation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b579-10\">Moscarino &amp; Treu, L.L.P., William H. Falin, Edward S. Jerse, and Michael W. Matile, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AE\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Douglas R. Cole, State Solicitor, Stephen P. Carney, Senior Deputy Solicitor, Franklin E. Crawford, Deputy Solicitor, and Martine Jean, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 41} The two words \u201cinvestigation\u201d and \u201cinspection\u201d are not statutorily defined. The word \u201cinvestigate\u201d means \u201cto observe or study closely: inquire into systematically: examine, scrutinize.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1189. The word \u201cinspect\u201d means \u201cto view closely and critically * * *: examine with care: scrutinize.\u201d Id. at 1170. An investigation, being the broader term, necessarily includes the ability to inspect. It defies common sense to say that the board can \u201cinvestigate\u201d without notice but cannot \u201cinspect\u201d premises as part of that investigation unless it gives five days\u2019 notice beforehand.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 42} The majority concludes that \u201c[bjeeause an inspection is generally more intrusive than an investigation, it is conceivable that the General Assembly may have determined that a more stringent notice requirement is appropriate for an inspection even when that inspection is connected to a surprise investigation.\u201d Nothing supports such a statement \u2014 in or outside of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 43} The concern that the board may somehow overuse the power to inspect without notice is mistaken. There is a safeguard built in that requires a verified complaint or a signed writing before the board is allowed to investigate specified statutory violations. For any inspection without notice as part of an investigation, written authorization must be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 44} In short, I agree with the reasoning expressed in <em>Ohio Veterinary Med. Bd. v. Singh </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 23, 29, 711 N.E.2d 740, in which the First District Court of Appeals stated, \u201cThe element of surprise is obviously an important factor in conducting investigations to determine whether a veterinarian has violated a provision in R.C. Chapter 4741.\u201d As I cannot agree with the contrary interpretation, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
