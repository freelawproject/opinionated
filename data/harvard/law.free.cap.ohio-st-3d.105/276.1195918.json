In 1997, CWRU entered into a memorandum of agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) with the Zeta Pi Chapter of Alpha Phi Fraternity House Corporation (\u201cHouse Corporation\u201d) for use of the House by the House Corporation for a term of ten years, with a renewal option. The preamble to the Agreement contained the following clauses:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cWhereas the university currently provides exclusive use of the house * * * to [House Corporation] for purposes of housing members of its Zeta Pi Chapter [Alpha Phi sorority]* * *; and</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cWhereas the parties wish to define the terms and conditions governing [House Corporation\u2019s] ongoing use of the House to house members of the Chapter [Alpha Phi sorority].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">{\u00b6 4} The Agreement then states, \u201cDuring the Term (as hereinafter defined), the House shall be made available to [House Corporation] solely for purposes of providing housing to Chapter [Alpha Phi sorority] members (and other individuals specified herein) * * *.\u201d Alpha Phi sorority members using the House are required to be students at CWRU and are required to sign a standard student-housing contract with CWRU. Alpha Phi is to provide a minimum of 30 individuals to live in the House during the fall and spring semesters and ten during the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">{\u00b6 5} During the fall and spring semesters, occupancy of the House is limited to members of the Zeta Pi chapter of Alpha Phi. However, during the summer term, pledges and national members of Alpha Phi can also use the House. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>House Corporation is to be \u201csolely responsible for the selection of occupants and for the assignment of rooms in the House.\u201d CWRU is to provide one room in the House to the House Corporation without charge for an advisor to the Alpha Phi sorority.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 6} In addition, the House Corporation is to provide comprehensive general liability insurance, including coverage for property damage. Under the Agreement, CWRU is released from liability for damage or injury to any person or property, including the property of Alpha Phi, its members, guests, or invitees occasioned by its use of the House. The House Corporation also agrees to indemnify CWRU and hold it harmless against claims resulting from the corporation\u2019s use of the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 7} CWRU is to provide housekeeping and maintenance services, capital improvements, and replacement of furnishings for the House in accordance with CWRU\u2019s practices and policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 8} As a condition of membership in the sorority, the student is expected to sign a housing contract with CWRU to live in the House and not sign any other housing contract unless and until every available space in the House is filled and the student is released from the housing obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 9} CWRU filed its application for real-property tax exemption on the House under R.C. 5709.07, 5709.12, and 5709.121. The Tax Commissioner denied the application, finding that use of the House was not open to the general student population. Instead, use of the House was restricted to a certain sorority. As a result, use of the House primarily benefited the sorority, and, therefore, the House was not eligible for exemption under R.C. 5709.07, 5709.12, or 5709.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 10} CWRU appealed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). After a hearing, the BTA affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision, finding that CWRU was not itself using the House, but had leased it to Alpha Phi, a private not-for-profit social organization, which was not an educational institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 11} This matter is before this court as an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">{\u00b6 12} The question to be determined by this court is whether the decision of the BTA denying exemption for the House is reasonable and lawful. When considering a request for exemption, we are mindful that we are to strictly construe statutes granting exemptions, and the burden rests on the one claiming an exemption to demonstrate that the property qualifies. <em>OCLC Online Computer Library Ctr., Inc. v. Kinney </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572. The rationale for granting tax exemptions is that the recipient\u2019s operation is a present benefit to the general public that justifies the loss of tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>revenue. <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 199, 201, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 13} CWRU first contends that the House is entitled to exemption under R.C. 5709.12 and 5709.121(A) because the House belongs to an educational institution and is used by it for educational purposes. The specific provision of R.C. 5709.12 relied upon by CWRU is R.C. 5709.12(B), which provides: \u201cReal * * * property belonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes shall be exempt from taxation * * Thus, to be exempt, the real property must (1) belong to an institution and (2) be used exclusively for charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 14} There is no dispute concerning the fact that the House belongs to CWRU. However, we must determine whether the House belongs to an \u201cinstitution.\u201d To determine whether CWRU is an \u201cinstitution\u201d for the purposes of R.C. 5709.12, we turn to our decision in <em>Highland Park Owners Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 405, 407, 644 N.E.2d 284, where we quoted Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 800, for the following definition of \u201cinstitution\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018An establishment, especially one of eleemosynary or public character or one affecting a community. An established or organized society or corporation. It may be private in its character, designed for profit to those composing the organization, or public and charitable in its purposes, or educational <em>(e.g. </em>college or university).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 16} CWRU is an Ohio not-for-profit corporation formed for the purpose of operating a university exclusively for charitable, scientific, and educational purposes. Applying the definition of \u201cinstitution\u201d to the facts, we hold that the evidence supports the BTA\u2019s finding that CWRU qualifies as an educational \u201cinstitution\u201d for the purposes of R.C. 5709.12(B) and that the House belongs to an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 17} The next step in establishing entitlement to an exemption under R.C. 5709.12(B) is to determine whether the House belonging to the institution is being \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d R.C. 5709.121 sets forth a definition of the phrase \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d However, that definition is applicable only in certain circumstances. In <em>Episcopal Parish of Christ Church, Glendale v. Kinney </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 199, 200-201, 12 O.O.3d 197, 389 N.E.2d 847, the court cited with approval Justice Stern\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals, </em>38 Ohio St.2d at 203, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862, which explained the relationship between R.C. 5709.12 and R.C. 5709.121 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cInitially, it is important to observe that, although R.C. 5709.121 purports to define the words used exclusively for \u2018charitable\u2019 or \u2018public\u2019 purposes, as those words are used in R.C. 5709.12, the definition is not all-encompassing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>R.C. 5709.12 states: \u2018* * * Real and tangible personal property belonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes shall be exempt from taxation.\u2019 Thus, <em>any </em>institution, irrespective of its charitable or noncharitable character, may take advantage of a tax exemption if it is making exclusive charitable use of its property. See <em>Wehrle Foundation v. Evatt </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 467 [26 O.O. 29], 49 N.E.2d 52. The legislative definition of exclusive charitable use found in R.C. 5709.121, however, applies only to property \u2018belonging to\u2019 <em>i.e., owned by, </em>a charitable or educational institution, or the state or a political subdivision. The net effect of this is that R.C. 5709.121 has no application to noncharitable institutions seeking tax exemption under R.C. 5709.12. Hence, the first inquiry must be directed to the nature of the institution applying for an exemption.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 19} Since the House is owned by CWRU, an educational institution, the definition of \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d in R.C. 5709.121 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 20} CWRU claims exemption for the House under two different provisions, R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) and 5709.121(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cReal property * * * belonging to a[n] * * * educational institution * * * shall be considered as used exclusively for charitable * * * purposes by such institution * * * if it meets one of the following requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(A) It is used by such institution * * * or by one or more other such institutions * * *under a lease, sublease, or other contractual arrangement:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(2) For other charitable, educational, or public purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">{\u00b6 26} CWRU contends that the House is exempt under R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) because it is being used for educational purposes. In his concurring opinion in <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn., </em>Justice Stern set forth the following statement concerning R.C. 5709.121(A)(2):</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cIf a qualified institution * * * owns property, that property is exempt from taxation if (1) the institution * * * itself uses the property as specified in R.C. 5709.121(A)(1) or (A)(2); [or] (2) the institution * * * contractually allows another qualified institution * * * to use the property as specified in R.C. 5709.121(A)(1) or (A)(2) * * *.\u201d Id., 38 Ohio St.2d at 203, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) is not applicable to the facts of this case. First, CWRU is not using the House itself. The House is being used exclusively by the House Corporation to house the members of the Alpha Phi sorority under a contractual arrangement with CWRU. No claim is made that the House Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>tion with which CWRU contracted is a qualified institution, i.e., a charitable or educational institution and, indeed, it is neither. The BTA found that Alpha Phi sorority, which is using the House, \u201cis a private not-for-profit social organization, and not an educational institution.\u201d Because the House Corporation\u2019s exclusive use of the House is not an educational use, the House is not exempt under R.C. 5709.121(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 29} CWRU\u2019s second contention is that the House is exempt under R.C. 5709.121(B) because it is \u201cunder the direction or control\u201d of CWRU and is being made available \u201cfor use in furtherance of or incidental to [CWRU\u2019s] * * * educational * * * purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d In <em>Cincinnati Nature Ctr. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 122, 125, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381, the court set forth a three-pronged test to determine whether real property belonging to a charitable or educational institution falls within the terms of R.C. 5709.121(B). In order to meet the test, the property must \u201c(1) be under the direction or control of [such an] institution or state or political subdivision, (2) be otherwise made available \u2018for use in furtherance of or incidental to\u2019 the institution\u2019s \u2018charitable [educational] or public purposes,\u2019 and (3) not be made available with a view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 30} The first prong of the three-pronged <em>Cincinnati Nature </em>test requires in this case that the property be under the direction or control of an educational institution. The actual wording of the statute requires that the property be \u201cmade available\u201d under the direction or control of an educational institution. There apparently is no disagreement that the House is made available under the direction or control of CWRU, as evidenced by the Agreement between CWRU and the House Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 31} The second prong of the <em>Cincinnati Nature </em>test is that the property be made available \u201cfor use in furtherance of or incidental to\u201d the institution\u2019s educational purposes. Id., 48 Ohio St.2d at 125, 2 0.0.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381. The BTA was not persuaded that providing housing for the \u201cexclusive use of a social sorority and its members is in furtherance of CWRU\u2019s educational purpose.\u201d Unlike the other residence halls at CWRU, occupancy of the House is not open to just any student enrolled at CWRU. Instead, use of the House is limited to students who are members of a private sorority. CWRU is providing housing for the exclusive use of a private fraternal organization. We do not believe that it is a function of a college or university to furnish a dwelling to a private social organization to use at its discretion. In providing the House, CWRU benefits the House Corporation and the local chapter of the Alpha Phi sorority, thereby relieving them of the obligation to provide a dwelling to the sorority members. However, providing housing for the exclusive use of a private fraternal organization is not in furtherance of or incidental to CWRU\u2019s educational purpose. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>House is not exempt under R.C. 5709.12 and 5709.121(B). Because we have determined that the use of the House does not meet the second prong of the three-pronged <em>Cincinnati Nature </em>test, we need not consider the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 32} This court has previously considered facts similar to those in this case in <em>Denison Univ. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 429, 20 O.O.2d 63, 183 N. E.2d 773 <em>(\u201cDenison </em>/\u201d). Admittedly, <em>Denison I </em>was decided before the enactment of R.C. 5709.121 in 1969. 133 Ohio Laws, Part III, 2646. We believe, however, that the result in <em>Denison I </em>is consistent with the result that would be reached under R.C. 5709.121. In <em>Denison I, </em>Denison University sought exemption for nine fraternity houses that had been built on land owned by the university and leased to the fraternities. Eight of the fraternities leased the land for 99 years, renewable forever, with a termination clause that could be exercised by the university. The remaining fraternity house had a renewable one-year lease with the university. All but one of the houses were constructed and paid for by the fraternities.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 33} This court held in the syllabus of <em>Denison I </em>that the fraternity houses constructed and paid for by the fraternities on land owned in fee simple by a university and leased to the fraternities were not exempt because they were \u201cnot \u2018used <em>exclusively </em>for charitable purposes\u2019 ydthin the purview of Section 5702.12, Revised Code, and Section 2, Article XII of the [Ohio] Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 34} CWRU\u2019s final contention is that the House is exempt under R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) because it is a building connected with a public institution of learning and is not used with a view to profit. R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) exempts from taxation \u201c[p]ublic colleges * * * and all buildings connected with them, and all lands connected with public institutions of learning, not used with a view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>Denison Univ. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 17, 31 O. O.2d 10, 205 N.E.2d 896 <em>(\u201cDenison II\u201d), </em>we held that Denison University was a public college within the meaning of R.C. 5709.07, stating at paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe words \u2018public colleges * * * academies * * * and public institutions of learning\u2019 in Section 5709.07, Revised Code, include a private institution of learning conducted in a lawful manner without any view to profit and open to all members of the public without regard to race, creed or nationality. (Paragraph eight of the syllabus of <em>Gerke, Treas., v. Purcell, </em>25 Ohio St. 229, approved and followed.)\u201d (Ellipses sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">{\u00b6 37} Thus, just as Denison University was a public college for the purposes of R.C. 5709.07, so also is CWRU a \u201cpublic college\u201d for the purposes of R.C. 5709.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>{\u00b6 38} In <em>Denison II, </em>the university sought exemption for buildings owned by it and used for a carpentry shop, a lumber storage shed for lumber used in the carpentry shop, a Quonset hut used by university painting crews to paint college equipment and for storage of maintenance equipment, a dwelling lived in by a caretaker of the facilities and his family, and a pole shelter used to store hay for the horses used in a physical education course. In addition, the university also sought exemption for the on-campus president\u2019s house and an off-campus guest house used to provide lodging for official guests of the university. A caretaker lived in part of the guest house. The university sought exemption for its properties under both R.C. 5709.07 and 5709.12, but the court considered only R.C. 5709.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 39} After finding that Denison was a public college and a public institution of learning within the meaning of R.C. 5907.07, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cEvery other question involved in the instant case was considered and decided by this court in 1909 when it affirmed without opinion <em>([Schnebly v. Kenyon College </em>(1909),] 81 Ohio St. 514, 91 N.E. 1138) the decision of the Circuit Court of Knox County in <em>Kenyon College v. Schnebly, Treas. </em>(1909), 12 C.C. (N.S.) 1, which held that, by reason of what is now Section 5709.07, Revised Code, \u2018residences occupied by the president and professors and janitor are exempt [from taxation], as is also vacant land from which no revenue is derived * *</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cWe agree with the statements of the Circuit Court in that case that \u2018the plain language of the statute is \u201call public colleges, public academies, all buildings connected with the same, are exempt\u201d and we think it was the purpose to exempt all buildings that were with <em>reasonable certainty </em>used in furthering or carrying out the necessary objects and purposes of the college,\u2019 and that the \u2018statute is clear, that all lands connected with public institutions of learning, <em>\u201cnot used with a view to profit\u201d </em>are exempt.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 21, 31 O.O.2d 10, 205 N.E.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 42} In paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>Denison II </em>the court approved and followed <em>Kenyon College v. Schnebly </em>as authority for its holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cAll buildings connected with such a public college or academy and used with reasonable certainty in furthering or carrying out the necessary objects and purposes of such academy or college, including the president\u2019s residence, and all lands connected with such a public institution of learning and not used with a view to profit are exempted from taxation by Section 5709.07, Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 44} The BTA found that the Alpha Phi \u201csorority\u2019s right to the exclusive use of the subject property is not an educational use by CWRU under R.C. 5709.07.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>{\u00b6 45} As the court held in paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Denison II, </em>the exemption in R.C. 5709.07 is for buildings connected with the college and used with reasonable certainty in furthering and carrying out the necessary objects and purposes of the college. While providing residences for its students may further and carry out the necessary objects and purposes of a college, we do not believe that the furnishing of a college building to a private fraternal organization to exclusively house its members is a necessary object or purpose for a college or university. The House is not being used by CWRU to house its students. Instead, the House is being used by the House Corporation to house members of the Alpha Phi sorority.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 46} Although it may not be necessary to the denial of the exemption in this case, we feel we would be remiss if we did not discuss R.C. 5709.07(B), which provides: \u201cThis section shall not extend to leasehold estates or real property held under the authority of a college or university of learning in this state * *</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 47} While exemption of the fraternity houses in <em>Denison I </em>was denied under R.C. 5709.12, exemption under R.C. 5709.07 apparently was raised as an issue in the university\u2019s brief even though it was not raised in the university\u2019s notice of appeal. Id., 173 Ohio St. at 429, 20 0.0.2d 63, 183 N.E.2d 773. In commenting on the sentence that is now contained in R.C. 5709.07(B), the court in <em>Denison I </em>stated, \u201c[I]t will be noted that, according to the express provisions of the last sentence above quoted, the entire section is expressly made inapplicable \u2018to leasehold estates or real property held under the authority of a college or university of learning in this state.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 437, 20 0.0.2d 63, 183 N.E.2d 773. While there are exceptions to that clause in R.C. 5709.07(B), none of those exceptions are applicable here. Instead, R.C. 5709.07(B) precludes an exemption in this case because the House Corporation is holding real property \u201cunder the authority of a college or university of learning in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 48} Colleges and academies have been granted an extremely broad exemption by R.C. 5709.07. However, the General Assembly placed limits on that exemption by providing that it does not extend to leasehold estates or real property held under authority of a college or university.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 49} For all of the reasons set forth above, we find that the decision of the BTA was reasonable and lawful and affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b435-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6g\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 50} I believe that Magnolia House should be exempt from taxation because the House \u201cis made available under the direction\u201d of CWRU and used \u201cin furtherance of or incidental to\u201d CWRU\u2019s educational purposes under R.C. 5709.121. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 51} Pursuant to R.C. 5709.121 and 5709.121(B), property that is \u201cused exclusively for charitable or public purposes\u201d by an educational institution includes property that \u201cis made available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use <em>in furtherance of </em>or <em>incidental to </em>its * * * educational * * * purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 52} Thus, in order to be tax exempt under this provision, the property (1) must be \u201cmade available under the direction or control\u201d of a charitable or educational institution, (2) must be made available \u201cfor use in furtherance of or incidental to\u201d the institution\u2019s charitable, educational, or public purposes, and (3) must be made available without an intent to profit. <em>Cincinnati Nature Ctr. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 122, 125, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 53} The majority\u2019s holding turns primarily on its determination that the House was not used <em>exclusively </em>for CWRU\u2019s educational purposes. The majority states that \u201cCWRU is providing housing for the exclusive use of a private fraternal organization. We do not believe that it is a function of a college or university to furnish a dwelling to a private social organization to use at its discretion.\u201d In support the majority cites <em>Denison Univ. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 429, 20 O.O.2d 63, 183 N.E.2d 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 54} The majority also supports its holding by pointing out that the House is available only to members of Alpha Phi as opposed to the general student population. The majority cites <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 199, 201, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862, for the proposition that the rationale for granting tax exemptions is that the recipient\u2019s operation is a present benefit to the general public that justifies the loss of tax revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">A. Under R.C. 5709.121(B), Use Need Not Be Exclusive</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 55} In <em>Denison, </em>Denison University sought tax exemptions under R.C. 5709.12 for nine buildings that were leased to nine fraternities. The BTA determined that the buildings were \u201c \u2018operated under lease by fraternities for fraternity purposes, and but <em>one </em>of the many uses, for which the fraternities use these buildings, is that of providing lodging for <em>fraternity members only.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) Id., 173 Ohio St. at 434, 20 O.O.2d 63, 183 N.E.2d 773. The board also found that \u201c \u2018these buildings were <em>not used exclusively </em>for charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>purposes within the meaning of those words as used in the Ohio Constitution and in Revised Code Section 5709.12.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 439, 20 O.O.2d 63, 183 N.E.2d 773. This court affirmed the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">{\u00b6 56} <em>Denison </em>relied on R.C. 5709.12. However, seven years after the court decided <em>Denison, </em>the General Assembly enacted R.C. 5709.121. 133 Ohio Laws, Part III, 2646. R.C. 5709.12(B) still provides that in order to be tax exempt, property belonging to <em>any </em>institution must be used <em>exclusively </em>for charitable purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, R.C. 5709.121(B) provides that property belonging to a charitable or <em>educational </em>institution or the state or a political subdivision is \u201cused exclusively for charitable or public purposes\u201d if \u201c[i]t is made available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use <em>in furtherance of or incidental </em>to\u201d the institution\u2019s educational purpose. As Justice Herbert stated, \u201cBy the enactment of R.C. 5709.121, the General Assembly has announced its desire that certain types of tax exemptions for the institutions mentioned in that statute should not be restrictively considered.\u201d <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn., </em>38 Ohio St.2d at 205, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862 (Herbert, J., dissenting). Thus, under the broadened definition of the phrase \u201cused exclusively for charitable or public purposes\u201d in R.C. 5709.121, property belonging to a charitable or educational institution or the state or political subdivision may be exempt from taxation even if its use is not \u201cexclusively\u201d charitable. <em>Galvin v. Toledo Trust </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 157, 159-160, 63 O.O.2d 242, 296 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 57} Therefore, cases that rely on the exclusive-use test under R.C. 5709.12, such as <em>Denison, </em>are not persuasive in determining whether property is exempt from taxation under R.C. 5709.121(B). See <em>Galvin, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus. Accordingly, I believe that the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Denison </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 58} Admittedly, Alpha Phi uses the House for some activities that may not be in furtherance of or incidental to CWRU\u2019s educational purpose, such as social gatherings. However, similar social activities occur at other nonfraternal residence halls, and those activities do not disqualify those properties from being exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 59} Moreover, pursuant to the agreement through which CWRU permits Alpha Phi use of the House, all the residents must be CWRU students. The fact that these students are also members of the Alpha Phi sorority does not diminish their status as CWRU students. Thus, irrespective of other uses, the House is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>used to house CWRU students, which is a use in furtherance of CWRU\u2019s educational purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 60} Finally, I also believe that Alpha Phi uses the House in other ways that are in furtherance of or incidental to CWRU\u2019s educational purposes. Part of CWRU\u2019s educational mission is encouraging students to become involved in the community. Greek organizations provide a formal approach to promoting community service. CWRU encourages Greek organizations, including Alpha Phi, to participate in charitable activities through the Panhellenic Council and Intrafraternal Conference in a program called \u201c365 Days of Service\u201d through which each Greek organization develops a quota of hours for community service. Thus, Alpha Phi certainly uses the House for activities that promote CWRU\u2019s educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">B. Under R.C. 5709.121, the Property Need Not Be Made Available to the Public</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 61} The majority seems to suggest that because the property is being used by members of a private entity to the exclusion of the general student population, a tax exemption should not apply, because \u201c[t]he rationale for granting tax exemptions is that the recipient\u2019s operation is a present benefit to the general public that justifies the loss of tax revenue,\u201d citing <em>White Cross Hosp., </em>38 Ohio St.2d at 201, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 62} In <em>Cincinnati Nature Ctr., </em>48 Ohio St.2d 122, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381, the Cincinnati Nature Center Association (\u201cNature Center\u201d), a nonprofit entity, sought a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.121 for a parcel of property containing two houses owned by the Nature Center and used as residences by its employees. The BTA granted the exemption as to the acreage but denied the exemption as to the houses. The court of appeals reversed the BTA on the grounds that \u201c \u2018the use of the two houses by employees of the Nature Center was in furtherance of and incidental to its charitable purpose and was not with a view to \u201cprofit\u201d under R.C. 5709.121.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 123, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 63} On appeal, the BTA argued that under R.C. 5709.121, the property must be made available for use by the public. However, after examining the language of R.C. 5709.121, the court found that \u201cthe board\u2019s contentions that exempt property must be made available to another charitable institution or to the public are without merit.\u201d Id. at 125-126, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 64} Therefore, the fact that residency in the House is limited to Alpha Phi members and is not open to the general student population does not preclude a finding that the house is exempt from taxation under R.C. 5709.121.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b439-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., Joel A. Makee, Bruce L. Waterhouse Jr., and Colleen G. Trem\u00ed, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A3T\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Janyce C. Katz, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">C. The House Was Not Used with View to Profit</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 65} The majority did not address this issue because it found that the second prong of the <em>Cincinnati Nature </em>test was dispositive. However, because I believe that the House satisfies the first two prongs of the <em>Cincinnati Nature </em>test, I will address the third prong, which requires that the property must be made available without an intent to profit. <em>Cincinnati Nature Ctr., </em>48 Ohio St.2d at 125, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 66} The record indicates that the House is not used with an intent to make a profit. The students who live at the House pay CWRU for the housing pursuant to a standard student housing contract. CWRU merely seeks to generate a revenue stream that covers the cost of operating the House. Any surplus revenue would be reinvested in the facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 67} Accordingly, I would hold that Alpha Phi\u2019s use of the House is in furtherance of or incidental to CWRU\u2019s educational purposes and not with a view to profit under R.C. 5709.121(B). Therefore, the House should be exempt from taxation pursuant to R.C. 5709.12. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\">. As the majority notes, R.C. 5709.12 applies to use of property belonging to <em>my </em>institution, including noncharitable institutions, but R.C. 5709.121 is limited to use of property belonging to a <em>charitable </em>or <em>educational </em>institution or the state or a political subdivision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
