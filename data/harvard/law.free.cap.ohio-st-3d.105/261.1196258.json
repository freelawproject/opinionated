After examining the scope and purpose of the attorney-client privilege, we conclude that the privilege applies to government clients and that notwithstanding various statutes cited in opposition, the privilege exists between a state agency and its in-house counsel even if that counsel is not an Assistant Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">{\u00b6 2} From August 2000 through February 2002, the Ohio Department of Development employed appellee and cross-appellant, attorney Mark A. Leslie, as its Chief of Compliance. In that capacity, Leslie\u2019s duties included conducting certain ministerial functions for appellant and cross-appellee Ohio Housing Finance Agency in compliance with state law. Effective March 1, 2002, the Department of Development terminated Leslie\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">{\u00b6 3} In October 2002, Leslie filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County naming appellants and cross-appellees Ohio Housing Finance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Agency, Chief Legal Counsel for the Department of Development, and the board members and other officials of the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as respondents. Leslie also named the State Treasurer, State Auditor, and two Ohio Department of Commerce officials as respondents. Leslie alleged that appellants and other respondents had violated certain laws. For example, Leslie claimed that the Ohio Housing Finance Agency had disbursed unclaimed funds in the form of loans that were not authorized by R.C. Chapter 175. Leslie requested a writ of mandamus to compel appellants and other respondents to cease the alleged illegal activities and to comply with the applicable law. Leslie further requested that the State Auditor perform audits to ensure compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 4} On December 10, 2002, appellants and other respondents moved to dismiss Leslie\u2019s complaint. The State Auditor attached a 2001 audit to his dismissal motion. The court of appeals treated the auditor\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment and set times for Leslie to respond to the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 5} On December 30, 2002, Leslie replied to the dismissal motions. His reply contained two lengthy endnotes describing various documents and explaining his discharge. On January 14, 2003, Leslie replied to the auditor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. He attached various documents, including several that disclosed legal advice from in-house counsel to Ohio Housing Finance Agency staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 6} On January 15, 2003, the court of appeals magistrate recommended granting the motions of appellants and other respondents and dismissing Leslie\u2019s mandamus claim. On January 16, 2003, the magistrate denied the auditor\u2019s summary-judgment motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 7} On January 27, 2003, appellants, Ohio Housing Finance Agency, its staff, its board, and the Chief Legal Counsel of the Department of Development, moved to strike the endnotes from Leslie\u2019s December 30, 2002 reply to appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss, seal those portions protected by attorney-client privilege, and obtain a protective order to prohibit Leslie\u2019s disclosure of privileged records.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 8} On February 11, 2003, appellants filed a second motion to strike and seal and for a protective order. This motion related to Leslie\u2019s affidavit and attachments to his January 14, 2003 reply to the auditor\u2019s summary-judgment motion. Appellants claimed that the affidavit and certain attachments were protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">{\u00b6 9} On February 20, 2003, Leslie replied to the motions to strike and seal and for protective orders. Leslie again attached documents to his reply. Appellants moved to strike Leslie\u2019s February 20, 2003 reply as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 10} On June 17, 2003, the court of appeals adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to dismiss Leslie\u2019s mandamus claim but stayed the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>until the magistrate ruled upon the pending motions. On August 28, 2003, the magistrate recommended that the court of appeals (1) grant appellants\u2019 motion to strike the endnotes in Leslie\u2019s December 30, 2002 reply, (2) deny appellants\u2019 motion to seal and for a protective order on Leslie\u2019s December 30, 2002 reply, (3) deny appellant\u2019s motion to strike and seal and motion for a protective order on Leslie\u2019s January 14, 2003 reply, (4) grant appellants\u2019 motion to strike the attachments to Leslie\u2019s February 20, 2003 reply, and (5) deny appellants\u2019 motion to strike Leslie\u2019s February 20, 2003 response as untimely. The magistrate applied the court of appeals\u2019 precedent in <em>State ex rel. Olander v. French </em>(July 16, 1996), Franklin App. No. 96APD04-501, 1996 WL 403802, which held that the attorney-client privilege does not exist between a state agency and its in-house counsel unless the attorney is a member of the Attorney General\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">{\u00b6 11} Appellants objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On December 9, 2003, the court of appeals overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, two of the three court of appeals\u2019 judges \u201creluctantly\u201d concurred \u201cbecause <em>Olander </em>has not been overruled and remains the law in this district.\u201d These judges believed that <em>Olander </em>\u201cwas wrongly decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 12} On January 16, 2004, appellants filed their notice of appeal, and on January 20, 2004, Leslie cross-appealed. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal and cross-appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 13} On July 14, 2004, we granted the parties\u2019 requests for oral argument. <em>State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1528, 2004-Ohio-3580, 811 N.E.2d 1148. On January 11, 2005, we heard oral argument on this appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>Appeal: Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 14} Appellants assert that the court of appeals erred in applying <em>State ex rel. Olander v. French </em>(July 16, 1996), Franklin App. No. 96APD04-501, 1996 WL 403802, in which the court of appeals held that the \u201cattorney-client privilege does not exist between members of a given state agency or department except the Office of the Attorney General.\u201d Appellants claim that eight of the attachments to Leslie\u2019s January 14, 2003 reply to the auditor\u2019s motion for summary judgment and one of Leslie\u2019s attachments to his February 20, 2003 reply to appellants\u2019 motions to strike and seal and for protective orders should have been stricken from the record and sealed based on attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 15} Leslie counters that the attorney-client privilege does not apply to in-house counsel of state agencies and that the court of appeals properly applied its <em>Olander </em>precedent to exempt the challenged records from the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>{\u00b6 16} For the following reasons, we find that rejecting Leslie\u2019s contentions and the court of appeals\u2019 <em>Olander </em>decision is consistent with the weight of precedent and markedly advances the purpose of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\n<em>Attorney-Client Privilege: Purpose and Elements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe privilege of a witness, person, state or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by statute enacted by the General Assembly or by principles of common law as interpreted by the courts of this state in the light of reason and experience.\u201d Evid.R. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 18} In Ohio, the attorney-client privilege is governed by statute, R.C. 2317.02(A), and in cases that are not addressed in R.C. 2317.02(A), by common law. See, e.g., R.C. 2317.02(A), which provides that in general, an attorney shall not testify \u201cconcerning a communication made to the attorney by a client in that relation or the attorney\u2019s advice to a client\u201d; see, also, <em>State v. McDermott </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 570, 574, 651 N.E.2d 985, distinguishing <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 513 N.E.2d 754 (\u201cThe <em>Post </em>court, therefore, recognized a judicially created attorney-client privilege where, without the presence of the attorney, the communications between the client and * * * the attorney\u2019s agent[ ] were deemed privileged. The court then properly decided how that <em>common-law attorney-client privilege </em>could be waived. The circumstances of waiver recognized in that case have no relationship to communications that fall squarely within the <em>statutory privilege </em>based on direct communications between attorneys and clients\u201d). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications.\u201d <em>Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 399, 403, 118 S.Ct. 2081, 141 L.Ed.2d 379. The privilege dates at least to \u201cthe reign of Elizabeth I, where the privilege was already well established.\u201d <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 660, 635 N.E.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIts purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice. The privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves the public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer\u2019s being fully informed by the client.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584; <em>Cargotec, Inc. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>155 Ohio App.3d 653, 2003-Ohio-7257, 802 N.E.2d 732, \u00b6 7. \u201c[B]y protecting client communications designed to obtain legal advice or assistance, the client will be more candid and will disclose all relevant information to his attorney, even potentially damaging and embarrassing facts.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 1 Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the United States (2d Ed.1999) 14-15, Section 2.3; <em>Taylor v. Sheldon </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>118, 121, 15 O.O.2d 206, 173 N.E.2d 892 (\u201cthe purpose of this rule is to permit complete freedom of disclosure by a client to his attorney without fear that any facts so disclosed will be used against him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 21} Under the attorney-client privilege, \u201c(1) [w]here legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by-himself or by the legal adviser, (8) unless the protection is waived.\u201d <em>Reed v. Baxter </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 134 F.3d 351, 355-356; <em>Perfection Corp. v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>153 Ohio App.3d 28, 2003-Ohio-2750, 790 N.E.2d 817, \u00b6 12. Except under circumstances not relevant here, only the client can waive the privilege. See <em>Allen Cty. Bar Assn. v. Williams, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 160, 2002-Ohio-2006, 766 N.E.2d 973, \u00b6 9-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>Attorney-Client Privilege: Extension to Government Clients</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 22} Courts have held that the attorney-client privilege applies to pertinent communications between attorneys and their corporate clients. See, e.g., <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. 383, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (communications made by corporate employees acting at direction of corporate superiors in order to secure legal advice for corporation from corporate counsel are protected by attorney-client privilege); <em>Am. Motors Corp. v. Huffstutler </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 343, 575 N.E.2d 116 (former attorney-employee of corporation enjoined from disclosing matters covered by attorney-client privilege); 1 Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the United States, at 53, Section 3:14 (\u201cThe confidential communications between in-house counsel and th[e] client are privileged to the same extent as communications between outside retained counsel and the clients who have consulted them for legal advice or assistance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 23} In the related context of attorney-employees of government entities, \u201c[tjhere is surprisingly little case law on whether a government agency may also be a client for purposes of this privilege * * *.\u201d <em>In re Witness Before Special Grand Jury 2000-2 </em>(C.A.7, 2002), 288 F.3d 289, 291. Nevertheless, the weight of existing authority applies the attorney-client privilege to confidential communications between government agencies and their attorney-employees. 1 Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the United States, at 124, Section 4:28 (\u201cWhen government agencies consult with legal counsel for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance (regardless of whether it be in-house agency counsel, attorneys from the Department of Justice, or outside counsel) the attorney-client privilege protects its communications to those attorneys\u201d); 1 Strong, McCormick on Evidence (5th Ed.1999) 355, Section 88 (\u201cmore recently the privilege has been held to extend to communications to an attorney representing the state\u201d); Restatement of the Law 3d, Law Governing Lawyers (2000), Section 74 (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>attorney-client privilege extends to a communication of a governmental organization * * * and of an individual employee or other agent of a governmental organization as a client\u201d); <em>Green v. Internal Revenue Serv. </em>(N.D.Ind.1982), 556 F.Supp. 79, 85, affirmed (C.A.7, 1984), 734 F.2d 18 (privilege \u201calso unquestionably is applicable to the relationship between Government attorneys and administrative personnel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 24} In Ohio, courts have consistently recognized that \u201c[rjecords of communications between attorneys and their state-government clients pertaining to the attorneys\u2019 legal advice are excepted from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(1) since the release of these records is prohibited by state law\u201d \u2014 i.e., they are protected by this state\u2019s attorney-client privilege. <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 245, 249, 643 N.E.2d 126; <em>State ex rel. Besser v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 535, 542, 721 N.E.2d 1044; <em>State ex rel. Nix v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 379, 383, 700 N.E.2d 12; <em>Woodman v. Lakewood </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 118, 541 N.E.2d 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 25} Leslie challenges this precedent by contending that R.C. 2317.02(A), the statutory attorney-client privilege, does not apply to government clients. Leslie further claims that the privilege should be limited to trial-preparation materials and that the authority extending the privilege to government entities subverts R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act, and R.C. 124.341, Ohio\u2019s whistleblowerprotection statute for state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 26} Leslie\u2019s claims lack merit. Even assuming that R.C. 2317.02(A) does not extend attorney-client privilege to government entities (see R.C. 2317.021, defining \u201cclient\u201d), the common-law attorney-client privilege recognized in Ohio would apply. See <em>McDermott, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 574, 651 N.E.2d 985; <em>Post, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 380, 513 N.E.2d 754 (recognizing a judicially created attorney-client privilege); <em>Ex Parte Martin </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 87, 101, 25 O.O. 225, 47 N.E.2d 388 (same). R.C. 2317.02(A), by its very terms, is a mere testimonial privilege precluding an attorney from testifying about confidential communications. The common-law attorney-client privilege, however, \u201creaches far beyond a proscription against testimonial speech. The privilege protects against any dissemination of information obtained in .the confidential relationship.\u201d <em>Am. Motors, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 348, 575 N.E.2d 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 27} Admittedly, the government attorney-client privilege has been subject to some criticism. See, e.g., Melanie B. Leslie, Government Officials as Attorneys and Clients: Why Privilege the Privileged? (2002), 77 Ind.L.J. 469,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>502(d)(7) of the Revised Uniform Rules of Evidence (1999). Nevertheless, the prevailing rule remains that \u201cgovernmental agencies and employees enjoy the same privilege as [their] nongovernmental counterparts.\u201d Restatement of the Law 3d, Law Governing Lawyers (2000), Section 74, Comment <em>b. </em>Significantly, Ohio has not adopted Rule 502(d)(7) of the Revised Uniform Rules of Evidence (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 28} Moreover, \u201ccourts generally have construed open-meeting, open-files, whistle-blower, and similar statutes as subject to the attorney-client privilege, recognizing that otherwise governments would be at unfair disadvantage in litigation, in handling claims and in negotiations.\u201d Id. at Comment <em>b; </em>see, e.g., <em>Orlando v. Desjardins </em>(Fla.1986), 493 So.2d 1027, 1029. Ohio courts are no exception. See, e.g., <em>TBC Westlake, Inc. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 58, 62-63, 689 N.E.2d 32 (\u201ccommon-law privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, are state laws that prohibit release of public records\u201d under Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act); <em>Shaffer v. OhioHealth Corp., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-102, 2004-Ohio-63, 2004 WL 35725 (in action for unlawful termination under Ohio whistleblower statute, attorney-client privilege applied to communications between corporate counsel and corporate president who was later fired).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 29} We also do not share Leslie\u2019s fears that governmental entities will blatantly attempt to avoid public-record laws by using the attorney-client privilege as a shield against disclosure. Simply stated, an attorney does not become any less of an attorney by virtue of state agency employment. That is so even if the attorney\u2019s position includes performance of nonlegal or so-called ministerial duties. The privilege applies when legal advice of any kind is sought from the legal advisor in that capacity and the client\u2019s confidential communication relates to that purpose. In other words, Leslie\u2019s example of a corporation sending copies of memos to attorney-employees so as to hide them from the public misunderstands the limitations built into the privilege itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 30} Therefore, in Ohio, the attorney-client privilege extends to government agencies consulting with in-house counsel for legal advice or assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\n<em>Attorney-Client Privilege: State Agencies: Olander and R.C. 109.02</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 31} The court of appeals held that based on its decision in <em>Olander, </em>\u201cthe attorney-client privilege does <em>not </em>exist between a state agency and its in-house attorney <em>unless </em>the attorney is a member of the [Attorney General\u2019s] office.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Leslie argues that R.C. 109.02 limits the attorney-client relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ship in the state government context to the relationship between the state and attorneys representing it who are from the Attorney General\u2019s office. Thus, he claims, the attorney-client privilege does not extend to attorneys who are not employed by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 109.02 provides that with certain specified exceptions inapplicable here, the Attorney General is the chief law officer for the state and its departments, and no state board or officer shall be represented by other attorneys:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe attorney general is the chief law officer for the state and all its departments * * *. * * * [N]o <em>state officer or board, or head of a department or institution of the state shall employ, or be represented by, other counsel or attorneys at law. </em>The attorney general shall appear for the state in the trial and argument of all civil and criminal causes in the supreme court in which the state is directly or indirectly interested. When required by the governor or the general assembly, the attorney general shall appear for the state in any court or tribunal in a cause in which the state is a party, or in which the state is directly interested.* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 109.02 does not limit the attorney-client privilege in the state government context to communications with attorneys employed by the Attorney General\u2019s office, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 35} First, the Supreme Court of Ohio has exclusive original jurisdiction over the \u201c[ajdmission to the practice of law, the discipline of persons so admitted, and all other matters relating to the practice of law.\u201d Section 2(B)(1)(g), Article TV, Ohio Constitution; <em>Royal Indemn. Co. v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 31, 27 OBR 447, 501 N.E.2d 617. Thus, the \u201cexclusive authority to regulate the practice of law is vested in the Ohio Supreme Court.\u201d <em>In re Karasek </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 615, 631, 695 N.E.2d 1209; see, also, <em>Melling v. Stralka </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 105, 107, 12 OBR 149, 465 N.E.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 36} Second, R.C. 109.02 is directed toward the legal <em>representation </em>of state agencies and officers in <em>courts or tribunals </em>instead of legal <em>advice </em>given by in-house counsel to state agencies and officers on day-to-day matters. The sentence at issue in R.C. 109.02 provides that \u201cno state officer or board, or head of a department or institution of the state shall employ, or be <em>represented </em>by, other counsel or attorneys at law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The next three sentences in R.C. 109.02 address instances in which the Attorney General appears in <em>courts or tribunals: </em>\u201cThe attorney general shall appear for the state in the <em>trial and argument of all civil and criminal causes in the supreme court </em>in which the state is directly or indirectly interested. When required by the governor or the general assembly, the attorney general shall appear for the state in <em>any court or tribunal </em>in a cause in which the state is a party, or in which the state is directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>interested. Upon the written request of the governor, the attorney general shall <em>prosecute any person </em>indicted for a crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 37} Third, R.C. 109.02 does not specify any sanctions for the employment by state agencies of attorneys not employed by the Attorney General. More particularly, R.C. 109.02 does not purport to preclude a state agency\u2019s attorneys from giving legal advice. Nor does R:C. 109.02 specify that legal advice given by in-house counsel to state agencies and officials is not covered by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 38} Fourth, R.C. 121.14 permits state departments to \u201cemploy, subject to the civil service laws in force at the time the employment is made, the necessary employees.\u201d One of the state departments created by the General Assembly is Leslie\u2019s former employer, the Ohio Department of Development. R.C. 121.01(A) and 121.02(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 39} Fifth, precedent supports appellants\u2019 position that R.C. 109.02 does not preclude attorneys employed by state agencies like the Department of Development from engaging in the practice of law. In <em>State ex rel. Devine v. Schwarzwalder </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 447, 451-454, 60 O.O. 95, 136 N.E.2d 47, we held that notwithstanding R.C. 109.02, a respondent who served as attorney-examiner and Chief of the Permit Division of the Department of Liquor Control was actively engaged in the practice of law so as to be entitled to have these employment periods added to the five-year period specified in R.C. 1901.06 so as to qualify him for the office of municipal court judge. We emphasized that much more recent statutes, see, e.g., R.C. 121.02 and 121.14, permitted state agencies like the Department of Liquor Control to employ necessary employees, including attorneys, despite R.C. 109.02. Id. at 451-452, 60 O.O. 95, 136 N.E.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 40} Leslie erroneously relies on the views of dissenting opinions never adopted by the court, see <em>Devine, </em>165 Ohio St. at 454-455, 60 O.O. 95, 136 N.E.2d 47 (Taft, J., dissenting), and case law that has been overruled. See <em>State ex rel. Flynn v. Cuyahoga Bd. of Elections </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 193, 57 O.O. 402, 129 N.E.2d 623, overruled by <em>State ex rel. Schenck v. Shattuck </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 272, 1 OBR 382, 439 N.E.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 41} Sixth, at most, R.C. 109.02 recognizes the Attorney General as the primary counsel for state agencies and officials focusing on in-court representation. Nothing in R.C. 109.02 prohibits the Attorney General from assenting to certain representation for state agencies and officials by other counsel. This assent is reflected in a September 1999 memorandum of understanding between the Attorney General and the Governor. In that memorandum, the Attorney General and Governor \u201crecognized that [state agencies and officials] need[] attorney employees to provide legal advice to properly address the complex issues which confront [them] on a daily basis\u201d and that legal communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>between state agencies and officials and their in-house counsel \u201care subject to attorney-client privilege.\u201d In fact, even the Attorney General can waive the right to invoke R.C. 109.02. See <em>DeRolph v. State </em>(2001), 94 Ohio St.3d 40, 42, 760 N.E.2d 351 (\u201cThe time has now passed for the Attorney General to object, and we find that the state has waived its right to challenge the separate appearance of the officials * * * or their representation by separate counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 42} Finally, Leslie\u2019s construction of R.C. 109.02 might lead to the absurd result that his own employment as an attorney with the Department of Development was prohibited. See <em>State ex rel. Webb v. Bliss, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 166, 2003Ohio-3049, 789 N.E.2d 1102, \u00b6 22 (court has duty to construe statutes to avoid unreasonable or absurd results).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>Conclusion: Appeal on Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 43} In sum, the communications by attorney-employees of the state departments in question were subject to the attorney-client privilege and should have been sealed. This furthers the laudatory objectives of the privilege: complete and candid communication between attorneys and clients. It also clarifies that the privilege extends to confidential communications between attorneys and their state-agency clients, notwithstanding R.C. 109.02. It further enhances the efficiency of state agencies. By so holding, we reject <em>dander, </em>the solitary case that held otherwise, which even the panel of the same court of appeals in this case believed was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 44} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it failed to seal and grant protective orders concerning Attachments 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 15, and 16 to Leslie\u2019s January 14, 2003 reply, and Attachment I to Leslie\u2019s February 20, 2003 reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 45} In his cross-appeal, Leslie contends that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 46} We affirm the dismissal of Leslie\u2019s claim for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 47} First, Leslie did not have the requisite standing. He has shown neither a personal stake in the outcome of his lawsuit nor a special interest in the funds involved. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 469, 715 N.E.2d 1062; <em>Cleveland ex rel. O\u2019Malley v. White, </em>148 Ohio App.3d 564, 2002-Ohio-3633, 774 N.E.2d 337, \u00b6 34. This is also not a \u201crare and extraordinary case\u201d warranting invocation of the public-right exception to the personal-stake requirement of standing. <em>Ohio Academy, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 503-504, 715 N.E.2d 1062; <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 504, 2002-Ohio-6717, 780 N.E.2d 981, \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b423-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Mark A. Leslie, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AE_\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Douglas R. Cole, State Solicitor, Stephen P. Carney, Senior Deputy Solicitor, and Sharon A. Jennings, Assistant Attorney General, for appellants and cross-appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b423-3\">{\u00b648} Second, as the court of appeals determined, the writ of mandamus requested by Leslie is so broad that it would be extremely difficult to implement. \u201cIt has been long and well established that <em>it is the duty of every judicial tribunal </em>to decide actual controversies between parties legitimately affected by specific facts and <em>to render judgments which can be carried into </em>effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Fortner v. Thomas </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 51 O.O.2d 35, 257 N.E.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">{\u00b6 49} Third, Leslie\u2019s requested relief consists of little more than future compliance with various statutes. \u201c[A] writ of mandamus will not issue to compel the general observance of laws in the future.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kirk v. Burcham </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 407, 409, 696 N.E.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 50} Fourth, Leslie\u2019s writ is an ill-disguised request for (1) a declaratory judgment that appellants are not complying with various legal requirements and (2) a prohibitory injunction preventing appellants from continuing these alleged illegal practices in the future. Neither this court nor courts of appeals have jurisdiction over these claims. <em>State ex rel. Maloney v. Sherlock, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 77, 2003-Ohio-5058, 796 N.E.2d 897, \u00b6 53; <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 72, 2003-Ohio-5062, 796 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 51} Therefore, we reverse the portion of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that relies on <em>Olander </em>and holds that the attorney-client privilege is inapplicable. We affirm the remainder of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">. This law journal article concludes, \u201cThe reflexive assumption that a government attorney-client privilege is necessary to ensure that government actors communicate openly with government is a fiction. At most, government entities should be able to claim a limited litigation privilege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>enables them to shield communications made in furtherance of trial preparation. This approach would be consistent with early case law. In addition, it would make government entities more accountable to the citizens they serve, at no cost to the government\u2019s ability to function effectively.\u201d Id. at 649-550.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
