Affiant asked the judge in April 2004 to lift the March 2003 order banning him from filing new cases in the court, but the judge has not done so. Also, since the filing of the no-new-cases order in March 2003, the judge has found affiant in contempt for failing to appear at a hearing in the one case in which he has continued to participate in the judge\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">{\u00b6 4} Affiant states in his affidavit that he would now like to file a new case in the Family Court in Marion County, but the judge\u2019s order prevents him from doing so. Affiant asks in his affidavit filed here that Judge Alspach be disqualified from any case in which he is the counsel of record, and he also asks that the judge\u2019s order barring him from filing new cases in the Family Court be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">{\u00b6 5} Judge Alspach has responded to the affidavit, and she has stated in her response that she is not biased or prejudiced against affiant. Rather, according to the judge, her actions have been motivated by her interest in resolving the cases in her court in a timely way.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>{\u00b6 6} I conclude that the request for disqualification should be denied. To be sure, both Judge Alspach and affiant appear to be quite frustrated by the situation, and certainly a ban without end on affiant\u2019s ability to file cases in a single court of this state is untenable. The situation is one of affiant\u2019s own making, though, as is the resolution of it. It appears that the judge is willing to permit affiant to return to her courtroom if he offers appropriate assurances that he will meet filing deadlines, avoid delaying tactics, and appear at scheduled court hearings. The judge\u2019s demand that attorneys honor time commitments in her court is not unreasonable, and as long as she provides affiant with an opportunity to convince her that he can and will do so, I have no reason to conclude that the judge will not manage affiant\u2019s cases fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">{\u00b6 7} Sup.R. 41(C) does not contain any time limit on the restrictions that trial judges may impose on attorneys who repeatedly seek continuances. Still, though the right to practice law is not a fundamental right, see <em>Russell v. Hug </em>(C.A.9, 2002), 275 F.3d 812, 819, fn. 5, Judge Alspach should permit affiant to file matters in the Family Court of Marion County when he complies with scheduling orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 8} I conclude that Judge Alspach has not displayed bias or prejudice as those terms are understood in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
