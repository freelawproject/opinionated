The contestors, 37 Ohio residents who allegedly had voted in the presidential election, filed an election-contest petition pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3515. The named contestees were President George W. Bush, Vice-President Richard Cheney, Bush-Cheney adviser Karl Rove, Bush-Cheney \u201904, Inc. (alleged by the contestors to be the political committee for Bush and Cheney), Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, and Ohio\u2019s presidential electors.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On January 6, Congress met in joint session pursuant to Section 15, Title 3, U.S.Code and certified George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney the winners of the November 2, 2004 national presidential and vice-presidential election. Five days later, on January 11, 2005, contestors applied to dismiss their election contest. That application was granted, and the case was dismissed. <em>Moss v. Bush, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 1449, 2005-Ohio-71, 820 N.E.2d 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">{\u00b6 3} Before me is a motion filed January 18, 2005, by Secretary of State Blackwell and Ohio\u2019s 20 presidential electors seeking the imposition of sanctions against the attorneys who represented the contestors. The movants assert that counsel for the contestors filed a meritless complaint without having adequately researched the law relative to their grievances and failed to adhere to the procedures and time requirements set forth in the election-contest statutes and the Rules of Civil Procedure. They claim that the complaint was based on \u201ctheory, conjecture, hypothesis, and invective\u201d rather than evidence and that the contestors filed this contest proceeding \u201conly for partisan political purposes.\u201d The movants note that the petition accused Ohio election officials of blatant misconduct, including fraud, and assert that contestors had no evidence of fraud, let alone the clear and convincing evidence that a finding of fraud requires. They accuse opposing counsel of filing meritless and frivolous motions and demanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>unwarranted discovery. They assert that the contestors acted for the purpose of \u201cgenerating headlines and harassing the rightful winners of the election\u201d rather than for legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 4} I have little doubt that many informed Ohioans share the movants\u2019 assessment of the motives of these contestors and disdain for their actions. The contestors indeed made multiple allegations in the complaint that are, at best, highly improbable and potentially defamatory, inflammatory, and devoid of logic. They asserted no less than a vast criminal conspiratorial scheme to subvert our democracy through massive election fraud. Examples of these allegations are:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u2022 George W. Bush, Richard Cheney, Karl Rove, and Bush-Cheney \u201904, Inc., participated personally and/or substantially \u201cin devising and/or implementing [a] pattern of vote fraud and discrimination * * * which operated to deprive numerous Ohio citizens of their constitutional and statutory rights\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u2022 Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell participated personally and substantially \u201cin ordering and/or acquiescing in the commission of numerous instances of election fraud in violation of Ohio criminal law after November 2, 2004, which actions served to cover-up and delay disclosure of the fraudulent scheme\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u2022 Election fraud or other irregularity must have occurred in the counting of the vote in Ohio and a number of other states because the ultimately certified result showing John Kerry winning only 48.7 percent of the Ohio vote was inconsistent with exit polls;</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u2022 Preliminary exit polls forecasting a Kerry victory were more reliable than the certified election results, and there was a 98.7 percent likelihood that Kerry actually received a greater percentage of the popular vote than Bush;</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u2022 The contestees schemed to \u201csteal the election\u201d by reducing or eliminating the time the \u201cfraudulent results would be subjected to serious scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u2022 \u201c[Traditional means of vote fraud were used. * * * [Ujnlawful ballots (not cast by a registered voter but merely added to the stack of ballots being counted) were added to those cast by lawful voters and * * * lawfully cast ballots were either destroyed or altered (as for example by adding a second vote to the one allowed vote for President and thereby invalidating the ballot).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u2022 Secretary of State Blackwell ordered all 88 boards of election to prevent public inspection of poll books until after certification of the vote on December 6, 2004, apparently to \u201ccause[ ] violations [of state law] by every board of elections in the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u2022 An unknown conspirator \u201cwas actually changing the vote totals\u201d electronically from an unknown location, which could have been virtually anywhere in the world;</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u2022 Conspirators procured fraudulent vote totals by inserting \u201cunauthorized and so far undetected operating instructions into the software\u201d used in connection with voting machines, and \u201csome or all of the unauthorized operating instructions were pre-set to delete themselves a given amount of time after the election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 14} Contestors further alleged fraud in the casting and counting of absentee ballots and alleged individual election incidents occurring throughout the state, including isolated voting-machine, registration, and provisional-ballot errors and irregularities, as well as long lines and discriminatory distribution of voting machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 15} Had the contestors not dismissed the election contest, several or all of these allegations of fraudulent conduct may well have been subject to dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 9(B), which requires that in \u201call averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\u201d The voluntary dismissal of the election contest, however, renders that issue moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 16} Hundreds of persons \u2014 including members of both the Democratic and Republican Parties \u2014 served on boards of elections, at polling places, and in other capacities to conduct the presidential election in Ohio on November 2, 2004. While that election was not perfect, the contestors\u2019 allegations, and the notoriety they produced, proclaimed to the world that Ohio did not conduct a fair and lawful presidential election. By their conduct, contestors, their attorneys, and other persons who appeared to be more interested in their own notoriety than in the facts profoundly disserved Ohioans of both political parties who worked so hard to conduct a fair election. Despite the apparently scurrilous nature of most of these allegations, I am, however, guided by the relevant statutes and precedent in considering the motion before me.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 3515.11 provides that \u201c[t]he proceedings at the trial of the contest of an election shall be similar to those in judicial proceedings, in so far as practicable, and shall be under the control and direction of the court which shall hear and determine the matter without a jury, with power to order or permit amendments to the petition or proceedings as to form or substance.\u201d Accordingly, this court has employed the Rules of Civil Procedure in adjudicating election contests. For example, the court has recognized that a party to an election contest could invoke Civ.R. 26(B)(3), which authorizes, under certain conditions, discovery of an opponent\u2019s work product. <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Atty. Gen. of Ohio </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 614, 567 N.E.2d 243. Similarly, in a separate opinion, the court entertained a motion filed under Civ.R. 41(B)(2), which authorizes dismissal of a case after the presentation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>plaintiffs case-in-chief. <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Atty. Gen. of Ohio </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 604, 567 N.E.2d 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 18} Later, a contestee who had been successful in an election contest filed a motion for costs, seeking reimbursement for various expenses, including attorney-fees incurred in defending his election. <em>In re Election of November 6, 1990 for the Office of Atty. Gen. of Ohio </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 1, 577 N.E.2d 343. As authority for the request, the contestee cited R.C. 3515.09,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Civ.R. 54(D),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and R. C. 2323.51.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 19} This court held that Civ.R. 54(D) and R.C. 2323.51 are not applicable to election contests, noting that we had long held that the \u201cprocedures prescribed for election contests are specific and exclusive.\u201d Id., 62 Ohio St.3d at 1, 577 N.E.2d 343. We acknowledged that R.C. 3515.11 provides that \u201c[t]he proceedings at the trial of the contest of an election shall be similar to those in judicial proceedings, in so far as practicable.\u201d Id. at 2, 577 N.E.2d 343. We recognized, however, that \u201c[ajlthough this provision incorporates into election contest proceedings some rules and statutes governing civil actions, such incorporation is limited to those rules and statutes that would pertain \u2018at the trial of the contest.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 20} In the case at bar, the movants rely upon Civ.R. II<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to support their request for an award of costs and sanctions, asserting that the contestors engaged in misconduct in connection with the filing and initial prosecution of the election contest prior to dismissing it. However, that dismissal occurred before a trial had even been scheduled. I conclude that Civ.R. 11 and</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">S. Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5) cannot be deemed to pertain to the trial of the contest, as contemplated by R.C. 3515.11, in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 21} The power to sanction attorneys who file baseless actions is the power to punish and deter. The United States Supreme Court has observed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>purpose of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, which is analogous to Civ.R. 11, is to curb abuse of the judicial system because \u201c[bjaseless filing puts the machinery of justice in motion, burdening courts and individuals alike with needless expense and delay.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp. </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 384, 398, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359. The court noted that the specter of Rule 11 sanctions encourages civil litigants to \u201c \u2018stop, think and investigate more carefully before serving and filing papers.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Amendments to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1983), 97 F.R.D. 165, 192 (March 9, 1982 letter from Judge Walter Mansfield, Chairman, Advisory Committee on Civil Rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 22} An election contest, however, is not a typical lawsuit. Because R.C. 3515.09 provides a very short time after an election within which an election contest petition may be filed, a prospective contestor has limited time to investigate all the facts surrounding an election, particularly where, as here, the challenge is to a statewide election. Yet the election contest statutes exist to ensure that the will of the electorate is correctly recorded. Whether the filing of election contests should be discouraged is a matter of public policy not for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 23} The General Assembly could have expressly authorized courts to sanction those who pursue frivolous election contests. It has not. It has provided for election contests and has authorized courts to use standard procedures to resolve those contests by trial. See R.C. 3515.11. The General Assembly, in authorizing the use of standard procedures to resolve election contests, did not specifically invest courts with the authority to, in effect, reopen the merits of dismissed election contest claims. Such authority would be required to justify an award of sanctions based on the filing of an election contest claimed to have been filed without evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 24} Because there will be no trial in the case at bar, Civ.R. 11 and S.CtPrac.R. XIV(5)(A) are not rules that would pertain \u201cat the trial of the contest.\u201d R.C. 3515.11. Under these circumstances, the election-contest statutes found in R.C. Chapter 3515 do not contemplate an award of sanctions to punish the filing of a frivolous election contest. I conclude that I am not authorized by R.C. 3515.11 to invoke Civ.R. 11 or S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5) to impose sanctions where attorneys filed an election contest but dismissed it shortly thereafter and before trial is scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 25} Even were I to consider the substantive merit of the motion before me, without the production of more evidence than is now before the court, I could not conclude that the standards imposed upon attorneys by these rules were violated in this case. Because contestors have voluntarily dismissed the contest and no trial will occur, that evidence will not be forthcoming.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b615-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Arthur J.

I take judicial notice that election-reform initiatives are currently under discussion at both the state and federal levels. See, e.g., 2005 Sub.H.B. No. 3; H.R. 1835, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2005); H.R. 2104, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2005); S. 450,109th Cong. 1st Sess. (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">{\u00b6 27} I conclude that an award of sanctions in this case is not authorized by the statutes governing election contests. I therefore overrule contestees\u2019 motion for costs and sanctions.
