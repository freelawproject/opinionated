All of them allege that their wages and salaries are not \u201cincome\u201d for tax purposes, and they contend that the state Tax Commissioner has no authority to collect taxes and penalties from them. For the reasons explained below, we reject those arguments and affirm the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals in all three cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">The Buckley Case</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant Donna L. Buckley received two Form W-2 wage-and-tax statements from her employer for the year 2000 showing that she had received wages, tips, or other compensation totaling $78,413.39 that year. On her Form 1040 U.S. individual income tax return for the year 2000, however, Buckley indicated that she had received no wages, salaries, or tips. She likewise listed no income on her Form IT-1040 Ohio individual income tax return for the year 2000 and sought a refund of the taxes withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">{\u00b6 3} The Tax Commissioner sent a letter to Buckley in August 2001, explaining that she owed not only state income taxes for the year 2000 but also interest on the taxes not paid, a late-payment penalty under R.C. 5747.15(A)(2), and a $500 frivolous-filing penalty under R.C. 5747.15(A)(5). Buckley challenged that conclusion through an R.C. 5747.13(B) petition for reassessment. The Tax Commissioner then agreed to forgo the late-payment penalty, but he determined that Buckley still owed taxes, interest, and the $500 frivolous-filing penalty. Buckley appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s order. Buckley has now appealed as of right to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The Gibbs Case</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant Rachel Gibbs likewise received a Form W-2 wage-and-tax statement from her employer for the year 1997, showing that she had received wages, tips, or other compensation totaling $33,094.85 that year. On her Form 1040 U.S. individual income tax return for the year 1997, however, Gibbs and her husband, Robert, indicated that they had received no wages, salaries, or tips. They also listed no income on their Form IT-1040 Ohio individual income tax return for the year 1997 and sought a refund of all Ohio taxes withheld. A refund check was issued to the Gibbses.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 5} The Tax Commissioner sent a letter to Robert and Rachel Gibbs in February 2000 explaining that they owed the refunded taxes and interest charges, and though the Gibbses challenged that finding, the Tax Commissioner adhered to his conclusion in a decision issued in January 2003. Robert and Rachel Gibbs appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s,order. The Gibbses have now appealed as of right to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The Jewett Case</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant Jerry A. Jewett, an Ohio attorney, did not file Ohio income tax returns for tax years 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994. The Tax Commissioner obtained information from the United States Internal Revenue Service indicating that Jewett had earned taxable income during those years, and the Tax Commissioner sent a notice to Jewett in 2002 indicating that he owed Ohio income taxes for 1991 through 1994, as well as interest and penalties. Jewett filed a petition for reassessment with the Tax Commissioner, arguing that he owed no taxes, but the Tax Commissioner affirmed the initial assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties. Jewett appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which in turn affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s order. Jewett has now appealed as of right to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The Appellants\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">{\u00b6 7} The appellants\u2019 refusal to pay state income taxes is grounded in their view that wages are not \u201cincome\u201d for tax purposes. We reject that view, as have many other courts. See, e.g., <em>Connor v. Commr. of Internal Revenue </em>(C.A.2, 1985), 770 F.2d 17, 20 (\u201cWages are income. * * * The argument that they are not has been rejected so frequently that the very raising of it justifies the imposition of sanctions\u201d); <em>United States v. Connor </em>(C.A.3, 1990), 898 F.2d 942, 943 (\u201cEvery court which has ever considered the issue has unequivocally rejected the argument that wages are not income\u201d); <em>Stubbs v. Commr. of Internal Revenue Serv. </em>(C.A.11, 1986), 797 F.2d 936, 938 (arguments suggesting that \u201cwages are not taxable income * * * have been rejected by courts at all levels of the judiciary and are patently frivolous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>{\u00b6 8} To be sure, Ohio law does not expressly state that wages are income, but it has effectively done so, albeit in a roundabout \u2014 and perfectly valid \u2014 way. Ohio has imposed \u2014 in R.C. 5747.02(A) \u2014 a tax on the \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d of individuals and has defined \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d in R.C. 5747.01(A) as \u201cfederal adjusted gross income, as defined and used in the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as provided in this section.\u201d In other words, the adjusted gross income of Ohio residents and those who earn or receive income in Ohio is taxed, and in calculating each taxpayer\u2019s \u201cadjusted gross income,\u201d Ohio looks to the definition that Congress has given to that term in the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 9} Congress has defined \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d for individuals as \u201cgross income minus * * * [various] deductions.\u201d Section 62(a), Title 26, U.S.Code. \u201cGross income\u201d is in turn defined as \u201call income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) the following items:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(1) Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items;</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(2) Gross income derived from business.\u201d Section 61(a), Title 26, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 12} In short, compensation paid to workers for their goods and services is income, and that income from wages and salaries is taxable by Ohio, just as it is by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 13} The appellants argue that the Ohio Constitution does not allow the General Assembly to pass bills that refer to or incorporate language or definitions found in the Internal Revenue Code or elsewhere. They are wrong. See, e.g., <em>State v. Posey </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 420, 424, 534 N.E.2d 61 (\u201cIt is certainly within the province of the General Assembly to incorporate .federal statutory provisions into state legislation\u201d); <em>State v. Waller </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 409, 414, 28 O.O. 351, 55 N.E.2d 654, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fritz v. Gongwer </em>(1926), 114 Ohio St. 642, 649, 151 N.E. 752 (\u201c \u2018The effectiveness of legislation by reference has been so generally recognized in Ohio that no very specific declaration appears in the reported cases\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 14} Section 15(A), Article II of the Ohio Constitution states, \u201cThe general assembly shall enact no law except by bill.\u201d Though the appellants suggest otherwise, nothing in that language bars the General Assembly from referring in bills to language or definitions found in other state or federal statutes. The provision simply requires that any proposed legislation originate in the form of a bill. It says not a word about the text of the bills themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">{\u00b6 15} The statutory provisions that the appellants question \u2014 R.C. 5747.01(A) and 5747.02(A) \u2014 have been duly enacted and amended various times over many years, most recently in 2003. See 2003 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 95. Previous versions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of the statutes were in effect when the appellants first challenged the state\u2019s power to collect an income tax from them, and those measures were likewise duly-enacted as Section 15(A), Article II of the Constitution directs. We reject the appellants\u2019 claim that Ohio\u2019s statutory definition of \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d violates Section 15(A), Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">{\u00b6 16} The appellants next contend that the first paragraph of R.C. 5747.01\u2014 the statutory provision in which \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d and other terms used in Ohio\u2019s income tax statutes are defined \u2014 is so vague that the statute must be stricken under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. The language in question reads: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided or clearly appearing from the context, any term used in this chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the Internal Revenue Code, and all other statutes of the United States relating to federal income taxes.\u201d R.C. 5747.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe due process clause of the Constitution provides the foundation for the void for vagueness doctrine.\u201d <em>Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. v. Tatum </em>(C.A.6, 1995), 58 F.3d 1101, 1104. Laws must \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly,\u201d and laws must also \u201cprovide explicit standards\u201d for the police officers, judges, and jurors who enforce and apply them. <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 18} In weighing the appellants\u2019 constitutional challenge to R.C. 5747.01, we must of course adhere to the oft-stated rule that a court\u2019s power to invalidate a statute \u201cis a power to be exercised only with great caution and in the clearest of cases.\u201d <em>Yajnik v. Akron Dept. of Health, Hous. Div., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 106, 2004-Ohio-357, 802 N.E.2d 632, \u00b6 16. Laws are entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption of constitutionality,\u201d and any party challenging the constitutionality of a law \u201cbears the burden of proving that the law is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 19} The void-for-vagueness doctrine \u201cdoes not require statutes to be drafted with scientific precision.\u201d <em>Perez v. Cleveland </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 376, 378, 678 N.E.2d 537. Rather, \u201cit permits a statute\u2019s certainty to be ascertained by application of commonly accepted tools of judicial construction, with courts indulging every reasonable interpretation in favor of finding the statute constitutional.\u201d Id., 78 Ohio St.3d at 378-379, 678 N.E.2d 537. The bar is not a high one, and a \u201ccivil statute that is not concerned with the First Amendment is only unconstitutionally vague if it is \u2018 \u201cso vague and indefinite as really to be no rule [or standard] at all\u201d or if it is \u201csubstantially incomprehensible.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Chavez v. Hous. Auth. of El Paso </em>(C.A.5, 1992), 973 F.2d 1245, 1249, quoting <em>United States v. Clinical Leasing Servs., Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1991), 925 F.2d 120, 122, fn. 2, quoting <em>A.B. Small Co. v. Am. Sugar Refining Co. </em>(1925), 267 U.S. 233, 239, 45 S.Ct. 295, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>69 L.Ed. 589, and <em>Exxon Corp. v. Busbee </em>(C.A.5, 1981), 644 F.2d 1030, 1033. The fact that \u201c \u2018the fertile \u201clegal imagination can conjure up hypothetical cases in which the meaning\u201d \u2019 of disputed terms could be questioned does not render the provision unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>Hutchins v. Dist. of Columbia </em>(C.A.D.C. 1999), 188 F.3d 531, 546, quoting <em>Terry v. Reno </em>(C.A.D.C.1996), 101 F.3d 1412, 1412, quoting <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222, fn. 15, quoting <em>Am. Communications Assn. v. Douds </em>(1950), 339 U.S. 382, 412, 70 S.Ct. 674, 94 L.Ed. 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 20} The language that the appellants challenge is not unconstitutionally vague. It links the meaning of various terms in R.C. Chapter 5747 \u2014 which addresses Ohio\u2019s income tax \u2014 to the definitions that Congress has given those same terms in Title 26, U.S.Code. That linkage actually works to eliminate confusion for taxpayers and tax collectors alike by providing both groups with uniform terms that apply to both state and federal tax laws. The Ohio statutory provision certainly is not \u201csubstantially incomprehensible,\u201d <em>Chavez, </em>973 F.2d at 1249, and it does not \u201ctrap the innocent\u201d or enable \u201carbitrary and discriminatory enforcement\u201d of Ohio\u2019s income tax statutes. See <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. We reject the appellants\u2019 void-for-vagueness challenge to the first paragraph of R.C. 5747.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 21} We also find, notwithstanding the appellants\u2019 contrary arguments, that the Tax Commissioner has the statutory authority to question income tax returns on which taxpayers have listed no income. When a taxpayer \u201cfails to file\u201d an income tax return, \u201cfiles an incorrect return, [or] fails to remit the full amount of the taxes due for the period covered by the return, * * * the tax commissioner may make an assessment against any person liable for any deficiency.\u201d R.C. 5747.13(A). In doing so, the Tax Commissioner may rely \u201cupon any information in the commissioner\u2019s possession.\u201d Id. The commissioner so relied in each of these cases. He compared the Ohio tax returns filed by appellants Buckley and Gibbs with the information provided to his office by those appellants\u2019 employers and by the Internal Revenue Service, and he gathered information about appellant Jewett\u2019s income from the Internal Revenue Service. The commissioner then calculated the amount of income taxes owed by each of the appellants, together with relevant interest and penalty amounts. He certainly acted within his statutory powers when he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 22} The appellants also question the authority of the employee in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s office who sent letters to the appellants advising them that they owed taxes, interest, and penalties. Here again, the Tax Commissioner acted properly, for R.C. 5747.18(C) empowers the commissioner to \u201c[a]ppoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the duties imposed upon the commissioner by this chapter.\u201d The Revised Code does not compel the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Commissioner to review and sign every official letter sent on his behalf by the employees in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">{\u00b6 23} And though the appellants argue that the Tax Commissioner improperly delegated the \u201cinvestigation powers\u201d that are mentioned in R.C. 5743.45 (which allows the Tax Commissioner to delegate those powers to employees of the Department of Taxation who have been certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission), we see no evidence to support that claim in the record. Indeed, as the Board of Tax Appeals said in the <em>Gibbs </em>appeal below, there is nothing in the record indicating that any investigation occurred at all involving these appellants. In any event, whether the Tax Commissioner or his employees did or did not conduct any such investigations, R.C. 5743.45 certainly empowered them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 24} Finally, appellant Buckley challenges the Tax Commissioner\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a $500 frivolous-filing penalty under R.C. 5747.15(A)(5). That provision indicates that \u201ca penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed\u201d when a \u201ctaxpayer, qualifying entity, or employer\u201d files a tax return that \u201cdoes not contain information upon which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect\u201d and when \u201cthe filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire * * * to delay or impede\u201d the proper collection of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 25} Buckley bears the burden of showing that the Tax Commissioner abused his discretion when he imposed the frivolous-filing fee. See <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 22, 23, 565 N.E.2d 568 (explaining that the commissioner\u2019s action must have been \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary and unconscionable\u201d for an appellant to prevail on an abuse-of-discretion claim). Buckley contends that the wages she earned in the year 2000 were not income. That argument is frivolous, and the Tax Commissioner certainly did not abuse his discretion when he imposed the maximum frivolous-filing penalty under R.C. 5747.15(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 26} For the reasons explained above, the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals in all three of these cases are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Decisions affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b507-11\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Jerry A.
