Bortoli requested a writ of procedendo to compel appellee, Judge Patrick Dinkelacker of the Hamilton County Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Common Pleas, to rule on Bortoli\u2019s November 21, 2003 motion to vacate his guilty plea. Judge Dinkelacker moved to dismiss Bortoli\u2019s complaint because he had already entered an order denying the motion on December 18, 2003.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b286-9\">Barry Bortoli, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-9\">Michael K. Allen, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and James Michael Keeling, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 2} On August 26, 2004, the court of appeals granted the judge\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 3} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. A writ of procedendo will not issue to compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Howard v.

And insofar as Bortoli claims that he did not receive sufficient notice of Judge Dinkelacker\u2019s entry denying Bortoli\u2019s motion to vacate his guilty plea, he has or had adequate remedies by delayed appeal and motion for relief from judgment to raise this claim. <em>State ex rel.
