This cause is pending before this court as a discretionary appeal and claimed appeal of right.

Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"AHAt\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, sua sponte, that appellant\u2019s reply and objection to appellee\u2019s waiver of memorandum in response be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
