In March 2002, Adams\u2019s appeal from his conviction and sentence was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In June 2004, Adams filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County for a writ of mandamus to compel the state of Ohio to vacate his sentence and resentence him in accordance with <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473. Appellee, Judge R. Scott Krichbaum, of the common pleas court, moved to dismiss the petition. On July 30, 2004, the court of appeals granted Judge Krichbaum\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">{\u00b6 3} The cause is now before this court upon Adams\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
