(\u201cTime Warner\u201d), applied to respondent, Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Time Warner to provide local and interexchange voice services in Ohio using Voice over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d). VoIP \u201callows customers to place and receive voice transmissions routed over the Internet.\u201d <em>Vonage Holdings Corp. v. Minnesota Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(D.Minn.2003), 290 F.Supp.2d 993, 995. \u201cTraditional telephone companies use circuit-switched technology. * * * A person using a traditional telephone, or plain old telephone service (\u2018POTS\u2019), is connected to the public switched telephone network (\u2018PSTN\u2019), which is operated by local telephone companies. Voice communication using the Internet has been called Internet Protocol (\u2018IP\u2019) telephony, and rather than using circuit switching, it utilizes \u2018packet switching,\u2019 a process of breaking down data into packets of digital bits and transmitting them over the Internet.\u201d Id. at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2003, various entities, including relator, Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company (\u201cCincinnati Bell\u201d), moved to intervene in Time Warner\u2019s case, which was designated as commission case No. 03-2229-TP-ACE. Cincinnati Bell opposed Time Warner\u2019s application on the basis that Time Warner should be subject to the same regulatory requirements as local exchange telephone companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 3} On December 17, 2003, the commission deferred the resolution of Time Warner\u2019s application until the commission decides case No. 03-950-TP-COI, <em>In re Comm. Investigation into Voice Services Using Internet Protocol, </em>which is the commission\u2019s generic investigation into its jurisdiction over VoIP providers, the resolution of which, it said, may be affected by litigation and federal regulation. The commission further authorized Time Warner to provide the VoIP services specified in its application pending resolution of case No. 03-950-TP-COI.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 4} On January 16, 2004, Cincinnati Bell applied for a rehearing of the commission\u2019s December 17, 2003 order. Cincinnati Bell raised several grounds in alleging that the commission had acted unreasonably and unlawfully by \u201cauthorizing [Time Warner] to provide telephone service in Ohio without a certificate of public convenience and necessity,\u201d by \u201cproviding [Time Warner] with unjustified regulatory advantages,\u201d and by \u201cnot requiring [Time Warner] to comply with equal access rules which, by statute, are not waivable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 5} On February 11, 2004, the commission, by entry, denied Cincinnati Bell\u2019s and the other entities\u2019 applications for rehearing. The commission noted that despite the language in its December 17, 2003 entry authorizing Time Warner to provide VoIP services, it had not granted Time Warner\u2019s certification application or any operating authority:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIn our December 17, 2003 Entry, we merely meant to convey that, pending the resolution of the jurisdictional issue, [Time Warner] should retain, not unlike each of these other entities [using VoIP], its ability to operate in the manner of its own choosing, and that [Time Warner\u2019s] ability to do so should not be impacted by the fact that it has, unlike most of these other entities, filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>certification application in which it publicly notified the Commission of the manner in which it intends to operate and of its intent to substantially comply with our rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 7} On March 12, 2004, Cincinnati Bell filed another application for rehearing in the Time Warner case, this time seeking rehearing of the commission\u2019s February 11, 2004 entry denying Cincinnati Bell\u2019s first application for rehearing. Cincinnati Bell claimed that the commission erred because it \u201cfails to recognize that [Time Warner] would be a telephone company under Ohio law,\u201d \u201cimplies that [Time Warner] may operate as a telephone company without a certificate of public convenience and necessity,\u201d and \u201cimplies that [Time Warner] may operate out of compliance with the Commission\u2019s rules without waivers.\u201d Cincinnati Bell specified that it was challenging the commission\u2019s February 11, 2004 order on rehearing rather than the commission\u2019s December 17, 2003 order. Cincinnati Bell\u2019s second application for rehearing was denied by operation of law because the commission took no action on it within 30 days of its filing. See R.C. 4903.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 8} On June 9, 2004, Cincinnati Bell filed a notice of appeal in this court from the commission\u2019s February 11, 2004 entry on rehearing and the denial by operation of law of Cincinnati Bell\u2019s March 12, 2004 application for rehearing. On that same day, Cincinnati Bell filed a copy of its notice of appeal with the commission\u2019s docketing division, which docketed it in the Time Warner case. Although the docketing division required only one copy of a notice of appeal, Cincinnati Bell\u2019s counsel left several extra copies of the notice of appeal with the docketing division in order to provide the required service. A clerk with the docketing division informed Cincinnati Bell\u2019s attorney that a copy would be distributed to the office of the commission\u2019s counsel \u2014 the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 9} Cincinnati Bell\u2019s notice of appeal included an attached certificate of service certifying service of the notice on the parties\u2019 counsel in the Time Warner case by U.S. mail, but it did not certify that service had been perfected on the chairman of the commission, any commissioner, or the Attorney General. The appeal is captioned as <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>case No. 2004-0925. The commission did not transmit a transcript of the proceeding in the Time Warner case (case No. 03-2229-TP-ACE) within 30 days of service of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 10} On July 12, 2004, which was 33 days after service of its notice of appeal, Cincinnati Bell filed a complaint in this court. Cincinnati Bell requested a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to transmit to the clerk of this court a complete transcript of the proceeding in case No. 03-2229-TP-ACE for inclusion in the record in its appeal. On August 5, 2004, the commission moved to dismiss Cincinnati Bell\u2019s mandamus action. On that same date, Time Warner, as an amicus curiae, filed a memorandum in support of the commission\u2019s dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>motion. On August 16, 2004, Cincinnati Bell filed a memorandum in opposition to the commission\u2019s dismissal motion, attaching an affidavit of its counsel, Douglas E. Hart, to its memorandum. The commission moved to strike the attached affidavit and related portions of the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 11} On September 29, 2004, we granted the commission\u2019s motion to strike, denied the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss, and granted an alternative writ. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 1459, 2004-Ohio-5056, 815 N.E.2d 676. Cincinnati Bell subsequently filed its evidence, which included an affidavit of Hart that was similar to the one previously stricken and an affidavit of one of its vice presidents stating that on October 6, he personally served a copy of the June 9 notice of appeal on the commission chairman. The commission filed no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 12} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Mandamus: R.C. 4903.21 and S.Ct.Prac.R. V(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 13} In order to be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, Cincinnati Bell must establish a clear legal right to the transmission of the commission transcript, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the commission to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4903.21 imposes a duty upon the commission to transmit to the clerk of this court a transcript of the commission proceedings upon service or waiver of service of the notice of appeal in accordance with R.C. 4903.13:</p>\n<p id=\"Ake\">{\u00b6 15} <em>\u201cUpon service or waiver of the notice of appeal as provided in section 4903.13 of the Revised Code, </em>the public utilities commission shall forthwith transmit to the clerk of the supreme court a transcript of the journal entries, the original papers or transcripts thereof, and a certified transcript of all evidence adduced upon the hearing before the commission in the proceeding complained of, which documents shall be filed in said court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">{\u00b6 16} If the commission does not transmit the transcript within 30 days of service of the notice of appeal, the appellant may request a writ of mandamus within three days after the 30th day. S.Ct.Prac.R. V(4) (\u201cThe word \u2018forthwith\u2019 as used in section 4903.21 of the Revised Code, providing that upon service or waiver of service of the notice of appeal the Public Utilities Commission shall forthwith transmit to the Clerk of the Supreme Court a complete transcript of the proceeding, shall mean a period of 30 days. If at the expiration of 30 days the transcript has not been filed, the appellant shall have an additional three days in which to file a complaint in the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel the Commission to file the transcript\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Cincinnati Bell requests a writ of mandamus in accordance with S.Ct.Prac.R. V(4) and R.C. 4903.21. The commission asserts that the writ should be denied because Cincinnati Bell did not comply with R.C. 4903.13, the appeal was from interlocutory orders, and the appeal was not timely. For the reasons that follow, we reject the commission\u2019s contentions and grant the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Propriety of Hart Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 18} Before the court considers the commission\u2019s primary arguments, we must first address the commission\u2019s contention that the affidavit of Cincinnati Bell\u2019s counsel, Douglas E. Hart, filed as part of its evidence, should not be considered because it is similar to the affidavit previously stricken by the court and it contains inadmissible legal conclusions and hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 19} The commission\u2019s argument lacks merit. Our previous decision striking Hart\u2019s affidavit was based on the determination that under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) and Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we are confined to the material factual allegations of the complaint. See, e.g., <em>Taiman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 13; <em>Butler v. Jordan </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 354, 356, 750 N.E.2d 554, fn. 4. Because Hart\u2019s initial affidavit was not attached to the complaint, we could not consider it in our S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination and thus struck it. See <em>State ex rel. Moore v. Malone, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1458, 2002-Ohio-3840, 772 N.E.2d 641 (striking affidavits attached to motion to dismiss for S.CtPrac.R. X(5) determination in mandamus action); <em>State ex rel. Keller v. Cox </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 707 N.E.2d 931 (court of appeals erred in failing to strike attached affidavit and unsworn factual allegations in memorandum in support of dismissal of mandamus action). But our decision did not preclude Cincinnati Bell from introducing a similar affidavit as part of its evidence after the court granted an alternative writ. Our decision on the merits after the submission of evidence and briefs is more expansive than our limited determination under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 20} Further, Hart\u2019s affidavit contains admissible evidence. Under S.Ct. Prac.R. X(7), affidavits submitted in original actions in this court \u201cshall be made on personal knowledge, setting forth facts admissible in evidence, and showing affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to all matters stated in the affidavit.\u201d See, also, <em>State ex rel. Nix v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 379, 384, 700 N.E.2d 12. Hart\u2019s affidavit specifies that it is made on his \u201cown personal knowledge\u201d and that he is \u201ccompetent to testify to the * * * events described [because they] are actions that [he] took personally or actions that [he] witnessed personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b621} Notwithstanding the commission\u2019s claims, Hart\u2019s affidavit statements that \u201cto provide service per R.C. 4903.13,\u201d he \u201cleft several extra copies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Notice of Appeal with the clerk in the Commission\u2019s Docketing Division at the Commission\u2019s offices in Columbus\u201d and that the \u201cdocketing clerk told [him] they would distribute a copy to the Attorney General\u2019s office\u201d set forth facts admissible in evidence. Hart could properly testify about his own actions \u2014 leaving several copies of the notice of appeal with a commission employee \u2014 as well as his subjective intent for those actions \u2014 to provide service in accordance with R.C. 4903.13. Manifestly, the legal issue of whether Hart\u2019s actions actually effected service pursuant to R.C. 4903.13 is not resolved by this statement, but evidence indicating his intent in performing certain acts is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 22} And the commission employee\u2019s response that a copy would be distributed to the commission\u2019s attorney was not hearsay. Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(d) (a statement offered against a party is not hearsay if it is \u201ca statement by his agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of his agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship\u201d). For example, in <em>Davis v. Sun Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 42, 54, 671 N.E.2d 1049, the court of appeals held that statements in which a witness \u201cplainly identified the [unnamed] declarant as an employee of [a company]\u201d and \u201cfurther identified the office and department in which the representative was employed\u201d did not constitute hearsay. See, generally, 2 Giannelli <em>&amp; </em>Snyder, Evidence (2d Ed.2001) 42, Section 801.26 (\u201cIf the agency relationship is established, the statement is admissible even if the agent remains unidentified\u201d). Hart\u2019s affidavit identified the unnamed person as an employee of the docketing division of the commission, and the employee\u2019s statement that the extra copies left with the division would be delivered to the commission\u2019s attorney concern matters within the scope of employment. See <em>Davis, </em>109 Ohio App.3d at 53, 671 N.E.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, we consider Hart\u2019s affidavit as evidence in evaluating Cincinnati Bell\u2019s mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">R.C. 4903.13</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 24} The commission initially asserts that its duty under R.C. 4903.21 to transmit the transcript in the Time Warner case did not arise, because Cincinnati Bell did not comply with R.C. 4903.13 in serving its notice of appeal. R.C. 4903.13 specifies that the notice of appeal shall be served, unless waived, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe notice of appeal shall be served, unless waived, upon the chairman of the commission, or, in the event of his absence, upon any public utilities commissioner, or by leaving a copy at the office of the commission in Columbus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 26} The commission claims that because Cincinnati Bell did not serve the notice of appeal on either the chairman of the commission or a commissioner, Cincinnati Bell did not comply with R.C. 4903.13. The commission construes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>R.C. 4903.13 so that the clause concerning the contingency of the absence of the commission chairman modifies both of the remaining service options: serving any commissioner or leaving a copy at the commission\u2019s Columbus office.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 27} The commission\u2019s contention lacks merit. R.C. 4903.13 specifies the following independent options for proper service, unless waived, of the notice of appeal: (1) service upon the commission chairman, (2) in the chairman\u2019s absence, service upon any commissioner, or (3) service by leaving a copy of the notice of appeal at the commission office in Columbus. The commission\u2019s contrary construction of R.C. 4903.13 would in effect delete the comma separating the final two options. See, generally, Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2d Ed.1995) 714 (a comma is used to separate items in a list of more than two and to mark the ending of a parenthetical phrase, but is not needed when the subject of the second independent clause is the same as in the first). Therefore, the commission\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4903.13 is not in accordance with the court\u2019s duty to \u201cread words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Karnes, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 559, 2004-Ohio-5718, 817 N.E.2d 76, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 28} Cincinnati Bell complied with the last of the statutory service options by leaving copies of its notice of appeal with the commission\u2019s docketing division in Columbus for delivery to the Attorney General. Cf. <em>Consol. Rail Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 252, 254, 533 N.E.2d 317 (appellant complied with R.C. 4903.13 by serving notice of appeal on the Attorney General at the commission\u2019s offices). There is also no evidence that the commission lacked notice of the filing of Cincinnati Bell\u2019s appeal, which supports Cincinnati Bell\u2019s argument that the docketing division did in fact properly serve the commission\u2019s attorney with a copy of the notice of appeal. The commission introduced no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, Cincinnati Bell complied with the R.C. 4903.13 service requirement. Based on this conclusion, the court need not consider Cincinnati Bell\u2019s alternative arguments that it also served the commission in compliance with R.C. 4903.13 by simply filing the notice of appeal with the commission\u2019s docketing division or by subsequently serving the commission chairman with a copy of its June 9, 2004 notice of appeal on October 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Commission\u2019s Arguments Concerning Jurisdiction of Court in Cincinnati Bell\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 30} The commission next asserts that it has no duty to transmit a transcript of the proceedings because the court lacks jurisdiction over Cincinnati Bell\u2019s appeal in case No. 2004-0925. The commission argues that the commission orders appealed by Cincinnati Bell do not constitute final appealable orders and that Cincinnati Bell\u2019s appeal was not timely. The commission\u2019s recent practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>refusing to transmit a transcript of proceedings on appeal when it believes that the appeal is either not from a final appealable order or is untimely has evidently spawned other recently filed mandamus actions seeking to compel the commission to file transcripts in appeals to this court from commission orders. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>case No. 2004-1855, filed Nov. 3, 2004, and <em>State ex rel. Maumee v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>case No. 2004-1864, filed Nov. 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">{\u00b6 31} As noted previously in analyzing R.C. 4903.13, we read words and phrases in context and construe them according to the rules of grammar and common usage. <em>Maschari v. Tone, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 411, 2004-Ohio-5342, 816 N.E.2d 579, \u00b6 12. Under R.C. 4903.21, upon service or waiver of service of the notice of appeal pursuant to R.C. 4903.13, the commission \u201cshall forthwith transmit\u201d the transcript to the clerk of this court. \u201c \u2018[T]he word \u201cshall\u201d shall be construed as mandatory unless there appears a clear and unequivocal legislative intent that [it] receive a construction other than [its] ordinary usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 522, 2003-Ohio-4358, 794 N.E.2d 56, \u00b6 4, quoting <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834, paragraph one of the syllabus. There is no clear and unequivocal legislative intent that R.C. 4903.21 receive anything but a mandatory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 32} After applying these rules of construction, it is manifest that R.C. 4903.21 conditions the commission\u2019s duty to transmit a transcript of the proceeding only upon \u201cservice or waiver [of service] of the notice of appeal as provided in\u201d R.C. 4903.13. By statute the commission must transmit the transcript in an appeal despite a lack of jurisdiction \u2014 perceived or real \u2014 by this court over the appeal. Adopting the commission\u2019s argument would add the appealability of a commission order as a condition to its duty under R.C. 4903.21. But we cannot add this condition to the statute. See <em>State v. Hughes </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E.2d 540 (\u201cIn construing a statute, we may not add or delete words\u201d). And issues concerning the appealability of the commission\u2019s orders are better addressed in the appeal itself than in a collateral proceeding like mandamus. See, e.g., <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-5466, 816 N.E.2d 238 (dismissal of appeal from commission orders that were not final appealable orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, we need not address the commission\u2019s remaining claims. Based on the foregoing, Cincinnati Bell has established a clear legal right to the transmission of the complete transcript of the Time Warner case to the clerk of this court in case No. 2004-0925, a clear legal duty on the part of the commission to transmit the transcript, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b337-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Frost Brown Todd, L.L.C., and Douglas E.

V(4). Leaving a copy of the notice of appeal with the commission complied with R.C. 4903.13. Furthermore, R.C. 4903.21 does not condition the commission\u2019s duty to transmit a transcript of the commission proceeding on whether this court has jurisdiction over the appeal. That issue is better addressed in the appeal itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b337-7\">Resnick, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
