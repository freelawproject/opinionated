Four years later, the Cold Case Unit of the Columbus Police Homicide Department obtained evidence implicating Shannon Boyd and defendant-appellant, Jonathon Monroe, in the double homicide. Monroe was found guilty of murdering Simmons and Quincy and was sentenced to death. This is Monroe\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">{\u00b6 2} In 1996, Shannon Boyd had known Monroe for a few years and had sold drugs with him. According to Boyd, on April 16, 1996, Monroe phoned Boyd and asked him if he wanted \u201cto take a ride.\u201d Monroe picked Boyd up and told him he had to meet someone on the east side of Columbus. They then drove to the Classic Lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">{\u00b6 3} Boyd later testified that inside the lounge, Monroe began talking to Deccarla Quincy and Travinna Simmons, whom Boyd described as flirtatious. The women invited Boyd and Monroe to smoke marijuana with them, and they all agreed to meet at Quincy\u2019s apartment nearby. Federal authorities were watching Quincy\u2019s apartment because the women were reputed to be dealers in large quantities of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">{\u00b6 4} According to Boyd, he and Monroe got into Monroe\u2019s car, and Monroe told Boyd that he planned to smoke marijuana with the women and have them call their friends. He told Boyd that while Boyd stayed with the women, he would ride around with the women\u2019s friends, rob them, and then come back to get Boyd and act as if nothing had happened. But Boyd refused to go along with the plan, and when Monroe tried to give him a gun, Boyd refused that, too. Monroe shoved the gun under his driver\u2019s seat and told Boyd: \u201cQuit being a pussy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">{\u00b6 5} Monroe and Boyd exited the car and followed the women into Quincy\u2019s third-floor apartment. Boyd noticed that the cigars in Quincy\u2019s apartment were not the type he preferred for making marijuana cigars, so he went back to Monroe\u2019s car to retrieve his own cigars. When Boyd reentered Quincy\u2019s apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ment, Simmons and Quincy were sitting on a couch, and Monroe was standing in front of them holding a gun. The gun was different from the one Monroe had showed Boyd earlier. Boyd told Monroe that he did not want to go along with what Monroe was doing. Monroe pointed the gun at Boyd and asked him, \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d When Boyd replied no, Monroe told him to shut the door and do what he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">{\u00b6 6} Boyd stated that Monroe gave him a pair of yellow latex dishwashing gloves to put on. Monroe then told Boyd to tape the women\u2019s hands and ankles with clear packing tape that was on a table in the apartment. While Boyd taped the ankles and wrists of the woman he referred to as the \u201cbig girl\u201d (Simmons), one of the glove\u2019s fingertips came off after getting stuck on the tape. When Boyd began taping the ankles of the \u201csmaller girl\u201d (Quincy), Monroe told Boyd he was doing it wrong and told him to get a knife from the kitchen. Monroe taped Quincy\u2019s ankles and then began asking the women where the drugs and money were. The women repeatedly denied having any. Monroe took the knife Boyd had brought from the kitchen and began poking the women with it, asking them where the drugs were. When the women denied having any drugs, Monroe stabbed them. Monroe then told Boyd to separate the women. Boyd grabbed Simmons and dragged her into a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 7} According to Boyd, Monroe put Simmons in a headlock while demanding drugs and money and stabbed her in the chest when she said that she and Quincy did not have any. Monroe put Simmons on a bed, then picked up Quincy from the couch and carried her into another bedroom. Boyd then panicked and ran out of the apartment and down the outside stairwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 8} Monroe later told a cellmate that after Boyd ran away, Monroe \u201cwent ahead and dumped them in the head,\u201d meaning he shot both women in the head. Boyd heard gunshots when he was at the bottom of the stairwell. He then ran to a nearby gas station, where he called a cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 9} Bennett and Patricia Wise lived in the apartment below Quincy\u2019s. Bennett was awakened by the scuffling and screaming coming from Quincy\u2019s apartment. Patricia, who was in the living room talking on the phone, also heard screaming and scuffling. She called 911. Patricia and Bennett heard someone running down the apartment-complex stairwell, and Bennett looked out from a window and saw a thin man wearing a greenish-yellow jacket running \u201creal fast\u201d from the apartment stairwell. Bennett recalled hearing \u201cmaybe four\u201d gunshots. After the shots were fired, he saw a shorter, stocky, heavy man with a \u201cmini-afro\u201d run from the apartment stairwell with a gun in his hand. Other witnesses described Monroe as having been heavyset at the time of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 10} Patricia also looked out the apartment window during the commotion. She first saw a young, tall, thin man run out wearing what she described as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cbright lined yellow jacket.\u201d Shots were still being fired in the apartment above when she saw the first man. After the first man fled the scene, Patricia saw a stocky black man come out of the stairwell. Patricia recalled that all the shots were fired from the apartment above. She estimated that seven or eight shots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 11} Columbus Police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter and found the bodies of Simmons and Quincy. The apartment appeared to have been ransacked. Shell casings found in Quincy\u2019s apartment indicated that the women had been shot with a nine-millimeter firearm. Also found at the crime scene were pieces from a yellow rubber glove. Police collected blood from the front door of Quincy\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 12} Although both women had suffered several sharp-instrument wounds, the coroner attributed Quincy\u2019s death to a gunshot wound to the head and Simmons\u2019s death to multiple gunshot wounds, including a fatal gunshot wound to her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 13} The murders remained unsolved for several years. In January 2000, Detective Richard Bisutti of the Columbus Police Cold Case Unit was assigned the case. He had information that Monroe had been scheduled to make a drug transaction with one of the victims on the day of the homicides. The detectives began viewing Monroe as a suspect in the slayings after blood samples they obtained from him matched blood recovered from the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 14} During the fall of 2000, Boyd implicated Monroe in the murders and made a plea bargain with the prosecutor to plead guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in exchange for his testimony against Monroe. Charles White, who shared a cell with Monroe in the county jail in November 2001, also implicated Monroe based on conversations he had with Monroe while they were incarcerated together.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 15} Mark Hardy, a firearms examiner, concluded that the casings recovered at the scene, as well as bullets recovered from the two murder victims, were fired from a nine-millimeter firearm, likely a semiautomatic pistol. Hardy found that three different brands of ammunition were used in the slayings; however, no evidence suggested that more than one weapon was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 16} Lynn Bohn, a forensic scientist with the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) specializing in DNA analysis, testified that blood found on the front door of Quincy\u2019s apartment was a mixture from various sources. The major DNA profile found in the mixture was consistent with Monroe\u2019s. Although the two victims could not be excluded as minor contributors to the mixture found on the apartment door, Boyd was excluded as a contributor. Bolin opined that Monroe could not be excluded as the source of the major DNA profile of the blood. The profile found occurs in one in every 29.140 quadrillion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the Caucasian population, one in every 2.336 quadrillion in the African-American population, and one in every 1.538 quadrillion in the Hispanic population.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 17} In April 2001, a grand jury indicted Monroe on eight counts of aggravated murder for the killings of Quincy and Simmons. Each count included a firearms specification and four death-penalty specifications: murder in connection with (1) an aggravated burglary, (2) an aggravated robbery, and (3) kidnapping (R.C. 2929.04[A][7]), and (4) murder as part of a course of conduct involving the killing of two persons (R.C. 2929.04[A][5]). Monroe was also indicted on one count of aggravated burglary, two counts of aggravated robbery, and two counts of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 18} During a jury trial, the state presented a number of witnesses, including Boyd. Monroe presented three defense witnesses, including Boyd and White. Defense witness Nathaniel Gilmore, who had lived with Boyd after the murders, testified that Boyd had told him that he murdered the two women and had never mentioned that anyone was with him. White testified that when he and Boyd were in jail, Boyd told him that he and Monroe had stabbed and shot the two victims. When another inmate expressed disbelief that Boyd could ever stab or shoot anyone, Boyd revised his story and said that Monroe was the one who had stabbed and shot the two women. When called by the defense, Boyd denied ever having talked to Gilmore about the murders and denied telling White that he had stabbed the victims. The trial court gave a limiting instruction to the jury that the testimony by Gilmore and White regarding what Boyd had told them was admitted solely to test the credibility of Boyd and was not to be considered for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 19} After deliberation, the jury found Monroe guilty as charged. At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury recommended death, and the trial court imposed the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">\n<em>Gruesome Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 20} In propositions of law II, Y, and VIII, Monroe claims that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome photographs during both phases of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">{\u00b6 21} Under Evid.R. 403 and 611(A), the admission of photographs is left to a trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 121, 559 N.E.2d 710; <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 264, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. Nonrepetitive photographs in a capital case, even if gruesome, are admissible if the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>dice to the accused. <em>Maurer, </em>paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 22} In proposition of law II, Monroe contends that many of the photos admitted in both phases of trial depicting the crime scene and the two victims at the morgue were gruesome and repetitive and deprived him of a fair trial and fair sentencing determination. Monroe asserts that the sheer number of photographs admitted, over 200, rendered them repetitive and cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 23} The defense filed a motion in limine to exclude all photos of the victims. Prior to voir dire, the parties discussed the motion with the trial court, and the defense then specifically objected to State\u2019s Exhibit M-20, a morgue photo depicting a gaping cut on Quincy\u2019s neck. The trial court overruled the objection and stated that although the photo was gruesome, it was the only photo showing that particular wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 24} At the close of the state\u2019s case, the prosecutor moved to admit State\u2019s Exhibits M (morgue photos of Quincy), N (morgue photos of Simmons), and P (crime-scene photos). The prosecutor noted that out of the 24 photos constituting State\u2019s Exhibit M, the court had excluded nine as too gruesome. Of the 18 morgue photos of Simmons included in State\u2019s Exhibit N, the court excluded six.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 25} Monroe failed to object to the admission of any of the remaining photos, except for State\u2019s Exhibit M-20, and has therefore waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus. Yet Monroe fails to demonstrate plain error in the admission of any of the photos in issue. We have reviewed all of these photos and hold that there was no plain error in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 26} We hold that all of these photos were relevant and helped to prove the killer\u2019s intent and the lack of accident or mistake and illustrated the testimony of the detectives who described the crime scene and the coroner who described the wounds and injuries sustained by the two murder victims. These photos gave the jury an \u201cappreciation of the nature and circumstances of the crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 251, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Moreover, reversal is not required merely because a large number of photos were admitted. <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 27} Here, the trial court reviewed all the photographs submitted by the state and removed those photos that it considered overly gruesome or repetitive or cumulative. In so doing, the trial court exercised its discretion in admitting the photos. See, e.g., <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 318, 686 N.E.2d 245; <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 23. We find no outcome-determinative plain error in the admission of these photos. Moreover, with respect to the one photograph Monroe did object to (the morgue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>photo showing the cut on Quincy\u2019s neck), we find that its probative value outweighed any prejudice to Monroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 28} In proposition of law V, Monroe argues that his counsel were ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the photographs during the guilt phase. Monroe objects to the same photos (State\u2019s Exhibits M, N, and P) as repetitive that he objected to in proposition of law II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 29} Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. However, in no instance does Monroe demonstrate prejudice, i.e., \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. Given that the trial court reviewed the photographs \u2014 removing those it believed to be overly gruesome or repetitive \u2014 counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to the photos admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 30} In proposition of law VIII, Monroe contends that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome photographs in the penalty phase over defense counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 31} Yet we have uniformly held that a trial court may properly allow repetition of much or all that occurred in the guilt phase, pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). See, e.g., <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542; <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 73. Exhibits from the guilt phase are relevant to the death-penalty specifications and to the nature and circumstances of the offense. <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 165, 694 N.E.2d 932; <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 78, 623 N.E.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 32} Here, the trial court noted the defense\u2019s objection to the admission of the photographs that had been admitted in the guilt phase and reviewed the photos again. As a result, the trial court excluded three gruesome photos from the penalty phase: State\u2019s Exhibits N-2, N-3, and M-20. Given the trial court\u2019s renewed scrutiny of the photos at the close of the penalty phase, Monroe\u2019s claim of error is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, propositions II, V, and VIII are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\n<em>Guiltr-Phase Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">{\u00b6 34} In proposition of law III, Monroe asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of murder and involuntary manslaughter, as requested by defense counsel. Monroe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>contends that the jury could have believed that Boyd exaggerated his story or could have chosen not to believe the parts of Boyd\u2019s testimony bearing upon prior calculation and design. According to Monroe, the jury had good reason to disbelieve Boyd\u2019s testimony, because the defense called two acquaintances of Boyd\u2019s, Nathaniel Gilmore and Charles White, who testified that Boyd had told them that he was the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 35} We note that only two of the eight aggravated-murder counts (Counts 1 and 2) against Monroe alleged prior calculation and design. The remaining six aggravated-murder counts were felony-murder counts. Thus, even if we were to accept Monroe\u2019s argument, only those two aggravated-murder counts would be affected. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 338, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 36} Murder (R.C. 2903.02) is a lesser included offense of aggravated murder (R.C. 2903.01[A]). <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 161, 694 N.E.2d 932. The sole difference is that prior calculation and design is absent from murder. <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 345, 703 N.E.2d 1251. Involuntary manslaughter (R.C. 2903.04) is also a lesser included offense of aggravated murder (R.C. 2903.01[A]). <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph one of the syllabus. The primary difference is that aggravated murder requires a purpose to kill, while involuntary manslaughter requires only that a killing occur as a proximate result of committing or attempting to commit a felony. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 218, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 37} However, \u201c[e]ven though an offense may be statutorily defined as a lesser included offense of another, a charge on such lesser included offense is required only where the evidence presented at trial would reasonably support both an acquittal on the crime charged and a conviction upon the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph two of the syllabus. In making this determination, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 47-48, 630 N.E.2d 339. When the evidence presented at trial does not meet this test, a charge on the lesser included offense is not required. <em>State v. Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 282-283, 513 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 38} Here, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Monroe, there was no reasonable basis for the jury to find that the element of prior calculation and design was absent. Monroe brought a gun and yellow latex gloves to Quincy\u2019s apartment. He tortured the two victims with a knife, inflicting stab wounds to their chests that would have been fatal if not treated. He moved the women to different rooms. He inflicted a fatal gunshot wound to Quincy\u2019s head and several fatal gunshot wounds to Simmons\u2019s head and body. His actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>occurred over a period of time and were not the result of a sudden decision. Therefore, we hold that an instruction on murder was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 39} The evidence of prior calculation and design presented in this case was, in our view, stronger than the evidence in <em>State v. Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 331, 703 N.E.2d 1251. In <em>Goodwin, </em>we held that the trial court correctly refused to give a requested instruction on murder in a case involving one victim killed during the robbery of a store. In that case, we held that putting the murder weapon to the forehead of the cooperative, unresisting victim and firing the weapon was sufficient evidence to support the element of prior calculation and design. Id. at 344-345, 703 N.E.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 40} Monroe argues, however, that the jury could have reasonably concluded that Boyd had lied and that Boyd was the actual killer. Monroe points to testimony from Nathaniel Gilmore and Charles White, who both testified that Boyd had admitted killing the two women. However, the trial court gave a limiting instruction to the jury that that testimony was admitted solely to impeach the credibility of Boyd and was not to be considered for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 41} Even if the testimony of Gilmore and White had been admitted as evidence that Boyd was the killer, it would not have supported a lesser-included-offense instruction for murder. According to Gilmore, Boyd said that he was the sole killer of the two women and did not say that Monroe or anyone else was with him at the time. Thus, under the version that Boyd allegedly told Gilmore, Monroe would have to be acquitted, since he was not involved in the murders at all. Cf. <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382, 388-389, 18 O.O.3d 528, 415 N.E.2d 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 42} According to White, Boyd told him two different versions of what had happened. Under one version, both Boyd and Monroe stabbed and shot the two women. Under the other version, Boyd fled the scene before the shootings took place. Thus, there was nothing in White\u2019s testimony whereby the jury could reasonably conclude that Monroe had acted without prior calculation and design and was guilty only of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 43} Likewise, there was no evidence whereby the jury could reasonably conclude that Monroe had acted without purpose to kill, which would make him guilty only of the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. The manner in which the victims were killed clearly points to purposeful killings. Both victims were stabbed repeatedly and shot in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">{\u00b6 44} Both Boyd and White testified for the state. Boyd essentially testified that Monroe had wanted to rob the women of drugs and was prepared to kill them, as evidenced by his bringing gloves and a gun to the apartment. According to White\u2019s testimony as a prosecution witness, Monroe admitted stabbing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>two women and then shooting them in the head so that he would not leave any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">{\u00b6 45} Moreover, even if the testimony from Gilmore and White regarding Boyd\u2019s alleged confession had been admitted to prove that Boyd was the killer, it did not portray Monroe as a mere accomplice, lacking a purpose to kill. Under Gilmore\u2019s testimony, Monroe was not involved in the killings. Under White\u2019s testimony, Monroe was directly involved in both the stabbings and the shootings. Under the evidence admitted at trial, no jury could have reasonably found the absence of a purpose to kill on the part of Monroe. Hence, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 330-331, 731 N.E.2d 645; <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 257-258, 699 N.E.2d 482. Accordingly, we reject proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 46} In proposition of law IV, Monroe argues that the verdicts in his case were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Monroe asserts that the state failed to prove the element of prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 47} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 48} We hold that the evidence in this case was sufficient to establish Monroe\u2019s guilt of the crimes and to prove prior calculation and design. The state\u2019s evidence showed that Monroe cajoled Boyd to take a ride with him. They drove to a bar on the east side of Columbus where they met up with Quincy and Simmons. The women invited Monroe and Boyd to Quincy\u2019s apartment to smoke marijuana. Shortly thereafter, Monroe confided to Boyd that he planned to rob the women\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 49} At the apartment, Monroe brandished a gun, produced yellow latex gloves, and told Boyd to wear the gloves and bind the women\u2019s hands and ankles with packing tape. Monroe rummaged through the apartment looking for drugs. Monroe then ordered Boyd to retrieve a knife from the kitchen. Monroe then stabbed the women with a knife, demanding that they give him drugs. He and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Boyd moved the women to different bedrooms. Boyd panicked and fled the apartment. Monroe then shot both women in the head and fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 50} While in jail with Charles White, Monroe admitted stabbing and shooting both women after they denied having drugs, which Monroe believed were in Quincy\u2019s apartment. The DNA profile of blood recovered from the front door of Quincy\u2019s apartment was consistent with Monroe\u2019s DNA profile. This DNA profile would be found in only one of every 2.336 quadrillion African-Americans.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 51} Viewing the foregoing evidence in favor of the state, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Monroe\u2019s convictions for the aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and murder with prior calculation and design of both Quincy and Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 52} As to the weight of the evidence, the issue is whether \u201cthere is <em>substantial </em>evidence upon which a jury could reasonably conclude that all the elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 193, 702 N.E.2d 866, citing <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132, syllabus. The evidence we set forth above collectively represents \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and supports the convictions. In our view, the jury did not lose its way, and this is not \u201c \u2018the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717; <em>State v.

Monroe asserts that recommendation of a life sentence need not be unanimous and that the jurors should recommend a life sentence if they are anything other than unanimously in favor of a death verdict. Yet Monroe\u2019s failure to object at trial waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.

Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph ten of the syllabus, we held: \u201cIn returning a sentence of life imprisonment under R.C. 2929.03(D)(2), the jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous.\u201d Thus, contrary to Monroe\u2019s assertion, unanimity is indeed required in order for the jury to return a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 61} Monroe cites <em>State v. Springer </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 167, 586 N.E.2d 96, and <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030, but neither case supports his argument. In <em>Springer, </em>we held that if the jury becomes irreconcilably deadlocked in the penalty phase of a capital trial and is unable to reach a unanimous verdict to recommend any sentence authorized by R.C. 2929.03(C)(2), then the <em>trial court </em>is required to impose a life sentence. <em>Springer </em>at syllabus. In <em>Brooks, </em>we recognized that in Ohio, a solitary juror may prevent a death-penalty recommendation and held that juries from the date of that decision forward should be so instructed. <em>Brooks </em>at 162, 661 N.E.2d 1030. Yet <em>Brooks </em>also reaffirmed the <em>Jenkins </em>standard that the jury must be unanimous in returning a life verdict. Id. \u201cIn Ohio, it is required that a verdict of life imprisonment be unanimous, and that requirement has been upheld as constitutional.\u201d <em>State v. Nields, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 30, 752 N.E.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">{\u00b6 62} Thus, the second verdict form for each of the aggravated-murder counts accurately reflected Ohio law, and we reject Monroe\u2019s argument that a recommendation of a life sentence need not be unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">{\u00b6 63} In proposition of law X, Monroe claims that the trial court deprived him of a fair trial by using the term \u201crecommendation\u201d throughout voir dire and in its penalty-phase jury instructions when referring to the jury\u2019s penalty verdict. Yet, as Monroe concedes, use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d in a jury instruction accurately reflects Ohio law. <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 444, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 559, 651 N.E.2d 965. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that the term \u201crecommend\u201d was not intended to \u201cdiminish [the jurors\u2019] sense of responsibility in this matter.\u201d This instruction was nearly identical to the cautionary instruction we approved in <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 84, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Therefore, we overrule proposition X.</p>\n<p id=\"AZgy\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\n<em>Merger of Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">{\u00b6 64} In proposition of law XII, Monroe argues that the trial court erred in failing to merge duplicative aggravating circumstances in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 65} Because Monroe failed to request a merger of the aggravated circumstances at trial, he waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 528, 605 N.E.2d 70; <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 39, 544 N.E.2d 895. Moreover, Monroe fails to specify which aggravating circumstances he believes should have been merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 66} There were four aggravating circumstances/death-penalty specifications under each aggravated-murder count: (1) murder in connection with an aggravated burglary, (2) murder in connection with an aggravated robbery, (3) murder in connection with a kidnapping, and (4) murder as a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons. However, as explained below, merger was not required for any of these aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 67} Aggravated robbery and kidnapping. Both victims in this case were bound at the hands and ankles with packing tape and were tortured with a knife. According to Boyd, the victims were stabbed because they denied having drugs, which Monroe wanted to steal from them. Given the prolonged torture, along with the fact that the bound victims were dragged into separate bedrooms, it is clear that the kidnappings had significance independent of the aggravated robbery. See <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d. at 280-281, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Cf. <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 89-95, and <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 344, 715 N.E.2d 136 (two cases in which we held that the aggravating circumstances of aggravated robbery and kidnapping should have been merged).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 68} Aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. The aggravated-burglary and aggravated-robbery specifications were also not subject to merger, since they were committed with separate animus. The burglary was complete as soon as Monroe entered the apartment by deception with the intent to commit a theft offense. Monroe then attempted to rob Quincy and Simmons of drugs that Monroe thought were in Quincy\u2019s apartment. Thus, the aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery were separate offenses and constituted separate aggravating circumstances because they did not arise from the same act. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 580, 660 N.E.2d 724; <em>State v. Fears, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 344, 715 N.E.2d 136. See, also, <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 253, 256, 12 O.O.3d 263, 389 N.E.2d 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 69} Aggravated burglary and kidnapping. Merger was not required for the aggravated burglary and kidnapping specifications. Aggravated burglary and kidnapping are not allied offenses of similar import. <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>63 Ohio St.3d 424, 448, 588 N.E.2d 819; <em>State v. Fears, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 344, 715 N.E.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 70} Course of conduct and aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping. The course-of-conduct specification involved Monroe\u2019s purposeful murder of two persons and is distinctly different from committing murder during an aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, or kidnapping. No merger of specifications was required. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 116, 684 N.E.2d 668 (specifications for multiple murder and for felony murder represent distinct and separate aggravating circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 71} The trial court did not commit plain error in failing to merge any of the death-penalty specifications. Therefore, we overrule proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>Waiver of Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 72} In propositions of law VII and XIII, Monroe argues that the trial court erred in how it conducted the penalty phase of Monroe\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 73} In proposition VII, Monroe asserts that the trial court failed to determine whether he was competent to waive presentation of mitigating evidence. Monroe contends that although he gave an unsworn statement, he addressed the statement to his family in the courtroom and offered nothing to the jury in mitigation. Monroe further contends that the lone witness called to testify on his behalf, Eliza Dillard, had not seen him in over 20 years and could testify only as to his poor upbringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 74} Monroe contends that the trial court failed to adhere to our holding in <em>State v. Ashworth </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231. In <em>Ashworth, </em>we held, in paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201cIn a capital case, when a defendant wishes to waive the presentation of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence, a trial court must conduct an inquiry of the defendant on the record to determine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) However, <em>Ashworth </em>has no applicability, here because Monroe did not waive presentation of <em>all </em>mitigating evidence. Given our emphasis in <em>Ashworth </em>on the word \u201call,\u201d it is clear that we intended to require an inquiry of a defendant only in those situations where the defendant chooses to present no mitigating evidence whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 75} Moreover, Monroe\u2019s claim that he essentially presented no mitigating evidence is not borne out by the record. Regardless of how Monroe characterizes it, he did in fact present mitigating evidence. Eliza Dillard testified about Monroe\u2019s upbringing in West Virginia. Dillard stated that Monroe\u2019s family suffered a hard life in the early 1980s, and she told of infidelity and other problems in his parents\u2019 marriage. She told the jury that Monroe\u2019s father eventually left the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>{\u00b6 76} Monroe gave an unsworn statement to the jury, and he described the hard life he had had as a child, including the absence of his father, and said that both of his parents had endured abuse during their upbringing. Monroe\u2019s unsworn statement was directed at the jury, not his family, as he now claims. For example, Monroe noted near the end of his statement: \u201cLike I said before, I respect all of your decisions and I think that if the evidence is presented to you the way I think it should have been, I don\u2019t think I would be sitting here begging for my life now. Well, I\u2019m not begging for my life * * Even assuming that Monroe directed his statement at his family, it is clear that his statement was also directed at the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 77} Monroe also suggests that his family members could have given additional mitigation testimony but cites nothing in the record to support this assertion. In fact, defense counsel informed the trial court that they complied with Monroe\u2019s request not to have any of his family testify in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 78} And even if family members had testified in Monroe\u2019s behalf, it is not clear that their testimony would have helped Monroe avoid a death sentence. Given that Monroe was already serving a prison term for murder in an unrelated case, a thorough mitigation presentation could have opened the door for the prosecution to introduce evidence of that murder conviction, a fact the defense naturally wanted to keep from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">{\u00b6 79} As we noted in <em>State v. Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 63, 706 N.E.2d 1231, even if a trial court were to require defense counsel to present mitigating evidence, it could not force an unwilling defendant to provide that evidence to his attorney. Moreover, if a defendant does not want to present mitigating evidence, \u201cno societal interest counterbalances his right to control his own defense.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 80} Moreover, a capital defendant\u2019s decision to forgo mitigation \u201cdoes not by itself call his competence into question.\u201d Id. at 29, 553 N.E.2d 576. \u201c[AJbsent a request by counsel, or any indicia of incompetence, a competency evaluation is not required.\u201d <em>Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 62, 706 N.E.2d 1231. A court is required to inquire into a \"capital defendant\u2019s competence only if some reason other than the decision to forgo presentation of mitigation evidence exists that calls into question the defendant\u2019s competence. See <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 82, 717 N.E.2d 298. Neither Monroe\u2019s behavior at trial nor his decision to limit the amount of mitigating evidence presented in his behalf provided cause to call his competence into question. Nor did his counsel, who worked with him closely, raise any questions about Monroe\u2019s competence. Deference on such issues should be granted to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d Id. at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>{\u00b6 81} In summary, we hold that Monroe did present mitigating evidence. Therefore, <em>State v. Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, syllabus, does not apply in this case. Monroe\u2019s behavior did not raise questions concerning his competence at any time during trial. Therefore, the trial court was not obligated to order a competency evaluation sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">{\u00b6 82} Thus, proposition VII is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 83} In proposition of law XIII, Monroe asserts that the trial court did not permit the jury to hear all relevant mitigating evidence, because it permitted defendant to waive presentation of potentially relevant testimony from numerous witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 84} However, as we discussed in response to proposition VII, a capital defendant cannot be compelled to present mitigating evidence. As we observed in <em>State v. Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 63, 706 N.E.2d 1231, \u201ca rule requiring the presentation of mitigating evidence would be impossible to enforce. Even if the court attempted to require an attorney to present mitigating evidence, it cannot force an unwilling defendant to provide that evidence to his attorney.\u201d Nor does the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution compel a capital defendant to present mitigation evidence against his will. See id. at 64, 706 N.E.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 85} We do not find error in the trial court\u2019s respecting Monroe\u2019s decision to limit the amount of mitigating evidence presented to the jury. As we stated in <em>State v. Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 28, 553 N.E.2d 576, no societal interest counterbalances the defendant\u2019s right to control his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">{\u00b6 86} Accordingly, proposition XIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">{\u00b6 87} In propositions of law I and XI, Monroe argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, in no instance does Monroe demonstrate deficient performance or \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus;</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">{\u00b6 88} In proposition I, Monroe contends that counsel were deficient in failing to object to the form and substance of the testimony of David Devillers, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>former prosecutor who negotiated the plea agreement with state\u2019s witness Shannon Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">{\u00b6 89} Monroe concedes that defense counsel objected to Devillers\u2019s testimony on two grounds before Devillers took the stand: first, that the state had not listed him as a potential witness, and second, that his testimony would be in the nature of rebuttal and therefore procedurally improper unless Devillers were called after the defense\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 90} The trial court overruled the defense\u2019s objections and permitted Devillers to testify as a \u201cfact witness.\u201d The state had proposed Devillers as a late prosecution witness to refute the defense\u2019s assertion during opening statement that the police and prosecutor had \u201cmanufactured\u201d, evidence. Moreover, the state wanted to refute defense counsel\u2019s suggestion (during cross-examination of Boyd) that a secret deal had been made between the state and Boyd concerning the length of his sentence. Defense counsel specifically raised Devillers\u2019s name as the person who had worked out the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 91} Monroe claims that Devillers testified that he believed Boyd had given truthful information in exchange for a plea deal. Monroe asserts that his counsel should have objected to this testimony, which he claims vouched for Boyd\u2019s testimony. Monroe contends that allowing Devillers\u2019s testimony was contrary to our holding in <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 128-129, 545 N.E.2d 1220 (a child-molestation case in which we reversed the conviction because an expert witness had given her opinion as to the veracity of the child declarant).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 92} In this case, however, Devillers did not testify that he believed that Boyd had testified truthfully. Rather, he explained what had happened during the plea-bargaining process with Boyd. Devillers explained that prosecutors will not make a deal with a witness unless they conclude that the witness is telling the truth. While Devillers testified that he had agreed to the plea bargain with Boyd because he believed that Boyd was being truthful, he did not vouch for the truthfulness of Boyd\u2019s testimony. Rather, Devillers noted that the determination whether Boyd was giving truthful testimony was \u201ccompletely up to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 93} Through Devillers\u2019s testimony, the prosecution sought to establish that the state and police had not manufactured evidence and that there was no \u201csecret deal\u201d made with Boyd. Similar to the situation we faced in <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 449, 751 N.E.2d 946, the prosecutor here established that there was a plea agreement with the witness, and as part of that agreement, the witness had agreed to tell the truth. See, also, <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d, 1, 12-13, 679 N.E.2d 646. Even if part of Devillers\u2019s testimony was improper, any error did not affect the outcome of Monroe\u2019s trial, especially in view of the abundant evidence of Monroe\u2019s guilt. Therefore, counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to certain aspects of Devillers\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 94} Monroe asserts that although the state never offered Devillers as an expert witness, his testimony bore all the indicia of expert testimony, since it explained the new criminal-sentencing law, the parole laws, the difference between murder and manslaughter, and how prosecutors make plea bargains. Monroe contends that it was improper to allow Devillers to testify, in effect, as an expert witness, since the trial court did not formally qualify him as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 95} Monroe concedes that the state did not offer Devillers as an expert witness and that the trial court allowed his testimony as a \u201cfact witness.\u201d Even if we were to view Devillers as an expert witness not formally qualified by the trial court, it is clear that Devillers\u2019s knowledge of criminal law and of the facts and circumstances of Boyd\u2019s plea bargain is not knowledge possessed by the average lay person. Thus, Devillers was qualified to testify as an expert on such matters under Evid.R. 702, even though the court did not formally qualify him as one. See <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 96} Therefore, we overrule proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 97} In proposition XI, Monroe argues that there were four instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 98} First, Monroe contends that counsel were deficient in allowing him to waive mitigation without determining whether he was competent to do so. However, as we noted in our discussion in response to proposition VII, Monroe did not waive presentation of mitigating evidence. Monroe called a former neighbor to testify in his behalf and gave an unsworn statement to the jury. Moreover, he instructed defense counsel not to call members of his family to testify in his behalf. Although Monroe now contends that he \u201cessentially\u201d waived presentation of mitigating evidence, <em>State v. Ashworth, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 56, 706 N.E.2d 1231, paragraph one of the syllabus, does not apply to Monroe\u2019s case, since mitigating evidence was in fact presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 99} Nor does the record reveal sufficient indicia of incompetence to have required the trial court or defense counsel to request a competency evaluation of Monroe. Counsel became familiar with Monroe in representing him, and if they had any reason to question Monroe\u2019s competency in any respect, they surely would have done so. See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 411, 692 N.E.2d 151. Neither Monroe\u2019s behavior at trial nor any testimony presented in his behalf provided \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence\u201d to warrant a competency hearing. See <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433. Therefore, counsel were not deficient in failing to request a competency evaluation of Monroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 100} Second, Monroe asserts that counsel were ineffective for not presenting relevant mitigating testimony by Monroe\u2019s family members. Yet as we noted above, counsel presented the mitigating evidence that Monroe allowed them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>present. Monroe specifically instructed counsel not to call any of his family to testify in mitigation. An attorney does not render ineffective assistance by declining, in deference to a client\u2019s desires, to present mitigating evidence. See, e.g., <em>State v. Cowans, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 81, 717 N.E.2d 298; <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 536-537, 684 N.E.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 101} Third, Monroe contends that counsel were ineffective by not requesting the court to merge the aggravating circumstances. However, as we discussed in response to proposition XII, none of the aggravating circumstances/death-penalty specifications required merger. Therefore, counsel were not deficient in failing to request it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 102} Moreover, counsel were not deficient in not objecting to the instruction that the jury was to weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. In <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 126, 734 N.E.2d 1237, we stated that \u201c[ajggravating circumstances in a single count are considered collectively in assessing the penalty for that count * * Accord <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 544 N.E.2d 895, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 103} Last, Monroe claims that counsel were ineffective for not objecting to the trial court\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d and to the second verdict form used for each murder count, which stated that a decision to impose a life sentence had to be unanimous. However, as we discussed in response to proposition X, use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d correctly reflects Ohio law, and counsel were not deficient in failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 104} Similarly, counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to the verdict forms requiring a unanimous verdict for a life sentence. As we discussed in response to proposition IX, Ohio law requires a unanimous verdict for life sentences. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph ten of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 105} Based on the foregoing, Monroe\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">\n<em>Constitutionality of Death Penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">{\u00b6 106} In proposition of law VI, Monroe challenges Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes on numerous constitutional grounds, but these claims can be summarily rejected. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 107} Upon independent assessment, we find that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances in this case: Monroe murdered Deccarla Quincy and Travinna Simmons in connection with committing aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, and as a course of conduct involving the murder of two persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\n<em>Mitigating Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 108} During the penalty phase, Monroe instructed defense counsel not to call any family members as mitigation witnesses. Thus, Monroe presented one witness, Eliza Dillard, who had known Monroe when he was a child. Dillard, a retired teacher, knew Monroe and his family in the early 1980s and knew Monroe\u2019s grandfather from high school. She stated that Monroe\u2019s family had a hard life and that Monroe\u2019s parents had a marriage fraught with infidelity, drinking, and fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 109} According to Dillard, Monroe\u2019s mother was a very angry person. She frequented a nearby house where \u201ca very permissive environment\u201d of alcohol, sex, and possibly drugs was maintained. Monroe\u2019s father was a skilled carpenter but could not read or write. Eventually, Monroe\u2019s father left the family. Although Dillard had not seen Monroe for approximately 20 years, she said she was testifying in his behalf because of her love for him and God.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">{\u00b6 110} Dillard described Monroe as a unique child, in that he was somewhat of a leader among his four siblings. For example, she had noticed that he usually tried to get them to obey their curfew.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">{\u00b6 111} Monroe gave an unsworn statement noting that he did not want his family to testify in his behalf. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want any of them getting on the stand today and begging or pleading for my life; I won\u2019t do it either.\u201d Monroe asserted that he had not been given a fair trial but offered his condolences to the families of the two victims. He said several times that he was not begging for his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">{\u00b6 112} Monroe claimed that his lawyers had decided not to offer into evidence letters Boyd had written to him, offering him money to take responsibility for committing the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">{\u00b6 113} Monroe also talked about his family life while growing up: \u201cWe had no water, electric, or food in the house, and no father provider, and often I went door to door asking for work.\u201d Monroe stated that he thought at times about blaming his parents \u2014 his mother for being depressed and his father for not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>there for him. However, he said that his mother had been abused and molested as a child by her father. He also said that his father had blamed his own father (Monroe\u2019s grandfather) for his bad actions. Monroe asked, \u201cHow could anyone be a good mother and a good father if not raised by good parents?\u201d Yet Monroe said he ultimately placed no blame on anyone else for how his life had turned out.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">{\u00b6 114} Monroe said that he is not proud that he had sold drugs. He told the jurors that he respected their decision but thought the evidence was not presented to them the way he thought it should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 115} The nature and circumstances of the offenses offer nothing in mitigation. Monroe deceived Quincy and Simmons by accepting their invitation to go to Quincy\u2019s apartment to smoke marijuana, while Monroe was planning all along to rob the women\u2019s friends. Once Monroe got into the apartment, he held the two women at gunpoint, ordered Boyd to tie them up, and then tortured them with a knife before shooting both women in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 116} Monroe\u2019s history, character, and background offer little in mitigation. Monroe had a difficult childhood, and his father abandoned the family. This history provides some mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 117} With respect to the statutory mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B), we note that the trial court instructed the jury on mitigating factor (B)(4), the youth of the offender, and (B)(7), any other factor mitigating against a death sentence. Monroe was 22 years old when he committed the two murders. As in previous capital cases, we accord some mitigating weight to the fact that Monroe committed his crime at that age. See, e.g., <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 118} None of the other statutory mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B) appear applicable. Neither Quincy nor Simmons induced or facilitated the murders. Nor was there evidence that Monroe was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation at the time of the murders. There is no evidence that Monroe suffers from a mental disease or defect. And although Boyd assisted Monroe by tying up a victim and retrieving a knife from the kitchen, no credible evidence suggests that Monroe was not the principal offender. Nor did Monroe lack a criminal record. He was incarcerated in Chillicothe for murder at the time he was charged with these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">{\u00b6 119} Upon independent weighing, we find that the aggravating circumstances in each murder count outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. For purposes of reviewing the sentence, we now merge counts 1, 3, 5, and 7 into one count for the murder of Quincy, and merge counts 2, 4, 6, and 8 into one count for the murder of Simmons. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>St.3d 403, 419, 739 N.E.2d 300. The four aggravating circumstances in each count are particularly grave. The two victims were held at gunpoint, bound, and tortured prior to being shot in the head.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b556-9\">Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, Steven L. Taylor, and Laura M. Rayce, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ai5\">W. Joseph Edwards and Todd W. Barstow, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 120} As to the murder of each victim, the death penalty is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with capital cases involving aggravated murders during aggravated burglary, see, e.g., <em>State v. Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 311, 686 N.E.2d 245, and for aggravated murders during aggravated robbery, see, e.g., <em>State v. Burke </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 399, 653 N.E.2d 242, and <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 699 N.E.2d 482. The death penalty is also appropriate and proportionate to death sentences approved for aggravated murders during kidnapping, see, e.g., <em>State v. Twyford </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 763 N.E.2d 122, and for aggravated murders as a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing or attempt to kill two or more persons, see, e.g., <em>State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 514, 684 N.E.2d 47; <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1; and <em>State v. Ahmed, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 121} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of common pleas, including the penalty of death, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
