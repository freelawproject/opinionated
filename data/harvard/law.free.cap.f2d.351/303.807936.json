On June 22 he was taken before a magistrate where he waived a preliminary hearing and was bound over to the district court for trial. Subsequently and on August 3, new charges were filed against him and he was arraijgned upon these charges before a magistrate on August 6, at which time he waived a preliminary hearing and was bound over to the district court for trial. Arraignment in the district court was not had until March 1, 1963, and a jury trial upon the charges followed on March 11 and 12. Sentence, after a verdict of guilty, was pronounced on March 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-27\">In the trial court appellant\u2019s only ground for invalidating the judgment of conviction and sentence was the delay between his arrest and trial. We agree with the trial court that, under the facts disclosed by the record, this is insufficient to constitute a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Federal Court jurisdiction. It is a matter preceding the trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we can find no prejudice to Love at the trial by reason of the delay. Appellant, for the first time, raises other questions concerning the validity of his present confinement. These questions were not presented to the district judge, therefore, we must refrain from passing upon them. In this regard, we are advised by counsel for respondent that the Oklahoma Legislature has recently enacted into law a statute similar to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 which gives to state prisoners a post conviction remedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This new statute is available to appellant for the purpose of seeking relief upon the new grounds urged here for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-13\">.
