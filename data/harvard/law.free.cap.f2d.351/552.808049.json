The complaint sought a temporary and a permanent injunction and an accounting for damages. Prior to trial plaintiffs moved, on affidavits and counter-affidavits, for a summary judgment granting a permanent injunction. The district court, upon consideration, denied the motion. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The first question is that of our jurisdiction. No determination was made, or sought for, warranting an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Plaintiffs assert jurisdiction under section 1292(a) (1), permitting appeals from \u201c[ijnterlocutory orders of the district courts * * * granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions * * *.\u201d We do not find this section appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Plaintiffs concede that they did not ask for, and made no showing in the district court warranting, an interlocutory injunction, and that all they sought, and presently seek, is a permanent injunction. It is equally clear that the district court did not finally deny a permanent injunction, but merely held that in the present posture of the case there is an issue of fact making a summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">It must be apparent that the denial of an interlocutory injunction is not the same as an interlocutory denial of a permanent injunction. By hypothesis the need, or alleged need for an immediate appeal is urgent in the former case. Contrariwise, a final appeal from the interlocutory denial of a permanent injunction may never be needed; the court, when the evidence is taken, may grant, rather than deny, relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\"> Because of the general policy against piecemeal appeals, statutes permitting interlocutory appeals are to be construed with some strictness. On this basis, whatever may be the exact letter, the spirit of section 1292(a) (1) is against plaintiff\u2019s position. In this we agree with cases such as Morgenstern Chemical Co. v. Schering Corp., 3 Cir., 1950, 181 F.2d 160, and Hook v. Hook &amp; Ackerman, Inc., 3 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 122. See also Division 689, Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of St. Elec. Ry. and Motor Coach Emp., etc. v. Capital Transit Co., 1955, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 4, 227 F.2d 19, and Clark, C. J., dissenting, in United States v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. RR., 2 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 525, at 549, 552, cert. den. Tri-Continental Financial Corp. v. United States, 362 U.S. 961, 80 S.Ct. 877, 4 L.Ed.2d 876 and Tri-Continental Financial Corp. v. Glenmore, 362 U.S. 964, 80 S.Ct. 877, 4 L.Ed.2d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Plaintiffs cite Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Dixon Textile Corp., 2 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 800. It is true that in that case the court upheld plaintiffs\u2019 position. We note, however, that the writer expressed his personal reluctance, but felt bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>by the circuit\u2019s- prior decisions. We are under no such disability. Furthermore, we think that the additional opportunity afforded by section 1292(b) for interlocutory appeals under controlled conditions enacted since the original decisions in the Second Circuit makes strict construction of the other sections all the more desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
