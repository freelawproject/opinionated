The court\u2019s supporting opinion is reported at 245 F.Supp. 595. The bank appealed from the judgment entered in accordance with the court\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">Having carefully studied the record and considered the issues presented, we conclude that the district court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous, and that the judgment was not premised upon a misconception of the applicable law. We, therefore, affirm, for the reasons stated in Judge Nordbye\u2019s soundly reasoned opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
