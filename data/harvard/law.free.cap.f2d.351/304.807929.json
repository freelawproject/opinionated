United States, 239 F.2d 560,\u2018 10 Cir.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We conclude that proper service was made of the demand required under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4744(d) to justify the trial court\u2019s charging the jury on the presumption set out in that section of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Finally, there was ample evidence to warrant submission of the charge under count IV to the jury. The facts of the transfer there alleged, in conjunction with the constructive possession by appellant, are sufficient to sustain the conviction in spite of the fact that appellant was not physically present. See Grant v. United States, 9 Cir., 291 F.2d 746, cert. denied 368 U.S. 999, 82 S.Ct. 627, 7 L.Ed.2d 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
