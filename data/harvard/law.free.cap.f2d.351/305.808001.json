Appellants\u2019 fairly feeble opposition to the motion in the District Court has not been much strengthened on appeal. The general contractor now cites United States for Benefit and Use of Westinghouse Supply Co. v. Robbins (1954 D.C.Mass.), 125 F.Supp. 25, for the proposition that the material supplier\u2019s affidavits were insufficient because they did not prove that the materials furnished had been incorporated into the building. It is not the law that a person who has furnished material in the prosecution of the work provided for in a contract for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>construction of a public building of the United States must prove the actual use of the material in the construction work to sustain a cause of action under the Miller Act. United States for Use and Benefit of National U. S. Radiator Corp. v. D. C. Loveys Co. (D.C.Mass.1959), 174 F.Supp. 44, aff\u2019d on other grounds, 1 Cir., 275 F.2d 372; Fourt v. United States for Use of Westinghouse Electric Supply Co. (10 C.C.A.1956), 235 F.2d 433; Continental Casualty Co. v. Allsop Lumber Co.
