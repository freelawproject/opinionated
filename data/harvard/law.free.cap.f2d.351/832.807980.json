Appellants also asked for an injunction restraining enforcement of the regulations. The regulations provide that additional tobacco inspection and price support services for a new tobacco \u201csale\u201d, <em>i. </em>e.., an individual sub-market in a designated area, will be furnished only to an applicant who proves that he has firm commitments from five or more buyers \u201cwho could reasonably be expected to purchase at least two-thirds of the total U.S. production of the kind of tobacco for which the additional services are requested\u201d, that they will participate in the sale. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 464.1016(b), 464.-1017(a); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 29.1(b), 29.2(a) (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Appellants alleged that they \u201care desirous of applying for and obtaining * * * services for an additional or fifth daily sale to be held in each of the cities of Danville and Winston-Salem\u201d, and that such sales would bring them additional commissions of $120,000 to $150,000. They alleged that it is impossible for any applicant to comply \u201cwith the prerequisites for such increased services as set forth in the * * * regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******The District Court held that the regulations were valid and entered judgment for the defendant Secretary dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\"> We think the court should have dismissed the complaint without passing on the validity of the regulations. Appellants are seeking judicial review of regulations in the abstract, not as applied to an existing fact situation. No appellant alleges that because of the regulations the Secretary has denied any application for services for a new sale. No final administrative action based on the regulations has been taken. The request for judicial review is therefore premature. With possible exceptions not pertinent here, litigants who have not been harmed or threatened with immediate harm by administrative action have no standing to attack it. A leading case for this familiar proposition is United States v. Los Angeles &amp; S. L. R. R., 273 U.S. 299, 47 S.Ct. 413, 71 L.Ed. 651 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Some of the appellants have made no applications. These appellants have not exhausted their administrative remedies. The Secretary has denied applications of other appellants, but on the ground that no need for the proposed sales was established. Appellants do not question -this finding of the Secretary or suggest that it is based on the regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, does not give appellants standing to sue, \u201cThe difference between an abstract question and a \u2018controversy\u2019 contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree * * *. Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941). To be \u201cripe for determination\u201d under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a \u201cdisagreement must not be nebulous or contingent but must have taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>on fixed and final shape so that a court can see what legal issues it is deciding, what effect its decision will have on the adversaries, and some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them.\u201d Public Service Comm\u2019n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 244, 73 S.Ct. 236, 240, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The appealed judgment should be modified so as to comply with this opinion and will then stand affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-11\">. They alleged that the Secretary\u2019s denial of the petition to repeal the regulations was unreasonable and deprived them of due process; that the applicants could not learn which buyers could be expected to buy two-thirds of the total production, because the amount individual tobacco companies buy is a trade secret and the Secretary, though he has this information, will not reveal it; and that the tobacco companies refuse to make commitments to applicants for sales. Appellants also contend that the regulations unconstitutionally delegate decision-making power to the tobacco companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-20\">. The District Court held that the Secretary\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
