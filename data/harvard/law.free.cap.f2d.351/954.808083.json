The basis for the action against Imperato, the defendant, lies in Imperato\u2019s activities as consultant for Shahmoon in developing and exploiting a secret process developed by Imperato for the blocking of iron ore In order to make it suitable for use in the steel industry. Jurisdiction is asserted to be based on diversity of citizenship. See 338 F.2d 449, 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">The case is now before us for the second time. At the first argument we raised <em>sua sponte </em>Shahmoon Industries, Inc.\u2019s failure to allege the necessary jurisdictional facts as to its principal place of business. See Rule 8(a) (1) Fed.R.Civ.Proe., and Section 1332(c), Title 28 U.S.C. We remanded the case for further proceedings to the end that the necessary jurisdictional facts might be established. See 338 F.2d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Upon the remand the court below supplemented the original record and made findings, based on adequate evidence, and conclusions which establish diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">We have examined the record and have considered carefully the arguments of the parties. We can perceive no error in the proceedings below. Accordingly the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
