Upon being arraigned, he was twice asked by the judge and once by the prosecuting attorney if he desired counsel. With a full explanation, he waived indictment, entered a plea of guilty and after proof by a Government agent was adjudged guilty and sentenced. He now complains that he was denied his right to counsel. He contended on an application made under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 that he was afflicted with a \u201cseizure amnesia blackout\u201d which prevented him from understanding trial procedures and that his waiver of counsel and plea of guilty were not understandingly made. The appellant\u2019s contentions are not established and relief was properly denied by the district court. Its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b451-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
