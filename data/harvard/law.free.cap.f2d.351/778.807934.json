Amendments to Western Air Lines route 13 redesignated San Diego as an intermediate point and added Honolulu as a terminal point. Further changes in Western\u2019s route 35 added Honolulu as a terminal point to that route. Nearly three years later, the Board terminated its <em>Transpacific Route Case, </em>proceedings by Order E-20178, served November 8, 1963, and thereafter denied Western\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Western has sought review, contending in essence that the Board\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious in that the Board acted in 1963 without findings and without revoking its 1960 findings. Western argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Board has acted contrary to law since in 1960 it had obviously found that public interest, convenience and necessity required additional capacity and scheduled service for the California-Hawaii routes. Moreover, in 1960, the Board had found Western to be fit and able to render that service. Western insists that as a matter of law it is entitled to an order which would compel the Board to reissue certificates conformably to the 1960 findings, as set out in the Board\u2019s opinion to accompany Order E-16285.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Pursuant to Presidential request in February 1959, the Board in its <em>Transpacific Route Case </em>initiated an examination of air service needs of the entire Pacific area. The scope of the inquiry included problems as to air service between the mainland of the United States and Hawaii, then a Territory, and between the mainland and other points in the Far East. When Hawaii became a State in August, 1959, services between the mainland and Hawaii became interstate air transportation within the meaning of section 101(21) (a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The Board thus was free to act. As to such services the Board prepared its \u201cDomestic Decision,\u201d as of December 7, 1960, with Western\u2019s amended certificates to become effective on March 20, 1961. At the same time the Board released its separate \u201cInternational Decision\u201d recommending that the President approve new international route awards in the Pacific area.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The Board\u2019s opinions and orders were not served upon the parties until January 19,1961. The previous day, the President, as he was authorized to do by section 801 of the Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had disapproved the Board\u2019s recommendations as to international air transportation. His notification to the Board coincidentally expressed the \u201chope\u201d that the Board would reconsider its decision to authorize additional service between the mainland and Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Faced with Presidential disapproval of the international phase, the Board stayed its December, 1960 decision which as noted had favored certification of Western to accomplish air transportation between California and Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Various subsequent proceedings engaged the attention of the Board,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but at no time was an award of routes to Western allowed to become effective. Finally the Board by its Order E-20178 adopted August 7, 1963 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and served on November 8,1963, simply terminated the \u201cdomestic\u201d phase of its <em>Transpacific Route Case. </em>Western\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied by the Board\u2019s Order E-20534 adopted March 3, 1964, with two members still expressing the opinion that a California-Hawaii route should have been awarded to Western in accordance with the Board\u2019s original 3 to 2 decision of December 7,1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">The Board\u2019s supplemental opinion and order No. E-20178 recited that oral argument covering the reconsideration aspects of both the international and the domestic phases had been heard by the Board. Its conclusion as to the mainland-Hawaii phase was said to have been based upon the proposition that both the domestic and the international issues were \u201cintimately intertwined.\u201d The Board asserted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-14\">\u201cthat a decision attempting to determine the purely domestic issues without regard to the international requirements of Hawaiian service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>could do serious damage to the freedom of the Board and the President in establishing a balanced and effective international route pattern in the Pacific, and conversely, that the sound development of a coordinated pattern of domestic services between the mainland and Hawaii cannot be accomplished without a full assurance as to what the transpacific route structure will ultimately be. * * * We are fully aware that, Hawaii having become a State, the Board under the Act has plenary jurisdiction to determine the mainland-Hawaii route pattern and that the President\u2019s comments in his January 18,1961 memorandum respecting the Board\u2019s domestic decision are not binding upon the Board. However, we believe that it would not be an act of sound judgment and discretion on our part to exercise this jurisdiction at this time, not knowing what the next reexamination of the Pacific area route complex will produce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Thus it was that the Board \u201cterminated\u201d the domestic phase of its Pacific area study notwithstanding its realization that there was not to be \u201can updating of the record in the international phase within the next several years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">There were no findings in derogation of the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions set forth in its December, 1960 Domestic Decision and Order No. E-16285 that the public interest, convenience and necessity as to Hawaii and the California gateways then required the certification of the California-Hawaii routes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There were no findings that Western by November, 1963 was no longer fit, able and willing to serve those routes. The Board in December, 1960 had applied proper standards, \u201cdetermined in hearings after notice.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here the Board in 1963 had not acted \u201cafter a searching inquiry.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have no more than the Board\u2019s <em>ipse dixit, </em>without findings or record evidence to justify its order of termination. What the Board in 1960 had unanimously found to be the public interest considerations as to service needs was simply waved aside in 1963. The Board members in 1960 by a 3-2 vote had differed only as to the choice of carrier. Yet in 1963 \u201cthe mainland-Hawaii phase of this proceeding\u201d was \u201cterminated.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">On the record material before us as stipulated by the parties, it would seem beyond question that the public need for additional air transportation between California and Hawaii was overwhelmingly established in the proceedings concluded in 1960. In that respect it is reasonable to deduce that the public interest has been allowed to suffer and may have become intensified <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> over the intervening years.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>As to the carrier\u2019s claim of right to certification, a different problem is presented. Were we reviewing an order which had simply disposed of the competing interests of Western Air Lines and Continental, for example, or of Western and Northwest Airlines, Inc., we could agree that the Board\u2019s 1960 conclusion that Western should be selected over other carriers to render that service should not be disturbed. Such a determination found support in the Supreme Court in Civil Aero. Bd. v. State Airlines <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> even where Piedmont Aviation, Inc. had not applied for the specific routes assigned to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Again, if the earlier order providing for the issuance of certificates to Western had actually become effective, we would have had a very different situation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On this record and in the circumstances shown, we can not <em>order </em>the Board now to issue certificates in accordance with its 1960 opinion and order. We have been granted \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside the order complained of, in whole or in part, and if need be, to order further proceedings by the Board or Administrator.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Board counsel on brief contend that should we perceive error on the Board\u2019s part, \u201cthe indicated course of action plainly is to remand the case to the Board for further proceedings.\u201d That step will be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Our study has convinced us that the Board\u2019s unanimous 1960 conclusion that mainland-Hawaii service was required by the public convenience and necessity<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> should not be ignored by this court, and should not have been ignored by the Board in 1963. The Board itself had recognized in its supplemental opinion accompanying the order under review that pursuant to the Act the Board \u201chas plenary jurisdiction to determine the mainland-Hawaii route pattern,\u201d yet the Board stated it would refuse to exercise that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">We have been shown no acceptable basis upon which the Board here purported summarily to \u201cterminate\u201d so important a proceeding which lies squarely within its jurisdiction. Certainly the mere \u201chope\u201d of the President or his advisers is no predicate for the Board\u2019s arbitrary refusal to act on the \u201cDomestic\u201d phase. Assuredly the Board had defined no administrative standards<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by which bona fide applicants for certification might have been given to suppose that any such result could be possible. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings, the Board\u2019s own studies, the record so thoroughly established by the various participants, the unanimous findings of the entire Board, all demonstrated that the public interest and necessity required a mainland-Hawaii route. Thus the Board had exercised a judgment as to \u201cwhat new routes should be established, if any.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the face of that record, the Board simply flouted the congressional mandate. The statute says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-12\">\u201cThe Board <em>shall issue </em>a certificate authorizing the whole or any part of the transportation covered by the application, if it finds that the applicant is fit, willing, and able to perform such transportation prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>erly <em>* *\u25a0 * </em>and that <em>such transportation is required by the public convenience and necessity; </em>otherwise <em>such application shall be </em>denied.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The mandatory<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> congressional directive is explicit. It deals clearly with certification of the interstate air transportation which lies within the jurisdiction of the Board. If the Board agreeably to the statute had awarded an effective certificate to Western, its order would have been subject to review upon proper challenge and agreeably to recognized procedures. Even a denial of the applications of others would have been subject to orderly test. Here were no findings; there was no well-grounded revocation of the findings previously made. Whatever the facts or whether the Board had misconceived the law<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> would have remained in obscurity had Western not asked the aid of this court. It has now been made to appear that at the very least the Board\u2019s action was a disservice to the administrative process which increasingly affects the economic life and the well-being of the nation, not to mention the rights of the parties before the Board. They had participated in good faith in a proceeding instituted by the Board itself. In short, the public interest, the exemplification of which has been entrusted to the Board, is not to be dealt with in so cavalier a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">We reverse that portion of the Board\u2019s order which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the mainland-Hawaii phase of this proceeding be and it hereby is terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">We remand the case to the Board so that it will exercise the jurisdiction so clearly required of it with respect to the \u201cDomestic\u201d phase and make its determinations <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in light of this opinion and of our directions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-11\">(1) If the Board shall decide (a) that the present record has established that a public interest need for mainland-Hawaii air transportation still exists irrespective of international route considerations, the Board will next determine (b) whether or not Western is pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>ently \u201cfit, willing, and able to perform such transportation properly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-4\">(2) If the Board shall decide that mainland-Hawaii service can not be authorized because of international air transportation requirements, it will make its determination properly derived from and supported by facts either from the record already amassed or by such supplemental record as may be required to establish an adequate basis for the Board\u2019s conclusion and for review by this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">(3) In its compliance with any of the foregoing directives the Board is free to reopen the present record and to supplement the same to the extent necessary to establish an adequate basis for its ultimate conclusions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">(4) The Board will within 60 days submit its supplemental record to this court which meanwhile will retain jurisdiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">Remanded.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. 72 Stat. 738, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(21) (a) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. 72 Stat. 782, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">.

This determination was based principally on a finding that the two carriers operating on this route were overloaded. The finding of a need for the new service did not rely on the international Pacific routes authorized by the Board at the same time in another order.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">The proposed international routes were disapproved by the President. The Board-thereupon suspended Western\u2019s authorization. In 1968 the Board terminated the domestic proceeding concerning the California-Hawaii route, in effect denying Western\u2019s application. It seems to me that the reason given by the Board \u2014 that this route should not be treated separately from the international Pacific routes \u2014 - would be sufficient to justify its action if it were supported on the record. However, the Board\u2019s conclusion has no such support. Cf. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). There was no testimony setting forth the disadvantages that allocation of the domestic route at this time would cause when the international routes are considered. Thus, we cannot sustain the Commission\u2019s conclusion that these disadvantages outweigh the advantages to the public found in 1960 after full hearings to flow from the grant of authorization to Western. I concur in the remand for further findings on this matter. The Commission\u2019s Supplemental Opinion of November 8, 1963, stated its \u201cintention to undertake a reexamination of the transpacific route pattern at a suitable time in the near future.\u201d Perhaps this will be a suitable occasion to reconsider the whole issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
