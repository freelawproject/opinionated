National Labor Relations Board, 380 U.S. 300, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b376-18\">MURRAH, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AiA\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">Being of the view that the case is clearly distinguishable from the Ship Building case, and since the Board has taken the same position in the rehearing en banc, I can discern no good reason for remanding it for further consideration by the Board in the light of Ship Building. I would deny the Petition for Rehearing and enforce the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
