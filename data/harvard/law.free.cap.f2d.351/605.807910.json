(\u201cRywelle\u201d) appeals from an order of Judge Blumen-feld denying its petition to reclaim 726 shares of stock in the United Metal Cabinet Corporation (\u201cMetal\u201d) over the objection of Robert E. Cohn, Trustee in Bankruptcy (\u201cTrustee\u201d) of Trans-United Industries, Inc. (\u201cT-U\u201d). On December 30, 1960, while still solvent, T-U entered into an agreement with Samuel and Nathan Hammer to purchase from them 726 shares of Metal stock. In June 1962, T-U sought to obtain a $600,000 loan from Textile Banking Company (\u201cTextile\u201d), to which it had already mortgaged most of its assets to secure prior outstanding loans of approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>$5,000,000. Textile considered itself in an over-advanced position and obtained Rywelle\u2019s participation in 50 per cent of the loan. Rywelle deposited $300,000 with Textile and Textile advanced the $600,000 to T-U, released the old mortgages and accepted in exchange certain new collateral. Part of the new collateral was an October 31, 1962, \u201cassignment\u201d of T-U\u2019s rights in the contract to purchase the Metal stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In April 1963, T-U filed a Chapter X petition in Bankruptcy. The trustee, with the permission of the court, borrowed a further sum from Textile and paid the balance of the purchase price for the Metal stock to the Hammers. The stock certificate was not delivered to Textile prior to the bankruptcy because it was being held as collateral to secure payment of the full purchase price. The instrument embodying the October 1962 assignment was never recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On October 16, 1964, pursuant to a settlement of Rywelle\u2019s suit against it for an accounting and return of the $300,000 previously advanced, Textile assigned to Rywelle all its rights in the Metal stock. Rywelle then commenced this reclamation proceeding, claiming that it had superior rights in the stock to those of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> We agree with Judge Blumenfeld that Rywelle, stepping into the shoes of its assignor Textile, had rights in the stock subordinate to those of the trustee. Although the agreement of October 31, 1962, was labeled an \u201cassignment,\u201d by its very terms it created only a security interest, which was never perfected (as it could have been) by a transfer of possession or recording under New York Lien Law, \u00a7 230, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 33.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the trustee obtains all the rights of a hypothetical lien creditor on the date of bankruptcy (\u00a7 70, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110, sub. c), the unperfected security interest was subordinate to his interest in the stock. Sammet v. Mayer, 108 F.2d 337 (2d Cir. 1939). Finally, even if Textile purported to assign to Rywelle rights good as against the trustee, it could not effectively do so; an assignee gets no better rights than those of his assignor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. Paragraph 1 of the assignment read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">This assignment is made as security for the payment of any and all loans which have been or may hereafter be made by Banker [Textile] to United [T-U]. * * * Now if United shall well and truly pay its indebtedness to Banker, or its successors and assigns, then these presents may be voided upon United\u2019s written request.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-21\">. We find no basis for Rywelle\u2019s contention that Textile purported to transfer more than it had. Paragraph 2 of the stipulation of settlement provided that \u201cThe defendant [Textile] assigns to the plaintiff [Rywelle] all of its right, title and interest in and to certificate No. 6 for 726 shares of the capital stock of United Metal Cabinets Corporation, <em>subject particularly to the rights therein of the trustee in bankruptcy for Trans-Vnited Industries, Inc., if any. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
