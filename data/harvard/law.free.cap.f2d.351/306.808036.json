Certain aspects of his conviction after plea were considered upon appeal by the Kansas Supreme Court in State v. Daegele, 193 Kan. 314, 393 P.2d 978, and determined to be free from error or prejudice. His present application for a writ alleges that his plea of guilty \u201cwas coerced ; the result of negligence, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>spiracy, chicanery, and perjury * Although such a bald pleading unsupported by allegation of fact is legally insufficient, Martinez v. United States, 10 Cir., 344 F.2d 325, Stephens v. United States, 10 Cir., 246 F.2d 607, the trial court held that the conclusionary claim of a denial of a constitutional right must in any event be first presented to the Kansas courts pursuant to that state\u2019s post-conviction statutory remedies. Kan. Stat.Ann. 60-1507, 1964. Since the issue of whether appellant\u2019s plea was in fact voluntary was not considered by the Kansas Supreme Court on appeal, the judgment is manifestly correct. Bratt v. Crouse, 10 Cir. 346 F.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"A75\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
