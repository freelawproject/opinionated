Appellant had attempted to serve process upon appellee Swed Distributing Company, a dissolved Florida corporation, by delivering process to an officer of Swed Distributing Company. The order of the district court was based solely on the ground \u201cthat a dissolved corporation can only be served by serving its last named directors, as trustees for said dissolved corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">Attempting to respond to this order, appellant served process upon Swed Distributing Company by service upon Louis Swed, as director-trustee of said dissolved Florida corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">On January 21,1964, the district court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cbecause the said Swed Distributing Company is a dissolved corporation of Florida and is <em>not subject to suit </em>and service of process in the manner attempted by plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">On January 29, 1964, appellant filed a \u201cmotion for rehearing,\u201d and in the last paragraph thereof urged the court \u201cto add along with Swed Distributing Company, a dissolved Florida corporation, \u2018Louis Swed, B. C. Garnett and Mrs. Georgia E. Sullivan, as the last named directors and as trustees of Swed Distributing Company, a dissolved Florida Corporation\u2019 and directing that the cause thus proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Apparently this request to add additional parties was not called to the attention of the district court and was therefore not acted upon by the court when it considered appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing on February 12,1964. In its order of February 12, the district court granted appellant\u2019s motion \u201cto the extent of permitting additional argument on the issue ruled upon in the Court\u2019s order of January 21, 1964 * * The district court then affirmed its order of January 21, 1964, and on August 24, 1964 entered an Order for Final Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"> It appears to this Court that appellant is entitled to have its request to add additional parties considered as a motion to amend its pleadings so as to respond to the district court\u2019s order of January 21, 1964, and on the basis of the record before us we feel that it should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Therefore, it is ordered that the order of dismissal of January 21, 1964 and the Order for Final Judgment of August 24, 1964, be and the same are hereby vacated and the cause is hereby remanded to the district court for further proceedings in light of the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
