On January 12, 1959, appellant was indicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, Ohio, for the crime of sodomy as defined in \u00a7 2905.44 of the Revised Code of Ohio; he was arrested on March 26, 1959, and arraigned on March 30, 1959. His first claim is that he was denied \u201cdue process of law\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment by being deprived of an attorney at his arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">The transcript of the arraignment proceedings in this connection discloses the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you receive a copy of the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-25\">THE DEFENDANT: YES, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-26\">THE COURT: You have read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-27\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-28\">THE COURT: You understand it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-30\">THE DEFENDANT: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>THE COURT: Do you have counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">THE COURT: Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Dan Gen-nett from Canton, Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is your plea, guilty or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Hon- or, at this time I would like to continue this until my attorney is here. As yet he doesn\u2019t know of this preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">THE COURT: I will enter a technical plea of Not Guilty for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, may I use the telephone at the Sheriff\u2019s office to get a hold of my attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-14\">THE COURT: Mr. Vaughn, can something be worked out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-15\">MR. VAUGHN: Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">It appears most likely that appellant had not in fact retained an attorney as he represented to the State court at the time of arraignment; for only three days later the Presiding Judge, before whom appellant had been arraigned, entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-17\">\u201cTHIS DAY, to-wit: The 2nd day of April A.D., 1959, it appearing that the said defendant, BILL VITORA-TOS aka BILL VICTOR, is in indigent circumstances and unable to employ counsel, the court hereby apr points Attorney Bill Watson as counsel to defend him in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-18\">The case was set for trial on April 17, 1959, but on April 14th attorney Watson on behalf of appellant moved for a postponement of the trial, which motion was denied. Attorney Watson then, for reason not revealed by the record, moved for leave to withdraw as appellant\u2019s attorney. The Court granted the motion by the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-19\">\u201cOn this day, April 16, 1959, the Court hereby permits William Watson, Attorney of record, to withdraw from said case and appoints Robert Blakemore to represent the Defendant in said matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-23\">The trial date was postponed until April 21, 1959, at which time the record shows the following occurred, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-24\">\u201cMR. BLAKEMORE: Your Hon- or please, I was appointed by this Court to serve as counsel for the defendant, William Vitoratos. I was advised by Mr. Vitoratos yesterday afternoon he prefers that I not serve in this capacity at any time after this, and I would at this time like to ask the Court to allow me to withdraw as counsel for the defendant, William Vitoratos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-25\">THE COURT: Why does he not want you to represent him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-26\">MR. BLAKEMORE: Probably the defendant could tell you that better himself, your Honor, except I would say this: We do not see eye to eye probably on the handling of the defense in this entire ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-27\">THE COURT: I will hear from you, sir. What is your reason for wanting to discharge Mr. Blake-more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-28\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Hon- or, there is several factors in this case that we totally disagreed upon, and I don\u2019t want Mr. Blakemore handling my case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-29\">THE COURT: Whom do you wish to have handle your case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-30\">THE DEFENDANT: I would like to make one phone call to obtain money, or get to a telephone to get money here to hire my own personal attorney. I haven\u2019t been able to make a phone call through the Sheriff\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-31\">THE COURT: How about that, Mr. Lynch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-32\">DEPUTY LYNCH: He didn\u2019t request a phone of me, so I cannot answer that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-33\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: * * * Mr. Danesis came over as co-counsel for Mr. Blakemore as a favor. I didn\u2019t ask Danesis to make long dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tance calls, but I would like to make several calls, your Honor, to obtain money to hire my own personal attorney. Would you grant me that wish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">THE COURT: No, I am not going to grant you that wish because you have had ample opportunity, as I see it, to do that. You are entitled to be represented by counsel, and I want to see that you are represented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * in order to see that you had proper representation this Court ordered Mr. Blake-more to defend you, Mr. Blakemore having had considerable experience in the trial of criminal cases both from the prosecution standpoint and on behalf of the defendant, and I know of no one who could represent you more adequately than Mr. Blake-more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">Now, he is a lawyer and you are not, and I would certainly recommend that you follow his advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, your Honor, I am entitled to counsel and I will not have Mr. Blakemore as my counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">THE COURT: Well then, you may, if that is what you wish, the Court will let you represent yourself, because I appointed what I have considered to be highly eminent counsel for a criminal case. Now, that\u2019s up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">THE DEFENDANT: I cannot represent myself, as you well know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">THE COURT: Then the Court will order Mr. Blakemore to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, I do not want Mr. Blakemore to represent me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">THE COURT: Doesn\u2019t make any difference what you want. It is my job to see that you are represented, and I am going to have Mr. Blake-more represent you, so we will go forward as soon as we get the jury up here at 1:15, and Mr. Blake-more will represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-14\">THE DEFENDANT: That I will not hold still for, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-15\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t care what you will hold still for. I am telling you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-16\">THE DEFENDANT: I just don\u2019t want Mr. Blakemore to represent me. That is simple, and it is my privilege not to have him represent me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">Thereafter the case proceeded to jury trial with attorney Blakemore representing appellant. The trial was concluded two days later, on April 23rd, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">The record further shows that the State court \u201cthereupon ordered the defendant to Lima State Hospital at Lima, Ohio, for mental examination not to exceed sixty (60) days\u201d. Such examination was required by law, once appellant had been convicted of violation of \u00a7 2905.44 of the Ohio Revised Code. [\u00a7 2947.25, Ohio Revised Code.]</p>\n<p id=\"b288-19\">On April 27, 1959, the trial court entered an order permitting attorney Blake-more to withdraw from the case. The record next shows that on June 15,-1959, the appellant \u201cbeing in Court and accompanied by counsel\u201d, the Court held a \u201chearing on the report from Lima State Hospital\u201d and found that appellant was \u201cnot mentally ill, mentally deficient, nor a psychopathic offender\u201d. The Court next \u201cconsidered a motion for a new trial and said motion was duly overruled\u201d. Then \u201cthe Court * * * inquired of said Defendant if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him and Defendant showing no good and sufficient reason\u201d, the Court sentenced appellant to an indeterminate term of \u201cnot less than the minimum of ONE (1) year and not more than the maximum of TWENTY (20) years, as provided by Section 2905.44 of the Revised Code of Ohio, for punishment of the crime of sodomy. * * * \u201d Since probation was not available to appellant [\u00a7 2951.04, Ohio Revised Code], that was the only sentence which could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>imposed under Ohio law [\u00a7 5145.01, Ohio Revised Code].</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Appellant appealed the judgment of conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeals of Summit County, Ohio, where the judgment was affirmed on January 14, 1960. [Case No. 4934, unreported.] On October 13, 1960, the Ohio Supreme Court denied appellant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal to that Court [Case No. 36,-565, unreported]; and the United States Supreme Court thereafter denied his petition for a writ of certiorari [Vitoratos, alias Victor v. State of Ohio, 366 U.S. 920, 81 S.Ct. 1097, 6 L.Ed.2d 242 (1961)].</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">More than two years later, on August 12, 1963, appellant\u2019s petition for The Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed in the District Court. Henry Clay Scott, Esq., was appointed as appellant\u2019s attorney and has represented him, proceeding in forma pauperis, in the District Court and upon the argument of this appeal, although it appears that the \u201cBrief of Appellant\u201d, filed with the Clerk of this Court on August 6, 1964, was \u201cin Pro Per\u201d, as was the \u201cSupplemental Brief of Appellant\u201d, filed October 23, 1964, and the \u201cReply Brief of Appellant\u201d, filed December 8, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant\u2019s primary contentions as to claimed denial by the Ohio courts of his Fourteenth-Amendment rights are found in the various briefs filed by him \u201cPro Per\u201d, and by his attorney in his behalf, and in the transcript of the habeas corpus hearing in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">As stated above, the first claimed denial of \u201cdue process of law\u201d is alleged to have occurred at his arraignment in the Court of Common Pleas, where a plea of not guilty was ordered entered on behalf of appellant while he stood at the bar without counsel. Appellant contends that, because he was not represented by an attorney at his arraignment, he lost many valuable rights required to be asserted prior to entry of plea. [See \u00a7\u00a7 2941.59, 2943.03, Ohio Revised Code.] But there is no allegation that he has ever attempted to exercise any of these rights, nor is there any allegation in his petition or elsewhere that any of such rights would have been appropriate or available in his case had they not been allegedly \u201cwaived\u201d by entry of the not-guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Moreover, as the Supreme Court of Ohio has observed with respect to failure to appoint counsel prior to entry of a not-guilty plea, arraignment in Ohio is not always a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial process. [Dean v. Maxwell, 174 Ohio St. 193, 187 N.E.2d 884 (1963); accord, Everhart v. Maxwell, 175 Ohio St. 514, 196 N.E.2d 589 (1964).] This is equally true when gauged in light of the Sixth-Amendment right to counsel asserted here. [McGill v. United States, 348 F.2d 791 (D.C.Cir. 1965); cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).]</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">In Ohio, as contrasted with some other states [see: Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961); White v. State of Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed 2d 193 (1963)], an accused may change his plea \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d at any time prior to commencement of trial [\u00a7 2943.03, Ohio Revised Code], and denial of a motion to change plea following appointment of counsel \u201cwould constitute such good cause that a subsequent refusal by the trial court to permit a change of plea would constitute an abuse of discretion\u201d reviewable as such [Dean v. Maxwell, supra, 174 Ohio St. at 196, 187 N.E.2d at 886]. As explained in Dean v. Maxwell, supra, \u201cwhere an indigent accused pleads to an indictment without the benefit of counsel, the subsequent appointment of counsel to act on his behalf places the accused, for practical legal purposes in the same position he was in prior to his arraignment.\u201d [174 Ohio St. at 196, 187 N.E.2d at 887.]</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">But even if it be assumed that the arraignment was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of this non-capital case [cf. Hamilton v. State of Alabama, supra, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157], appellant did not plead guilty [cf. White v. State of Maryland, supra, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050; Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948)]. Neither is it contended that any incriminating statements were elicited in the absence of counsel [cf. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964); Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964); Crooker v. State of California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448 (1958); Cicenia v. La Gay, 357 U.S. 504, 78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523 (1958)], nor that appellant was put to trial without counsel [cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792],</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We may therefore borrow the words of Chief Judge Murrah in Johnson v. United States, 333 F.2d 371 (10th Cir. 1964), involving the Sixth-Amendment right to assistance of counsel at arraignment in the Federal Courts, to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cWe think * * * the trial Court adequately protected the right of appellant to the assistance of counsel when it directed the entry of a plea of not guilty. No statement was made against the accused. He made no incriminating statement whatsoever, and was not called upon to waive assistance of counsel or any other constitutional right. He cannot, therefore, complain of the deprivation of any constitutional right at this [arraignment] stage of the proceedings.\u201d [333 F.2d at 373.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">[See also Black v. United States, 348 F.2d 159 .(9th Cir. 1965).]</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In Crooker v. State of California, supra, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, Mr. Justice Clark announced for the Court the common-sense rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">\u201c[S]tate refusal of a request to engage counsel violates due process * * * if the accused is deprived of counsel * * * for any part of the pretrial proceedings, provided that he is so prejudiced thereby as to infect his subsequent trial with an absence of \u2018that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.\u2019 * * * The latter determination necessarily depends upon all the circumstances of the case.\u201d [357 U.S. at 439-440, 78 S.Ct. at 1292.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Assuming that the authority of Crook-er v. State of California, insofar as it involves a confession made without benefit of prisoner-requested counsel, has been \u201cweakened by the subsequent decisions\u201d [Escobedo v. State of Illinois, supra, 378 U.S. at 492, n. 15, 84 S.Ct. at 1766], there is no reason to suppose that the above-quoted rule has been replaced by what would of necessity be a hyper-technical alternative. Especially so, since the quoted rule is in keeping with the spirit of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which directs that: \u201cAny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d Appellant\u2019s next claim \u2014 lack of effective assistance of counsel \u2014 must be considered against the background of the actual circumstances at trial. The record before us is far from one which presents a picture of an accused who is bewildered, untutored and uninformed as to judicial proceedings. One cannot review what took place in the Court of Common Pleas prior to trial without being impressed that appellant showed himself to be uncommonly wise in the ways of the criminal courts and, from the beginning, was a rather impudent defendant, bent upon delaying trial-court proceedings by any and every means he could conjure up, even to the verge of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">As the Court observed in Powell v. State of Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">\u201cIt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d [287 U.S. at 53, 53 S.Ct. at 58; accord, Crooker v. State of California, supra, 357 U.S. at 439, 78 S.Ct. 1287.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">Such \u201cfair opportunity\u201d was, however, afforded appellant here. At the close of his arraignment on March 30th, the Presiding Judge arranged for appellant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>be permitted to telephone his alleged Canton, Ohio, attorney. Only three days later the Court, finding that appellant was \u201cin indigent circumstances and unable to employ counsel\u201d, appointed counsel for him. On April 16th, a second attorney was appointed to represent him. It was not unreasonable then for the trial court, on April 21st, to deny appellant still further opportunity to attempt to raise money with which to retain some other counsel more preferable to him, especially when every indication was that appellant was determined to be dissatisfied so long as this stratagem would serve to delay the trial. [See Mc-Gill v. United States, supra, 348 F.2d 791; cf. United States v. Plattner, 330 F.2d 271 (2nd Cir. 1964).]</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Of course \u201crepresentation in the role of an advocate is required\u201d [Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S.Ct. 974, 975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1958)], but there is nothing in the record to suggest that attorney Blakemore was anything less throughout the trial. Appellant makes no charge that he had a defense which was not presented. [Cf. Brubaker v. Dickson, 310 F.2d 30, 32 (9th Cir. 1962).] Nor does he assert that attorney Blakemore was not experienced in the trial of criminal cases. To the contrary, appellant intimates that his court-appointed attorney was perhaps too experienced to permit appellant to dictate the conduct of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Of especial significance here is the admonition that: \u201cWe must guard against the magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting.\u201d [Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 83, 62 S.Ct. 457, 471, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).]</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In his briefs, but not in his petition, appellant asserts that he was without counsel at the time of sentencing. However, the record before us recites that appellant was \u201caccompanied by counsel\u201d, and that a motion for a new trial was presented and overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has declared that \u201cthe absence of counsel at the time of sentencing is not reversible error unless the accused was prejudiced thereby.\u201d [Thomas v. Maxwell, 175 Ohio St. 233, 235, 193 N.E.2d 150, 152 (1963).] This would appear to be the Federal standard as well, when Sixth-Amendment rights to counsel at the time of sentencing are involved; at least in non-capital cases where prejudice to substantial rights is not presumed. [See: Crooker v. State of California, supra, 357 U.S. at 439-440, 78 S.Ct. 1287; Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792; Hamilton v. State of Alabama, supra, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157.]</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">We have been unable to discern any possible prejudice to any \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of appellant [Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a)], assuming that he did stand at the bar without counsel at the time of sentencing. Convicted as he was of the crime of sodomy, the Ohio court was forbidden to grant him probation. [\u00a7 2951.04, Ohio Revised Code.] The Ohio legislature had specified that a minimum term of one-year\u2019s imprisonment was mandatory. Moreover, its further mandate required that \u201cCourts imposing sentences to the penitentiary for felonies * * * shall make such sentences general and not fixed or limited in their duration\u201d. [\u00a7 5145.01, Ohio Revised Code.] Under these circumstances \u2014 with these legislative fetters upon the trial judge\u2014 it is not overstatement to say that appellant\u2019s sentencing was little more than a ministerial ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">We are convinced that appellant was fairly tried and fairly convicted, and that any \u201cerror, defect, irregularity or variance\u201d, which resulted in possible denial by the Ohio courts of some Federal constitutional right, in no way affected any of appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d, and hence \u201cshall be disregarded\u201d in keeping with the mandate of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
