She had made an \u201capproved lease,\u201d dated April 1, 1955 with appellee Emmons, but Emmons had made an unapproved assignment to Andreas Corporation, and an unapproved \u201cside agreement\u201d dated October 31, 1956, with Mc-Glamary agreeing to a fifty year extension of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The statute pertinent to this transaction provided that any conveyance of the Indian lands, \u201cor any contract touching the same\u201d during the trust period, \u201cshall be absolutely null and void.\u201d Act of January 12, 1891; 26 Stat. 712 \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">The trial court found the side agreement \u201ctouched the land,\u201d and was void as against the United States; but specifically refused to make any ruling \u201cconcerning the validity of the side agreement as between McGlamary and defendants,\u201d inasmuch as McGlamary was not a party to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">The government protests that the side agreement must be found void for all purposes \u2014 that McGlamary was not a necessary party, as the government acts for the allottee in prosecuting the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">The government in this type of suit acts in its capacity as guardian on behalf of the Indians involved. It has no pecuniary interest to protect for itself, and needs none. Despite the fact title is in the Indian allottee, \u201cIt was not necessary to make these grantors parties, for the government was in court on their behalf. Their presence as parties could not add to, or detract from, the effect of the proceedings to determine the violation of the restrictions and the consequent invalidity of the conveyances.\u201d Individual Indians could not compromise the suit, nor dismiss it, nor estop the United States; \u201cnor could they assume any attitude with respect to their interest which would derogate from its complete representation by the United States.\u201d Heckman v. United States, 224 U.S. 413, 445, 32 S.Ct. 424, 56 L.Ed. 820 (1912). \u201cThe decree binds not only the United States but the Indian whom it represents in the litigation.\u201d (idem, p. 446, 32 S.Ct. p. 434) Thus, \u201cthe grantees are in no danger of double litigation.\u201d (idem, p. 445, 32 S.Ct. p. 434)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">The provisions of the statute makes a holding of absolute nullity mandatory. As the government\u2019s brief states, there was no option in the district court not to adjudicate all rights submitted to it. It should have. United States v. Langendorf, 322 F.2d 25 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">We note on this appeal the government did not urge a reversal of that portion of the judgment holding the United States could not recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">The matter is remanded for entry of a judgment adjudging the \u201cside agreement\u201d null and void for all purposes.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
