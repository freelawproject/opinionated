The sole specification of error is that the district court allegedly failed to instruct the jury that the defendant must have <em>known </em>that the substance with which he was engaged in the proscribed conduct was a narcotic. We have reviewed the conduct of the trial by the district court, and we find that the jury was in no way misled as to the essential elements of the offense charged, and that the jury was instructed that appellant must have knowingly dealt in narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-22\">The statutory provision in question reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-23\">\u201cWhoever * * * knowingly * * * receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of any such narcotic drug after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law * * * shall be imprisoned * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-26\">\u201cWhenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The record unambiguously demonstrates that the .trial court impressed the jury with the fact that the receipt, concealment, purchase, sale, or facilitation of transportation of the narcotic specified in the indictment must have been performed \u201cknowingly.\u201d Appellant admits this fact, but contends that the trial judge must also instruct the jury that the defendant must have known that the substance which he knowingly received, concealed, etc., was in fact a narcotic drug. We find he did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We cannot understand how it would be possible for one who \u201cknowingly conceals a narcotic drug\u201d to do so without knowing the substance <em>is </em>a narcotic drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Our reading of the colloquy between counsel and the court, and the subsequent instructions given to the jury convinces us that no doubt existed or could exist in the mind of any juror that the requirement of a \u201cknowing\u201d act on the defendant\u2019s part included within it that the defendant have known that the illegal substance was a narcotic drug. No evidence that the jury was led to believe or could believe anything to the contrary has been presented by appellant. In fact, at the time of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, appellant\u2019s then counsel expressly acknowledged that the court\u2019s expression of the elements of the crime, and particularly the nature of the knowledge required by the defendant, was satisfactory. (R.T. 123.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-21\">Appellant further urges that the presumption contained in the latter part of \u00a7 174, although previously constitutionally upheld, on many occasions, can only be used \u201cto fill the gap of legal proof that would otherwise be required to show the defendant had knowledge of illegal importation.\u201d We disagree. The presumption goes further. By the statute\u2019s terms, upon proof of \u201cpossession of the narcotic drug,\u201d the defendant is required to explain \u201chis possession of the narcotic drug to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d \u201cPossession of such drug\u201d is \u201csufficient to authorize conviction,\u201d unless explained. Thus to interpret the statute as creating only the presumption that there was illegal importation of an object would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>render the presumption largely ineffective and meaningless. The rebuttable presumption comes into play upon proof of possession of that which is later proved to be a narcotic drug. Its application is not prohibited because of the prosecution\u2019s ordinary inability to establish affirmatively that the possessor was subjectively knowledgeable as to the nature of the possessed substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">. \u201cMr. Enstrom: When your Honor read the statute I didn\u2019t hear you use the word \u2018knowingly.\u2019 <em>Of course, you have referred to it several times since. </em>I just wanted to call that to your Honor\u2019s attention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201cThe Court: Any other objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201cMr. Tatus: No, I have no objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">(Whereupon the proceedings resumed before the jury as follows):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">\u201cThe Court: Counsel calls to my attention that when I read the statute I may have omitted the word \u2018knowingly.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">Section 174, the part with which we are concerned, reads: \u2018Whoever <em>knowingly * * </em>* receives, conceals, * * * or in any manner facilitates the transportation or concealment * * * of any sueh narcotic drug after having been imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been Imported or brought into the United States contrary to law * * * \u2019 shall be guilty of an offense. But I think I mentioned the word \u2018knowingly\u2019 at various other times in my instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-17\">\u201cIs that satisfactory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-18\">\u201cMr. Tatus: <em>Yes, your Honor.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-19\">(R.T. 123, emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"A6l\">The jury was instructed that knowledge was an essential element of the crime. The jury was also instructed that proof of specific intent was essential for conviction, and that specific intent requires that the act in question be done \u201cknowingly.\u201d The jury was instructed that \u201cno man should be convicted of a felony unless he has a sense of wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-23\">It should be noted that the court gave a standard instruction defining the essential elements of the crime (R.T. 111; 27 F.R.D. 166-167, Instruction 24.05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-25\">In addition, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-26\">\u201cIf you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant <em>knowingly </em>received, concealed, facilitated the transportation of the substance, and that it was heroin, then of course, if it was done <em>knowingly, </em>obviously he had a specific intent, he had a guilty mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-27\"># * # * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-28\">\u201cThe purpose of adding the word <em>\u2018knowingly\u2019 </em>was to assure that no one would be convicted for an act done because of mistake, inadvertence or other innocent reason.\u201d (R.T. 117-118, emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
