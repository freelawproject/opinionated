As he states: \u201cThe Clerks assured petitioner that all submissions would be \u2018OK\u2019d\u2019 and that there would be no aftermath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-26\">There was.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-27\">On January 19,1962, the Commissioner sent a notice of deficiency for those years, by certified mail to the last known address of petitioner \u2014 Box 1305, Los Angeles, California. Petitioner does not dispute this was his correct address. In fact, he claims its rent as a business expense ; states he has maintained it since 1942 to the present; and describes it as the \u201cone unquestionable address\u201d for him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Nor does petitioner deny he received the deficiency notice, nor even that the receipt was untimely. He apparently insists that because of the \u201ccounter clerk\u2019s\u201d previous \u201capproval\u201d of his returns, and the fact he \u201chad no access to competent help,\u201d the laws Congress has passed should not be applicable to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The ninety-day period for filing his petition to review the alleged deficiency expired April 19, 1962.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 17, 1964, taxpayer filed with the Tax Court of the United States a \u201cPLEA FOR ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC AND FOR RETURN OF TAXES COLLECTED IN ERROR.\u201d The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss. After hearing petitioner\u2019s objections, the Tax Court dismissed petitioner\u2019s \u201cPlea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> The only question properly before this court is whether the Tax Court correctly dismissed taxpayer\u2019s petition upon the ground it was untimely filed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">\u201cThe requirement of filing the petition with the Tax Court within 90 days after the certified or registered notice of deficiency is mailed to the correct address of the taxpayer is jurisdictional. (Lasky v. Commissioner, 235 F.2d 97 (9th Cir. 1956), aff\u2019d. 352 U.S. 1027 [77 S.Ct. 594, 1 L.Ed.2d 598 (1957)]; Bloch v. Commissioner, 254 F.2d 277 (9th Cir. 1958); Jorgensen v. Commissioner, 246 F.2d 536 (9th Cir. 1957); DiProspero v. Commissioner, 176 F.2d 76 (9th Cir. 1949)), and no matter how allegedly inequitable the situation, there is no authority \u2018to relieve the taxpayer from the clear jurisdictional requirements of the law\u2019 (Rich v. Commissioner, 250 F.2d 170, 173 (5th Cir. 1957)). The petition here was not filed within the prescribed statutory period; thus the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Brief, p. 9.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">The determination of the Tax Court is correct and its order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-16\">. Jurisdiction in the Tax Court rested upon 26 U.S.C. Chapter 76, Subchapter B, \u00a7 7422(e). Jurisdiction here rests upon 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7482 (Int.Rev.Code of 1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\">. Petitioner urges that the government had in some way estopped itself from collecting from him because he was willing to permit subsequent refunds to be credited against his deficiency, and he actually sent in $25.00 to show his good faith. And on appeal he seeks to establish the merit of certain claimed deductions for the first time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A-Y\">. 26 U.S.C. 1958 ed. \u00a7 6212 and \u00a7 6213.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
