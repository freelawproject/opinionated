The District Court made findings of fact that the barge was placed in appellant\u2019s custody and control, in an undamaged condition, pursuant to a contract with appellee\u2019s agents. It further found that the barge sustained damage when it broke away from appellant\u2019s fleet in the St. Louis harbor. Concluding that a bailment existed, the court held that appellant failed to overcome the presumption of negligence on its part. Although appellant introduced no evidence at the trial, it now contends that the proof is insufficient to sustain the findings and conclusions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">Appellant makes a number of arguments, but its principal contention is that it was not a bailee. It asserts there was no evidence of a contract between it and appellee and that the barge was not in its exclusive possession, care, and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">The Sparks-Waters-Farnen Company handled appellee\u2019s barges in the St. Louis area. The evidence, (1) an invoice from appellant to the Sparks Company in which the latter is billed for fleeting the barge, (2) answers to interrogatories by the President of appellant in which he admitted billing for services to the barge in December, 1960, and (3) a letter to ap-pellee from appellant\u2019s counsel in which he states that the barge was \u201ctied up\u201d in appellant\u2019s fleet, demonstrates that there was a contract of bailment and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>barge was in the care, custody, and control of appellant when it broke loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The record lends some support to appellant\u2019s contention that the barge was not free from damage when delivered to the fleet. Mr. William McCune, a member of the crew which surveyed the barge, testified that he noted both \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d damage. Nonetheless, the court's finding that the barge was delivered in an. undamaged condition can be construed to refer to the absence of any recent damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Appellant makes a number of other arguments which need not be discussed. We have studied the testimony and exhibits in this case and find no basis for setting aside the court\u2019s findings of fact. The challenged findings are not clearly erroneous, and they give adequate support to the conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
