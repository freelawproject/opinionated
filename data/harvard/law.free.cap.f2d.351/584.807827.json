The order directed an employee\u2019s reinstatement with back pay. It was based upon a finding that the company had discharged Donald Tinsley for engaging in protected activity in violation of section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act. The principal question is the correctness of the Board\u2019s determination of the motive for the discharge. The Board\u2019s decision is reported at 148 N. L. R. B. No. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-26\">Tinsley was a \u201cgrievance committeeman\u201d for the union,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whose function it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was to assist other employees in the presentation of their grievances to the company. On September 20, 1963, employee George Bloom informed Tinsley that his timecard had been improperly altered by a company foreman in such a way as to deprive him of twenty minutes\u2019 pay. Tinsley, Bloom, and another grievance committeeman, Bob Gordon, confronted company superintendent George Russell with this problem in the latter\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In the ensuing discussion, Russell questioned the accuracy of Bloom\u2019s charges and deprecated his overall work record. Tinsley, who took an active part in the conference, defended the employee and sought to limit the exchange to the time-card matter. During the course of this investigation, Russell\u2019s temper began to flare. On several occasions, in progressively louder tones and climaxed by an obscene epithet, he objected to committeeman Tinsley\u2019s participation. The obscenity finally convinced Tinsley that Russell\u2019s attitude precluded any relief at that level and, so affirming, he proposed to end the meeting. As the employees were leaving the office, Russell overheard Tinsley mumbling something to Gordon. Distinguishing the words \u201cthe horse\u2019s ass,\u201d Russell diagnosed that they had been directed at him, hastened after Tins-ley, and summarily discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The union subsequently filed a grievance with respect to Tinsley\u2019s discharge, which proceeded through several stages of the contractual grievance procedure but which was finally abandoned when Tinsley filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The trial examiner, after reviewing the evidence, concluded that \u201cTinsley was in fact engaging in an activity protected by the statute while he was discussing the grievance with Russell, and Tinsley\u2019s comment on leaving the office was so directly related to the grievance meeting as to be, in effect, a part thereof.\u201d The Board agreed with the examiner, then added a conclusion of its own:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">We do not believe, on the basis of the entire record, that Tinsley was terminated solely because he used the derogatory term. Rather, we are satisfied that Russell\u2019s rising anger was directed to Tinsley throughout the grievance discussion because of Tinsley\u2019s participation in and conduct of the grievance meeting. The final explosion which resulted in Tinsley\u2019s discharge was the culmination and product of the grievance discussion, rather than the result of Tinsley\u2019s comment. As such it was part and parcel of Russell\u2019s anger at Tinsley for his vigorous participation in the grievance proceeding. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that Tinsley was in fact discharged because he participated in the presentation of the grievance, clearly a protected activity and that it was violative of Section 8(a) (3) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">We are convinced that when the entire record is considered there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Tinsley\u2019s discharge was the result of his having presented a grievance to the management.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">There is no doubt about Russell\u2019s resentment of Tinsley\u2019s vigorous presentation of Bloom\u2019s grievance. His mounting anger culminated in his saying to Tinsley, using an obscene word, \u201cshut your..... mouth.\u201d During the entire episode Tins-ley remained calm and endeavored to keep the discussion focused on the grievance despite Russell\u2019s efforts to argue about extraneous matters. After it became obvious that the superintendent had lost control of himself, Tinsley said that the grievance would have to be presented at a higher level. He and Gordon started to leave Russell\u2019s office. It was then that Tinsley uttered to Gordon the uncomplimentary remark about Russell. It is within this factual context that we must view the action of Russell in discharging Tinsley.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">Respondent argues that Tinsley\u2019s remark must be separated from what led up to it; however, the remark cannot be considered in a vacuum. Respondent also argues that Russell\u2019s testimony that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>discharged Tinsley solely because of the remark should be conclusive. But a contrary inference is warranted. Tinsley's derogatory remark undoubtedly triggered his discharge; however, Russell\u2019s extreme displeasure of Tinsley\u2019s participation in the grievance was clearly evident. Therefore, we think the evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Tinsley\u2019s remark furnished the excuse rather than the reason for Russell\u2019s retaliatory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">As other cases have made clear, flagrant conduct of an employee, even though occurring in the course of section 7 activity, may justify disciplinary action by the employer. On the other hand, not every impropriety committed during such activity places the employee beyond the protective shield of the act. The employee\u2019s right to engage in concerted activity may permit some leeway for impulsive behavior, which must be balanced against the employer\u2019s right to maintain order and respect. N. L. R. B. v. Illinois Tool Works, 153 F.2d 811 (7th Cir. 1946). Initially, the responsibility to draw the line between these conflicting rights rests with the Board, and its determination, unless illogical or arbitrary, ought not be disturbed. In the instant case we cannot say that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Tinsley\u2019s remark was within the protection of section 7 was either unreasonable or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">A second issue is raised by respondent\u2019s contention that the Board should have withheld its processes because the charging party, Tinsley, through his union had invoked and then abandoned the grievance procedures provided in the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the company. It is true that on occasion the Board has deferred action where the charging party has not resorted to available grievance procedures. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 137 N.L.R.B. 418 (1962); Hercules Motor Corp., 136 N.L.R.B. 1648 (1962). Section 10(a) of the act, however, provides: \u201cThe Board is empowered * * to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice * * * . This power shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, law, or otherwise:\u201d In those cases where the facts create both an arbitrable dispute and a possible unfair labor practice, the Board has discretion to issue a complaint or to defer action until an arbitration has been completed. \u201cThe superior authority of the Board may be invoked at any time.\u201d Carey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 375 U.S. 261, 272, 84 S.Ct. 401, 409, 11 L.Ed.2d 320 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-28\">.
