Appellants concede that a factual issue respecting the alleged discharge of the appellants must be resolved in their favor before the trial court had jurisdiction over the cause. They also concede that there was a further jurisdictional factual question relating to the alleged discrimination based on race. These factual determinations, having been made by the trial court, and being supported by substantial evidence on the record, cannot be set aside by us as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
