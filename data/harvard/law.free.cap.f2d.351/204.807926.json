That award was modified by order filed March 27, 1964, when the Deputy Commissioner determined not only that the disability rating should be reduced to 15 per cent but that the modified award be made retroactive to June 1, 1962. In review proceedings the District Court entered summary judgment for the Deputy Commissioner and for the intervenors, the appellant\u2019s former employer, Antonio Troiano Tile &amp; Marble Co., Inc. and that latter\u2019s insurance carrier, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Appellant charges error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to set aside the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s modification order as \u201cnot in accordance with the law and * * * not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">Section 922 of the Act authorizes a \u201cnew compensation order\u201d \u201con the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner.\u201d The Deputy Commissioner here had not purported to rest upon \u201cmistake\u201d grounds. There was no indication, by findings or otherwise, of the respect in which the August 20, 1962 order could have been the result of a \u201cmistake in a determination.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s 1964 award was based upon the finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">\u201c3. That the claimant\u2019s condition has improved; that since June 1, 1962, the claimant has worked as a gardener where he kneels <footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> down to pull up weeds, he sweeps walks and and tends the walks where flowers grow and often trims the rose bushes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-19\">Thereupon, although finding further that the claimant\u2019s \u201cpartial disability is permanent,\u201d the Deputy Commissioner determined in respect of the claimant\u2019s wage-earning capacity, that \u201che is entitled\u201d only to $8.10 per week compensation \u201cbased on a 15 per cent permanent partial disability.\u201d Since the initial order had been based upon a 50 per cent disability pursuant to which $8,262 had been paid, the immediate effect of the 1964 modified award was a reduction of weekly payments from $27 to $8.10. Since the \u201cnew\u201d order was made retroactive to June 1, 1962, the- result was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that an overpayment of $1,633.50 was deemed to have occurred. Thus not until February 8, 1968, when withheld amounts would absorb the overpayment, would the claimant begin to receive $8.10 per week as compensation for his permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The findings in the original award, set forth pursuant to stipulation, disclosed that this claimant on March 31, 1960, was employed as a tile setter, earning $81 per week, and that while lifting a bag of cement, he suffered a trauma to his back, rupturing a disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Surgery was required for the removal of the disc after which a right inguinal hernia developed. The claimant was totally disabled from April 1, 1960, to March 29, 1962. Since March 30, 1962, the original award recited, \u201cthe claimant has suffered a 50 per cent partial disability * * * which disability is continuing and is now permanent.\u201d Such was the predicate for the August 20, 1962 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">At the modification hearing the Deputy Commissioner ruled: \u201cThat order is completely final. Let\u2019s have no evidence about anything which occurred prior to August 20, 1962.\u201d When the claimant\u2019s attorney sought to establish the type of work the claimant performed \u201cbefore he got hurt and the type of work he can do and is doing now,\u201d an objection by counsel for the insurance carrier was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">At the same hearing, the representative of the claimant\u2019s present employer testified that the claimant for two years had been doing \u201cvery light work, garden work, watering, cleaning up, planting flowers, bulbs, and that.\u201d He did \u201cnothing heavy, lifting or anything like that.\u201d Practically every week the claimant had a half day off to attend an outpatient clinic. The witness had noticed no change in the claimant\u2019s condition during such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The medical experts differed in their evaluation of the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability, both at the time of the original award and as a result of their subsequent observations. Dr. Masterson thought that the claimant\u2019s disability throughout was 50 per cent. Dr. Horwitz testified \u201cI believe he can work,\u201d adding \u201cI do not think his permanent disability exceeds for the body as a whole 15 per cent.\u201d He saw \u201cno change of this man\u2019s condition,\u201d and his disability was the \u201cresult of his low back injury for which the award was made.\u201d He noted that the patient was wearing a brace or low back support every time the doctor saw him.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">In short, there was no evidence whatever that this claimant could, in 1963 or 1964, do more or less light work than he had been doing in July and August, 1962. That he had been so engaged when the original award was entered is beyond dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Further, there was no evidence whatever that in 1963 or 1964 there had been any \u201cchange in conditions\u201d within the meaning of section 922 of the Act in comparison with \u201cconditions,\u201d whatever they were, in August, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">Finally, the 15 per cent disability \u201cfor the body as a whole,\u201d which Dr. Horwitz estimated as of October 30, 1963, was \u201cas stated in previous reports.\u201d Dr. Masterson, for his part, had found permanent disability in August, 1961. \u201cAt that time I rated him as having a 50 per cent permanent partial disability and my note of November 13th 1963 stated that the disability rating still stood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">Because of the argument advanced by the Deputy Commissioner that his findings are presumed to be correct, we have gone into some detail beyond what is ordinarily- necessary. Great deference is usually accorded to those findings, to be sure, but they certainly are not controlling unless supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here the substantial evidence demonstrates in light of the various criteria suggested to us that there had been <em>no </em>\u201cchange in conditions\u201d; in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>deed, it has expressly been found that the claimant has a permanent partial disability. Clearly the modified award may not be sustained on the record evidence respecting the \u201cchange in conditions\u201d ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner is now saying in effect: Had it not been stipulated in 1962 that the claimant was 50 per cent permanently disabled, and if evidence then had been taken which established to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s satisfaction that the degree of disability was 15 per cent, not 50 per cent, the award in 1962 would have been as it now has been modified to read. That is the award which now should govern, according to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"> Any such position is fallacious on two grounds. First, we must review the order before us in terms of the grounds upon which the Deputy Commissioner actually relied,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cchange of conditions.\u201d There was no evidence of any such \u201cchange,\u201d and \u201cmistake\u201d was not the predicate for the contested order. Second, the fact that a wealthy employer pays this claimant $80 per week for light work as a gardener is irrelevant to establish a \u201cchange of conditions\u201d within the meaning of section 922 of the Act. It had been stipulated that the claimant was 50 per cent disabled even though when the first award was entered, he was employed at the same work as he was at the time of the hearing, November 22, 1963. Again, section 922 accords no different status to an award evolved by agreement<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> than to one determined after hearing. \u201cMistake\u201d or \u201cchange in conditions\u201d are still the predicates for the entry of a \u201cnew compensation order\u201d; Congress has spelled out no other grounds. Yet the Deputy Commissioner \u2014if he intended to rely upon the \u201cmistake in determination\u201d ground \u2014 has failed to meet the requirements of a showing as to how he originally had made that \u201cmistake.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed so that the case may be remanded to the Deputy Commissioner with directions to reinstate the 1962 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Reversed with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-15\">.
