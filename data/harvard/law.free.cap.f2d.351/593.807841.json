The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 148 NLRB 1560. On the facts found by the trial examiner he concluded that respondent, Local 25, I.B.E.W., AFL-CIO, had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">\u201cBy inducing and encouraging employees of various secondary employers performing services at the Shop Rite store of the Supermarket Operating Company in the Mid-Island Shopping Center at Hicksville, Long Island, New York, to engage in a strike or refusal in the course of their employment to perform such services, and by threatening, coercing, or restraining Supermarket Operating Company and such other persons with the object of forcing and requiring them to cease doing business with Alexander M. Cutrone, d/b/a A. C. Electric. * * * \u201d 148 NLRB 1560 at 1579.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">The Board, on review, adopted these findings and conclusions of the trial examiner, \u201cthat by picketing Supermarket\u2019s store and by threatening to picket and otherwise coercing Supermarket\u2019s director of store planning, the Respondent violated Section 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (B) of the Act.\u201d It issued the appropriate cease and desist order now sought to be enforced. 148 NLRB 1560 at 1566.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">The Respondent Union maintains that the activity found by the Board to be vio-lative of the secondary boycott provision of the Act was informational picketing and therefore lawful union conduct, and that there is no substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support any other interpretation of the union\u2019s acts. It also claims there was absolutely no credible evidence introduced before the trial examiner that the union induced or encouraged any employee of any one to engage in any work stoppage.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">An examination of the record belies these claims. We find no merit in them. Nor is there merit in the objections respondent raises to the issuance of any cease and desist order, or to the scope of the order issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">The petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
