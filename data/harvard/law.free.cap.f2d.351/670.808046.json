That decision was reversed by the Supreme Court and the cases remanded for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of the Supreme Court (United Gas Imp. Co. v. Continental Oil Co., 381 U.S. 392, 85 S.Ct. 1517, 14 L.Ed.2d 466).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">The Commission has not yet ruled on applications of the producer-sellers for certificates of public convenience and necessity under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. Indeed, the producer-sellers have not filed such applications. It was therefore reasonable for the Commission to defer decision on Texas Eastern\u2019s application. It would be premature at this time for this Court to rule upon issues which may or may not be presented when the Commission finally grants or denies Texas Eastern\u2019s application and/or such applications as may be filed by the producer-sellers. The Commission\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction is therefore affirmed, and on all other issues, the petitions for review are dismissed as premature, but without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
