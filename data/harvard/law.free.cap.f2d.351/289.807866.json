It was asserted that appellant was deportable under three separate charges. At the subsequent hearing appellant admitted that he was deportable under the first charge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but denied de-portability under the second and third charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">At the hearing appellant filed an application for permission to reapply for admission into the United States <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of March 28, I960.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The special inquiry officer denied this application and two subsequent petitions for reconsideration. An appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals from the second denial of reconsideration was ordered dismissed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The only question before us is whether denial by the special inquiry officer of the application for leave to reapply constituted abuse of discretion. Gonzales-Jiminez v. Del Guercio, 253 F.2d 420 (9th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Respondent\u2019s brief states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201cConsidering appellant\u2019s long record of immigration.violations, his irresponsible if not bigamous marital history, and his many false statements and misrepresentations, respondent submits that the special inquiry officer did not abuse his discretion in denying his application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\">. The charge was that he was within the following class: \u201cAliens who have been arrested and deported, consent to apply or reapply for admission not having been granted by the proper authority, under section 212(a) (17) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-14\">. A considerable portion of the argument on appeal has been directed to appellant\u2019s deportability under the second and third charges. We do not find it necessary to determine the issues thus presented since the first charge with appellant\u2019s admissions are sufficient to support deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-27\">. Appellant would be entitled to admission for permanent residence under certain conditions, including consent to reapplication by the Attorney General \u201cin his discretion.\u201d Section 5 of the Act of September 11, 1957, now to be found in Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
