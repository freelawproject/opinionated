YOUNG, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b83-27\">This is an appeal from a conviction on Counts I and III of an indictment consisting of five counts. The indictment was filed on June 15,1962, against appellant and one Thomas E. Thompson, the latter being jointly charged with appellant in Counts I, II and IV. Counts I and II charged interstate transportation of stolen grain on or about October 3, 1960 until November 19, 1960 in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. Counts III and IV charged interstate transportation of certain checks, \u201cstolen, converted and taken by fraud * * * \u201d on or about October 4, 1960, and on or about August 26, 1960 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>until October 6, 1960, respectively, in violation of the same statute. Count V charged a conspiracy to violate the statute, 18 U.S.C'. \u00a7 371. The second count was dismissed on motion of the Government as to both appellant and Thompson. Thompson was acquitted on all the remaining counts in which he was named. Appellant was convicted on Counts I and III, and acquitted on Counts IV and V. Appellant was given a \u201cgeneral sentence\u201d of ten years and was fined $10,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The trial in the court below commenced on November 4 and ended on November 21, 1963. The prosecution called twenty-eight witnesses and introduced over 250 exhibits. The defense, in addition to the two defendants and three character witnesses for defendant Thompson, called ten witnesses and introduced some 80 exhibits. It is appellant\u2019s basic contention, on appeal, that there was error tainting the verdict. Appellant does not question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction under Count I, but does contend that the proof as to Count III, even if accepted as true, does not establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">At the trial, it was the Government\u2019s theory as to Count I that appellant, with unlawful intent to provide himself with funds for speculation in commodities futures, caused a large quantity of grain to be removed from the elevators of Federal Grain Co. (hereinafter referred to as Federal) to those of Best Gin and Land Co. (hereinafter referred to as Best) and thereafter to be shipped in interstate commerce, with drafts ultimately diverted to appellant for his own speculative purposes. It was the Government\u2019s theory as to Count III that appellant caused the bookkeeper of Federal to draw a check on that company\u2019s account to the order of another company controlled by appellant and that he thereafter caused the check to be transported in interstate commerce from Tennessee to Missouri, the proceeds of the check being expended for appellant\u2019s speculative purposes. Appellant was the operating manager of Federal and controlled Best, a corporation owned by his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Appellant contends that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial and an impartial jury in violation of Rule 21(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution due to the following errors alleged to have been committed by the trial court: (1) Denial of appellant\u2019s motions to transfer the case, (2) Denial of his motion for a continuance, (3) Denial of his motion for disqualification of jurors from certain counties, (4) Denial of his motion to quash the supplementary panel of eight veniremen from Cape Girardeau called during the first day of trial, (5) Denial of his motion for a mistrial on the ground of a prejudicial statement made by a prospective juror in the presence of the entire panel, (6) Denial of his motion for a mistrial on the ground that the court emphasized the prejudicial effect of the prospective juror\u2019s statement by instructing the panel to disregard the statement, and (7) Overruling the defense objection to questions by the prosecution in cross-examining appellant as to the details of a previous conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Appellant further contends that prejudicial error resulted in the trial court\u2019s remarks in the presence of the jury to Brashears, a Government witness, during direct examination implying that Brashears\u2019 testimony was perjurious; and, also, that prejudicial error resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the evidence in his closing argument and the trial court\u2019s comment about the misstatement only compounded the resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>prejudice. Finally, appellant contends that the proof as to Count III, even if accepted by the jury, does not constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314; and, the \u201cgeneral sentence\u201d imposed upon appellant was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Since there is no issue raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence it is not necessary to set forth the facts in detail except as they relate- to appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We shall discuss these contentions in the order mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">I. The Alleged Unfairness of Appellant\u2019s Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The grain involved in Count I was allegedly stolen from the elevators of Federal at several towns in southeastern Missouri, and also a town in southwestern Illinois, just across the river. The grain in question had been gathered by Federal from farmers in the surrounding area. Federal eventually became insolvent and a number of farmers lost money as a consequence. In order to avoid the claimed prejudice of trial in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, in the farming area affected by the alleged thefts of grain, appellant and co-defendant Thompson moved before trial for a transfer of the case back to St. Louis, a different division of the same district. The indictment had been returned in the latter division, but the case had been transferred to Cape Gi-rardeau on the Government\u2019s motion. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to transfer on the ground that \u201cat this stage of the proceeding\u201d there was not sufficient showing that a fair trial could hot be had in Cape Girardeau.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">When appellant\u2019s case came on for trial he renewed his motion for transfer to St. Louis and also filed motions for a continuance and for disqualification of residents of the nearby counties as jurors. The trial court denied the motion for continuance and reserved ruling on the renewed transfer motion and the motion to restrict the panel pending the <em>voir dire </em>examination of jurors, after which time they were also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The selection of the jury took two full days, most of the examination of the venire being concentrated on the question of prejudicial opinions. A number of jurors were excused for cause, some of whom had preconceived opinions and others for various other reasons. After nine veniremen were excused the court declared a recess and eight additional talesmen were procured by the marshal. Appellant moved to quash this part of the panel when it was learned that these eight talesmen were residents of the City of Cape Girardeau and that the marshal had not left the city limits in selecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">On the second day of the jury\u2019s selection, a prospective juror stated on <em>voir dire, </em>in the presence of the entire panel, \u201cI might mention we have did (sic) business with the people from Bell City and Vanduser and they have caused them a lot of trouble by this mishandling by the fact that the farmers didn\u2019t get their money.\u201d Appellant moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion, immediately instructed the panel to disregard this remark, and excused the prospective juror who had made it. Appellant again moved for a mistrial, claiming that the instruction was unwarranted and emphasized the assertion that the farmers had lost money by reason of appellant\u2019s activities. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Another prospective juror was excused because she revealed, under examination by the prosecution, that she could not view the evidence with an open mind. After a recess, the trial court reported to the panel that during the recess, \u201cwhile she was in the ladies\u2019 restroom -she [the prospective juror just excused] made a remark concerning one of these defendants who is now on trial.\u201d The court then held a hearing in chambers to ascertain the facts as to the alleged remark. Five members of the panel were called in and informally questioned. They stated that they were in the restroom when the prospective lady juror just excused made a remark about her surprise that appellant was out of the penitentiary. These five ladies further stated that the remark did not prejudice them against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>appellant and that they could give appellant a fair and impartial trial. The court then called appellant into chambers and over the objection by the Government permitted him to be examined as to the circumstances of his prior convictions. The court concluded that in view of the remarks made by one of the prospective jurors in the presence of others that either of the attorneys for defendants would be permitted to make a brief statement of the circumstances of the convictions to the entire panel and inquire whether or not this would prejudice any of the prospective jurors against appellant. Appellant\u2019s counsel, again over objection by the prosecution, made a brief statement to the prospective jurors about the prior convictions and examined them on <em>voir dire </em>to determine if this would prejudice them against appellant. All replied that they would not be prejudiced. No objection was made by appellant to this procedure, nor did he request that any member of the panel be excused on account of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Because appellant\u2019s counsel was permitted to explain the prior conviction to the jury on <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court later allowed the Government to question appellant about the same conviction in some detail on cross-examination when appellant testified for the defense. The Government first asked whether appellant had ever been convicted of a felony, and appellant answered in the affirmative. The next question asked was the nature of the felony, and appellant\u2019s counsel objected. The trial court ruled: \u201cMr. Joslyn, under normal circumstances the government could only go into the fact that he had been convicted of a felony. However, in this particular instance at your request and prior to the impaneling of the jury the court permitted Mr. Butler under oath to make a statement about the matter and nature of this charge. I then permitted you to examine the jury and make a statement about the circumstances of what that charge was. Accordingly, I will now permit the government to go into it.\u201d The Government then brought out that appellant\u2019s state court conviction had been for obtaining money under false pretenses by issuing warehouse receipts for over one thousand boxcars of grain when there were only four boxcars of grain in the warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">At the conclusion of the <em>voir dire </em>examination, a jury of nine men and three women was selected to hear the case. Two male alternates also sat, but no occasion arose for them to take part in the deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Appellant\u2019s motions (1) to transfer, (2) for continuance, (3) to restrict the jury panel, (4) to quash the supplementary panel; and (5) and (6) the prospective juror\u2019s remark on <em>voir dire </em>and the court\u2019s instruction in that regard \u2014 these asserted errors collectively form the basis of defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">(1) <em>The Denial of Appellant\u2019s Protective Motions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">At the outset it may be observed that the resolution of questions as to prejudice are ordinarily within the discretion of the trial judge, \u201cThe trial judge has a large discretion in ruling on the issue of prejudice * * *. Generalizations beyond that statement are not profitable, as each case must turn on its special facts.\u201d Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 312, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Clearly the trial court did not err in postponement of its final rulings on these questions (except the motion for continuance) until after the <em>voir dire </em>examination, \u201cThe ultimate question is whether it is possible to select a fair and impartial jury, and the proper occasion for such determination is upon <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d Blumenfield v. United States, 284 F.2d 46, 51 (8th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The motion for continuance made on the day of trial was based on the alleged prejudicial effect of the publicity resulting from the receivership of Federal. Here also the trial judge is vested with wide discretion in ruling upon motions for continuance. Callanan v. United States, 223 F.2d 171, 177 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Cir. 1955). But since the basis of the motion was possible prejudice, the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jurors furnishes the most reliable evidence of whether any such prejudice existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">This is also true of defendant\u2019s request that residents of five counties be excluded from the jury panel and his motion to quash the supplementary panel of eight veniremen from Cape Girardeau, which are ordinarily discretionary with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The statement made by the prospective juror on <em>voir dire </em>in reference to the \u201ctrouble\u201d caused \u201cby this mishandling\u201d was unsolicited and, of course, improper. Appellant argues that this was prejudicial and that the trial court\u2019s instruction to disregard the statement did not cure the impropriety, but, on the contrary, only magnified the prejudice resulting from this remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">As the Government points out in its brief, while the statement of the veniremen is somewhat ambiguous the \u201cmishandling\u201d referred to was either a mishandling of grain or funds or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">It was the Government\u2019s theory, and much testimony was introduced to show that when the grain was shipped from Federal to Best a theft occurred. In fact, the grain, its proceeds, and the money referred to in the indictment were alleged to have been stolen from Federal. The testimony showed that Federal became insolvent and of course it followed that some or all of those who were doing business with Federal would suffer financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Since the essential contents of the veniremen\u2019s statement were later presented in testimony before the jury, the court\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning the statement could not have been prejudicial. The court properly told the jury to disregard the statement, as it was not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Most of these objections are based upon publicity that had been given Federal\u2019s difficulties and appellant\u2019s connection with Federal and Best. But as this court stated in Blumenfield v. United States, supra 284 F.2d at p. 51, \u201cIt is clear that the mere presence of adverse publicity does not per <em>se </em>establish proof of prejudice, or necessarily establish that a defendant would be unable to obtain a fair trial within the district. \u2018The mere fact that a juror has read newspaper accounts relative to a criminal charge is not in itself sufficient grounds for excluding a juror.\u2019 Finnegan v. United States, 8th Cir., 204 F.2d [105], 110.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">During the thorough <em>voir dire </em>examination, which lasted two days, none of the jurors finally accepted indicated the slightest prejudice whatsoever, and appellant has in no way at any time raised any question about any of the twelve jurors finally impaneled at his trial. At <em>voir dire, </em>one of the jurors finally accepted stated that he had read some newspaper accounts regarding the case but did not recall what he read; another said that she had probably heard of the case; another that he had read only headlines and had no impressions about the case; another that she had read about it but had forgotten all the information except the name; another that she had read headlines but had formed no opinion; another that he had heard it discussed but formed no opinion and had not paid much attention to the case; another that he recalled seeing something about it in the newspaper but did not pay attention to it and formed no opinion; another that he read about the case but not enough to get an idea of what it was about or form an opinion; another that he only remembered a newspaper report but formed no opinion; and finally two others who had only heard of the case through newspapers and one who had never heard or read of the case and had no knowledge of it one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">The ultimate and decisive test is whether the jurors who tried appellant were fair and impartial. \u201cOf course there could be no constitutional imf irmity in these rulings if petitioner actually received a trial by an impartial jury.\u201d Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 556, 82 S.Ct. 955, 963, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>It might be noted that the verdict of the jury indicated the opposite of bias or prejudice. It acquitted appellant on two of the four counts against him which were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The extensive <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jury panel and the answers of those selected and actually served certainly present \u201cno clear and convincing proof of prejudice existing in the minds of any juror finally accepted and empaneled.\u201d Beck v. United States, 298 F.2d 622, 629 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">(2) <em>The Cross-Examination of Appellant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting the Government to cross-examine him as to his prior convictions. The inquiry into these convictions arose out of the \u201crestroom incident.\u201d The trial judge, over the objection of the Government, permitted appellant\u2019s counsel to explain to the panel on <em>voir dire </em>the nature of the charges which had resulted in the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">It does appear, as the Government has suggested, that appellant made the most of this opportunity by making an explanatory statement about his convictions to the jury with the further benefit of his counsel later examining the prospective jurors as to any possible prejudice which they might entertain in light of appellant\u2019s convictions. Later, when appellant testified during the trial, the trial court recognized the settled rule that a prosecutor, on cross-examination of an accused, may not go beyond the fact of a conviction into its details. However, the trial judge recognized, and we agree, that appellant opened up the scope of the inquiry himself and it was not prejudicial error for the Government to pursue the matter judiciously on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">II. The Trial Court\u2019s Remarks to Brashears.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Appellant contends that the trial judge committed prejudicial error by his remarks to Brashears, the manager of Best, called by the Government as a witness. Brashears had known appellant and Thompson, the co-defendant, for over ten years. Thompson had given Brashears a job at Federal, and later, in April 1960, appellant had hired him as manager of Best. Before Brashears was called to testify, Bernes, the owner of Federal, had testified and disclaimed certain knowledge about relations between Federal and Best, grain shipments, and the speculations by appellant. Brashears, however, testified about a meeting in Atlanta on January 14, 1961, when the managers of all the Federal elevators met with Bernes for the purpose of discussing their future jobs and the financial trouble that Federal was experiencing in southeast Missouri. Brashears was present and on cross-examination by appellant\u2019s counsel testified that Bernes acknowledged having an interest in \u201ca little elevator at MeMullin,\u201d which was Best\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Earlier, the Government referring to a check signed by Thompson for Best, asked Brashears on direct examination whether he remembered anything about the cheek being drawn, and Brashears said that he did not. Then came the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">\u201cQ. Do you remember who was present when that check was drawn ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\">A. Not right now I don\u2019t Mr. Mayer, No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\">Q. You don\u2019t remember right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-16\">A. Well, if you would bring out something that would make me remember, I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-17\">Q. I am just asking you do you remember who was present when that check was signed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-18\">A. Well, Mr. Thompson was present. He has signed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-19\">Q. Were you present, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-20\">A. I may have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-21\">Q. Was Mr. Butler present, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-22\">A. He might have been, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-23\">The Court: Just a minute. Mr. Brashears, let me tell you something. You are under oath in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-24\">The Witness: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Court: You have previously testified about these things before the grand jury. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">The Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">The Court: Now if you don\u2019t tell the truth in this court you are subject to perjury, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">The Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">The Court: All right. Now you think about these things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Later during the day when the Government examined Brashears on redirect about the Atlanta meeting, defense counsel objected, saying \u201cYour Honor, Mr. Brashears is the Government\u2019s own witness. They put him on the witness stand, telling here in court that his testimony is truthful and it is violation of all of the rules of evidence for this man to be cross-examining his own witness and we strongly object to it.\u201d The trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">\u201cMr. Joslyn, Mr. Brashears was subpoenaed by the Government but after hearing his testimony today I am not so sure whether he is a witness for the Government or whether he is a witness for these defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">It appears that an important part of appellant\u2019s defense was his contention that Bernes knew of the close relationship between Federal and Best, and that he was aware of the grain transfers. Appel-ant contends that figuring largely in the proof of Bernes\u2019 knowledge was the Atlanta meeting referred to by Brashears in his testimony, and, appellant argues, when the trial court warned Brashears that he was under oath and cautioned him, this \u201ceffectively destroyed Bra-shears\u2019 utility to the defense.\u201d On the other hand, the Government argues that Brashears\u2019 testimony was not crucial to the defense, as alleged, because he did not relate any of the details of the meeting and there was earlier testimony to the same effect by the witness Purdy, who also attended that meeting. The Government further argues that the trial court\u2019s remarks to Brashears were not prejudicial error, particularly in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident and that appellant recognized this at the time is shown by his failure to ask corrective relief of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">The Atlanta meeting took place sometime after the grain transactions which were the subject matter of the indictment. This remark could not have suggested that Brashears was testifying falsely about the Atlanta meeting because the subject of the testimony at the time of the court\u2019s remarks was certain checks concededly immaterial to appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">That appellant did not consider the remarks prejudicial at the time is evidenced by the fact that he made no objection. In his brief he concedes that \u201cthe testimony about the check * * * was of no great materiality.\u201d It is true that later appellant did object to the court\u2019s remarks to the effect that he was not sure whether Brashears was a witness for the Government or the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">We do not mean to imply approval of these remarks by the trial court. In the exercise of appropriate judicial restraint they should not have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">However, at the conclusion of the trial, the judge included in his instructions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-18\">\u201cIt has been and will be the court\u2019s purpose to express no opinion upon the facts in this case for that is the province of the jury and if you have thought at any time during the trial that the court has indicated any opinion with respect to what the facts are you may disregard it * * * I have meant nothing by voice or manner to indicate any opinion upon what is or is not a fact in this case * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">As stated before, the trial of this case lasted nearly three weeks and the record discloses that it was hotly contested. As late Judge Sanborn said in Goldstein v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>United States, 63 F.2d 609, 613 (8th Cir. 1933):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201cIt is not always possible during the trial of a hotly contested case for a judge, however impartial he may be, to maintain in the courtroom that atmosphere of complete judicial calm which is so much to be desired. We must not overlook the fact that the human element cannot be entirely eliminated from the trial of lawsuits. * * * It is impossible to gather from the cold record, particularly when it is in narrative form, the atmosphere of the trial itself, the manner in which the words were spoken, or the probable effect, if \u00abany, which they had upon the merits of the controversy. Critical remarks of the court frequently cut both ways, if they cut at all. * * * An appellate court should be slow to reverse a case for the alleged misconduct of the trial court, unless it appears that the conduct complained of was intended or calculated to disparage the defendant in the eyes of the jury and to prevent the jury from exercising an impartial judgment upon the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Considering the fact that appellant did not object to the first remarks by the trial judge quoted above during the testimony of Brashears, the court\u2019s later cautionary instruction to the jury, the fact that the later remarks by the court to which appellant did object are not manifestly prejudicial, we are convinced that the trial court did not commit error prejudicial to appellant by its remarks to the witness Brashears.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">III. The Prosecutor\u2019s Misstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Appellant argues that the prosecutor in his closing statement was permitted to misrepresent the crucial testimony of the witness Allgire. Appellant points out that on the issue of Bernes\u2019 awareness of the speculations being conducted for Federal in various names, the only testimony from a completely disinterested witness was that of Mr. Allgire; and, appellant further says that while the jury might have failed to perceive from other evidence that Bernes must have known of the speculations, the jury could hardly have rejected Allgire\u2019s testimony that, on November 30 or December 1, 1960, before the collapse of Federal he heard Bernes and appellant discuss \u201cthe losses which Federal Grain had incurred in the commodities future market through the accounts of Mrs. L. Y. Butler and Best Gin &amp; Land Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">It appears that the Allgire testimony was first referred to in the closing argument of the defense when counsel accurately summarized the testimony, and the prosecutor interrupted, saying, \u201cI am going to object to that, Your Honor. That was not the question that was asked, nor was that the answer given.\u201d The trial court then stated, \u201cWell, the jury will remember what the testimony is. This is argument, this is not the evidence, this is merely the lawyer\u2019s statement about what happened. You will remember the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Later, during the closing statement for the Government, the prosecutor incorrectly summarized the testimony of All-gire to the effect that Allgire heard a conversation between Bernes and Butler about trading in futures but nothing was said in the conversation about trading in Mrs. Butler\u2019s name, or in other names or anything of that type. When counsel for appellant objected to this inaccurate summation, the trial court said: \u201cNow, gentlemen, let\u2019s let everybody make their own argument. The jury is going to remember this conversation. I have refrained from doing anything and let you attorneys say whatever you want to say. Both of you for the defendants did the same thing. Let the jury remember. Go on with your argument.\u201d The prosecutor further commented on the Allgire testimony, questioning why the defense did not proceed to ask Allgire the details of the conversation. In its general charge to the jury after the closing arguments were concluded, the trial court instructed the jury that what counsel stated was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>evidence, but rather the evidence was as they, the jury, remembered it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Appellant contends that prejudicial error resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentation and the error was compounded by the trial court\u2019s comment about the misrepresentation. Appellant argues that taking the most generous view of the matter, the prosecutor chose to leave an \u201cambiguity,\u201d and, by a less generous view, he chose to persist in his misrepresentation, no longer an honest one, relying on the trial court\u2019s apparent indisposition to interfere with him. The Government concedes that the prosecutor made a misstatement but contends that it was an honest misrepresentation, and, therefore, under the language of this court in Nicholson v. United States, 221 F.2d 281 (8th Cir. 1955), the error committed was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In Nicholson v. United States, supra at 283, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201c * * * Our examination of that part of the testimony which is contained in the record indicates that defendant is probably correct in his interpretation of the import of the testimony. Each time the dispute arose between counsel the Court informed the jury that the jury was the sole judge of what the testimony was. Misconduct of counsel in argument to the jury is ground for reversal under some circumstances. <em>But an honest misinterpretation of testimony, such as this apparently was, without some indication of resulting prejudice does not constitute reversible error.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">See also Keeble v. United States, 347 F.2d 951 (8th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">It should be pointed out that while appellant disputed the prosecutor\u2019s summation, no request for a mistrial was made and the trial court was not requested to instruct the jury to disregard the statement. There is nothing in the record which indicates that the misstatement was other than an honest misrepresentation and nothing more. Prefacing his summarization of the witness\u2019 testimony, the prosecutor said: \u201cThis is the way I understood * * * \u201d \u2014 and when he concluded he said: \u201cI think that was all that was said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">We cannot say that the misstatement was so \u201cpalpably improper as to have been clearly prejudicial,\u201d United States v. Cohen, 177 F.2d 523, 527 (2d Cir. 1949), and there is absent any clear and convincing proof of prejudice resulting from the misstatement; hence, it was not prejudicial error, and the error committed was cured by the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury. United States v. Barrett, 280 F.2d 889 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence Under Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Appellant next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction under Count III which alleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. The violation alleged was that appellant caused to be transported from Memphis, Tennessee, to Oran, Missouri, a $6,000 check which he knew was stolen, converted and taken by fraud from Federal. Appellant does not deny that the check in question was in fact transported from Tennessee to Missouri and he does not deny, for the purpose of this appeal, that there was adequate proof that he caused the transportation. However, appellant argues that there was no proof that the check in question had been stolen or converted, and hence it was error for the trial court to deny appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal made at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case and of the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">In summary, appellant rests its contention that the check was not stolen on two arguments: (1) He had such blanket authority in handling the affairs of Federal that the order to issue this check could not exceed the scope of this authority; and (2) Federal owed him $66,-000 in commissions under his \u201cconsultant\u201d contract, and hence he was entitled to this check. The Government contends, and we agree, that in light of all the evidence there was at least a factual issue created as to whether or not appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>was authorized to order the issuance of the check in question for the particular purpose shown by the evidence. If such a factual issue was created, and we think it was, then the trial court did not err in overruling the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. Once such an issue was created, it was the duty of the jury to determine whether or not the check was stolen within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In the case at bar, we have viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, Koolish v. United States, 340 F.2d 513, 514 (8th Cir. 1965). It would serve no useful purpose to discuss the evidence in this regard which both appellant and the Government have thoroughly argued in their respective briefs. Suffice it to say that we are compelled to conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record from which the jury could have found that the check in question had been stolen, and, therefore, it was not error for the trial court to deny appellant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal under this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Finally, appellant contends that even if his conviction should not be reversed, his sentence should be vacated and the case should be remanded for re-sentencing. The sentence imposed on appellant was a \u201cgeneral sentence\u201d of ten years and a fine in the sum of $10,000 on Count I and Count III of the indictment. Appellant argues that he should have been sentenced on each count and relies on Benson v. United States, 332 F.2d 288 (5th Cir. 1964), in which the court disapproved the use of a \u201cgeneral sentence\u201d and vacated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Both Counts I and III allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. The maximum punishment under both is therefore identical \u2014 a fine up to $10,000 and a term of imprisonment up to ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In Benson, supra, the defendant received an aggregate sentence of 15 years, which exceeded the maximum on any one particular count. The problem there, the court said, was \u201cthat no one \u2014 accused, [or the] reviewing Court * * * knows what the real sentence is.\u201d But here that problem is not involved. The sentence did not exceed that which could have been imposed on either count.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">This court has previously sustained general sentences. Phillips v. United States, 212 F.2d 327 (8th Cir. 1954); Barnes v. United States, 197 F.2d 271 (8th Cir. 1952). This contention is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">We have carefully considered the entire record with the assistance of the excellent briefs provided by both sides. Appellant has been represented by able counsel throughout the proceeding. We are convinced that his federal right to a fair trial and an impartial jury was fully preserved in the trial court, and his conviction is based upon substantial competent evidence. Finding no prejudicial error in the record, defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\">. Rule 21.
