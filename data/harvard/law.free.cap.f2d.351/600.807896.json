The convictions of three of Kane\u2019s co-defendants were affirmed on appeal, and the facts are fully set forth in United States v. Gersh, 328 F.2d 460 (2d Cir. 1964). Kane, who did not join in that appeal because he was a fugitive from justice, contends that various determinations by this court in Gersh were erroneous. We have carefully examined each of his arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">Kane places primary reliance on the argument that the buyers\u2019 surprise robbery of the counterfeit money from the seller negates the existence of a conspiracy. As we said in Gersh, this claim \u201cverges on the ludicrous.\u201d Kane was a \u201cbroker\u201d who actively participated in a plan through which the money would be transferred from the seller to the buyers. Had he not procured a buyer, the seller would have had little need to obtain or have possession of the counterfeit. And, Kane would be guilty of conspiring to possess counterfeit even if the money were never transferred to the buyers. We see no reason why the bizarre manner in which the transfer was consummated warrants a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">Kane next argues that the \u201csingle transaction\u201d in which he participated was insufficient to draw him within the ambit of the conspiracy. It is true that where a defendant is charged with participation in one central conspiracy involving many transactions, evidence of mere participation in a single transaction will not ordinarily justify conviction for conspiracy unless the defendant knew that the single transaction was \u201cin execution of the larger venture which made up the conspiracy.\u201d United States v. Carminati, 247 F.2d 640, 643 (2d Cir. 1957); see United States v. Agueci, 310 F.2d 817, 836, 99 A.L.R.2d 478 (2d Cir. 1962). But here, the single transaction in which Kane participated was the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for the conspiracy; there was no larger venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">Kane\u2019s other arguments, concerning the government\u2019s failure to produce the counterfeit money and the forelady\u2019s note to Judge Bartels, were fully presented by the appellants in Gersh and amply discussed in this court\u2019s opinion. We reject them for the reasons stated there.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The court wishes to express its appreciation to Frank Serri, Esq., appellant\u2019s assigned counsel, who has prosecuted this appeal with skill and fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
