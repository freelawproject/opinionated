We find no error in the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-25\">On September 14,1964 Cameron entered a plea of guilty to Count I of an indictment charging him, and another, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114, with robbery of a postal department employee of mail in his possession and placing the employee\u2019s life in jeopardy by use of a loaded pistol. Judgment of conviction on the plea resulted in a sentence of twenty-five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>imprisonment. At the time of sentencing, Cameron\u2019s oral motions for presen-tence investigation and for probation were denied. Later his written motion to modify or reduce the sentence imposed by applying thereto the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Congress approved Public Law 85-752<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on August 25, 1958; section 3 of that act added section 4208 of Title 18, allowing the sentencing court to fix a prisoner\u2019s eligibility for parole at the time of sentencing. But section 7 of Public Law 85-752 provided \u201cThis Act does not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, the legislative history of this act shows that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of section 7 is to \u201cassure that the mandatory penalties provided by statute for special categories of crime, such as armed robbery of a post office * * * shall not be affected in any way by the provisions of the bill.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is sufficient basis for approval of the district court\u2019s ruling which denied Cameron\u2019s motion to reduce the twenty-five year sentence to twenty years and grant probation for the remaining five years. The sentence provided in \u00a7 2114 for one guilty of robbery, by the use of a dangerous weapon, of a United States postal employee is that he \u201cshall be imprisoned twenty-five years.\u201d This is a \u201cmandatory penalty\u201d and the court had no power to apply the provisions of section 4208. The Supreme Court decision in Andrews v. United States, 373 U.S. 334, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 10 L.Ed.2d 383 (1963), is not authority to the contrary. The claim of error in this ruling is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Contrary to Cameron\u2019s argument in this court, the district court hearing on September 14, 1964 clearly shows that the court understood that, though the sentence was mandatory, it could be suspended for probation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651. Andrews v. United States, 373 U.S. at 335, 340, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 10 L.Ed.2d 383. The court heard Cameron\u2019s attorney, and Cameron, on the original oral motion for probation and denied the motion. There is no claim of abuse of discretion in that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-19\">. 72 Stat. 845 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AY0\">. 72 Stat. 847 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AGu\">. 1958 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.
