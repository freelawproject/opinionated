Two questions are presented on appeal: whether the motion for judgment of acquittal should be granted and whether the appellant was prejudiced by comments of the prosecuting attorney in his address to the jury. It is enough to say with respect to the first question that the evidence presented a jury issue, and it was not error to deny the motion for judgment of acquittal. In his statement to the jury, counsel for the Government said that the defendant, who is the appellant here, \u201chas yet to say where he was \u2014 where he had gone, insofar as the record is concerned \u2014 it is silent.\u201d This statement is clearly a comment upon the failure of the appellant to testify as a defendant in a criminal cause. It is clearly prejudicial. Fowler v. United States, 5 Cir., 310 F.2d 66. The judgment of conviction and sentence must be reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
