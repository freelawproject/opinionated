United States, 2 Cir., 306 F.2d 633, that \u201cthe identity of a client, or the fact that a given individual has become a client are matters which an attorney normally may not refuse to disclose, * * The order entered by the trial court here reserves to the court the opportunity to resolve any question that may arise by reason of the court\u2019s authorizing appellant to withhold copies of any privileged communications between the lawyer and his client. With this saving provision included in the order, we find that the trial court did not err in requiring the production of the books, records and documents as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
