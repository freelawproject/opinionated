The District Court summarily denied Hirons\u2019 <em>pro se </em>petition without requiring an answer from the prison authorities, and did not hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">In the absence of an answer or evidentiary hearing, the petitioner\u2019s allegations must be accepted as true. The petition recites that he \u201cis not receiving proper medical attention,\u201d that he has been \u201cdenied an operation on his jaw,\u201d and that this denial \u201cmay result in irreparable damage.\u201d Hirons further alleges that Dr. Cappuccio, a prison doctor, recommended on December 10, 1964, that Hirons\u2019 jaw be operated on in the very near future, and that Dr. Cappuccio\u2019s recommendation has not been acted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">Construing the petition in a light most favorable to the inmate, it alleges conduct which may be an improper deprivation of medical treatment seriously endangering the petitioner\u2019s physical well-being. The question presented is whether these allegations raise constitutional issues. The petitioner recites in his petition that his guarantees against \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d have been and continue to be violated. The petitioner also rests his claim on the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that no state shall deprive anyone of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">We must in these circumstances reverse the order of the District Court and remand the case with directions to require the prison authorities to answer. A prompt hearing should be held, ten months having elapsed since the prison\u2019s consulting surgeon recommended an operation. After the facts are fully developed in such a hearing the court will be in a better position to deal with the question of exhaustion of administrative remedies, and any other questions, legal or factual.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
