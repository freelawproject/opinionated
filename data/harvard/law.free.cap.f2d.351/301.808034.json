Kirtley pleaded guilty to the charge, and appellant was convicted in a jury trial. In the same trial, the jury determined that appellant was guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>two of twelve offenses with which he alone was accused in a separate indictment. One of the two offenses of which appellant was found guilty under the separate indictment was also the violation of Section 1343 of Title 18. The other involved the interstate transmission of a telephone communication in which appellant was alleged to have conveyed threats with the unlawful intent to extort money. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Shortly after their arrests, appellant and Kirtley were confined in the same cell, where they engaged in conversation. During the trial, Kirtley testified that in-the conversation, appellant had made certain statements which appellant contends were incriminating \u201cadmissions\u201d which, under the circumstances, were improperly received as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The oral statements can hardly be characterized as \u201cadmissions.\u201d When Kirtley initiated the conversation with the question, \u201cI wonder how we got picked up ?\u201d, appellant, according to Kirt-ley, replied, \u201cYou know what is going to happen if you say anything.\u201d Kirtley testified that in the ensuing discussions, appellant attempted to persuade Kirtley to make certain representations as to Kirtley\u2019s participation and the absence of appellant\u2019s participation in one of the transactions. Additionally, Kirtley testified that appellant suggested that Kirtley plead guilty and promised to send Kirtley five or ten dollars per week if he, Kirtley, should be sent to prison. Finally, it was told by Kirtley that appellant threatened to kill Kirtley if the latter \u201ctook him [appellant] to prison with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Regardless of whether or not the alleged statements constituted \u201cadmissions\u201d, they were doubtless subject to inferences which were, from appellant\u2019s standpoint, damaging if not literally incriminating. This conclusion, however, affords no sufficient basis upon which to support appellant\u2019s claim of prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">There is no law, constitutional or otherwise, which protects an alleged criminal against his own failure to remain mute in every environment and under all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Immediately after his arrest, appellant requested the assistance of counsel and was told by Federal officers that he would have it. In his brief before us, it is said, \u201cAppellant was firm in his determination not to say anything incriminating to these officers.\u201d This firm determination, coupled with his demand for counsel, is indicative of appellants\u2019 understanding, perhaps more than usually intelligent, of his pertinent constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Before there was an opportunity for consultation with counsel, appellant and Kirtley were placed in such proximity as to permit of conversation. There is no evidence that the two were so placed in furtherance of a Government plan or ruse or trick to obtain evidence of admissions on the part of either. No recording or transmittal device was concealed, as in the case of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), upon which appellant strongly relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The record contains no support for appellant\u2019s contention that Kirtley, in initiating the conversation, was acting as an agent for, or in behalf of, the Government or its officers. Kirtley denied any prosecution promise of favoritism, and there is nothing of substance to refute his denial. From the facts that Kirtley was interviewed by Federal officers on the day before his conversation \u25a0with appellant, that Kirtley was released on bail on the second day after the questioned conversation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Kirtley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>was produced as a prosecution witness at the trial, we are urged to infer that Federal officers moved Kirtley to act in their behalf. We refuse to draw such inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We hold that appellant\u2019s remarks to his confederate were not made as a result of any Government act of trickery or deceit. This being so, appellant is in no position to be relieved from his own mistaken and misdirected confidence. We find no prejudicial error, and the judgments of conviction are Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. While the amount of Kirtley\u2019s bail was fixed at $1000, he was accused in only one count, whereas appellant was charged with thirteen violations of law. Upon Kirtley\u2019s plea of guilty, the district court deferred the pronouncement of sentence pending appellant\u2019s trial. There were postponements at appellant\u2019s request, and the record discloses that the court fairly determined that Kirtley should be released on his own recognizance so as not to suffer undue confinement because of delay for which he was not responsible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
