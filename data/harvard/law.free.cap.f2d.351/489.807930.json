Brooks, 6 Cir., 303 F.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">The contention that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were denied him by the knowing use by the State of perjured testimony has not been presented to the state court for relief. It can therefore not be considered here. So, too, was there a failure by the appellant to present to the state court his contention that there had been an illegal exclusion of Negroes from the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
