Boyce was sentenced by the district court to ninety-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On appeal, Boyce argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We review the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>400 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir.2005). The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Boyce initially contends that law enforcement officers violated the Fifth Amendment by questioning him at the door of his residence without first advising him of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights. Law enforcement officers, however, are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone they question or suspect. <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (per curiam). Rather, <em>Miranda </em>is only implicated when officers question an individual who is \u201cin custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 86 S.Ct. 1602. An individual \u201cis \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection ... [when] there is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>California v. Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. 711). Thus, when reviewing whether a suspect was \u201cin custody\u201d at the time of law enforcement questioning, two inquiries are essential: \u201cfirst, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt that he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">We conclude Boyce was not in custody. He was not handcuffed or otherwise restrained. Boyce was questioned by law enforcement officers at the door of his residence, in the presence of another adult-his wife. Nothing in the joint appendix suggests that the officers ever drew their weapons, were antagonistic towards Boyce, or informed him that he was not free to end the interview. Though Boyce suggests that the officers improperly sought to obtain consent to search and travelled to Boyce\u2019s residence expecting to make an arrest, the officers\u2019 \u201cunarticulated plan,\u201d if any, is irrelevant to the issue of whether Boyce was in custody. <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). Thus, under these circumstances, we conclude a reasonable person in Boyce\u2019s position would not have considered the restraint on his freedom of movement comparable to that associated with formal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Boyce also contends that law enforcement officers violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. He argues that because he was represented by counsel in pending, unrelated charges, law enforcement personnel could not question him without counsel present. However, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense specific. <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 175, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); <em>see also, United States v. Kennedy, </em>372 F.3d 686, 692 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cIt cannot be invoked once for all future pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ecutions, for it does not attach until a prosecution is commenced ...\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175, 111 S.Ct. 2204. As law enforcement officers were investigating an alleged offense wholly unrelated to the charges for which Boyce was represented, Boyce\u2019s right to counsel had not yet attached and, consequently, there was no Sixth Amendment violation. Thus, the district court\u2019s denial of Boyce\u2019s motion to suppress was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\"> <em>Miranda v.
