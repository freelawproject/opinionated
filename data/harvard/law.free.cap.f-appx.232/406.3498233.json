AT&amp;T was the plan administrator; MetLife, the claims administrator. A medical evaluation of Sanders\u2019 case, performed on behalf of MetLife toward the end of the 52 week period of short-term benefits, concluded that Sanders was <em>not </em>capable of returning to work. Based on MetLife\u2019s finding her disabled under the plan, Sanders was no longer considered an active employee of AT&amp;T upon expiration of the 52 week period.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Sanders filed a claim for long-term-disability benefits, which was granted. Several months later, however, MetLife terminated those benefits after determining Sanders did <em>not </em>qualify for them. Sanders unsuccessfully administratively appealed the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">In May 2005, Sanders filed this action for, <em>inter alia, </em>damages against AT&amp;T and MetLife, pursuant to ERISA, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>the administrator had abused its discretion in terminating her benefits. The district court awarded summary judgment to AT&amp;T and MetLife.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant and applying the same standards as did the district court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>e.g., Bolton v. City of Dallas, </em>472 F.3d 261, 263 (5th Cir.2006). Such judgment is proper if the pleadings and discovery on file show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">\u201cWhen[, as here,] ... the language of the plan grants discretion to an administrator to interpret the plan and determine eligibility for benefits, a court will reverse an administrator\u2019s decision only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>High v. E-Systems Inc., </em>459 F.3d 573, 576 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe law requires only that substantial evidence support a plan fiduciary\u2019s decisions, including those to deny or to terminate benefits, <em>not </em>that substantial evidence (or, for that matter, even a preponderance) exists to support the employee\u2019s claim of disability.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 273 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">Sanders claims MetLife, as claims administrator, conducted only a limited review of her record, and \u201ccherry picked\u201d it to justify the termination of benefits. Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court in its well-reasoned and thorough opinion, MetLife did <em>not </em>abuse its discretion in terminating Sanders\u2019 long-term benefits. A plan administrator\u2019s reconsideration of its prior decision is sufficient to meet ERISA\u2019s \u201cfull and fair review\u201d requirement. <em>Sweatman v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 594, 598 (5th Cir.1994). MetLife met this requirement by reviewing Sanders\u2019 medical files, obtaining independent medical review, reviewing the claim following appeal, and obtaining review by physician consul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tants in addition to the one who initially reviewed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Any remaining claims were <em>not </em>raised in district court. Accordingly, we decline to review them. <em>E.g., Terrell Equip. Co. Inc. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>343 F.3d 478, 482 n. 11 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
