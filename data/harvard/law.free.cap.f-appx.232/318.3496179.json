On appeal, Davis contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence found pursuant to a search of a motel room that he had allegedly rented. Davis asserts that the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant failed to establish probable cause because (1) there was no basis to determine the reliability of the anonymous tip provided by a \u201cconcerned citizen,\u201d (2) the anonymous tip was not sufficiently corroborated, (3) police surveillance uncovered no criminal actions on Davis\u2019 part and largely involved individuals other than himself, (4) there was an insufficient nexus between the observed conduct and the subject motel room, and (5) the inclusion of Davis\u2019 arrest record was factually misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress are reviewed de novo, while factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Moreland, 437 F.3d </em>424, 429 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). The evidence is construed \u201cin the light most favorable to the ... prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). When making a probable cause determination, courts use a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis, allowing the judge to review the facts as a whole and make a common sense determination as to whether there is a \u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>974 F.2d 480, 481 (4th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). On review by an appellate court, a magistrate judge\u2019s finding of probable cause is entitled to \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>974 F.2d at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">After thoroughly reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 submissions, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Davis\u2019 motion to suppress. Surveillance of Davis, and of the motel room from which the evidence was seized, provided more than ample reason to support the search of that room. Moreover, the anonymous tip that alerted police to the possibility of drug dealing at the motel room was sufficiently corroborated by adequate police work. The inclusion of Davis\u2019 arrest record in the warrant application was not improper in light of the other evidence, notwithstanding the fact that two of Davis\u2019 prior arrests led to reduced charges or dismissals. In short, Davis\u2019 claims are meritless. Accordingly, we affirm Davis\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
