The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Owens that failure to file timely, specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Owens failed to specifically object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-19\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Owens has waived appellate review by failing to timely file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-20\">In No. 07-6603, Owens appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The district court denied the motion based on its finding that Owens\u2019 notice of appeal in case number 2:06-cv-00639-GRA was untimely. Because Owens noted a timely appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of appealability and vacate the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">No. <em>07-6063\u2014DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">No. <em>07-6603\u2014VACATED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-16\">. Owens did not object to the substance of the magistrate\u2019s report, which determined that Owens' claims were procedurally defaulted. Instead of addressing his default, Owens' objections argued the merits of his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-17\"><em>. </em>The district court\u2019s final order denying \u00a7 2254 relief was entered on November 22, 2006. Owens gave his notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing on December 21, 2007. Under the rule of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), the notice of appeal is deemed filed on December 21. It was therefore timely under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
