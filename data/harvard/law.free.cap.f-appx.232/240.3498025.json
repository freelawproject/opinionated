Debtors contended that their loss calculation and concomitant deduction were reasonable and should be sustained. The bankruptcy court upheld the Service\u2019s determination on the ground that Debtors\u2019 valuation method failed to reflect income clearly, as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446(b) (2000). The district court affirmed. Debtors now appeal, claiming that the \u00a7 446(b) clear reflection of income requirement does not apply to the valuation of their accounts receivable, and, in the alternative, that if \u00a7 446(b) does apply, the bankruptcy court erred in accepting the Service\u2019s determination. Because the assessment of fair market value is the core of the mark-to-market method, \u00a7 446(b) was correctly applied to Debtors\u2019 valuation. Because the bankruptcy court properly found that Debtors failed to meet their burden of proof, it did not err in upholding the Service\u2019s determination. We thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">This appeal involves a tax issue arising in the course of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for Debtors Heilig-Meyers Company, Heilig-Meyers Furniture Company, Heilig-Meyers Furniture West, Inc., HMY Star, Inc., HMY RoomStore, Inc., and MacSaver Financial Services, Inc. (collectively \u201cDebtors\u201d). Appellant is HeiligMeyers Liquidation Trust, successor in interest to Debtors. Debtors were primarily engaged in the retail sale of home furnishings, with a large portion of their sales being made through installment credit purchases. The dispute concerns Debtors\u2019 valuation of their installment accounts receivable under the mark-to-market method of accounting pursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 475, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 475, for the tax year ended February 28,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Section 475 imposes the mark-to-market method of accounting on non-inventory securities held by securities dealers. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 475(a). Under the mark-to-market method, any security that is held by a securities dealer at the end of the year and is not inventory must be \u201cmarked to market,\u201d i.e., treated as though it had been sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable year. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 475(a)(2)(A). The taxpayer recognizes a gain or loss equal to the difference between the fair market value so calculated and the security\u2019s basis. <em>Id. </em>If the taxpayer recognizes a loss on the security\u2014that is, if the security\u2019s fair market value on the last day of the taxable year is lower than its basis\u2014then the taxpayer receives a tax deduction in the amount of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">It was unclear under \u00a7 475 as originally enacted whether the statute\u2019s definition of \u201csecurities\u201d encompassed debt instruments that constituted customer paper and thus obligated sellers of nonfinancial goods and services to use the mark-to-market method for those items. <em>See </em>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub.L. 103-66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>107 Stat. 312, 481; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 475(c)(2)(C). The Department of Treasury promulgated regulations, in effect during the tax period in dispute here, which provided that if sellers of nonfinancial goods and services would not qualify as securities dealers under \u00a7 475 but for their nonfinancial customer paper, they did not constitute securities dealers and thus were not required under \u00a7 475 to use the mark-to-market method. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.475(c)-l(b)(l) (1997). If, however, the taxpayer so chose, it could elect \u00a7 475 treatment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1.475(c)-l(b)(3), (4). Thus, for instance, retailers that made loans to customers, such as Debtors in the present case, could elect to treat their accounts receivable in accordance with \u00a7 475, using mark-to-market accounting to calculate their gain or loss on such accounts. Congress subsequently eliminated such election by amending \u00a7 475 to provide that nonfinancial customer paper did not constitute a \u201csecurity\u201d for purposes of the statute. <em>See </em>Pub.L. 105-206, Title VII, \u00a7 7003(a), 112 Stat. 685, 832 (1998) (codified at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 475(c)(4)). Thus retailers such as Heilig-Meyers may no longer elect \u00a7 475 treatment for their accounts receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">For Debtors\u2019 taxable year ended February 28, 1997, Debtors elected \u00a7 475 treatment for their accounts receivable. Debtors filed an Application for Change in Accounting Method, IRS Form 3115, which the Service approved. Debtors retained Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young, LLP, to determine the year-end fair market value of their accounts receivable for purposes of \u00a7 475\u2019s mark-to-market determination. Ernst &amp; Young partner Barbara Rayner (\u201cRayner\u201d) prepared a valuation study of the accounts receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Rayner determined the assets\u2019 fair market value using a discounted-cash-flow approach, which calculates an accurate present value by discounting the future cash flow from the asset to present value at an appropriate discount rate. The method requires a determination of the asset\u2019s projected cash flow over its life and the selection of an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for reducing the future income to its net present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">In estimating the future cash flow of the accounts receivable, Rayner reduced their face value by (1) the cost of servicing the accounts, estimated at 3% of their face value; (2) anticipated defaults by some customers; and (3) projected income taxes on the receivables\u2019 income stream. In discounting the future income to present value, Rayner selected a discount rate using a weighted average cost of capital (\u201cWACC\u201d) methodology, which measures a company\u2019s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company\u2019s capital structure. Rayner based her WACC analysis in part on an estimate of the weighted average required investment return with respect to the stock of seven consumer credit card companies. On this basis, Rayner arrived at a WACC of 11%. From that rate she derived three different discount rates for three different categories of Debtors\u2019 accounts receivable: a rate of 8% for current receivables, 15% for receivables that were 61 to 120 days delinquent, and 22% for receivables that were 121 to 180 days delinquent. Applying these discount rates, she arrived at a fair market value for the accounts receivable of $1,027,312,671. As the undisputed book value of the accounts receivable was $1,073,234,932, Debtors recognized a loss, and thus a tax deduction, in the amount of $45,922,261. The \u00a7 475 deduction contributed to a net operating loss for the tax year ended February 27, 1998, the entirety of which Debtors carried back to the tax year ended February 28, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The Service later undertook an audit of Debtors\u2019 federal income tax returns for the tax years ended February 28, 1994 through February 28, 2001. The Service concluded that, in the return for the year ended February 28, 1997, Debtors inaccurately determined the fair market value of their installment accounts receivable pursuant to \u00a7 475. The Service identified a number of problems with Debtors\u2019 methodology. In the determination of future cash flow, the Service questioned Debtors\u2019 estimation of servicing costs and rejected as improper the reduction of the assets\u2019 value by Debtors\u2019 anticipated income tax liability on those assets. In the discounting of future income to present value, the Service found Debtors\u2019 discount rates excessive and unfounded. It found that the rates allowed too much for risks flowing from potential customer defaults, both in that the rates themselves overestimated the likelihood of such defaults and in that Debtors had already reduced the face value of the receivables for anticipated defaults when estimating future cash flow. The Service found a risk-free discount rate to be more appropriate and, applying a rate of 6.5%, which was the rate of eighteen-month Treasury securities issued in February 1997, computed the fair market value of the accounts receivable as $1,048,940,674, which resulted in a loss and deduction of $24,294,258 rather than $45,922,261. The Service thus disallowed $21,628,003 of Debtors\u2019 \u00a7 475 deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">After Debtors filed for bankruptcy protection, the Service filed an amended proof of claim seeking to recover, among other amounts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> $3,923,904 for underpayment of tax arising from Debtors\u2019 inaccurate \u00a7 475 determination and $882,080 in statutory pre-petition interest, for a total of $4,805,984. Debtors commenced this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy eourt, objecting to the Service\u2019s proof of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The bankruptcy court heard argument and testimony on December 18, 2003 and January 16, 2004. The Service called Theodore Barnhill, Jr., a finance professor at George Washington University, to testify to the problems with Debtors\u2019 methodology. Barnhill conducted his own valuation of Debtors\u2019 accounts receivable as of February 28, 1997, using the discounted-cash-flow method. Barnhill employed a range of discount rates from 6.2% to 7.3%, applying the lower rate to accounts maturing earlier and the higher rates to accounts maturing later. Based on this method, Barnhill calculated Debtors\u2019 \u00a7 475 deduction at $30,974,000, more than the IRS\u2019s calculation of $24,294,258 and less than Debtors\u2019 calculation of $45,922,261. Barn-hill offered several criticisms of Debtors\u2019 method, including Rayner\u2019s estimation of cash flows on a pre-tax basis, her inappropriate use of a WACC methodology to arrive at discount rates, and her lack of quantitative justification for her choice of the three discount rates for three categories of receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Debtors attacked Barnhill\u2019s method as inferior to Rayner\u2019s. They acknowledged that they no longer had accounting records for the accounts receivable and thus could not provide any substantive support for the assumptions upon which Rayner\u2019s valuation was based. Rayner acknowledged that her valuation report did not explain her choice of seven consumer credit card companies for the WACC determination or her selection of discount rates of 8%, 15%, and 22%. She offered as an explanation for these choices her judgment as a valuation expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In their initial post-trial brief, Debtors contended that their valuation method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>need only be \u201creasonable\u201d to satisfy I.R.C. \u00a7 475. For support, Debtors cited <em>Bank One Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>120 T.C. 174 (2003), which also involved the mark-to-market method of accounting. In its post-trial reply brief, the Service responded that the Tax Court in <em>Bank One </em>held that valuation of property under \u00a7 475 is a method of accounting that must clearly reflect income in accordance with \u00a7 446(b). The Service contended that Debtors therefore had to prove that the Service\u2019s determination was unlawful or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In its opinion, the bankruptcy court held that Debtors\u2019 valuation method was subject to \u00a7 446(b). The court noted that in <em>Bank One, </em>the Tax Court held that the taxpayer\u2019s burden was to prove that the Commissioner\u2019s determination was clearly unlawful or plainly arbitrary, by establishing that its own method clearly reflected income. <em>In re Heilig-Meyers Co., </em>316 B.R. 866, 870 (Bankr.E.D.Va.2004). The court found that Debtors failed to meet this burden due to three flaws in its valuation. First, Rayner\u2019s estimate of servicing costs at 3% of the face value of the accounts receivable was contradicted by Debtors\u2019 contemporaneous assertion on an SEC Form 10-K that they could not accurately calculate figures necessary to such an estimation. <em>Id. </em>at 871-72. Second, Rayner\u2019s WACC analysis was questionable because she was unable to justify her selection of the seven particular credit card companies on which she based her analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 872. Third, Rayner did not adequately justify or provide independent verification for the three discount rates she chose. <em>Id. </em>The court found that while Debtors had raised questions about the valuation study of Service expert Barnhill, the fact remained that Debtors bore the burden of showing their accounting method clearly reflected income. <em>Id. </em>at 873. The court allowed the Government\u2019s claim in the amount of $4,815,907.51, which included the recalculation of the \u00a7 475 deduction in the amount determined by the Service. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In the district court, Debtors argued that the bankruptcy court erred in applying the \u00a7 446(b) clear reflection of income requirement and should instead have considered Debtors\u2019 valuations under a reasonableness standard. Debtors also argued that, even if \u00a7 446(b) applied, the bankruptcy court had to make findings that the Service\u2019s valuation clearly reflected income before it could uphold the Service\u2019s determination. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court. It upheld the application of \u00a7 446(b) because \u201c[t]he income tax regulations clearly provide that \u2018[t]he term \u2018method of accounting\u2019 includes not only the overall method of accounting of the taxpayer but also the accounting treatment of any item.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Heilig-Meyers Co., </em>No. 00-34533, 2005 WL 1303351, at *3 (E.D.Va.2005) (quoting 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.446\u20141(a)(1)). The district court further held that Debtors bore the burden of showing that the Service\u2019s determination of deficiency was clearly unlawful and that they had failed to do so. <em>Id. </em>at *4. Debtors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">This Court reviews the judgment of a district court sitting in review of a bankruptcy court <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards of review used in the district court. Thus we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. In re Litton, </em>330 F.3d 636, 642 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Debtors\u2019 principal contention is that \u00a7 446(b) does not apply to the determination of the fair market value of their accounts receivable because such a determination does not constitute a method of accounting governed by \u00a7 446(b). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>hold that the bankruptcy court properly applied \u00a7 446(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Section 446 sets forth, and indeed bears the title of, a \u201c[gjeneral rule for methods of accounting.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446. Section 446(a) provides, \u201cTaxable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis of which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 446(a). Section 446(b), meanwhile, sets forth an important exception: \u201c[I]f the method used does not clearly reflect income, the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as, in the opinion of the Secretary, does clearly reflect income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 446(b). Treasury Regulations further provide that \u201cno method of accounting is acceptable unless, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it clearly reflects income.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.446-l(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Section 446 constitutes a recognition that the aims of financial accounting and tax accounting, while sometimes congruent, often diverge. <em>See Thor Power Tool Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>439 U.S. 522, 542, 99 S.Ct. 773, 58 L.Ed.2d 785 (1979) (noting the \u201cvastly different objectives that financial and tax accounting have\u201d). While financial accounting aims \u201cto provide useful information to management, shareholders, creditors, and others properly interested,\u201d tax accounting serves to facilitate the \u201cequitable collection of revenue\u201d and to \u201cprotect the public fisc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For this reason, an accounting method that may be entirely satisfactory for book purposes may be unsatisfactory for reporting taxable income. The design of \u00a7 446 is clear: whatever accounting method is used by the taxpayer to calculate income, that method must render a clear reflection of income consistent with the goals of the Internal Revenue Service, as determined by the Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">As part of \u00a7 446\u2019s general rule, \u00a7 446(b)\u2019s clear reflection of income requirement applies to all methods of tax accounting. As the Treasury Regulations make clear, \u201cThe term \u2018method of accounting\u2019 includes not only the overall method of accounting of the taxpayer but also the accounting treatment of any item.\u201d 26 C.F.R \u00a7 1.446-l(a)(l); <em>see Thor, </em>439 U.S. at 531 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 773. Thus the clear reflection of income requirement applies both to the taxpayer\u2019s overall accounting method, e.g., cash method or accrual method, and also to the \u201caccounting treatment of any item,\u201d such as inventory accounting for items of inventory, or mark-to-market accounting under \u00a7 475. 26 C.F.R \u00a7 1.446\u20141(a)(1); <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 471-74 (inventory accounting); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">This case concerns what it means to say that the accounting treatment of an item\u2014 specifically, the marking to market of Debtors\u2019 accounts receivable under \u00a7 475\u2014is subject to \u00a7 446(b)\u2019s clear reflection of income requirement. It is undisputed that \u00a7 446 allows the Service to determine whether a given accounting method\u2014either an overall method or the method for a specific item\u2014is an appropriate method for accurately representing taxable income. If the type of accounting method used by the taxpayer does not result in a clear reflection of income, the Service may compel the taxpayer to employ another method. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 446(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Debtors recognize this power of the Service, but they contend that it constitutes the entire scope of \u00a7 446(b). Once the question of what accounting method to use is settled, Debtors argue, the taxpayer\u2019s particular employment of that method is not governed by \u00a7 446(b). Thus they argue that \u00a7 446(b) has no relevance in this case, where it is undisputed that Debtors sought and received the Service\u2019s approval to use \u00a7 475\u2019s mark-to-market method on their accounts receivable. Rather, Debtors claim, this conflict pertains merely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>valuation, and thus the \u00a7 446(b) clear reflection of income requirement has no bearing. The Service, in invoking \u00a7 446(b), is improperly framing a valuation dispute as a clash over accounting methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Debtors\u2019 contention is not supportable. The Supreme Court\u2019s elucidation of \u00a7 446(b) establishes that it is not limited to the threshold question of which type of accounting method the taxpayer should use. <em>See Thor, </em>439 U.S. at 532, 99 S.Ct. 773. Where, as here, the accounting method at issue essentially consists of a determination of market value, \u00a7 446(b) applies to that determination. The conclusions of the Tax Court and one of our sister circuits in the specific \u00a7 475 context further confirm that Debtors\u2019 reading of \u00a7 446(b) is foreclosed in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In <em>Thor Power Tool Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>439 U.S. at 526-27, 99 S.Ct. 773 the Service took issue with tool manufacturer Thor Power Tool Co.\u2019s determination of losses stemming from certain items of inventory\u2014namely, 44,000 pieces of excess merchandise, most of them spare parts and accessories. To value these items, Thor employed the \u201clower of cost or market\u201d (LCM) method of inventory accounting. <em>See id. </em>at 533, 99 S.Ct. 773. Under this method, the taxpayer values inventory at either cost or market value, whichever is lower. <em>See id. </em>at 535, 99 S.Ct. 773. Thor put the market value of the items of excess merchandise at approximately their scrap value and thus recognized a loss on those items, which contributed to a net operating loss for the year. <em>See id. </em>at 524, 99 S.Ct. 773. Meanwhile, however, Thor continued to offer the \u201cexcess\u201d items for sale at their original prices. <em>See id. </em>The Commissioner disallowed the offset on the ground that Thor\u2019s valuation of the inventory did not constitute a clear reflection of income as required by \u00a7\u00a7 446(b) and 471.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 524, 530, 99 S.Ct. 773. The Court agreed, concluding that \u201cthe Commissioner acted within his discretion in deciding that Thor\u2019s write-down of \u2018excess\u2019 inventory failed to reflect income clearly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 99 S.Ct. 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\"><em>Thor </em>is significant because there was no contention that Thor should have been using a different type of accounting method. The government did not take issue with the fact that \u201c[a]t all times relevant, Thor has used ... the \u2018lower of cost or market\u2019 method of valuing inventories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 99 S.Ct. 773. Nevertheless, this did not answer the question of whether Thor\u2019s \u201cparticular method\u201d was clearly reflective of income. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 99 S.Ct. 773. The Court agreed with the Commissioner that the taxpayer\u2019s particular valuation method had failed to \u201creduce!] its inventory to \u2018market\u2019 in accord with its \u2018lower of cost or market\u2019 method of accounting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 99 S.Ct. 773; <em>see id. </em>at 532, 99 S.Ct. 773. Thus, the clear reflection of income standard applied not just to the selection of the LCM method over other accounting methods, but to Thor\u2019s determination of market value in the course of employing the LCM method.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">The circumstances of <em>Thor </em>are strikingly similar to those of the present case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Thor, </em>the Service asserted that the taxpayer\u2019s determination of the market value of certain assets for the purposes of a permitted tax accounting method failed to reflect income clearly. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 99 S.Ct. 773. In this case, the Service asserts that the taxpayer\u2019s determination of the fair market value of certain assets for the purposes of a permitted tax accounting method failed to reflect income clearly. The only apparent distinction is that in <em>Thor </em>the Treasury Regulations on proper LCM methodology were more specific than those that pertained to Debtors\u2019 mark-to-market methodology.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court concluded that Thor\u2019s valuation procedures were \u201cinconsistent with this regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 99 S.Ct. 773. But this circumstance is immaterial to <em>Thor\u2019s </em>application to the present case. The Court noted <em>Thor\u2019s </em>lack of regulatory compliance simply as an indication that the Commissioner was within his discretion in finding Thor\u2019s determinations not clearly reflective of income. <em>See id. </em>at 533, 537, 99 S.Ct. 773. The fact remains that the Court subjected Thor\u2019s market value determination to the clear reflection of income standard of \u00a7 446(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The Tax Court and the Seventh Circuit recently reached the same conclusion about the precise issue in dispute here: the determination of the fair market value of assets under the mark-to-market method of \u00a7 475. <em>See Bank One Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>120 T.C. 174 (2003), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part sub nom. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>458 F.3d 564 (7th Cir.2006). <em>JPMorgan Chase </em>involved transactions known as interest swaps, which were subject to \u00a7 475\u2019s mark-to-market method. <em>See </em>458 F.3d at 568. The Commissioner rejected the taxpayer\u2019s determination of the swaps\u2019 fair market value as not clearly reflective of income as required by \u00a7 446(b). At the Tax Court level, the taxpayer asserted, as Debtors do here, that the dispute was \u201ca \u2018valuation case,\u2019 as opposed to a method of accounting case, and that [taxpayer\u2019s] valuations must be sustained because its underlying methodology was reasonable.\u201d 120 T.C. at 281. The Tax Court rejected this contention and held that \u201cthe reporting of income under section 475, <em>inclusive of the valuation requirement subsumed therein, </em>is a method of accounting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282 (emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit agreed, stating in no uncertain terms that \u201c[t]he method of determining \u2018fair market value\u2019 under section 475 falls within the definition of \u2018method\u2019 \u201d for \u00a7 446(b)\u2019s requirement that the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cmethod of accounting\u201d must clearly reflect income. 458 F.3d at 570. Thus the Tax Court and the Seventh Circuit rejected Debtors\u2019 contention that \u00a7 446(b) places no limitations on how the taxpayer implements the mark-to-market method. Instead, the determination of an asset\u2019s fair market value for \u00a7 475 must clearly reflect income. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In light of this case law, it is difficult to read \u00a7\u00a7 446(b) and 475 otherwise than to subject determinations of fair market value under \u00a7 475 to \u00a7 446(b)\u2019s clear reflection of income requirement. Debtors\u2019 position to the contrary is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s approach in <em>Thor </em>and directly contradicts the reasoned conclusion of the Tax Court and the Seventh Circuit in <em>JPMorgan Chase. </em>Nor does our conclusion portend, as Debtors claim, that the Service will attempt to bring every valua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>tion dispute within the compass of \u00a7 446(b). Here, as in <em>Thor, </em>the accounting method at issue essentially consisted of the determination of the market value of the asset. The LCM method involved in <em>Thor </em>required the valuation of inventory at the lower of market or cost, and thus necessarily entailed the determination of market value. The mark-to-market method of \u00a7 475 requires nothing other than that the taxpayer peg the asset\u2019s value to its fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year. In such instances, for the taxpayer to fail to assess market value appropriately is in essence for it to have failed to execute the accounting method. In contrast, a valuation that does not constitute the core of an accounting method will not implicate \u00a7 446(b). <em>See, e.g., Estate of Godley v. Comm\u2019r, </em>286 F.3d 210 (4th Cir.2002) (valuation of asset for estate tax); <em>Krapf v. United States, </em>977 F.2d 1454 (Fed.Cir.1992) (valuation of asset donated to charity). Our conclusion today merely gives effect to the unexceptionable proposition that a taxpayer may not, by invoking the name of an accounting method that purports to reflect income, employ a methodology that does not. <em>See Thor, </em>439 U.S. at 532, 99 S.Ct. 773. To hold otherwise would be to allow taxpayers to subvert the entire aim of \u00a7 446 merely by confining the devil to the details. <em>See id. </em>at 536, 99 S.Ct. 773 (\u201cIf a taxpayer could write down its inventories on the basis of management\u2019s subjective estimates ... the taxpayer would be able, as the Tax Court observed, to \u2018determine how much tax it wanted to pay for a given year.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Thus we affirm that Debtors\u2019 determination of the fair market value of its accounts receivable under \u00a7 475 is subject to \u00a7 446(b)\u2019s clear reflection of income requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Debtors contend that, even if the bankruptcy court did not err in applying \u00a7 446(b), it erred in upholding the Service\u2019s determination. Having found that the application of \u00a7 446(b) was proper, we also affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings under that standard and its conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s determination should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Section 446(b) provides, \u201c[I]f the method used [by the taxpayer] does not clearly reflect income, the computation of taxable income shall be made under such method as, in the opinion of the Secretary, does clearly reflect income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 446(b). This provision gives the Commissioner \u201cbroad powers\u201d to reject a taxpayer\u2019s accounting method and to substitute his own. <em>See Comm\u2019r v. Hansen, </em>360 U.S. 446, 467, 79 S.Ct. 1270, 3 L.Ed.2d 1360 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Thor </em>that the Commissioner\u2019s rejection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>taxpayer\u2019s accounting method would be upheld unless the taxpayer showed that it was \u201cclearly unlawful\u201d or \u201cplainly arbitrary.\u201d <em>See Thor, </em>439 U.S. at 532, 99 S.Ct. 773; <em>Bank One, </em>120 T.C. at 288. In accordance with <em>Thor, </em>Debtors\u2019 first burden in this case was to show that the Service\u2019s rejection of their accounting method was clearly unlawful or plainly arbitrary. In essence, this burden required Debtors to show that their own method clearly reflected income, for if it did, the Commissioner\u2019s determination would perforce be unlawful or arbitrary. <em>See, e.g., Thor, </em>439 U.S. at 536, 538, 99 S.Ct. 773 (Thor failed to prove Commissioner\u2019s rejection of its market valuation was unlawful or arbitrary where it \u201cprovided no objective evidence\u201d of its valuation).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The bankruptcy court found that the taxpayer failed to bear this burden due to three specific flaws in its determinations. First, Debtors\u2019 estimation of servicing costs at 3% of the face value of the accounts receivable did not square with Debtors\u2019 earlier assertion in a Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-k that they were unable to give an accurate estimate of numbers upon which the 3% figure depended. Second, the bankruptcy court found Debtors\u2019 WACC analysis unpersuasive because Debtors\u2019 expert Rayner was unable to provide any explanation for how she came to base the WACC analysis on the stock of seven particular consumer credit card companies out of the dozens of such companies that exist. Finally, the bankruptcy court found insufficient support for the three discount rates employed by Debtors, because Rayner offered no explanation for the choice of rates other than her personal judgment as a valuation expert.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the effect these actions had of inflating the losses recognized by Debtors under \u00a7 475, and given Debtors\u2019 inability to offer satisfactory explanations for these actions at trial, the bankruptcy court had ample reason to uphold the Commissioner\u2019s rejection of Debtors\u2019 determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Debtors contend that, even if Debtors\u2019 calculations were properly rejected, the bankruptcy court could not uphold the Commissioner\u2019s determination without make findings as to its clear reflection of income. In this, Debtors overlook factual findings made by the court and misconstrue their own burden of proof. Under \u00a7 446(b), the Service has broad powers not only to reject the taxpayer\u2019s accounting method but also to substitute one that, \u201cin the opinion of the Secretary, does clearly reflect income.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446(b). These powers are not unbounded: like the rejection of the taxpayer\u2019s method, the Commissioner\u2019s substitution of a new method may not be clearly unlawful or plainly arbitrary. <em>See Dayton Hudson Corp. &amp; Subsidiaries v. Comm\u2019r, </em>153 F.3d 660, 667 (8th Cir.1998) (taxpayer succeeded in establishing that \u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s method does not reflect income and is plainly arbitrary\u201d); <em>Russell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>45 F.2d 100, 101 (1st Cir.1930) (\u201cAn arbitrary adoption of a substitute method of computing a tax, which does not in fact \u2018clearly reflect the income\u2019 of the taxpayers, cannot be sustained.\u201d). This standard squares with the general principle in federal tax disputes that the Commissioner\u2019s determination of deficiency will not be overturned unless the taxpayer proves it is \u201carbitrary and excessive.\u201d <em>Cebollero v. Comm\u2019r, </em>967 F.2d 986, 990 (4th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Helvering v. Taylor, </em>293 U.S. 507, 515, 55 S.Ct. 287, 79 L.Ed. 623 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Under this standard, after the bankruptcy court rejected Debtors\u2019 method as not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>clearly reflective of income, it was not then the court\u2019s task to determine <em>de novo </em>whether the Commissioner\u2019s method clearly reflected income. It was rather Debtors\u2019 burden to prove that it did not. The Seventh Circuit recently and persuasively addressed this issue in <em>JPMorgan Chase. </em>In that case, as noted above, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that fair market valuation of interest swaps under \u00a7 475 was subject to the \u00a7 446(b) clear reflection of income requirement. 458 F.3d at 570. The Tax Court, however, after rejecting the taxpayer\u2019s method, went on to analyze the Commissioner\u2019s method to determine whether it accurately reflected the fair market value of the swaps. 120 T.C. at 329-30. The Tax Court found that it did not and instructed the parties to prepare a new computation following the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 331. The Seventh Circuit rejected this approach. Recognizing that \u201cthe Supreme Court instructs that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation may not be set aside unless clearly unlawful or plainly arbitrary,\u201d it concluded that \u201cthe tax court was required to defer to the Commissioner\u2019s method of calculating fair market value.\u201d 458 F.3d at 570 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Similarly, in this case, the bankruptcy court properly upheld the Service\u2019s determination. The bankruptcy court opinion offers sufficient grounds for its conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s determination should be upheld. The only deficiency the court notes in relation to the Service\u2019s claim regards one aspect of its expert Barnhill\u2019s valuation study. <em>See In re Heilig-Meyers Co., </em>316 B.R. at 872-73. The bankruptcy court then went on explicitly to uphold the Service\u2019s determination of the \u00a7 475 loss and the amount of tax owed. <em>Id. </em>at 873. Given these findings, it seems clear that the bankruptcy court did not find the Service\u2019s determination to be unlawful and arbitrary, nor does the established record suggest it should have done so. The court must \u201cafford the Commissioner the deference due under the statutory scheme,\u201d <em>JPMorgan Chase, </em>458 F.3d at 570, as \u201c[i]t is not the province of the court to weigh and determine the relative merits of systems of accounting,\u201d <em>Brown v. Helvering, </em>291 U.S. 193, 204-05, 54 S.Ct. 356, 78 L.Ed. 725 (1934). Just as Debtors did not meet their burden of proving that their own method clearly reflected income, they also failed to prove that the Commissioner\u2019s did not, and thus the bankruptcy court did not err in upholding the Service\u2019s claim in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">A word finally as to the dissent. The dissent makes no pretense of trying to reconcile its position with the most relevant case from the Supreme Court. It all but ignores the <em>Thor Power Tool </em>decision. The Court in <em>Thor </em>took exactly the approach that we do here, finding that, regardless of the fact that the taxpayer\u2019s overall accounting method and specific accounting method were agreed upon, the taxpayer\u2019s particular way of determining market value was subject to \u00a7 446(b)\u2019s clear reflection of income requirement. <em>See </em>439 U.S. at 532, 99 S.Ct. 773. At issue in <em>Thor </em>was the valuation of spare parts in inventory; the taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting was required in that case to reflect income clearly, and we can see no reason, nor does appellant suggest any, why the treatment should vary with respect to the accounts receivable in this case. We are bound to implement the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court, and yet the dissent would overrule the Court on this point summarily.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Nor does the dissent acknowledge that it would place this court at loggerheads with both the Tax Court and the Seventh Circuit in <em>JPMorgan Chase.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The approaches of the Supreme Court, the Tax Court, the Seventh Circuit, and this court today give effect to a simple proposition\u2014 that the taxpayer may not avail itself of an accounting method, the entire substance of which consists of accurately determining market value, only to implement it in a way that does no such thing. It is for this reason that \u201cthe reporting of income under section 475, inclusive of the valuation requirement subsumed therein, is a method of accounting.\u201d <em>Bank One, </em>120 T.C. at 282. The dissent\u2019s contrary approach accords little respect to this body of law or to \u201cthe discretion rested by Congress in the Secretary and the Commissioner for the administration of the tax laws.\u201d <em>United States v. Catto, </em>384 U.S. 102, 114, 86 S.Ct. 1311, 16 L.Ed.2d 398 (1966). Nor does it afford proper deference to the factual findings of the bankruptcy court and its explicit adoption of the Commissioner\u2019s determination in light of the taxpayer\u2019s continuing burden of proof. In all of these respects, we do not write on a blank slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Thus we conclude that \u00a7 446(b) was properly applied to the valuation of Debtors\u2019 accounts receivable under \u00a7 475, and we affirm the upholding of the Commissioner\u2019s determination. The judgment of the district court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-5\">. Other amounts sought by the Service involved claims not related to this dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\">. Section 471 provides that \u201cinventories shall be taken ... on such basis as the Secretary may prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting income.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 471(a). The Supreme Court in <em>Thor </em>made clear that the existence of \u00a7 471 is not an indication that \u00a7 446(b) does not apply to inventory accounting. Rather, \"[i]nventory accounting is governed by \u00a7\u00a7 446 and 471 of the Code.\u201d 439 U.S. at 531, 99 S.Ct. 773. Thus the Court reinforced what is clear from the face of \u00a7 446\u2014that it governs all methods of tax accounting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-5\">. Specifically, in <em>Thor, </em>Treasury Regulations defined \"market value\u201d to mean the current bid price for the merchandise in the volume usually purchased by the taxpayer and further identified two limited circumstances in which dle taxpayer could value inventory at below market value so defined. <em>See id. </em>at 534-35, 99 S.Ct. 773 (citing 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.471-2(c), -4 (1964)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-5\">. Debtors also argue that, as a procedural matter, the bankruptcy court should not have considered the \u00a7 446(b) argument because the Service did not refer to that provision until its post-trial reply brief. While early notice of the Commissioner's legal theory is certainly preferable to late, \u201cthe Commissioner does not necessarily forfeit his right to rely on a theory by failing to raise it at the preferred times.\u201d <em>Ware v. Comm\u2019r, </em>906 F.2d 62, 65 (2d Cir.1990). The question is whether the timing of the argument specifically prejudices the taxpayer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">In this case, Debtors do not identify any manner in which they were prejudiced, nor do we conclude that they were. Characterizing the Service as claiming that the valuation was not accurate, versus that it did not clearly reflect income, does not change the nature of the dispute or what evidence would be relevant at trial. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Life Underwriters, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>30 F.3d 1526, 1531 (D.C.Cir.1994) (suggesting no prejudice where question is \"how to <em>characterize </em>the transactions involved, the raw facts seeming to be established\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\">. In addition to these issues noted by the bankruptcy court, Rayner estimated the future cash flow of the receivables on a post-tax rather than a pre-tax basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\">. The dissent's purported distinction of <em>Thor </em>is, as we have noted, \"immaterial to <em>Thor\u2019s </em>application to the present case. The Court noted <em>Thor\u2019s </em>lack of regulatory compliance simply as an indication that the Commissioner was within his discretion in finding Thor\u2019s determinations not clearly reflective of income. <em>See id. </em>at 533, 537, 99 S.Ct. 773. The fact remains that the Court subjected Thor's market value determination to the clear reflection of income standard of \u00a7 446(b).\u201d <em>See supra, </em>at 248.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. The dissent suggests that the Seventh Circuit in <em>JPMorgan Chase </em>placed the burden on the Service to establish that its method was lawful and not arbitrary. But the Court in <em>JPMorgan Chase </em>clearly stated, \"In applying the arbitrary or unlawful standard, the tax court should bear in mind that the taxpayer retains the burden of proof.\u201d 458 F.3d at 571. The dissent also entirely ignores the fact that the Seventh Circuit only remanded on this issue because the Tax Court made an error that the bankruptcy court here did not: it showed too little deference to the Commissioner's method. <em>Id. </em>at 571-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b274-9\">NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Relying on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446(b), the majority permits the IRS simply to characterize the dispute in this case as one involving the taxpayer\u2019s <em>method of accounting </em>and thereby avoid a trial and decision by a factfinder on the fair market value of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">During the course of this litigation, the IRS declared that the taxpayer\u2019s valuation of its accounts receivable was an <em>accounting method </em>that did not clearly reflect income. Therefore, the IRS claimed its right under \u00a7 446(b) to recompute the taxpayer\u2019s taxes under a method that does clearly reflect income. The problem with this approach was that the IRS and the taxpayer did not dispute a method of accounting, but only the valuation of the taxpayer\u2019s asset\u2014its accounts receivable. All of the taxpayer\u2019s practices properly regarded as methods of accounting were never in dispute, and the methods the taxpayer used clearly reflected income (or loss) to the very last detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The IRS and the taxpayer agreed on the taxpayer\u2019s overall method of accounting\u2014 <em>the accrual method. </em>The IRS and the taxpayer agreed on how, under the accrual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>method, to value the taxpayer\u2019s accounts <em>receivable\u2014the mark-to-market method. </em>The IRS and the taxpayer agreed on how to calculate income or loss using the mark-to-market <em>method\u2014by subtracting the market value of the accounts receivable from their book value. </em>The IRS and the taxpayer agreed on the method of determining the market value of the receiv<em>ables\u2014by reducing the book value to present value by applying a discount rate. </em>The IRS and the taxpayer agreed on the book value of the accounts receivable\u2014 <em>$1,073,234,932. </em>Finally, the IRS and the taxpayer agreed on how to determine the discount <em>rate\u2014by adding a risk premium to the risk-free rate of return. </em>In short, there was no disagreement over the taxpayer\u2019s <em>method of accounting</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, this agreement on accounting methods resulted in very similar valuations. The IRS and the taxpayer agreed on a value of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts receivable within 2%. The narrow disagreement between the IRS and the taxpayer was over the proper risk premium to add to the risk-free rate of return to get a discount rate to apply to the book value, ultimately to reach the market value. That narrow issue is a factual question that must be resolved by a factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Under the majority\u2019s view, the taxpayer never receives a trial on the fact of the appropriate risk premium by which to discount the book value of its accounts receivable. Rather, the majority upholds the IRS\u2019s post-trial declaration that the selection of a particular risk premium is a <em>method of accounting </em>within the IRS\u2019s regulatory purview. Under the majority\u2019s view, <em>at no point </em>is the taxpayer entitled to a finding of fact on the disputed issue by a neutral adjudicator. Thus, the IRS may always decree that the taxpayer\u2019s position on valuing accounts receivable fails to clearly reflect income and therefore is subject to recomputation by the IRS under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446(b) \"without a trial. The IRS\u2019s authority to regulate the tax accounting system, however, does not reach down to this level of detail, and it should not. If the IRS and the taxpayer disagree on the proper discount percentage to apply to the book value of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts receivable, the taxpayer is entitled to have a factfinder resolve the disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">What is even more troubling in this case is that even if the IRS had such a broad authority to deny the taxpayer a fact trial on its accounts receivable valuation, its exercise of that power was unreasonable and unfair. The IRS undertook to exercise its \u201cclear reflection\u201d authority for the first time <em>in a litigation document prepared after trial. </em>The IRS thus put the taxpayer through an elaborate and costly trial, undertaken to determine the valuation of the accounts receivable, only to then preempt the trial\u2019s results by declaring, during post-trial briefing, that the case was resolvable by IRS fiat under \u00a7 446(b). (As the IRS\u2019s internal procedures now recognize, this practice was unreasonable. <em>See </em>Rev. Proc.2002-18 \u00a7 7, 2002-1 C.B. 678). Deference to the IRS\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>regulatory authority under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 446(b) should be based on more than the post-trial briefing decision of a Department of Justice line attorney. <em>See Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, </em>488 U.S. 204, 213, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (\u201cDeference to what appears to be nothing more than an agency\u2019s convenient litigating position would be entirely inappropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Even under its own rationale, the majority has chosen the wrong remedy. In cases where the IRS declares unreasonable a taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting, the IRS must still demonstrate that <em>its own method </em>is lawful and not arbitrary. In this case, the bankruptcy court, despite finding several serious flaws with the IRS\u2019s valuation, did not decide whether that valuation was lawful and not arbitrary. The Seventh Circuit, on which the majority relies so heavily, has required just such a remand. <em>See JPMorgan Chase, </em>458 F.3d at 572 (vacating in part and remanding for evaluation of Commissioner\u2019s chosen valuation method). The majority improperly assumes that even though the bankruptcy court has never addressed the issue, it would nonetheless uphold the IRS\u2019s method. But that is not our decision to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">My position is not a far-reaching one\u2014 only a demand for simple procedural fairness. My position does not deny the IRS any of the authority that it was given under the Internal Revenue Code. I would simply remand this case so that the bankruptcy court can determine the value of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts receivable. The IRS should not be able to avoid such fact-finding simply by declaring that the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cmethod of accounting\u201d is improper, particularly after agreeing to every aspect of that accounting method. This case centers solely on the proper percentage by which to reduce book value to market value, and up until now, the taxpayer has not had the opportunity to have this issue tried and resolved. Under the majority\u2019s holding, it never will.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In sum, I would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the bankruptcy court to make a factual finding on the proper valuation of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts receivable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> This agreement on the method of accounting makes this case quite different from <em>Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, </em>439 U.S. 522, 99 S.Ct. 773, 58 L.Ed.2d 785 (1979), on which the majority relies. In <em>Thor Power Tool, </em>the taxpayer\u2019s \"method of inventory accounting\u201d was \"plainly inconsistent with <em>the governing Regulations </em>\u201d and the taxpayer \" 'made no effort to determine the purchase or reproduction cost\u2019 of its 'excess\u2019 inventoiy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532-33, 535, 99 S.Ct. 773 (emphasis added). This distinction also applies to <em>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, </em>458 F.3d 564, 569 (7th Cir.2006), where the taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting similarly violated IRS <em>regulations. </em>Here, not only was the taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting consistent with all governing law and regulations, but the IRS explicitly agreed with the taxpayer\u2019s method in all material respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
