We dismiss the appeal from the March 30, 2005, order denying in part the motion for summary judgment for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. We also grant Segrave Aviation, Incorporated and M&amp;F Air, Incorporated\u2019s (collectively \u201cSegrave\u201d) motion to dismiss the appeal from the July 14, 2005, order denying PWCC\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-20\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-21\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 30, 2005. The notice of appeal was filed on July 28, 2005. Because PWCC failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. The district court\u2019s order granting an extension of time to file a Rule 59(e) motion beyond the ten-day period did not defer the commencement of the appeal period. <em>See Alston v. MCI Communications Corp., 84 F.3d </em>705 (4th Cir.1996). Nor did the July 28, 2005, order denying Segrave\u2019s motion for reconsideration by amending the March 30 order start the appeal period anew. The amendment did not materially alter the March 30 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">Although the notice of appeal from the July 14, 2005, order denying PWCC\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration was timely, we must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>eral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The July 14 order PWCC seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we grant Segrave\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as to that order. We deny as moot that part of the motion seeking to dismiss the appeal from the March 30 order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
