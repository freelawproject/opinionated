Applying the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, the district court sentenced Richardson on February 2, 2004, to a 324-month term of imprisonment. Because that sentence violated Richardson\u2019s Sixth Amendment jury trial right, as subsequently determined in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we vacated the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See United States v. Richardson, </em>128 Fed.Appx. 305, 309-10 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">At resentencing, the district court calculated the <em>recommended </em>Sentencing Guideline range to be 324 to 405 months, but imposed a 180-month term of imprisonment. The district court gave three reasons for imposing the variance sentence: (1) Richardson\u2019s \u201cyouthfulness\u201d at the time of the criminal conduct; (2) her good character prior to becoming the girlfriend of one of the principal members of the drug conspiracy; and (3) her post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts. The government appeals the variance sentence, contending that the reasons given by the district court did not justify the extraordinary variance, and therefore the sentence imposed was unreasonable. We agree and accordingly remand for resentencing, but we do not rule out any variance as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">Following <em>Booker, </em>we review sentences for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. \u201cA sentence falling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>outside of the properly calculated Guidelines range is not <em>ipso facto </em>unreasonable,\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), for if a sentence within that range does not serve the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), a court must \u201cselect a sentence that does serve those factors,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 456. The reasons for the variance, therefore, \u201cmust be based on the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>id., </em>and the district court must \u201carticulate the[se] reasons,\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In reviewing a variance sentence, we consider \u201cwhether the district court acted reasonably with respect to (1) the imposition of a variance sentence, and (2) the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434. If the district court \u201cprovides an inadequate statement of reasons[,] relies on improper factors,\u201d or gives \u201cexcessive weight to any relevant factor,\u201d the sentence \u201cwill be found unreasonable and vacated.\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. Also, \u201cwhere the variance is a substantial one,\u201d such as here, \u201cwe must more carefully scrutinize the reasoning offered by the district court in support of the sentence,\u201d and \u201cthe farther the court diverges from the advisory guidelines range, the more compelling the reasons for divergence must be.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In this case, the district court was impressed with Richardson\u2019s good character prior to becoming the girlfriend of one of the conspiracy\u2019s principal members. The court saw in Richardson a person of good character with little criminal history (one conviction for use of a \u201csimple worthless check\u201d and one conviction for marijuana possession) whose present criminality was substantially influenced by her romantic relationship with one of the conspiracy\u2019s principals. This conclusion was fortified by Richardson\u2019s rehabilitative efforts between the first and second sentencing proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We conclude, however, that the reasons offered by the district court do not provide a basis sufficiently compelling to justify the substantial downward variance granted in this case-a reduction of Richardson\u2019s sentence from a recommended range of 324 to 405 months to 180-months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\"><em>First, </em>Richardson\u2019s prior good character, the effect of her personal relationship with a principal in the conspiracy on her criminal activities, and her lack of notable criminal record may relate to some \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, but they are not so extraordinary as to provide a compelling basis on which to support a large variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\"><em>Second, </em>the district court\u2019s reliance on Richardson\u2019s youth was misplaced. A district court is required to consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5)(A). One such policy statement provides that \u201cage (including youth) is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\"><em>Third, </em>the district court\u2019s reliance upon Richardson\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts was similarly misplaced. The Sentencing Commission has issued a policy statement indicating that \u201cpost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when re-sentencing the defendant for that offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.19. The discouraged sentencing factor of youthfulness and the inappropriate sentencing factor of post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts cannot provide a \u201ccompelling\u201d basis for a substantial variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\"><em>Finally, </em>the district court failed to account for the seriousness of Richardson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>criminal conduct and to demonstrate how such a large variance would serve the primary purposes of sentencing that are described in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Richardson was convicted for her participation in a wide-ranging, multi-year drug trafficking conspiracy based in New Bern, North Carolina. During that time, she was the girlfriend of a principal member of the conspiracy. The evidence presented at trial established that she was extensively involved, demonstrating that she stored drugs; that she stored cash proceeds from drug sales; that she transported cocaine shipments from New York to North Carolina; that she transported co-conspirators to drug sales; that she attended the conversion of powder cocaine into crack cocaine; that she facilitated communication among her co-conspirators by transporting messages among them; that she obtained a firearm for her coconspirators; that she helped her co-conspirators evade arrests, including one who had committed murder; that she permitted the concealment of a murder weapon behind residence; and that she herself sold crack cocaine on occasion. We conclude that the substantial variance sentence imposed does not \u201creflect the seriousness\u201d of this conduct, \u201cpromote respect for the law\u201d that was broken, nor \u201cprovide just punishment\u201d for Richardson\u2019s prolonged entanglement with the drug trafficking conspiracy. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">For the reasons given, we vacate Richardson\u2019s variance sentence because the extent of the variance was unreasonable. Our holding, however, does not deny the court discretion to impose a variance sentence as appropriate to support the sentencing factors found in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
