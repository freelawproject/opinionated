The district court sentenced Jonathon and Debbie Singleton to 360 months\u2019 and 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">On appeal, Jonathon Singleton contends the district court abused its discretion in admitting Debbie Singleton\u2019s hearsay statements into evidence over defense objection. Mr. Singleton argues that the district court\u2019s ruling runs afoul of Fed. R.Evid. 403, 404(b), and 801(d)(2)(E). Debbie Singleton joins in Mr. Singleton\u2019s argument as it pertains to Rules 403 and 404(b). She additionally contends that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction and that the district court erred in imposing its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">The Singletons contend that the district court erred by admitting statements into evidence over defense objection. We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Lancaster, </em>96 F.3d 734, 744 (4th Cir.1996). Such discretion is abused only when a district court has acted \u201carbitrarily or irrationally.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>27 F.3d 969, 974 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, evidentiary rulings based on erroneous legal conclusions are \u201cby definition an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, 198 F.3d </em>425, 430 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Jonathon Singleton argues that Debbie Singleton\u2019s statements made on or about March 6, 2003 were not properly admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) because they were made prior to the existence of the conspiracy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">To admit evidence as a co-conspirator\u2019s statement [under Rule 801(d)(2)(E)], a court must conclude (1) that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the party against whom the admission of the evidence is sought and (2) that the statements at issue were made during the course of and in furtherance of that conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em>United States v. Blevins, </em>960 F.2d 1252, 1255 (4th Cir.1992). The government bears the burden of establishing these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Neal, </em>78 F.3d 901, 905 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In the instant case, the indictment charged that the conspiracy began on or about March 6, 2003. Prior to the admission of the statements at issue, the Government presented the testimony of Lonnie Crigger. He testified as to the identities of the co-conspirators, including the Singletons, and their respective roles in the conspiracy. The Government offered various Western Union wire transfer documents into evidence, confirming Crigger\u2019s testimony that he sent money to the Singletons via an intermediary\u2014 Roger Oxford. Though the earliest document was dated April 2, 2003, it is clear from the testimony that plans between Crigger and Oxford as well as Oxford and the Singletons were made prior to this date. It was in this context that narcotics detective Robert Lincoln testified to Ms. Singleton\u2019s statements, establishing that the Singletons actively sought a supplier in furtherance of their plan to distribute methamphetamine. As the Government established the requisite elements by a preponderance of the evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Debbie Singleton\u2019s statements against Jonathon Singleton under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Additionally, both Jonathon and Debbie Singleton argue that Detective Lincoln\u2019s testimony was improper Rule 404(b) evidence and was unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. We have broadly interpreted Rule 404(b), holding that it \u201cis an inclusive rule that allows admission of evidence of other acts relevant to an issue at trial except that which proves only criminal disposition.\u201d <em>United States v. Watford, </em>894 F.2d 665, 671 (4th Cir.1990). \u201cEvidence of prior bad acts is admissible if it is (1) relevant to an issue other than character, (2) necessary to show an essential part of the crime or the context of the crime, and (3) rehable.\u201d <em>United States v. Powers, </em>59 F.3d 1460, 1464 (4th Cir.1995). Exclusion under Rule 403 is required \u201conly in those instances where the trial judge believes that there is a genuine risk that the emotions of the jury will be excited to irrational behavior, and that this risk is disproportionate to the probative value of the offered evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1467 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The testimony at issue established the dynamic of the relationship between the Singletons and illuminated the acts taken in preparation of their plan to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>methamphetamine. Such testimony was therefore relevant to the offense charged. Further, any danger of unfair prejudice was slight in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Therefore, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Debbie Singleton also contends that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, we consider whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We review both direct and circumstantial evidence, and permit the \u201cgovernment the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">To prove conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute a controlled substance, the government must establish that: (1) two or more persons agreed to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute the substance; (2) the defendant knew of the conspiracy; and (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily became part of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 857 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). A defendant may be convicted of conspiracy without knowing all the conspiracy\u2019s details, so long as she joins the conspiracy understanding its unlawful nature and willfully joins in the plan on at least one occasion. <em>Id. </em>at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The evidence presented at trial established that Ms. Singleton was an instrumental part of the conspiracy. She attempted to secure a supplier, acted as intermediary between Mr. Singleton and other co-conspirators, received funds, and mailed methamphetamine to at least one distributor. Therefore, construing the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. To the extent Ms. Singleton argues the Government\u2019s case rested almost entirely on the \u201cseriously questionable\u201d testimony of Teresa Nicks, it is not the province of this court to second-guess the credibility determinations of the factfinder. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Debbie Singleton finally contends that the district court erred in imposing its sentence. She initially argues that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant her a role reduction under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2005) was improper. She asserts that there were other individuals involved in the criminal activity who were more culpable than herself. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The district court denied Ms. Singleton\u2019s request for a role reduction. In doing so, the court determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\">[fit\u2019s clear from the evidence in this case that [Ms. Singleton] was involved in this drug conspiracy throughout at a very high degree. [Ms. Singleton] dealt with those who dealt with the conspiracy generally, she was involved in the essential roles in the conspiracy in terms of sale, packaging, transportation, receipt of money for drugs, all of which she was involved in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Because the materials in the joint appendix support the district court\u2019s findings, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>conclude that it was not clearly erroneous for the court to refuse Ms. Singleton a role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Ms. Singleton also argues that the district court failed to give proper weight to mitigating factors at sentencing. However, the district court appropriately calculated the advisory guideline range and considered it in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). Ms. Singleton\u2019s 292-month sentence, which is at the lowest end of the applicable guideline range and below the statutory maximum, is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. Though the court concededly failed to explicitly discuss \u00a7 3553(a) factors on the record, we conclude it does not render Ms. Singleton\u2019s sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cRequiring district courts to address each factor on the record would ... be an exercise in unproductive repetition that would invite flyspecking on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We therefore affirm the judgments of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
