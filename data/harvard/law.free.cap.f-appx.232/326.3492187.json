Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Chacon-Sorto cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1281(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We also find that Chacon-Sorto fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). Chacon-Sorto fails to make this requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
