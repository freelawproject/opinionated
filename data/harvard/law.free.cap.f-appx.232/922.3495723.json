Watson, the Village of Miami Shores, the law firm of Genovese, Job-love and Battista, and several individual defendants, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), because she failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order to conform her amended complaint to the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) and 10(b). We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">The district court dismissed Goodison\u2019s third complaint because: (1) she failed to make meaningful modifications to her complaint in order to comply with Rule 8(a)(2); and (2) she continued to employ a \u201cshotgun approach\u201d to pleading, making it virtually impossible for the defendants to answer. The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Goodison\u2019s complaint. <em>Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985) (stating we review orders dismissing complaints based on non-compliance for an abuse of discretion). A district court may dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>under Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>41(b) for failure to prosecute or failure to obey a court order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>Hildebrand v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe legal standard to be applied under Rule 41(b) is whether there is a \u2018clear record of delay or willful contempt and a finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u2019 Dismissal of a case with prejudice is considered a sanction of last resort, applicable only in extreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Goforth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535 (internal citation omitted). Even though the district court instructed Goodison to re-draft her complaint in order to make it more concise, her third amended complaint was approximately eight pages longer than her original 57-page complaint. Furthermore, her third amended complaint, like her original complaint, contained multiple pages of irrelevant factual allegations and redundant narratives. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) (requiring a pleading contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">In addition, as the district court correctly noted, it was impossible to discern how the defendants could answer Goodison\u2019s complaint because she repeatedly failed to comply with Rule 10(b) by ensuring that each count stated a legal basis for the claim it set forth. Rule 10(b) requires the averments of a claim \u201cshall be made in numbered paragraphs, the contents of each of which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances ... [and][e]ach claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence ... shall be stated in a separate count.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b). Moreover, Goodison continued to employ a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach in her third amended complaint by including approximately 60 legal and non-legal subheadings/counts, and, in several instances, she did not even designate which \u201cdefendants\u201d she was accusing. We have determined that \u201cshotgun\u201d complaints are not sufficient pleadings, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-10\">The typical shotgun complaint contains several counts, each one incorporating by reference the allegations of its predecessors, leading to a situation where most of the counts (i.e., all but the first) contain irrelevant factual allegations and legal conclusions. Consequently, in ruling on the sufficiency of a claim, the trial court must sift out the irrelevaneies, a task that can be quite onerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-11\"><em>Strategic Income Fund, L.L.C. v. Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg Corp., </em>305 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2002). In such cases, it is important for a court to \u201cnarrow and define the issues from the earliest stages of the litigation.\u201d <em>Ebrahimi v. City of Huntsville Bd. of Educ., </em>114 F.3d 162, 165 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cAbsent such efforts, shotgun notice pleadings ... would impede the orderly, efficient, and economic disposition of disputes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Goodison\u2019s third amended complaint, pursuant to Rule 41(b), because Goodison made no meaningful attempt to comply with the district court\u2019s orders despite being given multiple opportunities to file amended complaints. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-6\">. In <em>Bonner v.
