Thompson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. Califor</em>nia, 386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that the district court erred in sentencing Thompson. Thompson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but elected not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-27\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. However, in imposing a sentence post <em>-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Here, the district court treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Thompson only after considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Thompson\u2019s 188-month sentence is presumptively reasonable, as it is within the appropriate guideline range, and below the forty year statutory maximum sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 861(a)(1) and (b). As neither Thompson nor the record suggests any information to rebut the presumption, we find that Thompson\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
