The district court sentenced him to a 180-month sentence. Curbelo\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Curbelo has filed a pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-25\">Counsel suggests that the district court erred by denying Curbelo\u2019s motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>miss the indictment based upon the destruction of drug evidence before his retrial. Counsel asserts that the evidence was destroyed in bad faith in contravention of a court order. Counsel also contends that Curbelo was prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence because it prevented independent testing of the drugs and examination of the plastic bags for latent fingerprints, resulting in a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Supreme Court has held that, to establish a due process violation for failure to preserve evidence, a defendant must show that the evidence possessed exculpatory value that was apparent prior to its destruction and that the defendant cannot obtain comparable evidence by another means. <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 488-89, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). However, \u201cthe failure to preserve this \u2018potentially useful evidence\u2019 does not violate due process <em>\u2018unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police.\u2019 \u201d Illinois v. Fisher, </em>540 U.S. 544, 547-48, 124 S.Ct. 1200, 157 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2004) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988)); <em>see United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 334 (4th Cir.2003) (discussing test).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Even if the drug evidence and the plastic bags were potentially useful evidence, Curbelo failed to show that the evidence was destroyed in bad faith. Rather, trial testimony disclosed that the evidence was deteriorating to the point that it could have contaminated other evidence. We therefore conclude that the destruction of the drug evidence did not amount to a violation of Curbelo\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Therefore, we affirm Curbelo\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-17\"> We grant Curbelo\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We have \u25a0 carefully considered the claims raised therein and find them to be without merit. We decline to address Curbelo\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims in this direct appeal. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>United States v.
