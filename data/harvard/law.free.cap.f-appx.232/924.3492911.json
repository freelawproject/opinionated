Army Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>720 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir.1983) (stating we review dismissals without prejudice for abuse of discretion). A district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a plaintiffs action for failure to comply with the rules or any order of the court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Tanner failed to follow the district court\u2019s instructions on how to amend her complaint in order to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. A pleading should contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Tanner\u2019s amended complaint does not consist of simple statements connecting each claimed wrong with an identifiable defendant. It remains in excess of 150 pages with the same unnecessary exhibits. Although the district court\u2019s order provided a standard form, a clear description of what her complaint should contain, and page and exhibit limitations, the overall form and content of Tanner\u2019s amended complaint show that she did not comply with the district court\u2019s order after being warned of the conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>quences. Although courts liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, the litigant is still required to conform to procedural rules, and the court is not required rewrite a deficient pleading. <em>See GJR Investments, Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Tanner\u2019s argument that lack of knowledge and access to procedural rules justify her noncompliance fails because the court provided her with an explanation of the rules within its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
