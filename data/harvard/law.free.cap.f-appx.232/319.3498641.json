Finding no merit to his appeals, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">Esquivel claims that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because, although he stipulated in his plea agreement \u201cthat the readily provable quantity of the controlled substance to be used for the purpose of establishing the base offense level is ... more than 50 kilograms of cocaine,\u201d he did not realize that he could be sentenced based on a quantity exceeding fifty kilograms of cocaine. We find that the district court conducted a thorough inquiry pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Absent extraordinary circumstances, an appellant is bound by his statements at the plea hearing. <em>Beck v. Angelone, </em>261 F.3d 377, 395-96 (4th Cir.2001). The record in this case does not support Esquivel\u2019s claim that he was confused about the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-17\"> Although he filed a notice of appeal from the forfeiture order, Esquivel did not challenge the order in his brief and therefore has waived the issue. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
