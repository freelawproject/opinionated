He contends that the IJ refused to allow him to submit evidence that his spouse had filed for an immediate visa on his behalf, which was a prerequisite to obtaining an adjustment of status based on his marriage. The record does not reflect that counsel moved to introduce Ufot\u2019s visa petition or any other documentation of his marriage to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that his marriage was entered into in good faith and was not entered into to procure his admission into the country as required by 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u00a7 1255(e)(3). <em>See also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(c)(8)(iii). Because Ufot did not make a prima facie showing that he was eligible for an adjustment of status, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to continue. <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555 (5th Cir.1997)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Ufot further argues that the BIA erred in not considering additional evidence that he submitted with his appeal or in not remanding the case to the IJ for consideration of the new evidence. Ufot was required to present evidence of good cause for the continuance to the IJ. The BIA will not make factfindings in deciding appeals. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 680 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). The proper procedure to present additional evidence is a motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider the additional evidence or in denying the request for a remand. <em>Matter of Ige, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 880, 884 (1994); <em>Magdaleno de Morales v.
