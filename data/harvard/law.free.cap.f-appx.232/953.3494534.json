Alls argues that the circuit\u2019s pattern <em>Allen </em>charge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> given by the district court in his case was inherently coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Our review of \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to give an <em>Allen </em>charge is limited to evaluating the coercive impact of the charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 846 (11th Cir.1998). When the district court does not poll the jury prior to reading the <em>Allen </em>charge, as here, we will reverse only if we find under the totality of the circumstances that the charge was inherently coercive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">In <em>Allen v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 501-02, 17 S.Ct. 154, 157, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a charge urging jurors to reconsider whether their opinions were reasonable and to fulfill their duty to decide the case if conscientiously possible. The Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments among the jurors themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 17 S.Ct. 154. Therefore, the Court stated that it \u201ccannot be the law that each juror should not listen with deference to the arguments, and with a distrust of his own judgment, if he finds a large majority of the jury taking a different view of the case from what he does himself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">In <em>United States v. Rey, </em>811 F.2d 1453, 1459 (11th Cir.1987), we considered our circuit\u2019s pattern <em>Allen </em>charge and stated that an <em>Allen </em>charge which urges jurors to reconsider whether their doubt is reasonable \u2018Virtually guarantees jury confusion\u201d and \u201ccan intimidate individual jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1459. Even so, we upheld the <em>Allen </em>charge based on our precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 1460; <em>see also United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1050-51 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>United States v. Chigbo, </em>38 F.3d 543, 545 (11th Cir.1994), we noted that the short time in which a jury returned its verdict after receiving the <em>Allen </em>charge did not change our decision. Also, we have held that a jury does not need to indicate a deadlock before the court issues an <em>Allen </em>charge. <em>Government of Canal Zone v. Fears, </em>528 F.2d 641, 644 (5th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Considering the totality of the circumstances shown in the record, we conclude that the <em>Allen </em>charge given by the district court was not inherently coercive. Accordingly, we affirm Alls\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-7\">. <em>See Eleventh Circuit Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions, </em>Trial Instruction No. 7 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-9\"><em>. </em>In <em>Bonner v.
