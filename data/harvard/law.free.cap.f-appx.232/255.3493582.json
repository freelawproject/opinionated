Knox filed an administrative complaint alleging that the United States Department of the Interior (\u201cDOI\u201d) violated the whistleblower provision of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7622. In <em>Knox v. United States Department of Labor, </em>434 F.3d 721 (4th Cir.2006), we vacated a prior order of the United States Department of Labor Administrative Review Board (\u201cARB\u201d), which had dismissed Knox\u2019s complaint, and remanded this case for further proceedings. On remand, the ARB again dismissed Knox\u2019s complaint, and he now petitions for review of the ARB\u2019s second order. For the reasons set forth below, we grant in part the petition for review, vacate in part the second order, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">We previously set forth the underlying facts in <em>Knox. See </em>434 F.3d at 722-23. Stated generally, DOI employed Knox at the National Park Service Job Corps Center (\u201cCenter\u201d) in Harper\u2019s Ferry, West Virginia. Knox\u2019s duties included acting as the Center\u2019s safety officer. In this capacity, Knox became concerned about the presence of asbestos at the Center and reported his concerns to DOI officials. According to Knox, DOI management retaliated against him because of his asbestos reports. Knox eventually filed this whistleblower action. After conducting a hearing, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that DOI had violated the CAA by retaliating against Knox. On DOI\u2019s appeal, the ARB rejected the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>decision and dismissed Knox\u2019s complaint, finding that he had not engaged in protected activity under the CAA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Knox then filed a petition for review of the ARB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In <em>Knox, </em>we concluded that the ARB had misapplied the legal standard it had announced for CAA-protected activity, and we therefore granted Knox\u2019s petition for review. Specifically, we noted that the ARB had stated that to establish he engaged in protected activity under the CAA, Knox had to prove he reasonably believed DOI was emitting asbestos into the \u201cambient air\u201d (ie., air external to buildings) when he expressed his concerns to DOI officials. In attempting to apply this standard, the ARB recognized that Knox testified he had observed asbestos escaping from the Center into the ambient air through an exhaust fan, but it nonetheless found that he had not engaged in protected activity because he had not told DOI management about the exhaust fan.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Noting that there \u201care several ways to violate the CAA and its implementing regulations without releases into the ambient air,\u201d we expressed our doubts about the correctness of the ARB\u2019s \u201cambient air\u201d standard, <em>Knox, </em>434 F.3d at 724 n. 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but we determined that the ARB\u2019s decision was incorrect even under that standard because the evidence established that Knox did, in fact, reasonably believe that asbestos was escaping into the ambient air. As we explained, \u201c[although the contents of Knox\u2019s complaints may provide evidence of his reasonable beliefs, it does not follow that he must have necessarily conveyed a notion to have reasonably believed it, as the ARB demanded of him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. Accordingly, we held that Knox had engaged in CAA-protected activity under the ARB\u2019s \u201cambient air\u201d standard, and we remanded the case to the ARB for further proceedings. In doing so, we instructed the ARB to determine whether DOI retaliated against Knox because of this protected activity, and we noted that \u201c[wjhile the protected activity standard announced by the ARB did not require Knox to convey his reasonable beliefs to DOI management, DOI\u2019s awareness of his complaints may prove relevant in an analysis of the causal connection between his protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">On remand, the ARB expressly acknowledged our skepticism about its previously announced \u201cambient air\u201d standard, and it agreed with our suggestion that the CAA standard for protected activity is broader. Consequently, the ARB stated \u201cthat an employee engages in protected activity under the CAA when he or she expresses a concern, and reasonably believes, that the employer has either violated an [EPA] regulation implementing the CAA or has emitted or might emit, at a risk to the general public, potentially hazardous materials into the ambient air.\u201d J.A. 148. The ARB then rejected Knox\u2019s claim for two reasons. First, the ARB concluded, without elaboration, that \u201cKnox neither argues nor does the record contain any evidence that DOI was violating any EPA regulations implementing the CAA.\u201d J.A. 148 n. 5. Second, the ARB found that Knox did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>not express his concern about asbestos escaping through the exhaust fan to DOI officials, and \u201csince DOI was not aware of Knox\u2019s protected activity, it could not have retaliated against him because of his protected activity.\u201d J.A. 149. Accordingly, the ARB dismissed Knox\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In challenging the dismissal of his complaint, Knox primarily argues that the ARB erred by focusing on the ambient air issue. Knox contends that the ARB improperly disregarded evidence concerning his belief that DOI had violated EPA-work practice standards. Knox states that he \u201cwas concerned about renovations and maintenance activity that had disturbed the asbestos, causing it to be emitted into the air and posing a hazard to students, staff and visitors at the Center. He expressed these concerns on a number of occasions, both to his direct supervisor and other DOI management officials, as well as to outside agencies such as the EPA.\u201d <em>Brief for Petitioner, </em>at 11. For her part, the Secretary of Labor primarily argues that substantial evidence supports the ARB\u2019s finding that DOI did not retaliate against Knox because DOI was not aware of Knox\u2019s reasonable belief that asbestos was being emitted into the ambient air from the Center. Reading our <em>Knox </em>opinion narrowly, the Secretary also contends that \u201cthe EPA work-practice standard regulations are not implicated in the relevant causal relationship analysis,\u201d and that in any event \u201cthe evidence does not show that, before Knox filed his whistleblower complaint ..., DOI was aware of any concerns Knox might have had relating specifically to violations of these work-practice standards.\u201d <em>Brief for the Secretary of Lar bor, </em>at 23 &amp; n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">To the extent that Knox\u2019s claim is based on his concern about asbestos escaping into the ambient air from the Center, we hold that the ARB\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. As Knox\u2019s counsel admitted at oral argument, there is no evidence in the record to establish that Knox specifically reported his concern about asbestos escaping into the ambient air from the Center to DOI officials, and he has not pointed to any evidence that otherwise sufficiently establishes that DOI was aware of Knox\u2019s ambient air concern. Thus, although Knox may have engaged in protected activity regarding ambient air emissions under the ARB\u2019s previously announced standard because he reasonably believed that asbestos was being emitted from the Center, <em>see Knox, </em>434 F.3d at 725, DO could not have retaliated against him because of this belief because of his failure to bring it to the attention of DO officials. <em>See generally Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke Valley, </em>145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir.1998) (\u201cSince, by definition, an employer cannot take action because of a factor of which it is unaware, the employer\u2019s knowledge that the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity is absolutely necessary to establish\u201d the causal connection between the protected activity and an adverse action).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">To the extent that Knox\u2019s claim is based on his concern about EPA-work practice standard violations, we believe that a remand is necessary for further consideration by the ARB. As we noted, in rejecting this aspect of Knox\u2019s claim the ARB stated simply that \u201cKnox neither argues nor does the record contain any evidence that DOI was violating any EPA regulations implementing the CAA.\u201d J.A. 148 n. 5. We find this conclusion to be problematic for at least two reasons. First, although it suggests that Knox is required to prove that DOI was actually violating EPA regulations in order to prevail on his claim, Knox is only required to prove that he had a good-faith, reasonable belief that DOI was violating an applicable EPA regulation and that he expressed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>belief to DOI. Second, Knox has, in fact, presented some evidence that arguably tends to establish that he informed DOI officials about his concern that EPA-work practice standards had been violated. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 348 (Knox stating in a letter to the DOI Secretary that \u201c[o]ver the years, ... EPA Laws ... had been violated\u201d). On remand, the ARB should reconsider the entire record in light of Knox\u2019s contention that he reported EPA-work practice standard violations to DOI management, and it should specifically explain its findings and legal conclusions. In remanding this case, we express no opinion on the ultimate merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Based on the foregoing, we grant in part the petition for review, vacate in part the ARB\u2019s order, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED IN PART, ORDER VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">.
