Salazar was sentenced to three years in prison and, subsequently, was deported to Mexico. On February 12, 2006, Salazar was arrested in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and charged with Driving While Impaired. Salazar was then charged with illegal re-entry. Salazar pled guilty to the illegal re-entry charge pursuant to a plea agreement and was sentenced to forty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment. Salazar timely noted an appeal and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Salazar raises only one issue on appeal-whether his sentence was reasonable and complied with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Following <em>Booker, </em>a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, after making appropriate findings of fact, the court must correctly determine the applicable advisory guidelines range and consult the range in imposing sentence. <em>United States v. More-land, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court is then required to consider \u201cother relevant factors set forth in the guidelines and those factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) before imposing sentence.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. \u201cA sentence that falls within the properly calculated advisory guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 433. This court will affirm a sentence as long as it is within the prescribed statutory range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. Reasonableness review involves procedural and substantive components. <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434. Here, Salazar\u2019s sentence was both proeedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">In preparing Salazar\u2019s pre-sentence report, the probation officer correctly determined Salazar\u2019s base offense level, criminal history points, and adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Based on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of III, Salazar\u2019s resulting guidelines range recommended a sentence of 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the applicable advisory guidelines range, the district court specifically stated that it had considered counsel\u2019s sentencing argument and the factors in \u00a7 3553. The court then imposed a sentence of forty-eight months, which was at the low end of Salazar\u2019s guidelines range. Accordingly, Salazar\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Salazar\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable. Salazar had previously been convicted of possession of cocaine for sale and had been deported. Salazar, however, entered a guilty plea to the offense charged in the current indictment and accepted responsibility for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>illegal re-entry. Also, Salazar faced a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, Salazar\u2019s sentence, at the low end of his guidelines range, was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this ease and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Salazar\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Salazar in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Salazar requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Salazar.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\"> Salazar was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief; he has not done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
