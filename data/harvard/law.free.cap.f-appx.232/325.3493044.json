Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined process, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2006), the immigration judge\u2019s decision is the final agency determination. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">Coulibaly challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his testimony was not credible and that he otherwise failed to meet his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and we uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the determination that Coulibaly failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Coulibaly cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 367 (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum-even though the facts that must be proved are the same-an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2000) ].\u201d). In addition, we uphold the finding that Coulibaly failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Mali. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Accordingly, we deny Coulibaly\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
