John\u2019s Ford, Inc., </em>No. 04-1209 (E.D.Va. July 11, 2005) (the \u201cFirst Opinion\u201d). Plaintiff Loveless has cross-appealed from the court\u2019s September 23, 2005 denial of his motion for front pay and his separate motion for liquidated damages (the \u201cSecond Opinion\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, we affirm the rulings in the First Opinion, and affirm the Second Opinion in part and reverse in part. More specifically, we affirm the Second Opinion\u2019s denial of Loveless\u2019s request for front pay and reverse its denial of his motion for liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">John\u2019s Ford is a Virginia corporation that operates several automobile dealerships in Northern Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alton Loveless was first employed by John\u2019s Ford in June 1975, and he worked until November 2000 in its Annandale, Virginia, dealership as a service advisor and service manager. In November 2000, Loveless was promoted to Parts and Service Director in John\u2019s Ford\u2019s Leesburg, Virginia, dealership under the supervision of Stephen Cohen. On October 14, 2003, Cohen advised Loveless that he was being \u201cretired,\u201d as were all department heads. Loveless\u2019s discharge from John\u2019s Ford was made effective that day, and he was thereafter unable to secure employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">On October 8, 2004, Loveless filed his complaint in this case in the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging a wrongful termination by John\u2019s Ford on the basis of age, in violation of the ADEA. The dispute was tried in the district court before a jury on June 1 and 2, 2005. Based on the evidence presented at trial, Loveless made numerous improvements in the Parts and Services Department while employed at the Leesburg dealership, successfully meeting or exceeding the goals set by Ford Motor Company and John\u2019s Ford. During this time, he received no warnings or criticisms from his supervisor concerning his job performance. Loveless had received one criticism from a co-worker, Tony Hudson, who conveyed to him, apparently at Cohen\u2019s request, the concern that Loveless was spending too much time smoking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>drinking coffee on the job. Loveless had confronted Cohen in that regard, explaining that when he was smoking he was still doing his job overseeing the Parts and Service Department, and offering to resign. Cohen rejected the offer, however, talking Loveless out of quitting. Both pri- or to and at the time Loveless was discharged, Cohen made age-related statements concerning Loveless, Wesley Brown (the dealership\u2019s Sales Manager), and Wilber Laznic, another older employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Loveless also presented evidence on the damages he suffered as a result of his discharge. Christopher Brown, an accountant testifying about Loveless\u2019s back-pay damages, opined that Loveless had lost approximately $250,000 in back wages as a result of his discharge. John\u2019s Ford challenged Brown\u2019s testimony on the basis of an evidence spoliation claim arising from Brown\u2019s failure to produce a worksheet he had used to gather information and create a chart used at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On June 2, 2005 the jury returned its verdict in favor of Loveless in the sum of $250,000, finding that John\u2019s Ford had willfully violated the AJDEA. After the trial, John\u2019s Ford filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative seeking a new trial. In his own post-trial motions, Loveless sought attorney fees and costs, liquidated damages, and either reinstatement or front pay. By its First Opinion, the district court, on July 11, 2005, denied John\u2019s Ford\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. By its Second Opinion, the court, on September 23, 2005, granted Loveless his attorney fees and costs, but denied his request for liquidated damages and for reinstatement or front pay. Each of the parties has filed a notice of appeal, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Price v. City of Charlotte, </em>93 F.3d 1241, 1245 (4th Cir.1996). When assessing whether a verdict is properly supported, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of all permissible inferences. <em>See Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413, 1417 (4th Cir.1991). If a reasonable jury could have returned a verdict for the prevailing party, we must defer to the jury verdict. <em>See id. </em>The award or denial of a new trial is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, and a denial thereof may only be reversed when the court has abused its discretion. <em>Cline v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 294, 305 (4th Cir.1998). We also review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s refusal to impose sanctions for the spoliation of evidence. <em>See Silvestri v. General Motors Corp., </em>271 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s denial of an award of front pay for abuse of discretion, <em>see Nichols v. Ashland Hosp. Corp., </em>251 F.3d 496, 504 (4th Cir.2001), and we review findings of fact on which such an award is based for clear error, <em>see Taylor v. Home Ins. Co., </em>777 F.2d 849, 860 (4th Cir.1985). Whether the ADEA mandates an award of liquidated damages to a prevailing ADEA plaintiff after a jury finding of willfulness is a legal question that we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Segers, </em>271 F.3d 181, 183 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">There are two appeals presented in this proceeding. First, John\u2019s Ford has appealed the rulings made in the district court\u2019s First Opinion, denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative a new trial. Second, Loveless has cross-appealed from the court\u2019s rulings in the Second Opinion, denying his request for front pay and declining to make an award of liquidated damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">John\u2019s Ford makes two basic contentions in its appeal of the First Opinion: (1) that the district court should have awarded judgment as a matter of law, and in the alternative should have awarded a new trial, because the evidence was insufficient to establish Loveless\u2019s claim of age discrimination; and (2) that the court should have granted judgment as a matter of law, and in the alternative a new trial, because of Brown\u2019s spoliation of the evidence upon which he based his opinions. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Under the ADEA, an employer may not discharge any employee because of age. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Generally, an ADEA plaintiff may prevail in an age discrimination case by proceeding under either a \u201cmixed-motive\u201d or a \u201cpretext\u201d framework. <em>See Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., </em>354 F.3d 277, 284-85 (4th Cir.2004). John\u2019s Ford contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish Loveless\u2019s age discrimination claim under either of these methods of proof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As explained below, this contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">John\u2019s Ford first asserts that Loveless was unable to prove age discrimination under the mixed-motive scheme because he did not present sufficient evidence to establish that Cohen\u2019s decision to discharge him was motivated by age. A showing by either direct or circumstantial evidence that age motivated an employer\u2019s adverse employment decision need not establish that the employee\u2019s age was the sole motivating factor; the plaintiff must only show that his age was a motivating factor in the adverse decision. <em>See Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., </em>354 F.3d 277, 284 (4th Cir.2004). In a \u201cmixed-motive\u201d case, it is sufficient that the plaintiff-employee show that his employer was motivated to take an adverse employment action by both forbidden and permissible reasons. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Here, there was ample direct evidence that Loveless\u2019s age was a motivating factor in Cohen\u2019s decision, made on behalf of John\u2019s Ford, to discharge Loveless. Loveless testified that, on October 14, 2003, Cohen told him he was being \u201cretired.\u201d When Loveless asked why, Cohen told him that he was \u201creplacing all his department heads. That he need[ed] younger, more aggressive Managers, people that he [could] groom to the way that he does business.\u201d J.A. 592. During this conversation, Cohen referred to Wes Brown, another older John\u2019s Ford employee, as \u201can F\u2019n dinosaur\u201d and told Loveless that Brown \u201cis next\u201d and \u201cshould have been gone a long time ago.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Vicki Surface, an assistant service manager, heard Cohen refer to another older employee, Wilber Laznic, as a \u201cdinosaur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">John\u2019s Ford\u2019s contention that there was an insufficient nexus between the foregoing comments and Loveless\u2019s termination is also without merit. Indeed, one of Cohen\u2019s derogatory comments was made when Loveless was terminated, and in direct response to Loveless\u2019s question of \u201cwhy me?\u201d In order for such remarks to be indicative of discrimination, they must not be isolated, and must be \u201crelated to the employment decision in question.\u201d <em>Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 608 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also O\u2019Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers, Corp., </em>56 F.3d 542, 549-50 (4th Cir.1995) (finding insuffident nexus between age-related statements and adverse employment action where plaintiff could not recall context of first statement, another statement was made in connection with ability to play golf, and third statement was no more than innocuous commentary on fact that all people grow older); <em>Birkbeck v. Marvel Lighting Corp., </em>30 F.3d 507, 511-12 (4th Cir.1994) (concluding that statement \u201cthere comes a time when we have to make way for younger people\u201d reflected \u201cno more than a fact of life\u201d and was too remote to show age discrimination). In these circumstances, the evidence before the jury was sufficient to demonstrate a nexus between Cohen\u2019s comments and Loveless\u2019s discharge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">John\u2019s Ford also contends on appeal that Loveless failed to prove his ADEA claim under the pretext scheme of proof, because he failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination and failed to rebut the legitimate nondiscriminatory reason that John\u2019s Ford gave for his discharge. To make a prima facie showing of age discrimination under the pretext framework, a plaintiff-employee is obliged to satisfy four factors, that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) he was at the relevant time performing his duties at a level that met his employer\u2019s legitimate expectations; and (4) his posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tion remained open or was filled by a similarly qualified applicant outside the protected class. <em>See Hill v. Lockheed Marlin Logistics Mgmt., </em>354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir.2004). The only disputed point here is the third of these four factors, whether Loveless sufficiently established that he was performing his duties at a level that met John\u2019s Ford\u2019s legitimate expectations at the time of his discharge. Put simply, the evidence in this case, viewed in the proper light, established that Loveless was performing his duties at a level that met John\u2019s Ford\u2019s legitimate expectations when he was fired. Indeed, Loveless and the Parts and Service Department at Leesburg had received numerous awards during the time he served as its Director. For example, John\u2019s Ford became \u201cBlue Oval Certified\u201d for the first time under Loveless\u2019s supervision, and Cohen described Loveless\u2019s handling of that process as \u201cbeautiful[ ].\u201d J.A. 627. Under Loveless\u2019s supervision, the Service Department won Ford\u2019s \u201cSatisfaction Pays\u201d contest in 2002, and the Leesburg dealership qualified for Ford\u2019s \u201cPresident\u2019s Award\u201d that same year. Loveless also achieved a Master Certification as Service Manager, Warranty Administrator, and Sales Manager in 2003, and Cohen confirmed that the Department was named one of the \u201cBest of Leesburg\u201d by the local newspaper that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Although John\u2019s Ford presented the jury with a competing account of Loveless\u2019s performance, we are, in assessing this contention, obliged to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Loveless. <em>See Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413, 1417 (4th Cir.1991). In so doing, we are satisfied that a reasonable jury was entitled to find that Loveless was, at the time of his discharge, performing his duties at a level that met John\u2019s Ford\u2019s legitimate expectations. As a result, we must reject the contention that Loveless failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">When a prima facie case has been presented, an inference of age discrimination arises/ and the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, that is, Loveless\u2019s discharge by John\u2019s Ford. <em>Williams v. Cerberonics, Inc., </em>871 F.2d 452, 455-56 (4th Cir.1989). If a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge is then shown, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the nondiseriminatory reason is pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 456. In this instance, John\u2019s Ford articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its discharge of Loveless. Cohen testified that Loveless \u201chad lost his focus and his desire to fulfill the necessary functions to remain as the service manager.\u201d J.A. 475-76. Although there were no records on Loveless\u2019s attendance, Cohen asserted that it was poor, that Loveless had an \u201coverall laissez-faire attitude,\u201d that he was indecisive, and that customers had complained about him. J.A. 48. These reasons were presented by John\u2019s Ford as its actual basis for Loveless\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Loveless was thus required to demonstrate that John\u2019s Ford\u2019s explanation was merely a \u201cpretext\u201d for discharging him. To establish such pretext, Loveless was obliged to show that John\u2019s Ford\u2019s otherwise legitimate explanation for his discharge was \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d and was therefore a coverup for age discrimination. <em>Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Loveless presented sufficient evidence to warrant the jury\u2019s rejection of John\u2019s Ford\u2019s explanation for his termination as pretext. First, contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>dictions between an employer\u2019s explanation for an adverse employment action at trial and its statements to the employee at the time of discharge constitute strong evidence of pretext. <em>See Alvarado v. Bd. of Trs. of Montgomery Cmty. Coll., </em>928 F.2d 118, 122-23 (4th Cir.1991) (finding pretext established where employer\u2019s explanation for termination at trial contradicted explanation at time of discharge). Here, Cohen\u2019s explanation at trial for Loveless\u2019s termination (poor work performance) contradicted his explanation to Loveless when he was fired (that Cohen wanted younger, more aggressive managers he could groom to his management style). Second, despite Cohen\u2019s repeated references to poor attendance, there were no attendance records showing that Loveless had missed work, and there were no records documenting any customer complaints about him. Finally, Cohen was unable to identify any occasion where he gave Loveless notice\u2014in person or in writing\u2014of any dissatisfaction with his job performance. Loveless thus provided sufficient evidence of pretext to support the jury verdict, and the denial of John\u2019s Ford\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In its second contention on the First Opinion, John\u2019s Ford maintains that the district court erred in denying judgment as a matter of law on its spoliation of evidence claim relating to Christopher Brown, Loveless\u2019s expert accountant on damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this point, John\u2019s Ford asserts that Brown\u2019s failure to preserve a worksheet underlying his opinions obliged the district court to grant judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">When a party either fails to preserve or destroys potential evidence in a foreseeable litigation, it can be deemed to have engaged in the \u201cspoliation of evidence,\u201d and a trial court may use its inherent power to impose an appropriate sanction. <em>See Silvestri v. General Motors Corp., </em>271 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir.2001). We have recognized that a judicial response to a spoliation of evidence should serve the twin purposes of \u201cleveling the evidentiary playing field and ... sanctioning the improper conduct.\u201d <em>Vodusek v. Bayliner Marine Corp., </em>71 F.3d 148, 156 (4th Cir.1995). The range of options available to a trial court in such situations includes dismissal (or here, judgment as a matter of law), but such a severe sanction should only be imposed when a lesser sanction will fail to serve the foregoing purposes. <em>Silvestri, </em>271 F.3d at 590. Moreover, a dismissal on the basis of spoliation of evidence is only appropriate if the conduct was \u201cso egregious as to amount to a forfeiture of [the] claim,\u201d or if the effect of the conduct was \u201cso prejudicial that it substantially denied the defendant the ability to defend the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In this case, there is no evidence that either Loveless, his lawyers, or Brown, acted so egregiously as to warrant judgment as a matter of law. Indeed, the information Brown gathered from Loveless and wrote by hand onto his missing worksheet had been entered into Brown\u2019s computer and transformed into a chart used by Brown at trial. Such a situation is a far cry from those instances of spoliation of evidence that could establish bad faith. <em>See id. </em>at 593-94 (concluding that even where attorney knew unpreserved vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>was central piece of evidence and defendant was not notified of claim until three years had passed, it was unclear whether failure to preserve would justify dismissal). These circumstances constitute, at most, a less obvious type of spoliation, where evidence is simply transformed from one form into another. <em>See </em>Jamie S. Gorelick, Stephen Marzen &amp; Lawrence Solum, <em>Destruction of Evidence </em>\u00a7 1.1. There is no indication in this record that Brown\u2019s failure to preserve the worksheet was intended to deprive the jury or John\u2019s Ford of any evidence, and these circumstances may not even warrant an instruction on an adverse inference, let alone judgment as a matter of law. <em>See S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co., </em>695 F.2d 253, 259 (7th Cir.1982) (concluding that destruction of handwritten notes used to draft memorandum did not support adverse inference where witness did not preserve notes because they were illegible and all necessary information was in memorandum).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">There is also no indication that Brown\u2019s failure to preserve the worksheet was prejudicial to John\u2019s Ford ability to defend against Loveless\u2019s ADEA claim. First, the information Brown placed on the worksheet concerned the value of Loveless\u2019s lost employment with John\u2019s Ford, and it was data that John\u2019s Ford had access to and presented through its own expert. Second, John\u2019s Ford emphasized the absence of the worksheet during its cross-examination of Brown, and the jury considered that point in assessing Brown\u2019s testimony. In these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant judgment to John\u2019s Ford as a matter of law, and we thus reject its appeal on this contention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Turning to Loveless\u2019s cross-appeal in this matter, he raises two contentions of error with respect to the district court\u2019s Second Opinion. First, he maintains that the court erred in denying his request for front pay. Second, he asserts that it also erred in denying his request for liquidated damages under the ADEA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b). We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">In contending that the district court erred in failing to award front pay on his ADEA claim, Loveless argues that the court abused its discretion when it appeared to focus solely on Loveless\u2019s lack of diligence in pursuing replacement employment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> John\u2019s Ford presented evidence that Loveless had sought employment during the first six months after his October 2003 discharge, failed to make any employment inquiries for four months in 2004, and then made inquiries only once a month thereafter. John\u2019s Ford also presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>evidence that the median duration of an unemployment period at that same time, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was just over ten weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The equitable remedy of front pay is generally available when an employer has terminated an employee unlawfully and the employee\u2019s reinstatement is not possible. <em>Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413, 1423 (4th Cir.1991). Front pay is designed to place a plaintiff in the financial position he would have been in had he been reinstated. <em>See Bruso v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 848, 862 (7th Cir.2001). Whether an award of front pay should be made in a case such as this rests squarely within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Duke, </em>928 F.2d at 1424. Cohen testified that Loveless had \u201cburned the bridge\u201d and could not return to work for John\u2019s Ford. Thus, it fell to the trial court to determine how much, if any, front pay Loveless should receive on his ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">There is no precise formula for determining whether or in what sum an award of front pay should be made. <em>See id. </em>at 1424 (\u201cThe appropriate method for addressing the difficult question of providing a remedy which anticipates potential future losses requires an analysis of all the circumstances existing at the time of trial.\u201d). The district court was thus entitled, in its front pay ruling, to consider the evidence that Loveless had been less than diligent in attempting to secure replacement employment. <em>See Barbour v. Merrill, </em>48 F.3d 1270, 1280 (D.C.Cir.1995) (identifying factors, including plaintiffs efforts in mitigating damages, that may properly be considered in awarding front pay). As a result, we are unable to find an abuse of discretion in this regard, and we affirm the court\u2019s denial of Loveless\u2019s claim to front pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Finally, Loveless contends that the court was obliged, under the ADEA, to make an award of liquidated damages to him on the basis of the jury\u2019s finding of willfulness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In its Second Opinion, the court declined to do so, concluding that such an award would bestow a windfall on Loveless, in that the jury had already awarded him $250,000 in back wages. As explained below, we agree with Loveless that, in light of the applicable provisions of the ADEA, plus the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985), and the pertinent decisions of our sister circuits, he was entitled to an award of liquidated damages once the jury found that John\u2019s Ford had willfully violated the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Under the ADEA, an award of liquidated damages should only be made if a violation of the statute if found to be willful. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 216(b), 626(b). However, the applicable provision of the ADEA indicates that an award of liquidated damages is mandatory upon a finding of willfulness. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b) (\u201c[Liquidated damages <em>shall </em>be payable only in cases of willful violations of [the ADEA].\u201d (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court has strongly indicated that a liquidated damages award to a prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ADEA plaintiff is mandatory upon a jury finding of -willfulness. <em>See Thurston, </em>469 U.S. at 125, 105 S.Ct. 613. In <em>Thurston, </em>the Court observed that the ADEA must be enforced in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), but observed that the remedial schemes of those Acts are not identical. <em>See id. </em>The Court stressed one specific difference, that although the FLSA renders an award of liquidated damages mandatory in all instances of its violation, the ADEA entitles prevailing plaintiffs to liquidated damages \u201conly in cases of willful violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court thus did not explicitly hold that a liquidated damages award is mandatory upon a finding of willfulness. <em>See id. </em>The Court did, however, recognize that the ADEA was to be distinguished from the FLSA (which mandates double damages in all cases where FLSA violations are established) by limiting ADEA liquidated damages awards to situations where the ADEA violation is found to be willful. <em>See id. </em>Thus, <em>Thurston </em>lends strong support to the proposition that, upon a jury\u2019s finding of willfulness, a liquidated damages award is mandatory for a prevailing ADEA plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Several of our sister circuits have explicitly held that a liquidated damages award to a prevailing ADEA plaintiff is mandatory upon a finding of willfulness. <em>See Tyler v. Union Oil Co., </em>304 F.3d 379, 401 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Liquidated damages in an amount equal to the back pay award are mandatory upon a finding of willfulness.\u201d); <em>Mathis v. Phillips Chevrolet, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 771, 777 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201c[Cjourts are required to assess liquidated damages in the same amount as the compensatory damages if the employer\u2019s violation of the [ADEA] was \u2018willful.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Greene v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>210 F.3d 1237, 1246 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cOnce a violation of the ADEA is determined to be willful, an award of liquidated damages is mandatory.\u201d); <em>McGinty v. State, </em>193 F.3d 64, 69 (2d Cir.1999) (assuming that because ADEA \u201cincorporat[es] the corresponding provisions of the [FLSA] ... the payment of liquidated damages in an amount equivalent to a plaintiff\u2019s award for back pay and benefits where the statutory violation was \u2018willful\u2019 \u201d is mandatory); <em>Hill v. Spiegel, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 233, 238 (6th Cir.1983) (\u201cOnce ... the jury found a willful violation ... the award of liquidated damages was the duty of the trial court.\u201d). Our circuit has not explicitly recognized that \u00a7 626(b) of the ADEA mandates that a liquidated damages award be made to a prevailing ADEA plaintiff upon a finding of willfulness. The controlling authorities support application of such a rule, however, and the foregoing decisions are consistent with our reading of the applicable statutory provision. We thus see a liquidated damages award as mandatory in this case, where Loveless is a prevailing plaintiff relying on a jury finding of a willful violation of the ADEA by John\u2019s Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In the context of this case, it is significant that John\u2019s Ford has not challenged the propriety of the jury instruction on willfulness, either at trial or in this appeal. And the jury was fully instructed on this point, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">If the defendant knew that its adverse employment action was a violation of the law or acted in reckless disregard of that fact, then its conduct was willful. If the defendant did not know or knew that the law was potentially applicable, but did not act in reckless disregard as to whether its conduct was prohibited by the law, even if it acted negligently, then such conduct was not willful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">J.A. 744. This instruction appears to be a straightforward and correct statement of the law as enunciated by the Supreme Court. <em>See Thurston, </em>469 U.S. at 128, 105 S.Ct. 613. Of additional importance, the evidence in this case, assessed under the appropriate standard, that is, in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>most favorable to Loveless, <em>see Duke, </em>928 F.2d at 1417, was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of a willful violation of the ADEA. Cohen knew that Loveless was within the age group protected by the ADEA, and Loveless presented evidence that contradicted John\u2019s Ford\u2019s asserted basis for terminating him, that is, poor work performance. The jury was thus entitled to find that John\u2019s Ford\u2019s discharge of Loveless was on the basis of his age, and that its conduct was a willful violation of the ADEA. As a result, the district court erred in denying his request for a liquidated damages award, and we reverse and remand on this point.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of John\u2019s Ford\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative, a new trial. We also affirm its denial of Loveless\u2019s motion for front pay. We reverse the court\u2019s failure to make a liquidated damages award to Loveless, and remand on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-11\">.

Because this appeal challenges the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the facts underlying John\u2019s Ford\u2019s appeal are presented in the light most favorable to Loveless, and we draw all inferences in his favor. <em>See Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413, 1417 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">. During the conversation in which Loveless was discharged, Cohen referred to Wes Brown, an older employee who served as Sales Manager, as \"an F'n dinosaur\u201d and told Loveless that Brown \"is next\u201d and \"should have been gone a long time ago.\u201d J.A. at 593. An assistant service manager, Vicki Surface, heard Cohen refer to another older employee, Wilber Laznic, as a \u201cdinosaur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">. In its defense, John's Ford presented evidence of Cohen's dissatisfaction with Loveless\u2019s job performance, including allegations of absenteeism. According to John\u2019s Ford, Loveless missed worked to assist on the estate of an elderly customer he had befriended, and to assist his girlfriend in starting a hair salon business. John\u2019s Ford also presented evidence of customer complaints concerning the Service Department at Leesburg while it was under Loveless\u2019s supervision. The jury, by its verdict, rejected John\u2019s Ford's defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">. Loveless does not, in this appeal, challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his request for reinstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">. John\u2019s Ford also contends on appeal that Loveless failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a disparate impact case. Loveless did not allege a disparate impact claim, however, <em>see Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, </em>490 U.S. 642, 656, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989), and the district court did not permit Loveless to argue any such claim. We thus need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b256-5\">. John\u2019s Ford contends that the evidence regarding Wes Brown is irrelevant because another jury had found that Brown was not fired due to his age. John\u2019s Ford failed to object on this basis at trial, however, and it does not maintain that this contention warrants relief under plain error review. <em>See Brickwood Contractors v. Datanet Eng\u2019g Inc., </em>369 F.3d 385, 396-97 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that issues raised for first time on appeal may only be considered in limited circumstances).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\">. We also reject John\u2019s Ford contention that Loveless\u2019s recollections are insufficient to prove age discrimination under the ADEA because they are uncorroborated. Any such lack of corroboration goes only to the credibility and weight of the evidence. <em>See EEOC v. Warfield-Rohr Casket Co., </em>364 F.3d 160, 164 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">. John\u2019s Ford\u2019s also contends that Brown\u2019s evidence was improper because he actually had no opinion on Loveless\u2019s back pay damages. Brown\u2019s testimony reveals, at most, some semantic confusion about the term \"back wage,\u201d a point that does not alter the substance of his views. We thus reject John\u2019s Ford's contention in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. We also reject John\u2019s Ford\u2019s alternative request for a new trial on the sufficiency of the evidence and the spoliation issues. In assessing a motion for a new trial, a trial judge may set aside a verdict in three circumstances: (1) if it is against the clear weight of the evidence; (2) if it is based on evidence which is false; or (3) if the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice, notwithstanding that there may be sufficient evidence to preclude a directed verdict. <em>Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 639, 650 (4th Cir.2002). Because the jury\u2019s verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence, and upholding the verdict would not result in a miscarriage of justice, there was no abuse of discretion by the district court on either of these points. We thus also affirm the First Opinion\u2019s denial of a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b259-13\">. Front pay is payment for lost future earnings. See Charles R. Richey, <em>Manual on Employment Discrimination Law and Civil Rights Actions in Federal Courts </em>\u00a7 3.103 (2d ed.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">. The Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\u201d) provides that any employer who violates the FLSA \"shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b). The ADEA\u2019s liquidated damages provision is to be enforced in accordance with the FLSA\u2019s \u00a7 216, except \"[t]hat liquidated damages shall be payable only in cases of willful violations of [the ADEA].\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">. The district court\u2019s concern that a liquidated damages award would create a windfall for Loveless is not supported by the circumstances. Although we have recognized that a windfall should not be conferred by such an award, the issue is one of calculation. <em>See Fariss v. Lynchburg Foundry, </em>769 F.2d 958, 967 (4th Cir.1985) (declining to calculate liquidated damages before offsetting back wages claim with lump sum pension that exceeded back wages, because liquidated damages award to plaintiff who suffered no pecuniary loss would bestow windfall). Unlike in <em>Fariss, </em>Loveless suffered a pecuniary loss of $250,000, and thus a liquidated damages award would not bestow a windfall on him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
