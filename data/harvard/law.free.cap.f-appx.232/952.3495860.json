Simmons relies on <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir.2002). Although he describes his challenge as an attack on the execution of his sentence, Simmons makes no argument other than improper delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">A prisoner who fails to challenge a monetary judgment at sentencing or on direct appeal cannot challenge this penalty for the first time in a collateral proceeding, absent exceptional circumstances. <em>Dohrmann, </em>442 F.3d at 1280-81 (discussing a collateral challenge to an order of restitution). Exceptional circumstances \u201care analogous to a showing of cause and prejudice to overcome a procedural default for raising a claim for the first time in a habeas corpus petition\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">While Simmons characterizes his argument as an attack on the execution of his sentence, a charge of improper delegation challenges the validity of the sentence itself. <em>See Prouty, </em>303 F.3d at 1254-55; <em>Matheny v. Morrison, </em>307 F.3d 709, 711-12 (8th Cir.2002). The record demonstrates that Simmons failed to challenge the constitutionality of his fine at sentencing or on direct appeal, and he makes no attempt to show exceptional circumstances justifying this failure. Accordingly, he cannot make such a challenge now. <em>See Dohrmann, </em>442 F.3d at 1280-81. Because we conclude that the district court correctly denied Simmons\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, we affirm the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
