Insofar as Khan challenges the Board\u2019s prior orders, we lack jurisdiction because Khan did not file a timely petition for review from those orders. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). While Khan\u2019s brief raises challenges to both of those prior orders, he fails to raise any issue with respect to the November 14, 2006, order, the only order from which his petition for review is timely. Issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Pleasurecraft Marine Engine Co. v. Thermo Power Corp., </em>272 F.3d 654, 657 (4th Cir.2001); <em>11126 Baltimore Blvd. v. Prince George\u2019s County, Md., </em>58 F.3d 988, 993 n. 7 (4th Cir.1995) (relying on Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(6) and holding that issues not briefed or argued in federal appeal are deemed abandoned). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-19\">We note the Board did not abuse its discretion denying Khan\u2019s motion to reconsider or reopen. <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-20\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
