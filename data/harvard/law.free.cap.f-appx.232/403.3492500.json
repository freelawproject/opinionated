He argues that the district court erred in denying a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility and that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s refusal to reduce King\u2019s offense level under a highly deferential standard, we hold that the court did not err in denying King\u2019s request for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003). Because King denied relevant conduct at the sentencing hearing, the district court\u2019s decision was not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">King was sentenced pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>Booker. </em>The Government concedes that the this issue was preserved through King\u2019s objection in the district court based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and that it cannot show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we VACATE King\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
