Santiago also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to enlarge discovery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">Santiago lived with his two siblings and their spouses and children in an apartment on the second floor of a two-story apartment building in Houston. In July 2003, Santiago\u2019s brother allowed a co-worker, Pete Flores Cervantes (\u201cCervantes\u201d), to store a bag at the apartment. When Cervantes returned the following evening to retrieve his belongings, he and Santiago got into a heated discussion. Cervantes left the apartment building and reported to nearby police officers that a man in the apartment complex had pointed a gun at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">Four police officers\u2014Griffin, Hernandez, Topper, and Pederson\u2014went to the apartment complex to investigate the report. Hernandez, Griffin, and Topper went upstairs and stood on a balcony outside of Santiago\u2019s apartment, while Pederson remained in the courtyard in front of the apartment. Hernandez reported seeing movement behind the blinds at the front of the apartment and hearing someone answer from inside. He also reported seeing someone\u2019s hand stick through the window blinds holding what appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>be a small silver pistol. Pederson stated that he saw the incident, but he described the gun as a blue steel pistol. Pederson and Griffin yelled to the other officers that a gun was present. Hernandez ordered the individual to drop the weapon and come out of the apartment with his hands up. The hand and gun then disappeared behind the blinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The officers next saw a hand holding a pistol protruding from the apartment\u2019s front window; the gun was aimed at the officers on the balcony. Hernandez, Griffin, and Topper attempted to take cover. When he saw a firearm aimed at his fellow officers, Pederson drew his gun and rapidly fired eight shots at the apartment\u2019s front window, hitting Santiago once in the chest and severely injuring him. As a result of the injury, Santiago underwent multiple surgeries and remained in the hospital for four months. He continues to receive treatment for these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">After the shooting, the officers conducted a thorough search of the area, but no firearm was found. Santiago contends that the officers never informed him of their presence and that he never had a gun. He was nevertheless charged with \u201cdeadly conduct\u201d on the basis of the officers\u2019 statements that he pointed the gun at Cervantes.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In March 2004, Santiago filed a complaint against Defendants-Appellants in the Southern District of Texas, asserting various civil rights and state law tort violations. In July 2005, the district court granted Defendants-Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court held that Santiago\u2019s \u00a7 1983 unlawful arrest and excessive force claims against Pederson failed, because (1) Pederson acted with probable cause in arresting Santiago, and (2) the officer\u2019s use of force was reasonable in light of the perceived threat. As for the City, the court held that Santiago had failed to demonstrate a municipal policy to support his claim. The court also concluded that Santiago\u2019s state law claims failed, because the City had not waived its sovereign immunity to this type of claim. Santiago timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo} </em>A motion for summary judgment should be granted only when there is no genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, we view all facts and draw all inferences therefrom in favor of the non-moving party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s order denying Santiago\u2019s request for additional time in which to conduct discovery for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">Santiago asserts that Pederson falsely arrested him and subjected him to unreasonable force. Pederson counters, and the district court held, that he is entitled to qualified immunity. To determine whether a public official is entitled to qualified immunity, the court asks (1) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right and (2) whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of the clearly established law at the time of the incident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Santiago\u2019s claim that he was falsely arrested fails, as Pederson had probable cause to arrest him. \u201cProbable cause exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances within a police officer\u2019s knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed an offense.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, the district court correctly determined that the information provided to the officers by Cervantes and the subsequent occurrences at the apartment complex gave Pederson sufficient information on which to deduce that Santiago had engaged in \u201cdeadly conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Pederson is also entitled to qualified immunity on Santiago\u2019s excessive force claim. To state such a claim, a plaintiff must allege: \u201c(1) an injury, which (2) resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive to the need; and the excessiveness of which was (3) objectively unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Santiago has satisfied his burden with respect to the first of these two elements, his claim still must be dismissed, as we cannot say that Pederson\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u201cIt is objectively unreasonable to use deadly force \u2018unless it is necessary to prevent [a suspect\u2019s] escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cervantes had reported that a man in the apartment complex had pointed a firearm at him. Several officers, including Pederson, reported seeing a firearm aimed at the officers on the balcony from the front window. Based on these observations, Pederson had probable cause to believe that Santiago posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officers on the balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">C. Municipal Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">In a claim against a municipality under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) a municipal policy or custom existed; (2) governmental policy makers actually or constructively knew of its existence; (3) a constitutional violation occurred; and (4) through the municipality\u2019s deliberate conduct, the custom or policy was the moving force behind the violation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The district court correctly granted summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claim against the City, as Santiago failed to introduce evidence of a municipal policy or custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Santiago\u2019s state law claims against the City also must be dismissed. Relying on the Texas Tort Claims Act, Santiago asserts that the City has waived its governmental immunity for Pederson\u2019s conduct. \u201cThe Texas Tort Claims Act provides a limited waiver [of governmental immunity] when personal injury or death is caused by a \u2018use of tangible personal or real property if the governmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>according to Texas law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Santiago\u2019s injuries were caused by the \u201cuse of tangible personal or real property,\u201d the City nevertheless is immune, as it is not vicariously liable for Pederson\u2019s conduct in light of our conclusion that Pederson is entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To the extent Santiago also asserts under Texas law that the City negligently failed to carry out one of its established policies, as discussed above, Santiago has not cited any specific city policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">D. Extension of Time for Discovery and Opposition to the Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Santiago contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for additional time for discovery. He argues that an extension was necessary because his original attorney, Mr. Walsh, died, requiring Santiago to find new counsel. The attorney who filed Santiago\u2019s opposition to the summary judgment motion, Mu\u00f1oz, however, had previously indicated to the district court that both he and Walsh represented Santiago, and Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s signature appears on the complaint. Although Mu\u00f1oz apparently informed Santiago that he did not have the expertise to represent him on this case following Walsh\u2019s death, Santiago did not obtain new counsel, and Mu\u00f1oz remained counsel of record. And, the district court did extend the deadline by which Santiago was to file his opposition to the summary judgment motion. Moreover, Santiago fails to explain the type of information he believes he would have obtained through additional discovery, and does not articulate how such information would have created a genuine issue of material fact. In light of these facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the denial of that motion and the judgment of the district court are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\"> Under 5th Cir.
