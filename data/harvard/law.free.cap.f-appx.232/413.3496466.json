We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Petitioner\u2019s affidavit filed below states that he was arrested by the Department of Homeland Security on or about September 2, 2004 in the State of Washington and at that time was told he would be placed in removal proceedings and was given a copy of Notice to Appear (NTA) dated September 2, 2004. The NTA alleges that Maredia (1) is not a United States citizen or national, (2) is a native and citizen of India, (3) arrived in the United States on or about September 2, 2004 at or near Oroville, Washington, and (4) was not then admitted or paroled after inspection by an Immigration Officer. It charges that Maredia is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as \u201can alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.\u201d The NTA orders that Maredia appear before an immigration judge (to show cause why he should not be removed from the United States based on the stated charges) at a specified address in Seattle, at a date and time \u201cto be set.\u201d The NTA purports to be issued at Oroville, Washington, by \u201cRichard M. Graham, Jr. Patrol Agent in Charge.\u201d Maredia was held in immigration custody, and on September 13, 2004 his bond was fixed by the Tacoma, Washington immigration office at $10,000 and shortly thereafter he was released from custody, giving as his address the residence of a friend in Houston, Texas. The original NTA, having apparently previously been filed in the Tacoma office, was received and filed in the Seattle immigration office on September 14, 2005, and on September 15, 2004 Ms. Buttar, a Seattle attorney who had been retained by Maredia, was notified in writing by the immigration court that the hearing on Maredia\u2019s NTA would be on December 28, 2004 at 1:30 p.m. at the Seattle address (the same as that specified in the NTA). On November 12, 2004 Buttar filed in the proceedings a motion seeking both to change venue to Houston, Texas, and to withdraw as counsel. Filed with and in support of the motion was Buttar\u2019s affidavit in which she noted that Maredia had moved to Texas and \u201cit is my understanding that\u201d he \u201cwill retain an attorney in Texas\u201d, that she had provided him a copy of his immigration file, and that he could not afford to travel to Seattle. The affidavit also states that Maredia \u201cwill be apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ing for Asylum,\u201d that he \u201cadmits allegations one (1) through (4) in the Notice to Appear\u201d and \u201cconcedes removability,\u201d \u201cbut declines to designate a country to which he may be removed, should removal become necessary.\u201d A copy of the motion and affidavit was served by mail on Maredia at his designated Houston address. On November 17, 2004, the Seattle IJ issued an order that Buttar\u2019s motion to withdraw \u201cbe conditionally granted\u201d and that \u201cuntil new counsel enters an appearance, present counsel is responsible for acceptance of service documents.\u201d On November 18, 2004, the Seattle IJ granted the motion to change venue and transferred the proceedings to Houston, a copy of the order being served on Maredia.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On November 30, 2004, the case was set for hearing before the Houston IJ on February 15, 2005. On the latter date Maredia and his attorney, Mr. Kaufman of the San Antonio firm of Azar-Farr, appeared, as did government counsel. Kaufman advised that Maredia would be filing for asylum, that he lived in Austin, not Houston, and requested a change of venue to San Antonio. The IJ then inquired of Kaufman whether he was \u201cready to enter pleadings today.\u201d Kaufman stated he believed \u201cthat issue is address\u201d in the affidavit filed with the change of venue motion; the IJ then reviewed that affidavit and observed \u201che admits allegations one through four and concedes removability,\u201d and then stated \u201cThe court will designate India. The charge is sustained.\u201d The IJ then granted the motion to transfer venue to San Antonio.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On February 17, 2005, notice was given that the case would be heard in San Antonio on April 13, 2005. At that time Maredia and his attorney Mr. Azar-Farr appeared. The IJ asked if Azar-Farr objected to the Buttar affidavit in support of the motion to transfer from Seattle to Texas being \u201cadmitted into the record.\u201d Azar-Farr indicated he had a copy of the affidavit and stated \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have any objections to it\u201d and then \u201cyou can submit it into the record, and, but I do like to reserve any objections I may have to it perhaps later on if the court would entertain it at all.\u201d The IJ \u201centered\u201d the affidavit \u201cas Exhibit Number 2.\u201d The IJ then concluded the hearing by resetting the case for June 15, 2005, to allow counsel \u201csome more time to talk to your client about possible relief and prepare an application\u201d (presumably for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">On June 15,2005, Maredia and his attorney Azar-Farr appeared. The IJ noted that inadmissibility had been established and asked if Azar-Farr was seeking any form of relief. Azar-Farr said he was seeking termination without prejudice, and alternatively, voluntary departure. He tendered an affidavit, dated June 13, 2005, of Mr. Maredia, and the NTA copy, and the October 6,1994 sheet listing sources of free legal services in the Seattle area, which Maredia was furnished September 2, 2004. The affidavit also states that when he was given the NTA he was not told when the hearing would be, and was never told he \u201chad the right to contact any consular official,\u201d and that he \u201casked his former lawyer, Ms. Taran Buttar, to attempt to transfer my case to the San Antonio area\u201d but \u201cnever authorized Ms. Buttar to concede in court any factual allegations legal charges against me.\u201d Azar-Farr said he was moving to terminate on three grounds (though \u201crealizing that the factual allegations were conceded in Seattle apparently\u201d), namely: (1) the NTA did not state the date and time of the hearing, contrary to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)\u00ae, (2) that when served with the NTA Maredia was not furnished a quarterly updated list of sources for free legal services as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229(a)(l)(E)(ii) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>1229(b)(2), and (3) \u201che was not advised of his right to contact any consul or officials contrary to the Geneva Convention.\u201d Azar-Farr asserted that \u201cprejudice need not be shown\u201d to get relief on any of these grounds; and he did not assert any facts suggestive of or claimed to reflect prejudice. The government objected on the ground that Maredia had been represented by counsel throughout and, in essence, that no prejudice was shown. The IJ inquired of Azar-Farr whether he intended to file any motion based on ineffectiveness or improper assistance of counsel on the part of Buttar, and Azar-Farr responded \u201ca decision, I think up to now has been made not to file the <em>Matter of Lozado </em>motion against former counsel.\u201d No such motion has ever been filed (nor has any application for asylum ever been filed). The IJ continued the matter until June 29, with written arguments to be received by June 24 and then stated that \u201cIf the Government wants to submit written argument, it\u2019s also due on that same day June 24th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On June 21 Azar-Farr filed a motion (and supporting brief) for termination without prejudice (or, alternatively for a hearing \u201cto determine scope of constitutional and regulatory violations\u201d). The motion alleges only the same three \u201cviolations\u201d as urged orally at the June 15, 2005 hearing. No facts are alleged which are claimed to constitute or reflect prejudice, but the motion, though asserting no prejudice, argues that \u201cHaving raised his objections, respondent is at least entitled to develop the record to demonstrate the nature and the extent of the prejudice suffered by him.\u201d The Government did not file any written argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The hearing recommenced June 29, 2005, with Maredia and attorney Azar-Farr and government counsel present. Azar-Farr said the government\u2019s failure to file a written response \u201cshould be deemed as lack of opposition to the Motion to Terminate.\u201d The IJ questioned Azar-Farr at length as to what prejudice he was alleging, or would attempt to show, from the claimed violations alleged. Azar-Farr responded that prejudice did not have to be shown. When pressed by the IJ as to what he would show <em>if </em>prejudice had to be shown, Azar-Farr ultimately stated that \u201cthe prejudice we would be able to show would be the violation of the statute.\u201d The IJ then denied the motion for further hearing as to prejudice \u201cbecause the respondent has not alleged any prejudice,\u201d and denied the Motion to Terminate. He inquired of Mr. Azar-Farr if he requested any other relief. He mentioned only voluntary departure. The IJ noted that if he reserved his right to appeal, voluntary departure would only be available under section 1229c(b)(l) and that because Maredia had been in the United States less than a year when the NTA was issued he would be ineligible under section 1229c(b)(l)(A). Azar-Farr then argued that this showed prejudice, but the IJ pointed out that if the proceedings were then terminated a new NTA could easily be filed before a year from Maredia\u2019s September 2, 2004 entry into the United States, a matter which Azar-Farr did not dispute. Maredia reserved his right to appeal. The IJ then issued his June 29, 2005 order that Maredia be removed and denying voluntary departure, together with his oral decision finding that Maredia had failed to demonstrate or even allege any prejudice whatever from the alleged violations of which he complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">We note that in this court Maredia principally asserts the claims he raised before the IJ.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> We also observe that nothing in the record suggests that there is even any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>potential factual issue as to Maredia being removable as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law de novo. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). We accord \u201cdeference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). While we normally review only the decision of the BIA, when, as in this case, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The BIA has consistently held that \u201cso long as the enforcement officials of the Service choose to initiate proceedings against an alien and to prosecute those proceedings to a conclusion, the immigration judge and the Board must order deportation if the evidence supports a finding of deportability on the ground charged.\u201d <em>In re Yazdani, </em>17 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1981); <em>see In re Singh, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 427, 435 (BIA 1996); <em>In re Wong, </em>13 I. &amp; N. Dec. 701, 703 (BIA 1971). Maredia\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit. As the IJ did not have discretionary authority to terminate the removal proceedings against Maredia, the denial of Maredia\u2019s motion to terminate the removal proceedings was not error. <em>See Lopez-Telles v. INS, </em>564 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir.1977); <em>Panova-Bohannan v. Ashcroft, </em>74 Fed.Appx. 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Maredia\u2019s due process challenge regarding the technical procedural defects attendant to his immigration proceedings fails because he has not made an initial showing of substantial prejudice. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Finally, Maredia is bound by counsel\u2019s concession of removability, which was made while Maredia was still represented by that counsel and which new counsel accepted and did not challenge. <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> He also now complains that the copy of the NTA served on him was not signed. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>er, the original NTA in the record is signed and Maredia has never asserted that it was not in fact issued and signed by Patrol Agent in Charge Graham, over whose typed name and title an illegible signature appears. No contention in this respect was made before the IJ. We also note that a patrol Agent in Charge is authorized to issue a NTA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1(6) (\"Patrol agents in charge\u201d) (2005) (68 FR 35275, June 15, 2003). This contention is wholly without merit. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 544 (5th Cir.2006). The contention that the government consented or agreed to the motion to terminate because it did not file a written argument is also wholly without merit. The government opposed the motion on June 21 and the IJ in essence merely stated that if the government wished to <em>also </em>respond <em>in writing </em>it had to do so by June 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">Maredia does not challenge the denial of voluntary departure, which is clearly mandated by \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
