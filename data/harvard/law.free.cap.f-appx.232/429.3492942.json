He contends that the district court plainly erred in increasing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his 1999 and 2002 Texas convictions for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, arguing that his prior offenses do not constitute drug trafficking offenses. As Barrera-Castro did not raise this issue in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Barrera-Castro has two prior Texas convictions for possession with intent to deliver cocaine in violation Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(a)(Vernon 1993), which defines \u201cdeliver\u201d in relevant part to include \u201coffering to sell a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d The indictments and the judgments concerning these prior Texas convictions do not provide the specific means of commission of the offenses, and Barrera-Castro has not admitted such facts. The district court plainly erred in increasing Barrera-Castro\u2019s offense level relying solely on the factual narrative in the Presentence Report. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 715-17 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). The error affected Barrera-Castro\u2019s substantial rights because, without the 16-level enhancement, his guidelines sentencing range would have been 37-46 months, much less than his 63-month sentence. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 715-16. As the error clearly affected Barrera-Castro\u2019s sentence, the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 716-17. Accordingly, Barrera-Castro\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>Gonzales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Barrera-Castro also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Barrera-Castro\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Barrera-Castro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Barrera-Castro\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
