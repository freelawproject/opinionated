On appeal, Liu argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which he asserts was not supported by substantial evidence and was not based on an adequate consideration of the other evidence of persecution. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA issued a written opinion, and, although it agreed with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and ultimate conclusion, it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion. Accordingly, we will review only the BIA\u2019s opinion, although we will also examine the inconsistencies the IJ noted on which the BIA relied. <em>See id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Like other factual findings, credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-1287 (11th Cir.2005). And \u201can adverse credibility determination <em>alone </em>may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d when there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (emphasis added); <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004) (same). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citations omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255. (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">An adverse credibility determination alone may be fatal to an asylum application. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, an adverse credibility finding does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by the applicant. <em>Id. </em>For a credibility finding to be dispositive, the IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After an adverse credibility finding is made, the applicant bears the burden of showing this decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. We have held that an IJ\u2019s concerns about the credibility of an applicant on \u201ckey elements of the claim,\u201d combined with the applicant\u2019s failure to rebut these with sufficient corroborating evidence and explanation, supported a finding that the applicant did not qualify for asylum. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1369 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the BIA gave specific, cogent reasons for its adverse credibility determination. As the BIA noted, Liu\u2019s testimony and asylum application were materially inconsistent with his credible-fear interview on several key points, including (1) whether his family knew about the illegality of Falun, and (2) whether his claim for asylum was based on impregnating his girlfriend or the practice of Falun Gong. On this record, we cannot say that the record <em>compels </em>a contrary finding as to Liu\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">After the adverse credibility finding was made, it was Liu\u2019s burden to \u201cshow that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. He suggests the IJ and the BIA failed to consider his explanation for lying during his credible-fear hearing. Liu claimed that he was threatened by a \u201csnakehead\u201d (an alien smuggler) who told Liu to lie during his interview. Liu raised this argument before the BIA. The BIA explicitly addressed the claim in its order, finding that Liu\u2019s explanation was \u201cnot sufficient to overcome the diminishment in [his] veracity.\u201d We also observe that the IJ specifically mentioned Liu\u2019s claim concerning the \u201csnakehead\u201d threats twice during his oral decision. Simply put, the record does not support Liu\u2019s claim that the IJ and the BIA failed to consider his explanation. Moreover, from our own review, the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Because Liu lied about the basis for asylum in his credible-fear interview, and because a discrepancy exists between Liu\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s letter concerning the legality of Falun Gong, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination and conclusion that Liu had not met his burden to overcome that finding. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-19\">. Because we find that Liu did not establish a case for asylum under the INA, we do not consider whether he satisfied the higher standard for withholding of removal under the INA or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>human, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
