Orozco claimed reopening was warranted because she had ineffective assistance of counsel before the immigration judge and on appeal. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-21\">Our review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (2006) (stating a \u201cmotion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d). The decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">We find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s finding that Orozco failed to show she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s conduct. We also find no due process violation. As a result, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
