The district court initially sentenced Banda-Zarate to 105 months of imprisonment. Banda-Zarate appealed, and we remanded for resentencing based upon the Government\u2019s unopposed motion. Upon resentencing, the district court calculated that Banda-Zarate\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 51 to 63 months in prison. The Government moved for an upward departure based upon Banda-Zarate\u2019s propensity for recidivism, the understatement of his criminal history, and the seriousness of the crimes he committed. The district court upwardly departed four levels, sentencing Banda-Zarate to 96 months in prison. Banda-Zarate again appealed his sentence and contends his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider all of the factors found in \u00a7 3553(a) and erred in upwardly departing from the advisory guidelines range. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. In reviewing a sentence outside the guidelines range, the appeals court must consider \u201cwhether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir.2007). A sentence is unreasonable if the \u201ccourt provides an inadequate statement of reasons or relies on improper factors in imposing a sentence outside the properly calculated advisory sentence range____\u201d <em>Id. </em>A departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 is encouraged, provided that the criminal history category does not account adequately for the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that he will commit other crimes. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>318 F.3d 585, 588 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion;\u2019 \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) <em>(quoting United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Here, the district court sentenced Banda-Zarate <em>post-Booker </em>and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. After accurately calculating an advisory sentencing guideline range of 51 to 63 months, the district court examined the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that they supported an upward departure from the guidelines range. The district court determined that based upon Banda-Zarate\u2019s prior convictions and deportations, an upward departure of four levels was warranted. The court assigned an additional point for every three felony convictions for crimes Banda-Zarate committed after reentering the United States after each of three deportations, for a total of three points, and one additional point based upon the likelihood that he would commit future crimes. This departure yielded an offense level of 21 and combined with the criminal history score of VI, the guidelines range was 77 to 96 months. The court discussed the seriousness of Banda-Zarate\u2019s criminal history, the likelihood that he would commit further crimes, his propensity to illegally renter the country, and his prior escape from custody. On these facts, we conclude the district court sufficiently articulated its reasons for the departure from the guidelines range and imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Banda-Zarate\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
