The issue before us is whether the trial judge correctly concluded that the State was immune from suit for damages as a result of negligent medical care received by appellant while he was an inmate in the custody of the Maryland Division of Correction. The health care providers were employed by a private company that supplied health care employees pursuant to a contract with the State. More specifically, the sole question for our decision is whether the health care providers were \u201cState personnel\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-101(1) or (4) of the State Government Article (S.G.), the Maryland Tort Claims Act. We answer that question in the negative and affirm the ruling of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">More than nine years after the injury that gave rise to this litigation, the parties are still wending their way through our judicial system. The underlying facts may be found in Judge Rosalyn Bell\u2019s opinion in <em>Conaway v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 234, 237-39, 600 A.2d 1133 (1992). We will not repeat the entire history of this litigation, but a brief review may be helpful in understanding its present posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Appellant injured his hand while incarcerated at the Brock-bridge Correctional Facility in May, 1986, and was treated at that Facility\u2019s dispensary. He filed a claim with the Health Claims Arbitration Commission and then a suit against Frank G. Basil, Inc. of Delaware, a health care company that the State contracted with to provide health care services to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mates at certain facilities, including Brockbridge, through June 30, 1986, and PHP Health Care Corporation, the contractor hired to provide such services subsequent to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In the first <em>Conaway, </em>the issues were whether appellant had made a written claim against the State in compliance with S.G. \u00a7 12-106(b) and whether the claim against Basil was barred by limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 239-54, 600 A.2d 1133. We held that appellant had given the State adequate notice of his claim but that the claim against Basil was barred by limitations. This Court remanded the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Subsequent to our remand, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City remanded appellant\u2019s case to the Health Claims Arbitration Office (\u201cHCAO\u201d). The HCAO granted defendant PHP Health Care Corporation\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the negligent acts occurred prior to its involvement. This left the State as the sole defendant. Thereafter, on November 15, 1993, the panel issued its decision. The panel found the State liable to appellant and awarded to him: (1) $5,980 for future medical expenses; (2) $2,000 for past lost earnings and $15,000 for future lost earnings; and (3) $2,020 for non-economic damages. Additionally, the panel assessed costs against the State in the amount of $1,247.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">On December 27, 1993, the State filed an action to \u201cNullify Award and Assessment of Costs\u201d in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In response, on January 10, 1994, appellant filed a complaint, in which he claimed damages totaling $75,-000. The parties\u2019 dispute survived motions for summary judgment and proceeded to a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Prior to trial, the parties agreed that, if appellant prevailed, he would receive $18,000 in damages. The parties further agreed that they would proceed on the one issue as stated above. Although the parties did not explicitly stipulate that the health care provider or providers in question were negligent, it appears that they proceeded to trial with that assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ti'on. In any event, the issue is not raised, and we shall assume that the negligent acts occurred prior to June 30,1986. Moreover, the parties do not raise an issue with respect to the fact of, or the basis for, the State\u2019s liability for the negligent acts of the health care providers. Appellant does argue that the State had a duty to render adequate medical care to inmates and that this was a non-delegable duty. Additionally, appellant argues that there was a \u201cholding out\u201d of the health care providers as agents of the State. Either or both of these doctrines, if applicable, would give rise to vicarious liability on the part of the State. We do not decide if a legal basis for liability exists on either of those theories, since the issue presented by the parties implicitly assumes (without conceding) a basis for tort liability by the State.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At trial, appellant testified that he did not know whether he was treated by State employees or by employees of Basil. The State presented two witnesses, Myles Carpeneto and Larry Andersson. Carpeneto and Andersson were, respectively, at the relevant times, Director of Procurement Services for the Department of Correction and Chief of Personnel Services for the Department of Correction. They testified, in part, that no State employees were assigned to provide health care at Brockbridge when appellant received negligent treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">At the conclusion of the trial on February 16, 1995, the trial judge held the matter <em>sub curia. </em>Approximately one month later, the trial judge filed his opinion and entered judgment against appellant. Appellant timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Our discussion centers upon the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cAct\u201d), which took effect on July 1,1982. See Md.Code (1981 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-401 to 5-408 of the Courts Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As stated in the preamble to Senate Bill 585, the legislation was proposed for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">[t]he purpose of waiving the immunity of the State and its officials in certain tort actions to the extent that the State is insured; granting certain State personnel immunity from liability as individuals for such torts absent certain circumstances; providing for the representation of the State and its personnel in such cases; requiring the filing of a claim with the State Treasurer as a prerequisite to the waiver of such immunity; authorizing the Treasurer to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle such claims and contract for services; limiting the fees which attorneys may charge in such matters; directing the Treasurer to secure insurance for such purposes to the extent that funds are available; and generally relating to the immunity of the State and its personnel in tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">1981 Md.Laws chap. 298, page 1609. Moreover, the Legislature specifically declared that the Act was to be liberally interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Act has been amended from time to time, including significant amendments in 1989, which would clearly resolve the issue herein, if applicable. The negligent acts in question occurred prior to July 1, 1986. Appellant\u2019s claim was filed in September, 1986. <em>See Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 250, 600 A.2d 1133. As the trial judge in this case noted, the 1989 amendments to the Act took effect on July 1, 1989 and are inapplicable to this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Under the Act, the State has waived immunity under certain circumstances with respect to negligent acts committed by State personnel. The issue presented to us requires us to focus on two provisions of the Act defining \u201cState personnel,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 12-101(1) and 12-101(4). Under subsection (1), an individual is within the definition of \u201cState personnel\u201d if a \u201cclassified,\u201d \u201cunclassified,\u201d or \u201ccontractual employee\u201d of the State, or under subsection (4), if the individual \u201cexercises a part of the sovereignty of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Appellant\u2019s first point relates to S.G. \u00a7 12-101(1). We look to that section as it existed prior to the 1989 amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">In this subtitle, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, \u2018State personnel\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">(1) a classified, unclassified, or contractual employee of the State whose compensation is paid wholly or partly from State funds____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Md.Code (1984), \u00a7 12-101(1) of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his brief, however, appellant makes no argument regarding that section\u2019s applicability to this case. Instead, he refers us to the joint record extract and to a memorandum appearing at the cited page, which was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The argument in the memorandum is not clear, but it appears as though appellant asserts that S.G. \u00a7 12-101(1) is germane to this litigation because Basil\u2019s employees were \u201ccontractual employee[s] of the State whose compensation is paid wholly or partly from State funds----\u201d The short answer to this assertion is that, in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>argument in the brief, the point need not be considered by this court. <em>Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 640 A.2d 236 (1994), cert. <em>denied, </em>337 Md. 580, 655 A.2d 370 (1995). The longer answer is that appellant is mistaken. We shall examine the argument because it aids our discussion of the main issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In analyzing appellant\u2019s arguments, we are guided by the basic principles of statutory construction as set forth by Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Condon:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the true intention of the legislature. In searching for legislative intention, a court looks for the general purpose, aim, or policy behind the statute. We first look to the plain meaning of the language of the statute to discern legislative intent. Where the language is clear and unambiguous, a court may not add or delete words to make a statute reflect an intent not evidenced in that language to avoid a harsh result. A clearly worded statute must be construed without \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application. The language must be examined in the context in which it was adopted. All parts of a statute are to be read together to determine intent, and reconciled and harmonized to the extent possible. If reasonably possible, a statute should be read so that no part of it is rendered nugatory or superfluous. Where a statute may be susceptible of more than one meaning, the court may consider the consequences of each meaning and adopt that construction which avoids a result that is unreasonable, illogical or inconsistent with common sense. It often is necessary to look at the development of a statute to discern legislative intent that may not be as clear upon initial examination of the current language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 490-91, 632 A.2d 753 (citations omitted); <em>Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving, </em>340 Md. 519, 538-39, 667 A.2d 624 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The pre-1989 Act did not provide definitions of \u201cclassified, unclassified, or contractual\u201d employees. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated at oral argument that no claim is being made that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Basil\u2019s employees were \u201cclassified\u201d or \u201cunclassified\u201d employees of the State. We turn to the Merit System law then in existence for clarification of \u201ccontractual\u201d employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Section 15A of former Article 64A defined \u201ccontractual employee.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">(2) \u2018Contractual employee\u2019 means a person providing personal services to the State for remuneration provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">(i) The services and remuneration are specified in a written agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">(ii) An employer-employee relationship exists; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">(in) The person is not employed as a classified, unclassified or temporary extra employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">(3) <em>\u2018Employer-employee relationship\u2019 </em>means conditions of employment such that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">(i) The State has the right to control and direct the performance of services, not only as to results but also as to details and means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">(ii) The State has the right to discharge the employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">(iii) The State furnishes necessary tools and a place to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">Md.Code (Cum.Supp.1986), Art. 64A, \u00a7 15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">At trial, Carpeneto explained the distinction between a contractual employee and an independent contractor\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">Q Okay could you please explain the difference between a contractual employee and an employee of a contractor or a company with whom the State contracts?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">A Sure. And\u2014a contractual employee is an employee of the State of Maryland. We pay their social security, take \u2022 out their taxes. As far as Internal Revenue Service is concerned, they are a State employee. As employer contractor, we don\u2019t actually contract with the employees, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>contract with the contractor himself. So in this case it was Frank E. Basil Incorporated. And Frank E. Basil then had employees and paid their social security and taxes and whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">And for the IRS purposes, they were employees of Frank E. Basil as opposed to employees of the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The trial judge found that the medical personnel at Brock-bridge at the pertinent time were not State employees. This finding was supported by uncontradicted evidence and is not clearly erroneous. Additionally, the above discussion makes clear, based on the plain language of the statute, that an employee of an independent contractor is not a \u201ccontractual employee\u201d of the State. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion with respect to this point will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellant\u2019s second point is grounded in S.G. \u00a7 12-101(4), which includes, within the definition of \u201cState personnel,\u201d the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">(4) an individual who, with or without compensation, exercises a part of the sovereignty of the State.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">It is helpful to review the common law doctrine of immunity prior to the Act and the history of the Act. At common law, public employees were not immune from suit for negligence, but public officials were immune from such suits, if based on discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts, and if they were in furtherance of official duties. The State was immune from liability, absent consent. Pursuant to the Act, the State waived its immunity in certain instances and, where waiver was applicable, the individual was immune. The original version of the Act waived immunity in certain specified actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>to the extent and in the amount that the State was covered by a program of insurance established by the Treasurer. Six categories of actions were listed. The 1985 amendment broadened the waiver of immunity, waiving it with respect to all types of tort actions for damages to the extent of coverage, based on acts committed by \u201cState personnel,\u201d subject to the limitations contained in S.G. \u00a7 12-104(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Court of Appeals discussed subsection (4) as it existed prior to the 1989 amendments in <em>Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 558 A.2d 399 (1989). The issues presented in <em>Rucker </em>came in the form of certified questions from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. A stray bullet fired by a peace officer initiated appellant David Rucker\u2019s claim. The court had before it the question of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeM\">[wjhether Harford County or the State of Maryland is obligated to fund the expenses associated with claims for liability involving the Harford County Sheriff, the Deputy Sheriffs, or the Sheriffs office, including the cost of liability insurance, the costs of defending suits brought against them and the payment of any settlements and judgment[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>Rucker, </em>316 Md. at 278, 558 A.2d 399. The discussion is enlightening.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Subsection (4) of \u00a7 12-101 literally covers sheriffs and deputy sheriffs, and the Attorney General does not argue otherwise. Rather, the Attorney General contends that subsection (4) should not be given a literal construction, as this would render the State liable for the tortious acts of public officials and employees at every level of government, including many whose offices were created by local charters or local ordinances....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">We agree with the Attorney General that subsection 4 of \u00a7 12-101 cannot reasonably be read to encompass every individual exercising part of the sovereignty of the State. Many county and municipal officials and employees could be said to exercise part of the sovereignty of the State. The General Assembly, in enacting \u00a7 12-101(4), obviously did not contemplate that the State was assuming liability for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>torts of purely local government officials and employees. If it had, there would have been little reason to enact the Local Government Tort Claims Act or other legislation relating to the tort liability of local government personnel. As \u00a7 12-101 deals with \u2018State personnel,\u2019 \u00a7 12-101(4) should be limited to those who are State officers or employees, or to those directly acting for the State Government rather than for a county or municipality....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Subsection (4) of \u00a7 12-101, by referring to those exercising a part of the sovereignty of the State, and by making the matter of compensation irrelevant, seems particularly applicable to State officers like sheriffs, state\u2019s attorneys, orphans\u2019 court judges, and similar officials, who are performing fundamental State government functions but who may not be compensated by the State government. It seems to have been specifically designed to cover these personnel, based upon the language used and the fact that virtually all other categories of State personnel appear to be encompassed by other subsections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 298-300, 558 A.2d 399 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The Court of Appeals did not decide the question before us, however. It did not indicate what was meant by \u201cdirectly acting for the State.\u201d Additionally, the Court did not state that subsection (4) is <em>limited </em>to \u201csheriffs, state\u2019s attorneys, orphans court judges, and similar officials, who are performing fundamental state government functions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 300, 558 A.2d 399, only that it included such persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We must now decide what is meant by exercising \u201cpart of the sovereignty of the State,\u201d as applied to the facts before us. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201csovereignty\u201d carries with it something more than an act that inures to the benefit of the State or directly or indirectly furthers a State interest. The dictionary definition of the term includes \u201c[s]upremacy in respect of power, domination, or rank; supreme dominion, authority, or rule ...

There exist at least two \u201cwell-known exceptions\u201d to the four guidelines. <em>Id. </em>As stated by Judge Barnes, for the Court of Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">[t]he exceptions where an individual fails to meet most of the above tests, and yet is nevertheless considered to be a public official, are limited to those individuals who exercise \u2018a <em>large portion </em>of the sovereign power of government\u2019 ... and to those individuals who can be called on to exercise police powers as conservators of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\"><em>Duncan v. Koustenis, </em>260 Md. 98, 106, 271 A.2d 547 (1970). A further distinction exists between discretionary and ministerial actions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">[A]n act falls within the discretionary function of a public official if the decision which involves an exercise of his personal judgment also includes, to more than a minor degree, the manner in which the police power of the State should be utilized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\"><em>James, </em>288 Md. at 327, 418 A.2d 1173. Public officials\u2019 discretion \u201cis the power conferred upon them by law to act officially under certain circumstances according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience, and uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of others.\u201d <em>Schneider v. Hawkins, </em>179 Md. 21, 25, 16 A.2d 861 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Appellant argues that the Act does not perpetuate the distinction between public officials and public employees. We agree that the distinction is not specifically maintained, but the waiver of immunity remains a limited, and not a general, waiver. Appellee contends that subsection (1) corresponds with the common law public employee category and subsection (4) corresponds to the common law public official category. We do not agree with that assertion. Subsection (1) applies to employees but, in our view, the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>whether an individual is within subsection (4) turns on the question of whether the individual is exercising part of the \u201csovereignty of the State,\u201d without necessarily being a <em>public official </em>as previously defined. As stated above, there were four principal guidelines to be used in determining whether an individual was a public official. Only one of the guidelines is expressly retained by the Act, <em>i.e., </em>whether the position calls for the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power of the State. If an individual comes within this language, the individual need not necessarily meet the other requirements to be a public official. In other words, in order for an individual to come within subsection (4), he or she must perform some function that is part of the exercise of a peculiarly governmental power or obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In addition to the reasons set forth above, this conclusion is further supported by the fact that the four principal guidelines used in determining whether an individual is a public official for purposes of immunity, as set forth in <em>James, supra, </em>were the same guidelines used in decisions by the Court of Appeals interpreting the term \u201cpublic office\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland Constitution. In <em>Nesbitt v. Fallon, </em>203 Md. 534, 544, 102 A.2d 284 (1954), the Court held that a member of the Board of License Commissioners of Anne Arundel County held a \u201ccivil office\u201d within the meaning of Article 2, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 13 of the Maryland Constitution, and further held that a \u201ccivil office\u201d was synonymous with a \u201cpublic office.\u201d The Court used th\u00e9 same four guidelines mentioned above, as had been previously defined in <em>Buchholtz v. Hill, </em>178 Md. 280, 13 A.2d 348 (1940). The Court stated that the most important guideline (of the four) is whether the individual \u201cis entrusted with a part of the sovereign power to exercise some of the functions of government for the benefit of the people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 102 A.2d 284. In <em>Board of Supervisors v. Attorney General, </em>246 Md. 417, 229 A.2d 388 (1967), the Court had before it the question of whether a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention held \u201cpublic office\u201d so as to be forbidden from holding another office for profit or trust in violation of the State Constitution. The Court stated that the individual was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>not delegated any sovereign power of the State, vie., any part of the sovereignty delegated by the people through their Constitution to the executive, legislative, or judicial branches. <em>Id. </em>at 439-40, 229 A.2d 388; <em>see Hetrich v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>222 Md. 304, 159 A.2d 642 (1960); <em>Buchholtz, supra. </em>The <em>Buchholtz </em>line of cases clearly holds that, in order to satisfy the element of exercising part of the sovereignty of the State, one must perform a function that is peculiarly governmental in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The result reached herein is further supported by accepted rules of statutory construction. In our view, under the plain language of the Act, subsection (1) applies to <em>employees </em>without the qualification of whether they are exercising a part of the \u201csovereignty of the State,\u201d and subsection (4) applies to <em>any individual, </em>including non-employees, who exercise a part of the \u201csovereignty of the State.\u201d If all State employees were held to exercise some part of the State\u2019s sovereignty merely by virtue of being employed by the State, then employees would be included in subsection (4) and subsection (1) would be superfluous. Consequently, it follows that, in order to exercise some part of the \u201csovereignty of the State,\u201d more is required than doing some act for or on behalf of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Moreover, if appellant\u2019s position is correct, then the State would have waived immunity in subsection (4) with respect to tortious acts committed by all persons for whom the State is liable in tort. If the Legislature had intended to waive immunity in all actions in which the State is liable, it could have done so clearly and unequivocally. In fact, the waiver of immunity is limited and the scope of waiver is not synonymous with the State\u2019s liability in tort. We are mindful of the Legislature\u2019s admonition that the Act should be liberally construed, but we must interpret and apply the law as enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">To find that an individual exercised part of the sovereignty of the State when not employed by the State, when not performing a governmental function, and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>absence of a constitutional violation, would make any person furthering some business of the State \u201cState personnel.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This would make the scope of waiver of immunity synonymous with a basis for tort liability and would be inconsistent with the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The Legislature granted immunity to \u201cState personnel\u201d pursuant to C.J., \u00a7 5-399.2(b). If \u201cState personnel\u201d perform a negligent act, for which the State has waived immunity, then \u201cState personnel\u201d are immune from suit. Consequently, because the individuals who performed the tortious acts in this case and their employer, Basil, were not \u201cState personnel,\u201d they were not immune from suit. We note that the contract between the State and Basil required Basil to indemnify the State against liability for claims relating to performance under the contract and required Basil to carry liability insurance in certain minimal amounts. Thus, appellant was not left without recourse or remedy. Unfortunately for him, he did not timely file his action against Basil.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">. <em>See State v.

Appellant argues that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution gives rise to a duty by the State to provide medical care to inmates. This argument, apparently, is made to support the position that the State owes a non-delegable duty to inmates to provide a basis for tort liability. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>pp. 481-482. Additionally, a complaint that a health care provider negligently diagnosed or treated a medical condition is not a valid claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). The medical malpractice does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation even if the injured party is a prisoner. <em>Id. </em>Appellant also argues that the health care providers in question were acting under color of State law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and cites <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988), in support thereof. There is no claim under \u00a7 1983 in this case, and the question of whether an individual is acting under color of State law for that purpose has no relevance to whether an individual is \"State personnel\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>See Rucker, </em>316 Md. at 280, 558 A.2d 399.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
