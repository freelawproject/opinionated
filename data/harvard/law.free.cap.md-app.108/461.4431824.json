Helinski, appellant, (\u201cMs. Helinski\u201d) and Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, appellee, (\u201cC &amp; P\u201d) who were, respectively, employee and employer. Ms. Helinski, whose claim for workers\u2019 compensation was denied by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), sought relief from the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Court for Anne Arandel County. No recourse was found there, however, as the circuit court dismissed her claim on C &amp; P\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Continuing her quest for redress, Ms. Helinski now comes before us and presents two issues for our consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">I. Whether the lower court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s Motion to Strike the Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment where the latter was not filed with a supporting affidavit, and where the affidavit filed during the hearing on the motion was not upon personal knowledge as required by Md.Rule 2-501(c)[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">II. Whether the facts and circumstances surrounding the onset of Mrs. Helinski\u2019s disease and the date that Mrs. Helinski actually knew that the disablement was caused by her employment, demonstrate a material doubt about whether she filed her claim in time which requires resolution by a trial rather than by summary judgment[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">At oral argument, the parties asked that we address the substantive matter, issue II, \u25a0 to the exclusion of issue I. Accordingly, we turn our attention to issue II.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">C&amp;P<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> employed Ms. Helinski as a service representative beginning in 1972. For our purposes, nothing significant occurred in the employment relationship until February 15, 1989. On that day, Ms. Helinski met with Dr. Paul Berson, an ophthalmologist, who, in response to Ms. Helinski\u2019s statements and his examination, diagnosed her with \u201ccontact allergic dermatitis\u201d of the eyelid. Dr. Berson was unable to pinpoint the cause of Ms. Helinski\u2019s dermatitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Ms. Helinski informed her superiors of her dermatitis, and was directed to fill out health insurance and office forms. Ms. Helinski took Dr. Berson\u2019s bill and a prescription receipt to C &amp; P\u2019s medical department on March 28, 1989. Dr. Brown, a physician employed by C &amp; P, examined Ms. Helinski and suggested to her that, although he was not sure what was causing the dermatitis, formaldehyde might be a culprit. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>response to Dr. Brown\u2019s question as to whether there were new materials in Ms. Helinski\u2019s workplace, she replied that her Annapolis office contained new furniture and carpeting. Dr. Brown, according to Ms. Helinski, stated that C&amp;P would further investigate the cause of her dermatitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">C&amp;P returned to Ms. Helinski, sometime in May 1989, Dr. Berson\u2019s bill and the prescription receipt. Ms. Helinski\u2019s supervisor notified her that C&amp;P would not reimburse her because C&amp;P did not find her dermatitis to be work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In April of 1989, Ms. Helinski\u2019s supervisor advised her that according to the office furniture supplier formaldehyde was not used in the furniture\u2019s manufacturing process. Ms. Helinski\u2019s supervisor did note, however, that the carbonless paper manufacturers stated that although the papers did not contain harmful materials, they may have a \u201cpungent odor\u201d when first used.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Ms. Helinski submitted to C &amp; P\u2019s multiphasic health screen on July 20,1989. On that day she did not exhibit symptoms of her earlier eye irritation. The dermatitis, which had subsided by late May of 1989, had not caused Ms. Helinski to miss any time from work, nor had it prevented her from performing job related tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Ms. Helinski departed for maternity leave in October 1989 and returned in September 1990. Upon her return to active employment, she attended a six-week training session held at C &amp; P\u2019s Calverton office. When she returned to C &amp; P\u2019s Annapolis office, in late October, her symptoms reappeared. In December of 1990, Dr. Fratto, a C &amp; P physician, evaluated Ms. Helinski\u2019s complaints, and directed that her work station be changed. He suggested that her dermatitis might be related to her use of personal care products. Her condition improved in December of 1990 and January of 1991, during which time she was stationed in C &amp; P\u2019s Baltimore office.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The dermatitis and other maladies finally took their toll upon Ms. Helinski on April 25, 1991, when she missed her first time from work due to the symptoms. Until that day, she had not missed any work time because of the dermatitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>On January 30, 1992, Dr. Grace Ziem diagnosed Ms. Helinski as having an occupational disease. Later that year, on July 1,1992, Ms. Helinski filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, citing an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Commission conducted a hearing on August 3, 1993, at which Ms. Helinski testified. The next day, the Commission rendered its decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">Hearing was held in the above claim at Baltimore, Maryland on August 3,1993, on the following issue[s]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">1. Did the employee sustain an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">2. Limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">The Commission finds, based on the evidence presented, that the claimant did not sustain an occupational disease of multiple chemical sensitivity arising out of and in the course of employment as alleged to have occurred on February 28, 1992.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> In addition to the evidence presented, the claim would have been time barred by limitations even if the claimant had sustained an occupational disease. Therefore, the Commission will disallow the claim filed herein____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The Circuit Court entered summary judgment against Ms. Helinski because C &amp; P\u2019s \u201cexhibits show[ed] that [Ms. Helinski] ha[d] reason to believe she had an occupational disease as of the date she filed her On-Duty Injury Report.... [Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Helinski\u2019s] July 1, 1992 claim has, therefore, been filed too late....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\n<em>Timeliness of Filing of the Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e) governs the entry of judgment on a motion for summary judgment. In relevant part, the Rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Md.Rule 2-501(e) (1996). We review on appeal whether the lower court was legally correct. <em>Pope v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 590, 665 A.2d 713 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy recited the tenets of statutory construction in <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 632 A.2d 753 (1993). As he stated for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the true intention of the legislature. In searching for legislative intention, a court looks for the general purpose, aim, or policy behind the statute. We first look to the plain meaning of the language of the statute to discern legislative intent. Where the language is clear and unambiguous, a court may not add or delete words to make a statute reflect an intent not evidenced in that language to avoid a harsh result. A clearly worded statute must be construed without \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application. The language must be examined in the context in which it was adopted. All parts of a statute are to be read together to determine intent, and reconciled and harmonized to the extent possible. If reasonably possible, a statute should be read so that no part of it is rendered nugatory or superfluous. Where a statute may be susceptible of more than one meaning, the court may consider the consequences of each meaning and adopt that construction which avoids a result that is unreasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>illogical or inconsistent with common sense. It often is necessary to look at the development of a statute to discern legislative intent that may not be as clear upon initial examination of the current language of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 632 A.2d 753 (citations omitted). With these guidelines in mind, we turn to the statutory sections at issue and the interpretation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Act is now codified in Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. Desirous of not leaving us without guidance as to its intent, the Legislature included a section pertaining to the Act\u2019s construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014This title shall be construed to carry out its general purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">(b) <em>Rule for strict construction </em>inapplicable.\u2014The rule that a statute in derogation of the common law is to be strictly construed does not apply to this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00a7 9-102 of the Labor and Employment Article (Repl.Vol.1991) (\u201cL.E.\u201d). Maryland courts have followed these dictates. <em>See R &amp; T Constr. Co. v. Judge, </em>323 Md. 514, 529, 594 A.2d 99 (1991) (applying former Article 101, \u00a7 63, of the Maryland Annotated Code, which was the precursor of \u00a7 9-102).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The gist of C &amp; P\u2019s argument is that the statute of limitations has run its course on Ms. Helinski\u2019s suit because she knew that she had an occupational disease as early as March of 1989, or at the latest, in December of 1989. C&amp;P further contends that \u201c[tjhere is no dispute that [Ms. Helinski] was disabled throughout 1989 and thereafter. By [her] own testimony and the documents submitted with the Motion for Summary Judgment, [Ms. Helinski] has set forth specific intolerance to performing within her work environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">The Act generally grants to an employee or her dependents two years within which to file a claim for disablement or death.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">(a) <em>Filing </em>claim.\u2014If a covered employee suffers a disablement or death as a result of an occupational disease, the covered employee or the dependents of the covered employee shall file a claim with the Commission within 2 years, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>in the case of pulmonary dust disease within 3 years, after the date:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">(1) of disablement or death; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">(2) when the covered employee or the dependents of the covered employee first had <em>actual knowledge that the disablement was caused by the employment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">(b) <em>Failure to file </em>claim.\u2014Unless waived under subsection (c) of this section, failure to file a claim in accordance with subsection (a) of this section bars a claim under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">(c) Waiver.\u2014The defense of failure to file a claim in accordance with subsection (a) of this section is waived if the employer or its insurer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">(1) fails to raise the defense of the failure to file the claim at a hearing on the claim before the Commission makes any award or decision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">(2) pays compensation for the disability or death arising from the occupational disease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">(3) by its affirmative conduct leads the covered employee or other claimant to reasonably believe that the requirement of filing a claim has been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">\u00a7 9-711 L.E. (emphasis added). We glean from this section that Ms. Helinski could not have filed a claim unless she contracted an \u201coccupational disease\u201d that caused her \u201cdisablement.\u201d Occupational disease and disablement, the terms key to this discussion, are defined in other sections of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">According to \u00a7 9-101(g), the Act\u2019s definitions section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00a7 9-101 (g) L.E. Ms. Helinski\u2019s pleadings allege that her dermatitis and other symptoms arose, after their first manifestation, whenever she was situated in C &amp; P\u2019s Annapolis office. In addition, Dr. Ziem diagnosed her as having a work related disease. Thus, we next examine the term \u201cincapacitated.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>(g) \u201cOccupational disease\u201d means a disease contracted by a covered employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">(1) as a result of and in the course of employment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">(2) that causes the covered employee <footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> to become temporarily or permanently, partially or totally incapacitated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>As \u00a7 9\u2014101(g) declares, incapacity may take on four main forms: (1) temporary partial incapacitation; (2) temporary total incapacitation; (3) permanent partial incapacitation; and (4) permanent total incapacitation. These categories, however, cannot be rigidly maintained. For example, a covered employee may regress from number (2) to number (4) or progress from (2) to full health.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Furthermore, the incapacitation must relate to the covered employee\u2019s ability to perform whatever work that employee was engaged in last.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">(a) <em>\u201cDisablement\u201d </em>defined.\u2014In this section [subtitle 5, entitlement to and liability for compensation], \u201cdisablement\u201d means the event of a covered employee becoming partially or totally incapacitated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">(1) because of an occupational disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(2) from performing the work of the covered employee in the last occupation in which the covered employee was injuriously exposed to the hazards of the occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">(b) <em>Scope of application to employer and </em>insurer.\u2014Subsection (c) of this section applies only to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">(1) the employer in whose employment the covered employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the occupational disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">(2) the insurer liable for the risk when the covered employee, while employed by the employer, was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">(c) <em>Liability of employer and </em>insurer.\u2014Subject to subsection (d) of this section and except as otherwise provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>an employer and insurer to whom this subsection applies shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">(1) a covered employee of the employer for disability of the covered employee resulting from an occupational disease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">(2) the dependents of the covered employee for death of the covered employee resulting from an occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">(d) <em>Limitation on liability.\u2014An </em>employer and insurer are liable to provide compensation under subsection (c) of this section only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">(1) the occupational disease that caused the death or disability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">(1) is due to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist and the covered employee was employed before the date of disablement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">(ii) has manifestations that are consistent with those known to result from exposure to a biological, chemical, or physical agent that is attributable to the type of employment in which the covered employee was employed before the date of disablement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">(2) on the weight of the evidence, it reasonably may be concluded that the occupational disease was incurred as a result of the employment of the covered employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00a7 9\u2014502(a)\u2014(d) L.E. Disablement is equivalent to incapacitation. <em>Belschner v. Anchor Post Prods.

Whether a disablement suffices to be occupational in scope would depend, at least in part, upon how the occupation is defined and how much of the range of activity fairly included within the occupation is in fact foreclosed to the claimant. If, indeed, the claimant is able to continue to perform reasonably analogous work within the same occupational classification at the same or higher wages, he is not incapacitated \u2018from performing his work in the last occupation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Adams, </em>63 Md.App. at 593, 493 A.2d 392. <em>See CES Card Establishment Servs., Inc. v. Doub, </em>104 Md.App. 301, 656 A.2d 332 (1995) (summarizing discussion of definition of incapacitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">C&amp;P contends that Ms. Helinski\u2019s claim should be time barred because, it alleges, she knew, as early as March of 1989, or at the latest, as of December 1989, that she was disabled. Awareness is but one factor that a court considers when evaluating a statute of limitations defense. The following discussion from Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is instructive on this point.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Manifestation [of an occupational disease] is sometimes identified as a suitable starting point [towards ameliorating the harshness of a non-discovery statute of limitations]. Although it clearly should be a minimum requirement, standing alone it is inadequate. The reason is that a claimant could not reasonably be expected to file a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>every symptom such as shortness of breath until the connection with the employment is apparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">The modern view, then, requires knowledge. The period does not begin to run until the claimant knew or should have known the nature and seriousness of his condition and its relation to the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">But, while this takes care of the great bulk of the cases, there is still the possibility that there may be such knowledge without actual disability. It would not be desirable to force workers to apply for compensation in these circumstances, while still fully employed, on pain of losing their rights altogether. The optimum rule then, which has been always favored by this Treatise, and which appears also in the Council of State Government\u2019s Model Act, is a dual one:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">The period begins to run when the disease has culminated in disability and when by reasonable diligence the claimant could have discovered that his condition was a compensable one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, 1B The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation 7-696-97 (1995) (footnotes omitted) (\u201cTreatise\u201d). We agree with the comments of Larson, quoted above, as they relate to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Section 9-711 of the Act, which Larson groups in the discovery category, Treatise, at 7-702, is written in the disjunctive. Furthermore, \u00a7 9-711 is much more favorable to the covered employee or her dependents because it calls for actual knowledge. A covered employee may file a claim, time aside, after the disablement, \u00a7 9-711(a)(1), <em>or </em>upon actual knowledge that the disablement was caused by the employment, \u00a7 9-711(a)(2). In essence, \u00a7 9-711(a) provides to the covered employee or her dependents a choice of alternatives. A prerequisite to filing remains, however, in that a disablement, a <em>sine qua non, </em>must exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">In the case at bar, April 25, 1991 was the first day that Ms. Helinski was unable to perform her work. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>web of statutory sections discussed above,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> she could not have filed a claim until an occupational disease caused her disablement. Thus, the two year statute of limitations could not have begun to run until the date of her disablement, April 25, 1991, or the date that she first had actual knowledge that her disablement was caused by her employment. Therein lay the way of confusion followed by the Commission, and ultimately led to the Circuit Court\u2019s error. Consequently, we must reject C <em>&amp; </em>P\u2019s argument that Ms. Helinski knew of her disablement in 1989 because, as defined under the Act, she was not disabled until April 25, 1991, the operative date. We hold that the Circuit Court erred in granting C &amp; P\u2019s motion for summary judgment because Ms. Helinski, who had the option of filing her workers\u2019 compensation claim upon her disablement <em>or </em>upon the date that she first acquired actual knowledge that her disablement was caused by her employment, timely filed her claim within two years of April 25, 1991, the first day she was disabled, and, alternatively, within two years of Dr. Ziem\u2019s diagnosis, delivered on January 30, 1992, that Ms. Helinksi suffered from an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CAUSE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS IN THIS COURT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">.
