We conclude that it does not apply as a bar to recovery of unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Maria M. Taylor, appellee, applied for unemployment benefits after she was terminated from her employment with the County Commissioners of Frederick County, Maryland (\u201cthe County\u201d). The County discharged Taylor because her Frederick County driving permit, which she needed in order to perform her job, was revoked after Taylor was convicted for driving while intoxicated. The Board of Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d) of the Department of Economic and Employment Development (\u201cDEED\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant, held that Taylor\u2019s loss of her driver\u2019s permit constituted a breach of \u201ca condition of continued employment ... required by her employer,\u201d and amounted to a \u201cconstructive voluntary quit,\u201d thus disqualifying her from receiving benefits under the \u201cvoluntarily leaving work\u201d provision of the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Act, Md.Code (1991, 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 8-1001(a) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Taylor sought review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Washington County. It reversed, holding that Taylor\u2019s actions did not amount to \u201cvoluntarily leaving work.\u201d The Board has now appealed to this Court; appellee did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>submit a brief or appear at oral argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board presents the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">I. Is the Board\u2019s determination that Appellee voluntarily left her employment by failing to meet a condition of the employment correct as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">II. Is the Board\u2019s finding that Appellee voluntarily quit her employment supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We hold that the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Act does not authorize the denial of benefits to a claimant on the ground of \u201cconstructive voluntary quitting.\u201d Therefore, we answer both questions in the negative and shall affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\n<em>FACTUAL SUMMARY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Since 1986, Taylor was employed as a laborer for the County. Her job entailed manual work for the County Department of Parks and Recreation, including a variety of parks maintenance and custodial tasks. As part of her job, she was required to operate a County vehicle, both in the parks and on public roads. Therefore, as a condition of her employment, Taylor was obligated to have a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license and, in addition, a \u201cFrederick County Employee Driving Permit.\u201d In order for employees to retain their driving permits, the County required that the employees have fewer than six points on their driving records.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In January 1989, Taylor was stopped on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. She refused to submit to a chemical test and her driving record indicates that she was not convicted of any alcohol-related offense. Nor was her license revoked, notwithstanding her refusal to take the chemical test. Instead, the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) restricted her driver\u2019s license to employment and educational purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>This apparently occurred because Earl A. Eyler, the County parks superintendent, wrote a letter to the MVA, dated February 17, 1989, informing it that Taylor needed to have a license to perform her job satisfactorily. Nevertheless, by March 1989, the County discovered that Taylor had accumulated four points on her driving record, due to prior speeding violations. Consequently, her County driving permit was placed on probationary status, and Taylor was warned that she would be terminated if her County driving permit were revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Several years later, on February 2, 1993, Taylor was again arrested for driving while intoxicated and, on May 20, 1993, she was convicted. Pursuant to Md.Code (1977, 1993 Repl.Vol, 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 16\u2014402(a) of the Transportation Article (\u201cTransp\u201d), twelve points were assessed on her driving record. Nevertheless, the MVA again allowed Taylor to keep her license, and restricted her driving to employment and educational purposes. <em>See </em>Transp. \u00a7 16-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">During a routine check of driving records on July 20, 1993, the County discovered the points that had been assessed against Taylor\u2019s license as a result of the alcohol offense, and it revoked her County driving permit. But, for reasons that are not apparent from the record, the County continued to retain Taylor as an employee. In February 1994, however, Taylor was ordered to clear the points from her license within ninety days, which she had no authority to do. Consequently, on May 27, 1994, Eyler sent Taylor a letter terminating her employment, effective the following day. The letter stated, \u201c[t]he ability to drive is essential to satisfactorily perform the job of parks laborer,\u201d and added, \u201cOnly a temporary accommodation of this requirement can be made for this position. I have made this temporary accommodation for a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Taylor filed for unemployment benefits under L.E., Title 8. A claims examiner concluded that \u201cinsufficient evidence has been presented to show any misconduct connected with the work.\u201d The claims examiner thus allowed Taylor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The County contested this determination and, on July 15, 1994, an evidentiary hearing was conducted before a hearing examiner. The hearing examiner found that, \u201cas a condition of her employment,\u201d Taylor was \u201crequired to possess ... the ability to obtain ... a Frederick Employee County Permit.\u201d The hearing examiner also found that the \u201cclaimant became aware of the [Cjounty\u2019s regulation that an accumulation of more then [sic] six points on a drivers [sic] record can result in disciplinary action leading to termination of employment.\u201d The hearing examiner further noted that, although the claimant had the \u201clegal right\u201d to drive to and from work, she could not drive a vehicle while at work. Therefore, the hearing examiner determined that the County \u201cwas justified in discharging the claimant for her inability to continue in her work classification for lack of a valid County drivers [sic] permit. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Although the hearing examiner concluded that Taylor\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cmisconduct connected with employment,\u201d within the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 8-1003(a), the hearing examiner rejected any finding of gross misconduct. The hearing examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">Accordingly, I cannot find that the claimant\u2019s violation of the employer\u2019s rules concerning driving privileges rises to the level of gross misconduct---- But, clearly, the claimant\u2019s conduct in driving while intoxicated is a matter which is connected with the work, because she knew or should have know [sic] that the accumulation of driving points could result ip termination from employment, and that she would be in violation of the employer\u2019s rules and regulations if such would occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Taylor was thus denied unemployment benefits for ten weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Both Taylor and the County appealed to the Board. After the Board reviewed the record, it issued an opinion in which it adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact, but disagreed with the hearing examiner\u2019s legal conclusion. The Board determined that Taylor\u2019s failure to retain her County driving permit constituted a \u201cconstructive voluntary quit\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>meaning of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a). Accordingly, the Board disqualified Taylor from receiving benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Taylor then sought judicial review in the circuit court, which held that the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that Taylor had voluntarily left her employment. It thus reversed the Board\u2019s decision, and remanded the case to the Board for a determination of whether Taylor\u2019s actions constituted misconduct under L.E. \u00a7 8-1003(a) or gross misconduct under L.E. \u00a7 8-1002(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The standard for our review is established by L.E. \u00a7 8-512(d), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">In a judicial proceeding under this section, findings of fact of the Board of Appeals are conclusive and the jurisdiction of the court is confined to questions of law if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">(1) findings of fact are supported by evidence that is competent, material, and substantial in view of the entire record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">(2) there is no fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">In reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, our review is generally limited to a determination of: (1) whether the agency applied the correct principles of law; and (2) whether the agency\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Caucus Distributors, Inc. v. Maryland Securities Commissioner, </em>320 Md. 313, 323-24, 577 A.2d 783 (1990); <em>Board of Education of Montgomery County v. Paynter, </em>303 Md. 22, 35, 491 A.2d 1186 (1985); <em>Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City v. James, </em>96 Md.App. 401, 418-19, 625 A.2d 361, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, </em>332 Md. 381, 631 A.2d 451 (1993). <em>See generally Anderson v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>330 Md. 187, 210-13, 623 A.2d 198 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Our review of the Board\u2019s findings of fact is deferential. In the absence of fraud, our inquiry is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>findings are supported by substantial evidence and are reasonable, not whether they are right. <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 515, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978). We examine the agency\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in light of the record as a whole\u2014that is, whether a reasoning mind could have made those findings from the evidence adduced. <em>Singletary v. Maryland State Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>87 Md.App. 405, 416, 589 A.2d 1311 (1991). We will not engage in our own fact finding, however. <em>Board of Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the City of Baltimore v. Novik, </em>87 Md.App. 308, 312, 589 A.2d 976 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>326 Md. 450, 605 A.2d 145 (1992). Instead, the tasks <em>of </em>drawing inferences from the evidence and resolving conflicting evidence are exclusively the province of the Board. <em>Prince George\u2019s Doctors\u2019 Hospital, Inc. v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, </em>302 Md. 193, 200-02, 486 A.2d 744 (1985). A reviewing court must also take care not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of the Board. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Callahan, </em>105 Md.App. 25, 34, 658 A.2d 1112 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In contrast, our review of the Board\u2019s decisions on issues of law is not deferential. <em>Columbia Road Citizens\u2019 Association v. Montgomery County, </em>98 Md.App. 695, 698, 635 A.2d 30 (1994). Thus, \u201cthe reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Liberty Nursing Center, Inc. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 443, 624 A.2d 941 (1993). On issues of statutory construction, we will afford substantial deference to an agency\u2019s construction of a statute that it is charged with administering. <em>Westinghouse, </em>105 Md.App. at 37, 658 A.2d 1112. Nevertheless, an administrative agency is not authorized to disregard the terms of a statute when that statute is clear and unambiguous. <em>See Sugarloaf Citizens Association v. Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, </em>323 Md. 641, 663 n. 1, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991); <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 239, 60 A.2d 691 (1948); <em>Baines v. Board of Liquor License Commission</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>ers for Baltimore City, </em>100 Md.App. 136, 141, 640 A.2d 232 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">With these principles in mind, we shall analyze the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The Board disqualified Taylor from receiving benefits pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1), which states: \u201cAn individual who otherwise is eligible to receive benefits is disqualified from receiving benefits if the Secretary finds that unemployment results from voluntarily leaving work without good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet the Board does not contend that Taylor actually \u201cvoluntarily [left] work\u201d or quit. Rather, it contends that, based on her conduct, Taylor essentially put the employer in the position of having to terminate her because, without a County driving permit, she no longer met the criteria for employment. Thus, according to the Board, she \u201cconstructively\u201d voluntarily left work due to the drunk driving conviction that resulted in the loss of the County driving permit that she needed for her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We begin our analysis with a discussion of the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving. It is a theory under which an employee who is actually discharged or terminated by the employer is nonetheless deemed to have \u201cconstructively\u201d voluntarily quit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the doctrine, the employee\u2019s actual intent to terminate the employment is not relevant. The Board apparently first adopted the doctrine in 1984 in <em>Queen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>v. Maryland Lumber Co., </em>No. 910-BR-84 (November 21, 1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Later, in <em>Hoffman v. Maryland Car Care, </em>No. 643-BH-93 (April 13, 1993), the Board described the principle as follows: \u201c[W]hen a claimant has failed to abide by a condition of employment (in this case possession of a valid drivers [sic] license) the absence of which leaves the employer <em>absolutely no choice </em>but to terminate the claimant\u2019s services, the claimant has \u2018constructively\u2019 voluntarily quit his employment without good cause or valid circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">While the states have split on the issue of whether to recognize the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving, <em>see generally </em>76 Am.Jur.2d <em>Unemployment Compensation </em>\u00a7 107 (1992); 81 C.J.S. <em>Social Security </em>\u00a7 225b (1977), the Board\u2019s articulation of the principle of constructive voluntary leaving is similar to the expressions of the doctrine by courts of those states that have recognized it. In <em>Steinberg v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, </em>87 Cal.App.3d 582, 585, 151 Cal.Rptr. 133, 134-35 (1978), for example, California\u2019s intermediate appellate court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">A claimant is said to have constructively quit his job when, although discharged by the employer, the claimant himself set in motion the chain of events which resulted in the employer\u2019s having no choice except to terminate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">All three of the following elements must be present before it can be said that a claimant has constructively quit his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">1. The claimant voluntarily committed an act which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">2. made it impossible for the employer to utilize his services, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">3. the claimant knew or reasonably should have known the act would jeopardize his job and possibly result in the loss of his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">87 Cal.App.3d at 585, 151 Cal.Rptr. at 134-35 (citation and italics omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The issue is one of first impression in Maryland, although the Board asserts that the Court of Appeals \u201crecognized\u201d the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving in <em>Allen v. Core Target City Youth Program, </em>275 Md. 69, 338 A.2d 237 (1975). In that case, the Court construed former Art. 95A, \u00a7 6(a), the predecessor to L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board focuses on the following statement in <em>Allen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">[W]e can envision limited circumstances where, although the employee was shown to have been factually and technically discharged, it might be evident that he in fact undertook to terminate the employment relationship and thus be held to have \u201cconstructively\u201d voluntarily left his employment. This is particularly true where an employee is shown to have abandoned his employment by pursuing a course of conduct which resulted in his severance from employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">275 Md. at 81, 338 A.2d 237. This statement is, however, <em>dictum. </em>Indeed, on the next page of its opinion, the Court stated that it was merely <em>assuming </em>the applicability of the doctrine <em>without deciding </em>whether Maryland would recognize it. The Court said: \u201cAssuming that the doctrine of \u2018constructive voluntary leaving\u2019 would be applicable under appropriate circumstances, it is self-evident that the facts in this case do not bring it within that doctrine.\u201d <em>Id., </em>275 Md. at 82-83, 338 A.2d 237.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Dictum </em>is, of course, worthy of consideration, but it is not binding. In <em>State v. Wilson, </em>106 Md.App. 24, 664 A.2d 1 (1995), Judge Moylan, writing for this Court, stated at the conclusion of an extensive discussion of the differences between <em>dicta </em>and holdings: <em>\u201c[SJtare decisis </em>is ill-served if readers hang slavishly on every casual or hurried word as if it had bubbled from the earth at Delphi. <em>Obiter dicta, </em>if noticed at all, should be taken with a large grain of salt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>106 Md.App. at 39, 664 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Furthermore, any notion that the <em>Allen </em>Court recognized the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving was put to rest by the Court in <em>Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Inc. v. Department of Employment and Training; </em>309 Md. 28, 522 A.2d 382 (1987). There, the Court expressly stated that the issue was still open. The Court said: \u201cWhether the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving is recognized in Maryland has not been decided by this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 522 A.2d 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This case squarely presents for resolution the question of the viability of the doctrine. There is evidence in the record that Taylor\u2019s County driving permit was a condition of her employment, that the County permit was essential to Taylor\u2019s ability to work, and she lost this permit through her voluntary act of drinking and driving. There was also testimony that Taylor was terminated because, without her driving permit, she was unable to perform the job for which she was hired. These facts fit within the concept of constructive voluntary leaving as articulated by the Board and the courts of other states. Therefore, we must determine whether the doctrine is encompassed in L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(l). In essence, this is an issue of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The principles of statutory construction are well settled. The polestar of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature. <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 260, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994); <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Gaddy, </em>335 Md. 342, 346, 643 A.2d 442 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>(1994). In our inquiry, the primary source for determining that intent is the language of the statute. <em>In re Douglas P., </em>333 Md. 387, 392, 635 A.2d 427 (1994); <em>State v. Patrick A., </em>312 Md. 482, 487, 540 A.2d 810 (1988); <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Martin G. Imbach Inc., </em>101 Md.App. 138, 144, 643 A.2d 513, <em>cert. denied, </em>336 Md. 593, 650 A.2d 239 (1994). We read the statute in a natural and sensible fashion, assigning its words their ordinary and commonly understood meanings. <em>Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 559, 644 A.2d 537 (1994); <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>313 Md. 118, 124-25, 544 A.2d 764 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">A litigant who asks us to ignore the plain language of the statute bears an \u201cexceptionally heavy\u201d burden. <em>Union Bank v. Wolas, </em>502 U.S. 151, 156, 112 S.Ct. 527, 530, 116 L.Ed.2d 514 (1991). That party must show that it is \u201cmanifest\u201d that the legislature could not possibly have meant what it said in that language, <em>see State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9 (1990); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188 (1990), or that a natural reading of the statute would lead to an absurd result, <em>see Thanos v. State, </em>332 Md. 511, 525, 632 A.2d 768 (1993); <em>In re Special Investigation No. 281, </em>299 Md. 181, 200, 473 A.2d 1 (1984). Courts are not \u201cat liberty to gather a legislative intention contrary to the plain words of the statute or to insert words to express an intention not shown in the original form.\u201d <em>Allen, 275 </em>Md. at 77, 338 A.2d 237, citing <em>Celanese Corp. of America v. Davis, </em>186 Md. 463, 47 A.2d 379 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We also read the language of the statute in the context that it appears, considering surrounding statutes, the statutory scheme as a whole, <em>see Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 41, 641 A.2d 870 (1994), and the purpose that the Legislature had in mind in enacting the statute. <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. 188, 194, 626 A.2d 972 (1993); <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590 (1992). Moreover, \u201cwhen there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislative body.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Montgomery County v.

As we continue our analysis, we shall apply these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We turn next to the language of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1). The provision is relatively straightforward. The statute disqualifies claimants from receiving benefits if their unemployment \u201cresults from voluntarily leaving work without good cause.\u201d The plain language of the statute suggests that a claimant is disqualified under its terms only when the employee intentionally terminates his or her employment or affirmatively undertakes or elects to do so. <em>See </em>The American Heritage Dictionary at 762 (1983) (defining \u201cvoluntary,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>as \u201c[a]rising from one\u2019s own free will,\u201d \u201cacting by choice and without constraint or guarantee of reward,\u201d \u201c[n]ot accidental; intentional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The question is whether an employee, who is involuntarily discharged by the employer based on the employee\u2019s voluntary act, such as driving while intoxicated, has voluntarily quit his or her employment. Clearly, a discharge is not the same thing as a voluntary quit. <em>See MacFarland v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>158 Pa.Super. 418, 45 A.2d 423, 425 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Two decisions of the Court of Appeals support a plain meaning approach to L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1): <em>Allen v. Core Target City Youth Program, supra, </em>275 Md. 69, 338 A.2d 237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>which, as we have noted, construed the predecessor to L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1), and <em>Wills v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 480, 667 A.2d 331 (1995), which used <em>Allen </em>to construe the term \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d in Maryland\u2019s child support law, Md.Code Ann., Fam.Law \u00a7\u00a7 12-201(b)(2) <em>&amp; </em>12-204(b) (1991 &amp; Supp.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In <em>Allen, </em>the Court held that a teacher who was discharged after she \u201ccontumaciously\u201d refused to prepare for courses that she had undertaken to teach had not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d left work. The Court recognized that \u201c[t]he term \u2018leaving work voluntarily\u2019 is not anywhere defined in the statute and absent some imperative reason for enlarging its meaning the term \u2018should be construed as having its ordinary and commonly-accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>275 Md. at 77, 338 A.2d 237, quoting <em>Scoville Service, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 395, 306 A.2d 534 (1973). It determined that the \u201cphrase \u2018leaving work voluntarily\u2019 cannot by construction be extended so as to make it applicable to any case which is not shown to be <em>clearly </em>within the contemplation of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>275 Md. at 78, 338 A.2d 237 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The Court also considered dictionary definitions of the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201c1.

Although it certainly cannot be challenged that her conduct precipitated her severance, based upon the factual findings that she contumaciously refused to prepare herself to perform the duties she had undertaken, the record clearly demonstrates that the employer was the party who elected to and did, in fact, terminate the relationship when she was discharged. She did not quit or otherwise \u201cvoluntarily\u201d leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">In view of the plain meaning of the statutory language, and the clear intention of the Legislature, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, upon the factual findings made by the referee, as adopted and affirmed by the Board, that the appellant\u2019s unemployment was \u201cdue to [her] leaving work voluntarily, without good cause.\u201d We hold-that the factual circumstances resulting in her termination did not bring her case within the provisions of Art. 95A, \u00a7 6(a). To construe the statute otherwise would render the distinction maintained by the Legislature between unemployment due to \u201cleaving work voluntarily\u201d and unemployment resulting from discharge as completely meaningless and the Legislature, in our view, did not intend such a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\"><em>Id., 275 </em>Md. at 79-80, 338 A.2d 237 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The Court of Appeals\u2019s recent decision of <em>Wills v. Jones, supra, </em>is also instructive. There, the Court construed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>term \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d in Maryland\u2019s child support law, Md.Code Ann., Fam.Law \u00a7\u00a7 12-201(b)(2) <em>&amp; </em>12-204(b) (1991 &amp; Supp.1995). In interpreting the word \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d the Court discussed <em>Allen </em>at length and stated, \u201cOur inquiry here is similar to that made in the unemployment context.\u201d <em>Wills, </em>340 Md. at 496, 667 A.2d 331. The Court held in <em>Wills </em>that a father who was incarcerated was not \u201cvoluntarily impoverished\u201d unless he committed the crime with the intent of going to prison to become impoverished. <em>Id., </em>340 Md. at 497, 667 A.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">It is salient that, in <em>Wills, </em>the Court distinguished the intent to become impoverished from the intent to commit the act that necessarily resulted in impoverishment. Thus, the Court rejected the mother\u2019s claim that the father had voluntarily impoverished himself because he purposely committed a criminal act that resulted in his impoverishment: \u201cThe contention that Jones\u2019s incarceration and subsequent impoverishment should be considered \u2018voluntary\u2019 because he made the free and conscious choice to commit a crime stretches the meaning of the word beyond its acceptable boundaries. Jones\u2019s incarceration can only be said to be \u2018voluntary\u2019 if it was an intended result.\u201d <em>Id., </em>340 Md. at 496, 667 A.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Board attempts to rely on a \u201cforeseeability\u201d argument to support its view that this case is governed by the doctrine of constructive voluntary quit. It argues that, although Taylor \u201cmay not have intended the ultimate consequences of her decision to drive drunk,\u201d her conduct was tantamount to a voluntary quit because \u201cit was reasonably foreseeable that her decision to engage in this conduct would result in a conviction, the accumulation of 12 points on her driving record, and the loss of the County driving permit.\u201d This is a mirror image of an argument that the Court of Appeals also rejected in <em>Wills. </em>Rejecting as \u201cwithout merit\u201d the child support obligee\u2019s contention that an incarcerated obligor had \u201cvoluntarily\u201d impoverished himself because it was foreseeable that he would be imprisoned if he committed a crime, the Court said: \u201c[T]he foreseeability of an action\u2019s possible consequences is not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cient to conclude that the actor brought those consequences about \u2018voluntarily.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>340 Md. at 496, 667 A.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The structure of the Maryland unemployment insurance law also supports our conclusion that the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving is not embodied in the statutory scheme. The doctrine denies benefits to claimants because of improper conduct on their part. But the Code <em>already has </em>provisions that disqualify claimants because of their misdeeds. Specifically, L.E. \u00a7 8-1002 provides a total disqualification for \u201cgross misconduct,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> L.E. \u00a7 8-1002.1 provides a total disqualification for \u201caggravated misconduct,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and L.E. \u00a7 8-1003 provides a partial disqualification for \u201cmisconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The General As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>sembly\u2019s enactment of statutes to disqualify claimants because of their conduct indicates that it considered the question of what behavior warrants a sanction and drafted the statutory scheme accordingly. <em>See Allen, 275 </em>Md. at 80, 338 A.2d 237. Adding a new disqualification provision would interfere with the carefully crafted provisions of the Code by creating a \u201chybrid\u201d ground for disqualification that would lie somewhere between the \u201cvoluntarily leaving work\u201d provision and the \u201cmisconduct\u201d provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The foregoing cases, coupled with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cvoluntary\u201d and the structure of the statutory scheme, lead inexorably to the conclusion that the statute disqualifies persons who depart their employment by their own free choice; it does not disqualify persons who commit a voluntary antecedent act that eventually results in discharge. Instead, the issue of whether an employee has \u201cvoluntarily le[ft] work\u201d within the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1) hinges on the employee\u2019s <em>intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We conclude that it is a necessary element of \u201cvoluntarily leaving work\u201d that the employee have the <em>intent </em>to terminate the employment relationship voluntarily. <em>Swanson v. State, </em>114 Idaho 607, 759 P.2d 898, 900 (1988); <em>Coates v. Bingham Mechanical &amp; Metal Products, Inc., </em>96 Idaho 606, 533 P.2d 595, 597 (1975). <em>See Gaspro, Limited v. Commission of Labor and Indus. Relations, </em>46 Haw. 164, 377 P.2d 932, 936 (1962) (leaving work voluntarily means \u201cthe volitional severance of the employment relation by a worker\u201d); <em>Kitchen v. G.R. Herberger\u2019s, Inc., </em>262 Minn. 135, 114 N.W.2d 64, 67 (1962) (voluntary unemployment requires \u201csome act of the employee acquiescing in the unemployment\u201d [quotation omitted] ). Thus, in order to establish that a claimant voluntarily left work within the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1), it must be shown that the employee intentionally, purposely, or by his or her own choice or will, terminated the employment or, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>on the <em>Allen </em>Court\u2019s <em>dictum, </em>that the employee committed an act that the employee \u201cknowingly intended\u201d to cause a discharge. Thus, it is the claimant\u2019s <em>intent </em>to become unemployed that is critical, and not the claimant\u2019s intent to commit a particular act that culminates in discharge. This differs markedly from the doctrine of \u201cconstructive voluntary leaving,\u201d which, as we observed earlier, is a precisely-defined concept, with respect to which the claimant\u2019s, intent to leave employment is irrelevant. <em>Ante, </em>at 263-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We recognize, however, that an employee\u2019s conduct, both verbal and non-verbal, may, under some circumstances, constitute a voluntary quit, even if the employee does not expressly terminate the employment. Thus, it is not necessary for the employee actually to say, \u201cI quit,\u201d or words to that effect, in order to be deemed to have voluntarily left work. What is critical, however, is that the employee\u2019s conduct must demonstrate the <em>intent </em>to quit voluntarily. Therefore, if an employee is to be deemed to have voluntarily left work based on his or her non-verbal conduct, it must be established that the employee engaged in the conduct with the <em>intent </em>to terminate the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">A claimant\u2019s intent or \u201cstate of mind is a factual issue for the Board to resolve.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t. of Economic and Employment Develop. v. Hager, </em>96 Md.App. 362, 371 (1993). We acknowledge, of course, that one\u2019s intent cannot be proven directly. <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201c[t]he matter is determined by drawing reasonable inferences from admitted conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Hager, </em>the employee\u2019s \u201cadamant refusal to accept a [shift] reassignment,\u201d 96 Md.App. at 371, 625 A.2d 342, without adequate explanation, culminated in his termination. Based on the facts and inferences drawn from the facts, we upheld the Board\u2019s conclusion that the claimant\u2019s conduct was deliberate and willful, and thus constituted gross misconduct within the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 8-1002(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>In this case, however, the Board did not make any findings concerning appellee\u2019s intent to terminate employment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the Board, in adopting the hearing examiner\u2019s findings, determined only that the claimant \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that an accumulation of points would constitute a violation of the employer\u2019s rules and <em>\u201ccould\u201d </em>result in the discharge. That the employee <em>could </em>be fired does not mean that she <em>would </em>be fired. Indeed, the hearing examiner found that the employee was permitted to work for one year following her alcohol-related driving offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The case of <em>Maryland Employment Security Board v. Poorbaugh, </em>195 Md. 197, 200, 72 A.2d 753 (1950), illustrates the point. The Court held that a Board finding that the claimant had voluntarily left work was supported by evidence to the effect that the claimant stayed home from work because it was too cold, was warned by the employer to come back to work the following day or not to come back at all, and then did not appear back at work until four months later. Obviously, it could be found from those facts that the claimant voluntarily abandoned his employment. <em>Compare Wickey v. Employment Security Commission, </em>369 Mich. 487, 120 N.W.2d 181 (1963) (sailor discharged after he missed a ship\u2019s sailing because he was watching a movie; <em>held, </em>sailor had not voluntarily quit).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We also find unpersuasive two \u201cpublic policy\u201d arguments that the Board proffers in support of its position. First, the Board argues that the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving is an extension of the policy of the General Assembly articulated in L.E. \u00a7 8-102, the \u201clegislative findings and policy\u201d statute of the unemployment insurance code. In \u00a7 8-102, the General Assembly declared that <em>\u201cinvoluntary </em>unemployment\u201d was a menace that the law sought to combat, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the Legislature was establishing a system of aid \u201cfor the benefit of individuals unemployed <em>through no fault of their oum.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The Board claims that, because Taylor was at \u201cfault\u201d for her unemployment because of her voluntary decision to drink and drive and the resulting loss of her County driver\u2019s license, she is not entitled to share in the benefits from this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This, too, is an argument that the Court of Appeals has consistently rejected. The Court has held that, although the \u201cno fault of their own\u201d language of L.E. \u00a7 8-102(c) is a \u201cguide for the interpretation and application\u201d of the Code, <em>see </em>L.E. \u00a7 8-102(a); <em>Celanese Corp. of America v. Davis, </em>186 Md. 463, 466-67, 47 A.2d 379 (1946), the language of L.E. \u00a7 8-102(c) does not create a, separate ground for disqualification due to the \u201cfault\u201d of the claimant. <em>MEMCO v. Maryland Employment Security Administration, </em>280 Md. 536, 548, 375 A.2d 1086 (1977); <em>Fino v. Maryland Employment Security Board, </em>218 Md. 504, 507, 147 A.2d 738 (1959); <em>Tucker v. American Smelting &amp; Refining Co., </em>189 Md. 250, 257-58, 55 A.2d 692 (1947). Instead, only the specific grounds for disqualification enumerated in the statutory scheme may be employed to deny a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits. <em>See MEMCO, </em>280 Md. at 548, 375 A.2d 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">It is thus the specific provisions of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1) that we must consider to evaluate the Board\u2019s contention. Because the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving is not encompassed in the language of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1), or any other provision, claimants cannot be denied benefits on the basis of that doctrine, regardless of their \u201cfault.\u201d <em>See Snyder v. State, </em>189 Md. 167, 170, 55 A.2d 485 (1947) (courts must determine legislative intent from the language of the statute at issue, and not from any general statement of policy). \u201cIf there is incongruity between the \u2018general policy\u2019 [provision] and the result of particular provisions in [the disqualification statute at issue], the incongruity may be eliminated only by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>189 Md. at 258, 55 A.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Second, the Board also contends that, as a matter of policy, awarding benefits to Taylor would impose \u201can unjust burden\u201d on the County by forcing the County to pay Taylor unemployment compensation, in addition to bearing the cost of paying her replacement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board argues that \u201cthere is an inherent inequity\u201d if the County is required to bear this double cost, because Taylor\u2019s unemployment resulted from her decision to drink and drive\u2014a voluntary, illegal act over which the County had no control. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The problem with the argument is that the Board is directing it to the wrong branch of government. The statute simply does not admit to an interpretation allowing disqualification for claimants who are discharged because of the voluntary commission of an act that triggers discharge. Recognizing the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving would require us to rewrite the statute to add a new disqualification provision that the General Assembly did not see fit to include. It is the function of the General Assembly to address the policy issues proffered by appellant and determine whether to adopt the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving. <em>See, e.g., </em>Wis.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 108.04(1)(f) (West 1988 &amp; Supp.1995) (employee disqualified if a license that the employee is \u201crequired by law to have ... to perform his or her customary work\u201d was suspended, revoked, or not renewed due to the employee\u2019s own fault).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We must view the law as it is, and not as we might wish it to be. <em>McCance v. Lindau, </em>63 Md.App. 504, 512, 492 A.2d 1352 (1985). <em>See Amalgamated Casualty Insurance Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 534-35, 212 A.2d 311 (1965) (\u201cTo supply omissions\u201d in a statute \u201ctranscends the judicial function,\u201d quoting <em>Iselin v.

Gregg, </em>199 Md. 662, 668, 87 A.2d 581 (1952). \u201c[W]here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of words with a view towards making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Fikar v. Montgomery County, </em>333 Md. 430, 434-35, 635 A.2d 977 (1994) (internal quotations omitted). In this case, the applicable statute and the entire statutory scheme are clear; adopting the principle of constructive voluntary leaving would cross the proper boundaries of judicial decision-making and would constitute judicial law-making. <em>See Todd v. Weikle, </em>36 Md.App. 663, 682, 376 A.2d 104 (1977) (\u201cit is not the function of an appellate court to rewrite a statutory provision\u201d). <em>See also Fairbanks v. McCarter, </em>330 Md. 39, 47, 622 A.2d 121 (1993) (\u201cwe will not inferentially manufacture additional components of the statute that do not exist\u201d). This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we decline the Board\u2019s invitation to rewrite L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1) by judicial fiat. Because of the unambiguous statutory language, the policy of construing disqualification provisions narrowly, and considerations concerning the proper scope of judicial functions, we hold that the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving does not apply in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Cases from other jurisdictions support our conclusion that L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1) does not embody the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving. <em>See Brousseau v. Maine Employment Security Commission, </em>470 A.2d 327 (Me.1984); <em>Lewis v. Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>39 Conn.Supp. 371, 465 A.2d 340 (1983); <em>Przekaza v. Department of Employment Security, </em>136 Vt. 355, 392 A.2d 421 (1978). Each of these cases rejects the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving, based on the clarity of the language of the voluntarily-leaving-work statutes in their jurisdictions and the policy in favor of eligibility for benefits. In <em>Przekaza, </em>the Vermont Supreme Court, after noting that that state\u2019s unemployment insurance scheme only allowed disqualification in three instances (voluntarily leaving work without good cause, discharge for gross misconduct connected with the work, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>failure to apply for or accept suitable work), stated: \u201cThe defendant asks us in effect to rewrite the statute by adding a fourth instance of disqualification, where an employee has been discharged for misconduct <em>not </em>connected with his work. This we will not do____\u201d 392 A.2d at 422 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In <em>Lewis, </em>the Appellate Session of the Connecticut Superior Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">Where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, the intent of the legislature must be derived from that statute. This court cannot, by construction, read into such a statute provisions which are not clearly stated. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of [the voluntarily-leaving-work statute] would have us do just that. Moreover, it would contravene the clearly remedial purpose of the Unemployment Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">465 A.2d at 341 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">What the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine stated in <em>Brousseau </em>is particularly cogent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">The term \u201cvoluntarily\u201d is not defined in the Act, nor is there any reference to the doctrine of \u201cconstructive voluntary quit\u201d or \u201cconstructive resignation.\u201d Words which are not expressly defined in the applicable statute must be accorded their plain and common meaning and should be construed according to their natural import. Therefore, in the context of [the voluntarily-leaving-work statute], an individual leaves work \u201cvoluntarily\u201d only when freely making an affirmative choice to do so. The clear import of the statute is that it is the intentional act of leaving employment rather than the deliberate commission of an antecedent act which disqualifies an individual from eligibility for benefits. To read the doctrine of constructive voluntary quit or constructive resignation into [the statute] is to overstep the bounds of administrative construction and usurp the legislative function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay\">470 A.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">We recognize that other jurisdictions have held that employees who are discharged after they lose, through their miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>duct, a driver\u2019s license that they must have in order to work are deemed to have \u201cvoluntarily quit\u201d within the meaning of those states\u2019 versions of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1). <em>See, e.g., In re Paladino, </em>202 A.D.2d 932, 609 N.Y.S.2d 694 (1994); <em>In re Moulton, </em>198 A.D.2d 595, 603 N.Y.S.2d 240 (1993); <em>Yardville Supply Co. v. Board of Review, Department of Labor, </em>114 N.J. 371, 554 A.2d 1337 (1989); <em>Olmeda v. Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>394 Mass. 1002, 475 N.E.2d 1216 (1985); <em>Donahue v. Catherwood, </em>33 A.D.2d 848, 305 N.Y.S.2d 827 (1969); <em>Echols v. Michigan Employment Security Commission, </em>380 Mich. 87, 155 N.W.2d 824 (1968). But we find the reasoning of the courts of Vermont, Connecticut, and Maine more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In our view, the decisions upholding constructive voluntary leaving are flawed to the extent that they extend beyond the plain language of the particular statutes, and impose a disqualification provision that is not there. We agree with the dissent in the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Yardville Supply Co., supra, </em>a ease involving a truck driver terminated after his driver\u2019s license was suspended due to a drunk driving conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">I hold no brief for drunk drivers. But as judges we do not have the power to punish their conduct more than has the Legislature. To say that this driver \u201cquit\u201d work is to say that words mean what we want them to mean.... Drunk driving is an abhorrent social malady. But courts are expected to apply legislative policy, not enact it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">554 A.2d at 1340, 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Finally, the Board also cites several cases from Pennsylvania that held that employees who needed to drive as part of their jobs, and who were discharged after their licenses were suspended or revoked, were ineligible for unemployment benefits. <em>See HiNe v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>103 Pa.Cmwlth. 267, 520 A.2d 102 (1987); <em>Corbacio v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>78 Pa.Cmwlth. 70, 466 A.2d 1117 (1983); <em>Varmecky v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>60 Pa.Cmwlth. 640, 432 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>A.2d 635 (1981); <em>Huff v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>40 Pa.Cmwlth. 11, 396 A.2d 94 (1978), <em>aff'd per curiam </em>487 Pa. 448, 409 A.2d 854 (1980). We decline to follow these cases for a different reason. In Pennsylvania, the \u201clegislative findings and policy\u201d statute of their unemployment insurance scheme, Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 43, \u00a7 752 (1992), stating that the policy of the act is to aid individuals \u201cunemployed through no fault of their own,\u201d has been held to be a substantive ground for disqualifying claimants who were at \u201cfault\u201d for their unemployment. <em>See Strokes v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>29 Pa.Cmwlth. 584, 372 A.2d 485, 486 n. 1 (1977). None of the Pennsylvania cases cited by appellant held that the claimants had voluntarily quit their employment; instead, each of them held that the claimants were at \u201cfault\u201d for their discharges and were ineligible on that independent ground. Because, as we stated earlier, the legislative findings and policy statute of the Maryland unemployment insurance act, L.E. \u00a7 8-102, is not a substantive ground for disqualification, <em>see MEMCO v. Maryland Employment Security Administration, supra, </em>280 Md. at 548, 375 A.2d 1086, these Pennsylvania cases are not apposite. In fact, a Pennsylvania court rejected the doctrine of constructive voluntary leaving long ago. <em>See MacFarland v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>158 Pa.Super. 418, 45 A.2d 423 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In the wake of the preceding discussion, we now apply L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1) to the facts of the case at bar. In order to sustain the Board\u2019s determination that Taylor \u201cvoluntarily le[ft] work,\u201d the record must contain evidence that is sufficient to allow a reasoning mind to conclude that Taylor intentionally, or by her own choice or will, terminated her employment. The facts are virtually undisputed, and it is clear that the record is devoid of any evidence that Taylor intentionally left her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Taylor did not quit or otherwise undertake to terminate her employment; she was fired. The dismissal letter from Eyler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>states in its first paragraph, \u201cbecause you have more than 6 points assessed against your State drivers [sic] license you will be <em>terminated </em>on 5/28/94 from your position as Park Laborer,\u201d and says in its last paragraph, \u201cyou are <em>dismissed </em>from employment effective May 28,1994.\u201d (Emphasis added). Eyler testified that Taylor had been terminated and had not quit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Taylor also testified that she would still be at her job if she had not been terminated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the only rational conclusion from the evidence in the record is that Taylor was discharged. Furthermore, no reasonable inference can be made from the evidence that Taylor committed the act of drunken driving with the <em>intent </em>of terminating her employment with the County. In fact, the Board appears to concede that point in its brief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Accordingly, because there is no evidence that Taylor intentionally and voluntarily relinquished her work, and all the evidence indicates that she was discharged, we conclude that the Board\u2019s determination that appellee voluntarily left her work, within the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 8-1001(a)(1), is not supported by substantial evidence. Even though Taylor\u2019s act of drinking and driving may have been voluntary, there is nothing in the record to suggest that she did so with the intention of being terminated. Therefore, the circuit court was correct in reversing the decision of the Board, and remanding the ease for the Board to determine whether Taylor is disqualified from receiving benefits for misconduct connected with her work, under L.E. \u00a7 8-1003, or gross misconduct, under L.E. \u00a7 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>1002. <em>See Allen, </em>275 Md. at 87, 838 A.2d 237. We express no opinion on whether her conduct amounts to misconduct or gross misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED.
