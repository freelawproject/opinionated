In September 1994, his parents brought this suit for money damages as an appeal of a final order of the State of Florida Division of Administrative Hearings rendered at the conclusion of an administrative hearing conducted pursuant to Section 1415(c) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1415 (1994). In their amended complaint, Samuel\u2019s parents contend that the School Board of Hillsborough County, Florida, failed to provide Samuel with a \u201cfree appropriate public education,\u201d as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and, in failing to provide such education, denied him rights established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (1994). Samuel\u2019s parents also contend that the School Board infringed two rights guaranteed Samuel by the Fourteenth Amendment: the right to the equal protection of the laws and the right of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court, in the order appearing in the Appendix, entered summary judgment for the School Board. Samuel\u2019s parents appeal, contending the district court should have granted their motion for summary judgment and denied the Board\u2019s motion. After considering their arguments for reversal, we conclude that, in all respects, the district court properly applied the law to the material facts (which the parties agree are not in dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">ATTACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">Before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment (Dkt\u2019s.20, 39). Plaintiffs seek relief under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cIDEA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This action is primarily an appeal of a decision rendered by a state hearing officer. Although the Hearing Officer heard only IDEA issues, Plaintiffs\u2019 other claims are based in large part on the resolution of those issues. This Court, having considered the facts and the arguments of counsel and being otherwise fully advised, hereby affirms the decision of the Hearing Officer, and grants the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-15\">Samuel Weiss is a child diagnosed with autism. He presently resides in Hillsborough County. Pursuant to the IDEA and the companion Florida statutes, the School Board for Hillsborough County (\u201cSchool Board\u201d) must provide Samuel with a free appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d). Integral to the concept of an \u201cappropriate\u201d education is the notion that the services provided must be tailored to serve the individual needs of the child. To insure that each child\u2019s individual educational needs are met, the school and parents work together to develop an individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-16\">If the parents and school cannot agree on the contents of an IEP, either party may request a due process hearing. In Florida, due process hearings are conducted by an administrative hearing officer of the Division of Administrative Hearings (\u201cDOAH\u201d). Fla. Stat. \u00a7 230.23(4)(m)(4). The DOAH decision is a final order which entitles a party adversely affected to bring an action in either a federal district court or a state court of competent jurisdiction. <em>Id.; </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-17\">This Court must conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the hearing officer\u2019s findings. <em>Hendrick Hudson Central School Disk v. Rowley, </em>458 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>U.S. 176, 205, 102 S.Ct. .3034, 3050, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). Furthermore, the Court has discretion to determine the extent of the deference it will give to the administrative findings. <em>Doe v. Alabama State Dept, of Educ., </em>915 F.2d 651, 657 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). Although the district court\u2019s review is in the nature of an appeal, the court is not limited to the administrative record, nor must the court remand if it determines that a remedy was inappropriately denied. The IDEA specifically provides that the court may take additional evidence and may fashion relief that the court deems appropriate. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">During the 1992-1993 school year Samuel Weiss attended school in Fulton County Georgia. In May of 1993, Col. &amp; Mrs. Weiss<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> worked with Georgia school employees to create an IEP to be implemented in 1993-1994 school year. However, during the summer of 1993, the Weisses were transferred to Florida. Having become accustomed to dealing with Samuel\u2019s educational needs, the Weisses investigated schools in Hillsborough County and selected a home within the boundaries of Maniscalco Elementary School. The Weisses chose Maniscalco because it had a program specifically designed to serve autistic children, A Developmental Activities Project Team (\u201cADAPT\u201d). In an effort to make Samuel\u2019s transition as smooth as possible the Weisses sent copies of his Fulton County IEP and other pertinent records to Maniscalco prior to their arrival in Tampa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">On October 6, 1993 the Weisses met with several School Board employees concerning Samuel\u2019s placement at Maniscalco. The School Board contends that the Weisses were informed that this was a temporary placement and interim IEP meeting. At the October 6th meeting the Weisses were pleased with the services provided in the ADAPT program and they agreed to Samuel\u2019s placement there. The recorder for the meeting filled out an IEP form that she marked \u201cinterim.\u201d Although the October IEP was not nearly as comprehensive as the Georgia IEP, it sketched out some current levels, some goals and objectives, a list of persons responsible for Samuel\u2019s education, evaluation procedures and a schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">The Weisses inquired as to whether the Georgia IEP would be followed, and someone at the meeting stated that the Georgia IEP would serve as a guide pending development of a permanent IEP. The Hearing Officer specifically found that the Weisses were not told that the School Board was adopting the Georgia IEP, <em>per se, </em>as its own. Rather, the School Board informed the Weisses that it needed to conduct additional evaluations before deciding on a permanent IEP within six months. At the conclusion of the meeting Col. Weiss signed a three page document entitled \u201cInterim IEP.\u201d The Weisses also agreed to allow the School Board to perform the necessary tests to re-evaluate Samuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">Despite the Weisses desire that the Georgia IEP be implemented for Samuel, the School Board did not consider itself governed by that document. Instead, the School Board operated under the interim IEP for six months. During that time, the Weisses were actively involved in Samuels education and frequently expressed concerns and requested changes in the services he was receiving. It appears that many if not all of their requests were granted; Samuel received a one-to-one aide, a longer period of time for occupational therapy, removal from participation in certain class activities, and the use of a Canon Communicator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">Between December 1993 and February 1994 the School Board conducted several evaluations of Samuel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Hearing Officer found that those evaluations were sufficient for use in determining Samuel\u2019s eligibility for permanent placement and the revision and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>review of his Interim IEP. March 24, 1994 the School Board contacted Mrs. Weiss in order to schedule an eligibility staffing/IEP meeting for Samuel because the interim IEP was due to expire on April 6, 1994. Mrs. Weiss objected to the creation of an IEP at that time and requested the independent evaluation to which she was entitled pursuant to the IDEA. The School Board then asked Mrs. Weiss to attend a case review meeting. Mrs. Weiss requested a written notice concerning the type of meeting to be held in April. The School Board sent her a notice of \u201ccase review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The case review meeting was held on April 6, 1994, exactly six months after the date of the interim IEP. School board personnel answered Mrs. Weiss\u2019 questions and determined that they had all evaluations necessary to determine Samuel\u2019s eligibility for School Board programs. The School Board then moved the ease review meeting to an eligibility staffing, in which the School Board determined that Samuel met the criteria for the autistic program, and that he should receive speech and occupational therapy services. School Board personnel also recommended that Samuel\u2019s IEP be reviewed. However, Mrs. Weiss refused to allow the School Board to proceed with an IEP review until independent evaluations were completed. Immediately following the meeting the School Board ordered independent evaluations for Samuel. The Weisses removed Samuel from Maniscalco on April 7, 1994 and began schooling him in their home. In the summer of 1994, after the conclusion of the independent evaluations, the School Board developed a permanent IEP for Samuel. In the meanwhile, the Weiss\u2019 challenged the school\u2019s use of the temporary IEP before an administrative Hearing Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">The Hearing Officer found that Samuel progressed both academically and behaviorally while he was in the ADAPT program at Maniscalco. The final order of the Hearing Officer details Samuel\u2019s progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">III. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">The issues presented to the Administrative Hearing Officer were: (1) whether the interim IEP was proper; (2) whether the School Board performed proper evaluations for a permanent IEP and placement by April 6, 1994; (3) whether the School Board provided Samuel Weiss a FAPE; and (4) if the School Board violated any applicable law, whether the school board should be required to provide compensatory educational services. The Hearing Officer conducted five days of hearings and permitted supplemental pleadings after the conclusion of the hearing. Although the Hearing Officer found defects in the School Board\u2019s notifications and in the interim IEP,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Hearing Officer found for the School Board on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">The primary issue before this Court is whether under the IDEA, the School Board provided Samuel Weiss with a PAPE during the 1994-1995 school year. Plaintiffs argue that the temporary IEP prepared by the School Board denied Samuel a FAPE, and that the school board should have implemented the Georgia IEP, or in the alternative, created a suitable IEP for Samuel before the end of the six month period permitted by Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">The Weisses also claim that the school discriminated against Samuel in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>the Rehabilitation Act. Further, the Weisses argue that Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 violates the fundamental right to travel secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, the Weisses assert that their federally protected rights are enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">IV. STANDARD ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Summary judgment may not be granted unless the pleadings depositions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P.56. The moving party satisfies its burden by showing an absence of evidence to support an essential element or the nonmoving party\u2019s case. <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 317, 106 S.Ct. at 2549. Once the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine material fact, whether or not accompanied by affidavits or other proof, the nonmoving party must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the \u2018depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\u2019 designate \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)); <em>Hoffman v. Allied Corp., </em>912 F.2d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-16\">V. FREE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-17\">To determine whether Samuel Weiss received a FAPE this Court must determine: (1) whether the State has complied with the procedures set forth in the IDEA; and (2) whether the IEP developed through the Act\u2019s procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206-207, 102 S.Ct. at 3050-51; <em>Doe, </em>915 F.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-18\">A. Procedures under the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-19\">The procedural prong of the FAPE analysis assesses whether the state has complied with the procedures set forth in the IDEA, including the creation of an IEP that conforms to the requirements of the Act. <em>Doe, </em>915 F.2d at 658. In evaluating whether a procedural defect has deprived a student of a FAPE, the Court must consider the impact of the procedural defect, and not merely the defect <em>per se. See Doe, </em>915 F.2d at 661-662. The Weisses list twenty-seven acts of the' School Board which the Weisses claim denied Samuel a FAPE.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority of the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>listed by Plaintiffs stem either from the School Board\u2019s failure to implement the Georgia IEP, or the alleged inadequacy of the interim IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">1. Florida Administrative Code Rule 6A-6.0334</p>\n<p id=\"Av_\">The Weisses challenge the validity of Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334, contending that a receiving school which chooses not to accept a current out-of-state IEP cannot wait as long as six months to formulate a permanent IEP. The Weisses claim that the School Board should have implemented a revised Georgia IEP if it deemed the Georgia IEP insufficient, or created its own permanent IEP. Although Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334, promulgated by the State Board of Education, allows up to six months for the development of a permanent IEP for transfer students, the Weisses claim that Florida\u2019s regulation is valid \u201conly to the extent that [it] do[es] not limit the rights of children with disabilities to a free appropriate public education ...\u201d (Plaintiffs Mot. at 35 n. 11). Thus the Court must evaluate whether Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 limits Samuel Weiss\u2019 ability to receive a FAPE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-18\">The IDEA defines \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d as special education and services that: (A) have been provided at public ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>pense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge, (B) <em>meet the standards of the state education agency, </em>(C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education in the state involved, and (D) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section 1415(a)(5) of th[e Act]. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(18) (emphasis added). As discussed <em>infra, </em>the interim IEP used by the School Board during the six month period provided by Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 conformed to textual definition of FAPE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Further, Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 does not appear to be inconsistent with the goals or purposes of the IDEA. The central purpose of the IDEA is to provide exceptional children with access to public education. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 194 n. 18, 102S.Ct. at 3045 n. 18. The Weisses transferred Samuel to Maniscalco in October, and a permanent IEP could not have been implemented without proper evaluation, which the School Board began in December and continued through March of the following year. The six month window created under Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 is not inconsistent with the IDEA\u2019S goal to provide Samuel with a FAPE. Absent clear direction from Congress, the Court will not invalidate a state rule because it differs from a particular party\u2019s interpretation of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">2. Florida Interim IEP</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">The Weisses claim that the interim IEP provided for Samuel during the six month period was deficient and denied him a FAPE. The IDEA sets out specific standards for an IEP which the Court must consider. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(20); <em>J.S.K. v. Hendry County School Bd., </em>941 F.2d 1563 (11th Cir. 1991). The Hearing Officer found that the interim IEP was legally sufficient under Florida law and the IDEA, although it lacked specificity and failed to explain the effect of the Georgia IEP. The Court upholds the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings regarding the legal sufficiency of the interim IEP. The IEP contained a statement of Samuel\u2019s current educational performance, a statement of annual goals, a statement of the specific education and related services to be provided, a statement of how much Samueji would participate in regular education programs, and the dates for and initiation of services. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(20). The interim IEP was neither as long nor as detailed as the Georgia IEP, but the Court finds it was satisfactory under the IDEA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-11\">3. Notice to the Weisses</p>\n<p id=\"APr\">Among the twenty-seven alleged violations by the School Board, the Weisses list several procedural defects in the notice provided to the Weisses. The Weisses claim that the School Board failed to ensure that the Weiss-es understood the ramifications of the October 6, 1993 meeting, failed to provide appropriate notice to the Weisses of procedural safeguards available, failed to provide the Weisses with all of Samuel\u2019s school records, failed to notify the Weisses when evaluations were scheduled, and unilaterally formulated the objectives of the ADAPT Curriculum Plan without the equal participation of the Weisses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">For the Weisses to prove that Samuel was denied a FAPE, they must show harm to Samuel as a result of the alleged procedural violations. Violation of any of the procedures of the IDEA is not a <em>per se </em>violation of the Act. The Weisses cite language from <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 205-06, 102 S.Ct. at 3050-51. However, in <em>Doe, </em>the Eleventh Circuit qualified the Supreme Court\u2019s language, noting that the Court was concerned with the purpose behind procedural notice requirements\u2014full and effective participation in the IEP process. <em>Doe, </em>915 F.2d at 662. Because the purpose of the procedural requirements was not thwarted, the Court found no violation of the IDEA based on the procedural defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>Here, Plaintiffs seek to advance a <em>per se </em>violation argument, claiming that the School Board\u2019s failure to provide specific notice to the Weisses of various aspects of Samuel\u2019s education are <em>per se </em>denials of a FAPE to Samuel. However, the facts do not show that any of these procedural defects resulted in harm to Samuel, or restricted the Weiss\u2019 ability to participate fully in Samuel\u2019s education.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">The Weisses\u2019 first contention is belied by the undisputed facts. The Florida IEP which Col. Weiss signed stated clearly \u201cInterim IEP,\u201d and several changes requested by the Weisses reflected items already a part of the Georgia IEP, such as the use of a one-to-one aid and increased time in occupational therapy. As to the other alleged violations, the facts do not show that the Weisses were precluded from participating or making informed decisions regarding the education Samuel received. Although the IDEA envisions full parental participation in the development of the IEP, the Act does not mandate such participation in every aspect of the educational process. <em>Cf. Doe, </em>915 F.2d at 662. Nevertheless, the facts show that the Weisses participated extensively in Samuel\u2019s education, initiating the use of a Canon Communicator for Samuel, increasing his weekly time in occupational therapy from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, and obtaining a one-to-one aid. At various points during the school year the Weisses requested that Samuel be removed from the Positive Action activity, that he no longer be made to write, and that he receive a fourth-grade curriculum. In sum, the Weisses have not shown a denial of participation resulting from the procedural violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">4. Excluded Report<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1H\">The Weisses also claim that the Hearing Officer refused to admit the result of the independent evaluation but proceeded to use the evaluation in ordering his decision. The Weisses claim that the Hearing Officer\u2019s actions denied them the benefit of the independent evaluation provided under the IDEA. The Hearing Officer denied the evaluation based on the School Board\u2019s hearsay objection. The preparer of the report was not available to testify, and thus the Hearing Officer sustained the objection. Neither party had access to the report for the purposes of the administrative hearing, and there is no showing that the Weisses were barred based on the fact that the report was excluded. Further, the Weisses have not provided any specific proof that the Hearing Officer referred to the report in his findings. The Court finds that the exclusion of the report did not constitute a violation of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">B. Adequate Educational Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"AYP\">Under the substantive prong of <em>Rowley </em>the Court must determine whether Samuel received adequate educational benefits during his year at Manisealco. <em>J.S.K. v. Hendry County School Board, </em>941 F.2d 1563, 1572-73 (11th Cir.1991) (interpreting <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690). Adequate educational benefits refer to a \u201cbasic floor of opportunity\u201d which might not have existed without the IDEA. <em>Id. </em>The Hearing Officer\u2019s findings include a thorough review of Samuel\u2019s educational experience while at Manisealco, and conclude that Samuel progressed both academically and behaviorally during the school year. The final order sets forth a lengthy recitation of Samuel\u2019s progress. (Final Order \u00b6 37, 38). In their motion for summary judgment, the Weisses disagree with the Hearing Officer\u2019s interpretation of certain facts and offer others in support of their position that Samuel did not receive adequate educational benefits. Upon review of the objections to the final order, it appears that the Weisses do not refute the Hearing Officer\u2019s recitation of the academic benefits Samuel received. Rather, the Weisses spend a great deal of their memorandum discussing the faults of the educational services that Samuel received and explaining how Samuel would have made greater progress had the Georgia IEP been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>implemented. The Weisses also contend that Samuel\u2019s behavior regressed during the school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">The Court is certain that both the Weisses and the School Board desire to provide Samuel with an education which will maximize his potential. However, the School Board is not required to maximize his potential. <em>Doe v. Alabama State Dept. Of Educ., </em>915 F.2d 651, 665 (11th Cir.1990). Nor is the School Board required to provide an education according to the dictates of Col. and Mrs. Weiss, notwithstanding their unequivocal right to participate in making educational decisions. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not adequately refuted the Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusion that Samuel made measurable and adequate gains in the classroom as required under <em>J.S.K., </em>941 F.2d 1563.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Thus, the Weisses have failed to show a violation of the IDEA under either prong of the <em>Rowley </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">VI. SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">The Weisses claim that the School Board discriminated against Samuel in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. The Weisses contend that the State rules which provide for temporary placement under an interim IEP as well as the School Board\u2019s decision not to implement the Georgia IEP constitute \u201cbureaucratic obstacles to Samuel\u2019s ability to obtain appropriate educational opportunity,\u201d based solely on Samuel\u2019s disability. (Plaintiffs Mot. at 69). The Weisses compare the School Board\u2019s treatment of Samuel to that of his older brother who is not handicapped, noting that Samuel\u2019s brother only had to show his report card to be appropriately placed. As proof of the discriminatory motives of the School Board, the Weisses highlight the fact that Samuel did not eat lunch in the cafeteria where non-handicapped students spent their lunches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">The Court finds that the Weiss\u2019 Rehabilitation Act claim is essentially the same as their IDEA claim, and fails for the same reasons that the IDEA claim fails. <em>See Doe, </em>915 F.2d at 666. As to the school\u2019s differential treatment of Samuel and his brother, the Court finds no discrimination against Samuel because be is disabled. The IDEA requires a school district to conduct evaluations and develop an IEP before the school district may permanently place an exceptional student. Non-handicapped students are not subject to the IDEA; they do not normally undergo evaluations, nor do they receive IEPs. Any comparison between the School Board\u2019s treatment of Samuel and his older brother is inapposite. The \u201cbureaucratic barriers\u201d of which the Weisses complain constitute part of the very framework under which they expect a special education for Samuel, and through which they seek redress in these proceedings. If Samuel were treated as a non-handicapped student and simply placed into a class on the basis of a report card, that would constitute a violation of the IDEA. The Court likewise refuses to find discrimination because the school kept Samuel\u2019s class in the classroom during lunchtime for the first semester of the school year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-13\">VII. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">The Weisses contend that the Florida regulatory scheme burdens their fundamental right to travel interstate in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Weisses argue that Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 which allows a School District six months to create a permanent IEP for a student transferring from another state treats students with disabilities transferring from out of state less favorably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>than student transferring from another school district within the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">In <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), the Supreme Court invalidated a state statute which denied welfare assistance to state residents who had not resided within the jurisdiction for at least one year. The Court subjected the law to strict scrutiny and found that the justifications offered by the government did not constitute compelling state interests. <em>Id. </em>The Court discussed the right to travel in the context of public education in <em>Martinez v. Bynum, </em>461 U.S. 321, 103 S.Ct. 1838, 75 L.Ed.2d 879 (1983). In <em>Martinez, </em>the Court distinguished durational residency requirements such as the one invalidated in <em>Shapiro, </em>from bona-fide residence requirements, which discriminate in favor of residents over non-residents. <em>Martinez, </em>461 U.S. at 326, 103 S.Ct. at 1841. The Court stated that bona-fide residence requirements are permissible in the field of education. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 is neither a durational residence nor a bona-fide residence requirement. The Rule does not attempt to distinguish between true residents and out-of-state residents seeking the benefits of a Florida education. Nor does the rule require that Florida residents remain in the jurisdiction for a period of time before receiving educational benefits. The Rule can be loosely analogized to a durational residence requirement because it provides School Boards a longer period of time in which to prepare a permanent IEP for residents transferring from other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Nevertheless, Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 does not burden the right to travel. The fact that a School Board may have up to six months to formulate a permanent IEP does not prevent or inhibit residents of another state from traveling to Florida. The Rule does not require, for example, that exceptional students wait six months before receiving special education. Under Fla. Admin. Code R. 6A-6.0334 School Boards have up to six months to conduct evaluations and formulate a permanent IEP. An exceptional student operating under a temporary IEP is still entitled to receive the educational benefits guaranteed under the IDEA. The School Board explains that the Rule\u2019s six month period provides a school district time in which to gather evaluative information on the out-of-state student and ascertain the student\u2019s eligibility for Florida programs. (Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16)1 The Court finds that Florida\u2019s rule is a rational means to carry out the requirements of the IDEA. The Court finds no violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">VIII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">Because the Weisses have not shown a violation of the IDEA, Section 504, or the Equal Protection Clause, the Weiss\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">IX.

Even assuming that the IEP was deficient, the Weisses have not shown, that any procedural defect in the formulation or content of the interim IEP denied Samuel a FAPE. Samuel was placed in ADAPT, a program which the Weisses specifically requested for Samuel before transferring him to Maniscalco. The Hearing Officer found that Samuel made academic and behavioral progress while in the ADAPT program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">. Plaintiffs claim that the Hearing Officer\u2019s failure to admit the report supports its argument that the \"Final Order should be accorded no deference by this Court.\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Mot. at 30). The Court interprets this argument to allege a violation of the procedures required under the IDEA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">. The School Board states that Samuel's class was kept from the cafeteria so that the students could better adjust to the new learning environment. The Weisses compare this reasoning with the justifications advanced by the schools in <em>Brown v. Board of Education. </em>The Court finds no correlation between the separation during lunch period of the ADAPT students and the racial segregation addressed in <em>Brown, </em>and refuses to substitute its own notion of sound educational policy for that of the educators in this case. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206, 102 S.Ct. at 3050-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">.
