Justice Felts</author>\n<p id=\"Anc\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This is a petition for the writs of certiorari and super-sedeas to review an <em>interlocutory </em>order of the Court of Appeals, entered by Presiding Judge Hickerson, of the Middle Section, vacating an interlocutory order of the Chancery Court of Davidson County which struck out certain parts of respondents\u2019 answer to petitioner\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Since this was a \u201ccivil case\u201d in which the pleadings presented \u201cissues of fact to be determined upon proof\u201d to be heard by the Chancery Court, appellate jurisdiction of it is in the Court of Appeals, not this Court. T.C.A. sec. 16-408; <em>State of Georgia v. City of Chattanooga, </em>153 Tenn. 349, 284 S.W. 359; <em>Cox v. Smith, </em>154 Tenn. 369, 289 S.W. 524; <em>Goins v. Yowell, </em>199 Tenn. 167, 285 S.W.2d 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">This Court has jurisdiction to grant the writs of cer-tiorari and supersedeas to review only final decrees and judgments of the Court of Appeals. The statute (sec. 14, chap. 100, Acts 1925, now T.C.A. sec. 27-819), creating the Court of Appeals, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\u201cThe Supreme Court, or any Judge thereof, shall have the right to require, by certiorari, the removal to that court for review of any case that has been <em>finally determined </em>in the Court of Appeals, upon a sworn petition for this purpose filed in the Supreme Court * * * ; and there shall be no other method of review\u201d (italics ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Thus, by the statute, this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the action of the Court of Appeals is limited to <em>final </em>judgments and decrees \u2014 cases that have been <em>\u201cfinally determined\u201d </em>\u2014 in that Court; and this Court has no jurisdiction to review <em>interlocutory </em>orders of that Court. <em>First Nat. Bank of Greenwood, Miss. v. Planters\u2019 Nat. Bank of Clarksdale, Miss., </em>158 Tenn. 50, 12 S.W.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In that case, Chief Justice Green distinguished <em>Cockrill v. People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>155 Tenn. 342, 293 S.W. 996, on the ground that \u201cimmediate appellate jurisdiction\u201d of it was in this Court, and not the Court of Appeals; and, therefore, this Court properly granted the writs of certiorari and supersedeas \u201cissued directly to the Chancery Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Likewise, <em>City of Nashville v. Dad\u2019s Auto Accessories, </em>154 Tenn. 194, 285 S.W. 52, was a case within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court and the writs of certiorari and supersedeas granted by this Court were issued directly to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">For these reasons the petition for the writs of cer-tiorari and supersedeas must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
