Chief Justice Peewitt</author>\n<p id=\"APO\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The defendant below, J. E. Hooper, was tried and convicted for practicing dentistry without a license and a fine of $150 imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">There is only one question made by the assignment of error and that is Section 63-537, T.C.A., violates Article I, section 8, Constitution of Tennessee, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The evidence in this case shows beyond a doubt that the defendant was engaged in the practice of dentistry and that he was not licensed to practice this profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">As to the legal question raised this Court has already held in <em>Prosterman v. Tennessee State Board of Dental </em>Examiners, 168 Tenn. 16, 73 S.W.2d 687, that a statute regulating the practice of dentistry (Section 63-506, T.C.A.) does not violate Article I, Section 8, Constitution of Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">The Section in question does nothing more than define the practice of dentistry. It does not appear to be unreasonable but sets forth a reasonable definition of the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In <em>O\u2019Neil v. State, </em>115 Tenn. 427, 90 S.W. 627, 3 L.R.A., N.S., 762, we Reid that a statute prohibiting' the practice of medicine without a license is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In other States a similar statute has been upheld. <em>Shewmaker v. State, </em>Okl.Cr., 329 P.2d 858; <em>Commonwealth v. Finnigan, </em>326 Mass. 378, 96 N.E.2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">It results that the assignment of error is overruled and that the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
