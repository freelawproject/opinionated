Jacobs, President of the Hiwassee Rail Road Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-4\">\u201cWitnesseth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-5\">\u2018 \u2018 That the said Lewis Ross for and in consideration of the sum of One Dollar to the said Lewis Ross in hand paid by the said Solomon D. Jacobs, President as aforesaid for and on behalf of the said Hiwassee Rail Road Company, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, hath bargained and sold and by these presents doth convey and confirm to the said Solomon D. Jacobs, President as aforesaid, and his successors in office, forever, for the use and benefit of the stockholders in the said Hiwassee Rail Road Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-6\">\u201cThe right-of-way for a railroad 200 feet in width, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the construction of said railroad, through the land or farm owned by the said Lewis Ross, on the north side of Hiwassee River, known as Walker Reservation, the said right-of-way to be on the west side of the Town of Calhoun, where the said railroad is now located, and extending the whole length of said farm to within (60) sixty feet of the top of the bank of said river, as well as all of said 200 feet which may not be necessary for the construction of said Hiwassee Railroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-7\">\u201cTo Have and to Hold to the said Solomon D.

Prom henceforth and forever, hereby warranting and defending the title to said right of way to the said S. D. Jacobs, President, for the use and benefit of said company to the said premises above described against the lawful title, claim and demand of all and every person or persons. In Witness Whereof, the said Lewis Boss has hereunto subscribed his name and affixed his seal the date above written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-5\">\u201cLewis Boss (Seal)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-6\">\u201cSigned, sealed and acknowledged in presence of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-7\">\u201cWilliam Brittain</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-8\">\u201cHal C. Kennox\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">We are of the opinion that the instrument above conveys an easement only and does not purport to convey the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">It is quite evident that the grantor undertook to convey a right of way or so much of the footage that was necessary for railroad purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">The plaintiff below relies upon <em>Southern Railway Co. v. Forrest, </em>13 Tenn.App. 547; <em>Burnett v. Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad Co., </em>36 Tenn. 528, and <em>Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad v. Bell, </em>162 Tenn. 661, 39 S.W.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-12\">In those cases the conveyances were made to the Bail-way Company for the land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>In 17 Am.Jnr. 923, Section 2, an easement is defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-3\">\u201cAn easement bias been asserted to be a right \u25a0which one person has to nse the land of another for a specific purpose or a servitude imposed as a burden upon land. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">In 44 Amer.Jur. page 316, Section 102 it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-5\">\u201c102. \u2014 Of or Eeciting \u2018Right of Way\u2019. \u2014 There are a number of decisions involving the construction of a deed to a railroad company purporting to grant a strip, piece, or parcel of land in which the result was reached that because the deed contained additional language referring in some way to a \u2018right of way,\u2019 it operated to convey a mere easement rather than a title in fee. The mention in such a conveyance of rights, members, and appurtenances belonging and appertaining to the strip of land conveyed, or the use of the words, \u2018forever, in fee simple\u2019, has been held not to enlarge such an easement into a fee. A railroad to which is conveyed a \u2018right of way\u2019 for \u2018all the uses and purposes of said railroad company so long as the same shall be used for the construction, use and occupation of said railroad company\u2019 acquires an easement only. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-6\">\u201c* * * In other words, the phrase \u2018for railroad right of way\u2019 in the granting clause of a deed of land to a railroad camiot be rejected as mere surplusage. The use of the words \u2018successors and assigns\u2019 in the granting clause of such a deed to a corporation does not amount to an express grant of a fee. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The Charter of Incorporation of Hiwassee Eailroad Company provided that the Hiwassee Eailroad Company was granted the power to acquire by purchase or Emi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>nent Domain a right of way two hnndred feet in width for the construction and operation of a railroad, or any less breadth that the directors might accept as being necessary for such rig\u2019ht of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">In <em>McLemore v. Charleston &amp; Memphis Railroad Co., </em>111 Tenn. 639, 69 S.W. 338, 342, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-6\"><em>\u201c* * </em># \u2018A grant of a rig'ht of way to a railroad company is the grant of an easement merely, and the fee remains in the grantor.\u2019 * * * The nature of an easement, for railroad right of way purposes, is so clearly stated in <em>Railway Co. v. Telford\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>89 Tenn. 293, 14 S.W. 776, that we cannot hope to add anything to what has there been said.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">See also <em>Southern Railway Company v. Vann, </em>142 Tenn. 76, 216 S.W. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">In the case at Bar no attempt was made in the granting clause to convey the land hut only conveyed the right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">In the cases relied upon by the plaintiff below the deed was made to the land and not to the right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">This being our view of the case we find no error in the judgment of the lower court dismissing the suit and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
