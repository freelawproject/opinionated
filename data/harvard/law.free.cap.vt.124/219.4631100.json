He contends he is entitled to be admitted to bail pending final disposition of his appeal from these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Since it appears that the petitioner is \u201cin execution\u201d within the meaning of Section 32, Chapter II of the Vermont Constitution, the offense for which he is confined is not bailable, as a matter of right, at this stage of the proceedings. <em>In re Comolli, </em>78 Vt. 337, 343, 63 Atl. 184. This disposition is also in accord with the unreported case <em>In re Rickert, </em>No. 1984, filed June 4, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>It is ordered that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus be dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
