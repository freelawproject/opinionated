The object of the amendment to the forty-sixth section was to provide for a replication introduced under the act; and the object of the amendment .to section sixty-five was to provide for the effect of matters in the -replication; but it was not designed to work a change in the character of the answers, or to abolish the distinction as between those verified and those not verified. The omission of the words \u201c when it is verified,\u201d in the amendment to section sixty-five, is a mere clerical misprision, readily corrected by reference to the whole body of the original act and .amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
