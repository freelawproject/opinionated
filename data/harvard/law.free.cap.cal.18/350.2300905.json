Subsequently, N., execution creditor of H. and P., causes the Sheriff to levy on the property. Plaintiff files his bill to restrain the sale as casting cloud on his title. Court below found plaintiff\u2019s deed to be in effect a mortgage: <em>Held, </em>that the bill must be dismissed; that the purchaser at the Sheriff\u2019s sale would only acquire the interest of the judgment debtors, H. and P.; that plaintiff\u2019s rights as mortgagee would be unaffected by the sale, and hence there is no necessity for equity .to interfere in his behalf.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b350-6\">Appeal from the Fourteenth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">Bill in equity to restrain Irwin, Sheriff, from selling real property on execution in favor of defendant Nesbit and against H.
