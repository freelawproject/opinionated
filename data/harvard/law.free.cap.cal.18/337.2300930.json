The Court charged the jury if they believed from the evidence that defendant took and carried away and converted the horse and saddle to his own use, with intent to steal the same, they should find him guilty as charged; and refused to charge, as requested by defendant, that \u201c to find defendant guilty, the jury must be convinced that the defendant did steal the horse and saddle named in the indictment, and there must have be\u00e9n a felonious taking and carrying \"away thereof.\u201d The District Attorney read t\u00f3 the jury and relied upon, the seventy-first section of the act concerning Crimes and Punishments, (Wood\u2019s Dig. 339) relative to a bailee of goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">Verdict, guilty.

J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Judgment reversed. The indictment is only good as an indictment for ordinary larceny, but not good as an indictment.for the statutory offense of converting property of which the defendant was bailee. The offense of larceny, apart from the crime constituted by statute from the conversion of a bailed article, is not complete, unless the original taking be felonious. In other words, in this case, the prisoner, at the time of hiring the horse, must have intended t\u00f3 steal it, the felonious intent at the time of the taking being of the essence of the crime. The Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury in accordance with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
