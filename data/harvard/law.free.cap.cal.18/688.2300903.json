On the return of the cause the association rescinded their former resolutions requiring the oath mentioned, sent plaintiffs notices thereof, and invited them to return and take their seats in the association in the full enjoyment of their rights and privileges; and these facts were set up in the answer filed to the complaint. The Court below held that this action on the part of the defendants defeated the bill for dissolution and account, and accordingly dismissed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b688-8\">Plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b688-10\"><em>Stanly &amp; </em>Hayes, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b688-11\"><em>Merrill, Clement &amp; White, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b688-12\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AGl\">Field, C.

This course seems to have been pursued, and we think the decree of dismissal was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
