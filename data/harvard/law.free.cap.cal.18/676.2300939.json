This suit was brought, in the language of counsel for plaintiff, <em>\u201c </em>in obedience to an intimation thrown out at the end of the opinion in that case.\u201d The plaintiff, a judgment creditor of Joaquin De la Guerra, files this bill to restrain the defendants, executors of the last will of Jos\u00e9 De la Guerra, deceased, from paying to said Joaquin a bequest alleged by plaintiff to have been made by the testator in favor of said Joaquin, asking that they be directed to sell the cattle referred to, and out of the proceeds to pay plaintiff\u2019s claim against Joaquin. The bill offers to give bond of indemnity against the claims of other creditors of the estate of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-7\">The complaint in this case, besides making the averments made in the former case, annexes a copy and translation of the will of Jos\u00e9, a copy of the proceedings before the referee appointed to take the answers of the executors touching their instructions, etc., and other matters not necessary to be stated. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-8\">The will gives to Joaquin De la Guerra, one of the sons of the deceased, a piece of land in Spain, on condition that he shall, within fifteen years, settle there. This bequest, the complaint avers to be of trifling value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-9\">The clauses of the will containing the disputed bequest to Joaquin are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-10\">\u201c Paragraph 3d. Before any distribution be made, there shall be parted out from the neat stock which at my decease may be found, fourteen hundred (1,400) head of large cattle, which shall be sold by my executors, and their product shall be invested by them according to the instructions which I have given to them, of the fulfillment whereof they, shall have to give account to God alone.\u201d \u201c Paragraph 5th. I declare that, besides what has been already expressed, I made a secret bequest to my said son Joaquin, which my executors shall give him to understand, according to my instructions, when they may deem it convenient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Defendants demurred to the complaint, on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction, and that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-5\">Demurrer sustained on the second ground assigned,\" the Court holding that the will did not impose upon the executors any legal obligation to give Joaquin anything, and that, as he has no claim upon them, neither have his creditors. Plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-6\"><em>Eugene Lies, </em>for Appellant, cited 4 Kent, 340; 2 Leading Cases in Equity, Part 2, 334-355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-7\"><em>H. W. Halleck, </em>for Respondents, argued that the decision in 14 Cal. 108, covered the present case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b678-8\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AVl\">Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">We see nothing in the amended bill to withdraw this case from the principles of our former opinion, reported in 14 Cal. The alleged trust for Joaquin seems to be nothing more than an oral direction to apply the proceeds of certain cattle, if the executors think it best, to his benefit\u2014they having full discretion as to the fact and the time of such application. We do not see how the creditors of Joaquin can enforce this claim, which seems to be a mere matter of conscience, and not of legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
