The female defendants, Merced and Francisca, inherited this tenth interest on the first of January, 1856, from their mother, Guadalupe Moraga, to whom it came from their grandfather, Joaquin Moraga, who, in connection with Juan Bernal, was the grantee of the Mexican Government. At the time the interest in the ranch descended to Mercedes and Francisca, it was incumbered by a mortgage given \"by the grandfather, Joaquin, and others, to Hugh O\u2019Donnell, on the twenty-fifth of May, 1855. The proportion of this incumbrance which would-fall to Mercedes and Francisca was six hundred dollars, and they procured of Yilar an advance of this money, and to secure it, jointly with their husbands executed to him the mortgage upon which suit is brought\u2014being at the time under eighteen years of age. There seems to have been no note given. Plaintiff is assignee of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-8\">On the twehty-second of May, 1856, Angel Soto and his wife, Francisca\u2014she being under eighteen years\u2014executed to one Ga\u00f1ido a mortgage upon an interest in said ranch, amounting to two hundred acres, to secure their note to him for two hundred dollars, with interest. May 6th, 1856, defendants Henrique Welsh and Mercedes, his wife, she being under eighteen years of age, executed and delivered to Brown and Hendricks their mortgage upon an undivided one hundred and fifty acres of said ranch. At the date of both these mortgages the land was the separate property of the wives; and one Reed, made defendant, is the holder thereof. The wive\u00a7t when they became of age, disaffirmed and refused to be bound by the mortgages\u2014at least, such is the language of the decree, though there is no other proof of the fact in the record. The answers set up the plea of infancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The Court below held that the wives were not bound by any of the notes or mortgages, and accordingly entered a decree giving-personal judgment in favor, of plaintiffs, and against defendants Henrique Welsh and Angel Soto, for six hundred dollars, with interest, as due on the first mortgage; also a personal judgment in favor of Reed, and against the same defendants, for the amounts respectively due on the other two notes and mortgages. The decree also released and discharged the wives from all of the notes and mortgages, and declared them void, and ordered plaintiff and Reed to. deliver up their mortgages for cancellation. Plaintiff and defendant Reed appeal from so much of the decree a&amp;\u25a0 rejects the mortgages.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-5\"><em>E. A. Lawrence, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">I. The deed of an infant is voidable, and not void. <em>(Zouch </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>3 Burr. 1794; S. C. 1 Wm. Blackstone, 575; 14 Mass. 462; 7 Cow. 180 ; 9 Id. 626; <em>Bool and Wife </em>v. <em>Mix, </em>17 Wend. 120 ; 15 Mass. 220 ; 1 Greenl. 11; 2 Paige, 191; 1 N. H. 73 ; 7 Blackford, 442.) The mortgage purports, on its face, to be a benefit to the infants, viz: to secure money advanced to them to pay off their proportion of the O\u2019Donnell mortgage, which was a lien on their estate when inherited, <em>(Tucker et als. </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>10 Peters, 71; 2 Kent, 31.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-7\">II. Defendants were guilty of fraud in concealing the fact of their infancy, and executing the mortgage. <em>(Covey v. Getehen, </em>2 Mad. 40; Chitty on Cont. 153; <em>Kilgon v. Jordan, </em>17 Texas, 341.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-8\">III. Having done no act to disaffirm the mortgage after obtaining majority, and having permitted the mortgage since such majority to pass into the hands of innocent third parties, they should now be estopped from denying its validity. (8 Taunt. 35, 508 ; 3 Kent, 295.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-9\">IV. The deed of an infant if voidable must be disaffirmed by an act of equal solemnity. (2 Kent\u2019s Com. 237 ; 10 Pet. 71, 73 ; 1 N. H. 73 ; 14 Johns. 174.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-10\">V. An infant cannot avoid his deed without restoring the consideration received. The money secured by the mortgage was to pay off the O\u2019Donnell mortgage, which was a lien at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>defendants inherited the property. <em>(Stewart </em>v. Baker, 15 Mass. 359 ; 2 Paige, 191; 17 Texas, 417 ; 1 Edwards, 303 ; 7 Johns. 84, 87 ; <em>Roof </em>v. Stafford, 7 Cow. 182.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">VI. The Vilar mortgage is a mortgage for necessaries furnished to defendants\u2019 wives, to wit: to pay off the O\u2019Donnell mortgage, and thereby release their separate estates. It was not to secure the debt of their husbands. This debt is a charge upon their separate estates, by Spanish law. <em>(Portis </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>22 Texas, 699 ; 1 Denio, 460 ; 7 N. H. 368 ; 2 Hill, 400.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">VII. Marriage is-a \u201c civil contract,\u201d (Wood\u2019s Dig. art. 2595) a partnership in which the wife is a.silent partner. Deed of husband and wife conveys wife\u2019s property in same manner as if she were unmarried. (Wood\u2019s Dig. 100, sec. 2.) The husband shall have the management and control of the separate property of the wife during the continuance of the marriage, (Wood\u2019s Dig. 488, sec. 2609) except that a sale.of her separate property must be acknowledged by her separate and apart, and in form prescribed by statute. (Art. 2620, Wood\u2019s Dig.\u2014a minor; <em>Ingoldsby </em>v. <em>Juan, </em>12 Cal. 564.) Again: \u201c The marriage of any person who is under guardianship as a minor shall terminate such guardianship.\u201d (Art. 2379, 431.) The guardian shall have the care of the estate of the minor until \u201c such minor shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years, or marry.\u201d (Art. 2369, Wood\u2019s Dig. 428.) By the Mexican law, the disability of infancy was removed upon marriage; and the law of April 2d, 1858, (Wood\u2019s Dig. 1024, art. 253) is only declaratory of that law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-7\"><em>M. S. Chase, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">Infancy, a good defense everywhere at common law, has always been recognized in this State. <em>(Burrell </em>v. <em>Bennett, 2 </em>Cal. 101; Act of May, 1854.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-9\">The Act of April 2d, 1858, provides that married women, when under the age of eighteen years, and married with the consent of their parent or guardian, \u201c shall be deemed of full and lawful age.\u201d This act is inapplicable (because not retroactive) to the case at bar, yet, like the Act of 1854, fixing legal age, it can only be regarded as recognizing these common law disabilities of infants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and as defining by enactments when they shall cease. As to the statute of conveyances, (Wood\u2019s Dig. 100, sec. 2) which authorizes husband and wife, by their joint deed, to convey her real estate, it carries the proper restriction with it in the same section, and in these words, to wit: \u201c In like manner as she might do if unmarried.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-5\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AuY\">Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The main question in this case is, whether a mortgage executed in 1856, by a <em>femme covert </em>under the age of eighteen, can be enforced against her plea o\u00ed infancy, the mortgage having been made upon the separate estate of the femme.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The _Act of May 10th, 1854, (Wood\u2019s Dig. 541) fixes the legal age of males at twenty-one and of females at eighteen, and provides that at those periods respectively they shall be competent to contract and to convey real estate. The Act of April 2d, 1858, (statutes, 108) provides that married women, when under the age of eighteen years, and married with the consent of their parent or guardian, shall be deemed of full and lawful age. It is true, that the Statute of Conveyances (Wood\u2019s Big. 100, sec. 2) empowers husband and wife, by their joint deed, to convey real estate of the wife; but the act continues, \u201c in like manner as she might . do if unmarried.\u201d Taking all these acts together, and it seems evident that the disability of infancy, as defined by the first act cited, attaches as well to <em>femmes covert </em>under age as to <em>femmes sole, </em>subject only to the Act of 1858, which has, however, no application to mortgages executed in 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">It is urged in avoidance of this plea that the deed of an infant is not void, but only voidable, and that it will be held valid unless disaffirmed on the infant\u2019s arrival at legal age. But if this doctrine be generally true, it would not apply to such a case as this\u2014the case, namely, of a married woman, whose disability of coverture might prevent, if not the possibility, by her own volition, of an act of disaffirmance, yet its effectual exercise ; and the principle would not, moreover, apply to the case of a note and mortgage, in respect to which there would seem to be no act of disaffirmance necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>until demand, of payment were made or enforcement were sought. It seems that the refusal to acknowledge the asserted obligation was made as soon as payment was insisted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Nor if warranted by the record, is'the point better taken, that the mortgage and note are binding because-given to raise money to lift another mortgage upon the same property. This money so raised can scarcely be considered necessaries in contemplation of law, even if a mortgage executed to raise money for such a purpose be protected as a debit incurred for such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Some other points are made, but we do not think it necessary to notice them.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
