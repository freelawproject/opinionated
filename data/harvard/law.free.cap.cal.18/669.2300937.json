Motion granted, and judgment entered in favor of plaintiff for $1,490. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-8\"><em>Hereford </em>&amp; <em>Long, </em>for Appellant, contended that the motion for judgment on the pleadings, after verdict, came too late, citing Voorhies\u2019 N. Y. Code, ed. 1859, 206, note <em>a; </em>3 E. D. Smith, 13; 25 Barb. 505.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-9\"><em>E. B. Crocker, </em>for Respondent, argued that the denial was insufficient, and that hence the judgment must be according to the pleadings <em>non obstante veredicto ; </em>citing, on the latter point, Voorhies\u2019 Code, 251; 24 Miss. 134; 5 Sandf. 217; 13 Cal. 369; 5 Id. 167.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b670-10\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AYb\">Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">We see no error in the record except this, that it was irregular to enter up a judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>after the plaintiff had gone into proof as to damages, and the jury had returned a verdict upon the facts introduced in evidence. The effect of this might well have been to take the defendant by surprise, and induce him to refrain from moving to amend his answer in the partial traverse .which he made of the amount of damages; which amendment the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Court had power to grant, and probably would have granted with or without terms, in advancement of justice. For this reason the judgment is reversed, and the Court below may, if the plaintiff desire it, enter judgment on the verdict. If not, the cause can be retried.
