On the day of trial, plaintiffs being present and defendants not appearing, the Justice makes, this entry: <em>\u201c </em>Plaintiffs demand judgment against defendants for debt and costs. It is therefore adjudged by this Court that plaintiffs have judgment rendered in their favor and against defendants by default for the sum of eighty-nine dollars and thirty-two cents, and fourteen dollars and fifty cents costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-12\">\u201c J.

The defendants justify under the judgment and writ, Warner claiming that, although the judgment could be only against the joint property of Randall &amp; Inos, and the individual property of Randall, still, Inos, by neglecting to appeal or move to alter it, and especially by failing to notify the Constable who seized his individual property that it was such, had lost all remedy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">There was no evidence of any malice or wanton conduct on the part of any of the defendants\u2014the case going off entirely upon the want of authority to seize the individual property of Inos.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">General verdict for plaintiffs, $1,536.

J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">. This is an action to recover damages for the seizure of certain personal property under an execution issued upon a judgment claimed to be void as against the plaintiff. The judgment was rendered by a Justice of the Peace in an action brought by defendant Warner against the plaintiff and one Randall, and there is no doubt whatever of its invalidity. The record of the proceedings in the case shows that no jurisdiction had been acquired of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>son of the plaintiff, and the judgment was therefore, as to him, <em>coram nonjudiee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The judgment being a nullity, the only remaining question is as to the liability of the appellants, and on this point we have as little doubt as upon the other. The judgment was entered against the plaintiff and his codefendant jointly, and the execution directed the officer to make the amount out of the property of the judgment debtors. There was no special direction as to the property to be taken, but the language was sufficiently broad to authorize the seizure of the individual property of either of the parties. Under these circumstances the liability of the Justice who issued the execution is beyond question, and the evidence shows that the plaintiff in the execution is also liable. The execution was issued at his request, and he afterwards participated in the proceedings under it. There is not even the merit of plausibility in the grounds of defense relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
