On the sixth of September, 1858, for a valuable consideration, Muldrow sold and assigned this judgment to the plaintiffs Moore &amp; Welty. A short time after this assignment, plaintiffs caused execution to be issued and levied, by the defendant, on certain property belonging to Norris. This property was sold, a sufficient sum realized to pay the judgment and costs, and the money paid over to Crocker &amp; Robinson. Moore &amp; Welty demanded the money from the defendant, who refused to pay, and this suit is brought on the Sheriff\u2019s official bond to recover it. The assignment to Moore &amp; Welty was in writing, and' immediately filed among the papers in the case. -Crocker &amp; Robinson, Avho are the real defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>set up for the Sheriff, that in 1857 Samuel Norris recovered judgment against Muldrow, McBrayer, Lapsley and others for three hundred dollars, and that this judgment was assigned by Norris to them; that in February, 1859, an execution was issued on.this last named judgment, and levied upon the judgment which Muldrow had assigned to Moore &amp; Welty, and that this judgment was then sold by the Sheriff, and purchased by Crocker &amp; Robinson. Under this purchase, Crocker &amp; Robinson claim to be the owners of the judgment of <em>Muldrow Fore </em>v. Norris, and entitled to the money which the Sheriff collected, as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">Plaintiffs had judgment below; defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\"><em>E.

The assignment of the judgment to Moore &amp; Welty constituted them the absolute owners thereof, and hence there was no interest in the judgment left to be sold at the Sheriff\u2019s sale, and notice to subsequent purchasers was not necessary. (3 Hill, 228; 3 Dessauss, 254; 5 Shep. 327 ; 6 Blackf. 444.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-11\">2. The judgment in question was not the subject of levy and sale under execution; and if it were, the statute was not complied with, and the purchaser acquired no title. Under the statute, notice of the levy must be served on the judgment debtor. (Prac. Act, secs. 217, 220; <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>Blen, </em>13 Cal. 15 ; <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>1 Code R. 98; 19 Wend. 495; 2 Hill, 666; 4 Kern. 270; 9 Barb. 620; 14 Cal. 49.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b437-14\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>If a judgment be the subject of levy and sale, as appellant contends, the purchaser would only take as assignee. Ho title to the chose in action different from that passing by act of assignment, made immediately by the owner of it, would be communicated by the Sheriff\u2019s sale. A judgment is not a negotiable instrument, as a bill of exchange is, by the law merchant; but is a mere <em>chose in </em>action, vesting an equitable right in the assignee to the\u00b0 proceeds of it, with a right to the usual and legal means of collecting the amount due on it. But in this case it appears that before the levy and sale, the judgment had been assigned for value by the holder of it to Moore &amp; Welty. Their right first accruing by the assignment of the execution debtor, took precedence of the Sheriff\u2019s assignment subsequently made. The Sheriff sold the interest of the creditor in the judgment; but the title was already gone before the levy. Between two <em>bona fide </em>purchasers of a <em>chose in action </em>not negotiable, the purchaser first in time is prior in right. It does not avail to say that the execution sale carried the legal title and the prior assignment only an equity; the title sold in both cases is precisely the same\u2014there being no difference, so far as affects the quality of the interest conveyed, between a sale made voluntarily by the party himself and a sale made for him by the Sheriff who, in making it, acts as his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
