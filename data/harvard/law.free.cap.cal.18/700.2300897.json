Defendant in his ..\u2022answer claims title to the north half of the quarter section, and in \u2022substance concedes plaintiff\u2019s claim to the south half. It was proven on the trial that plaintiff surveyed and located, under the Possessory Act, one hundred and sixty acres of land. Prior to ;plaintiff\u2019s survey and settlement, defendant was living upon a tract of land adjoining plaintiff on the north. Thirty acres of defendant\u2019s tract, called the \u201c Old Field,\u201d were enclosed by a fence, and extended into one corner of the north eighty acres claimed by plaintiff. Defendant called A. R. Whitesides as a witness to prove</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>defendant\u2019s prior possession of so much of the eighty acres as is outside of the \u201c Old Field.\u201d The witness, being sworn on his <em>voir </em>dire, said he was a brother of defendant, lived with him and carried on business with him; that he paid no rent, had no interest in the eighty acres, but had an equal interest in the profits of farming; that there was a crop in the \u201c Old Field \u201d only; that outside of this field he had no interest in land or crops. Plaintiff objected to the witness on the ground of interest; sustained, and witness rejected, defendant excepting. Witness executed to defendant a bill of sale of his interest in the crops, without warranty. Witness again offered, and again rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-5\">Judgment for plaintiff for all the land except the \u201c Old Field.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-6\">Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b701-7\"><em>Jos.

R. Whitesides, was not incompetent for the defendant. The fact that he was interested with the defendant in farming within the \u201c Old Field \u201d\u2014a part of the eighty acres sued for\u2014did not make him interested in the result of the litigation outside of that field, in respect to which he had no interest. We do not see how the verdict and judgment could affect him\u2014his proffered testimony not going to the general title, or the title to or right of possession of the field, but to the piece of ground outside of it. It is as if two distinct parcels of ground had been sued for, in only one of which the witness was interested; but that interest would not disqualify him from testifying as to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
