A road running from the limits .of Stockton, <em>via </em>Hamilton\u2019s Ranch, known as the Sonora Road.\u201d The tax was levied and collected and the money set apart as a special fund for the purposes named. On the tenth of July, 1861, the Board made an order to the effect that, \u201c the following route be, and the same -is, hereby declared the location of the road running from the limits of Stockton, <em>via </em>Hamilton\u2019s Ranch, known as the Sonora Road.\u201d [Then follows a regular description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>route by chains, as surveyed.] March 11th, 1861, the Board annulled said order of July 10th, 1860, and located the road on other ground. The line of road,, as first located, passed by or through the lands of plaintiffs, which will be less valuable if no road passes through them, or if the proposed change is mad%. After the first road was located, the Supervisors assessed damages to the owners of land along its line, as the Act of 1860 provides; but before they obtained the right of way through the land surveyed and viewed out, they located the second road. The right of -way for the first road has not been procured, but the right of way for the second road has been procured. There is no material difference in fitness for the purposes of a highway between the two roads; the new road to Sonora is a mile longer. The new road leaves the limits of Stockton at the same point with and continues two miles on the same line as the road from Mariposa to Stockton. The first road is not located immediately on the old traveled track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-5\">The Court below dissolved the preliminary injunction granted, and dismissed the bill. Plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-6\"><em>H. O. &amp; W. H. </em>Beatty, for Appellants, argued that the second order of the Board was void; that the Board exhausted its power over the subject upon passing its first order, citing <em>People ex rel Decker </em>v. <em>Lynde </em>(8 Cow. 134).</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-7\"><em>Geo. W. Tyler, </em>also for Appellants, cited Wood\u2019s Dig. Art. 3319 ; Act 1860, 317; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>Cro. Jac. 446 ; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Bamber, </em>5 Q.

The, first order is not in the nature of a power exercised and exhausted, but at the most merely a mode proposed of executing the.power, which could be changed at any time before rights had vested under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Other points need not he noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
