During the six months succeeding the sale, C., acting as agent of defendants, occupied the premises, carrying on the business of a saloon. At the end of the six months, defendants, as mortgagees, redeemed: <em>Held, </em>that the defendants are tenants in possession within the two hundred and thirty-sixth section of the Practice Act, and must pay plaintiff for use and occupation for the six months.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b113-5\">Appeal from the Seventeenth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">Suit for value of the use and occupation of a certain lot of land in Downieville, with the buildings thereon, known as the \u201cWashington Saloon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">The Court below found that on the seventh day of May, 1859, the premises were sold at Sheriff\u2019s sale, under an order of sale issued upon a decree of foreclosure in the case of <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Reticleer et al., </em>the plaintiff herein becoming the purchaser, and receiving the Sheriff\u2019s certificate ; that from that day to November 7th, 185'9, inclusive, the premises were occupied by one J. H. Cassidy, acting as agent of defendants, and carrying on the business of saloon keeping: that one Gondolfo, an employee in the saloon during said time, was paid for his services by defendants, and that the accounts of the saloon against various persons during said time were settled by and with defendants ; that the value of the use and occupation of the premises meanwhile was two hundred dollars per month, and that the defendants redeemed the same on the seventh of November, 1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">It seems that defendants, merchants in San Francisco, were creditors of Reticker, who was doing business in Downieville, and that in the summer of 1858, to secure their debt, they took from Reticker a mortgage of the premises in question, and also a bill of sale of the personal property in the saloon, with the agreement that the whole was intended as security for their debt; that the receipts of the saloon, less the expenses and less two hundred dollars per month, allowed Reticker for family purposes, should be transmitted at short intervals to defendants; that they should keep an agent in the saloon to look after their interests, and see that this agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ment was carried out; and that this connection of defendant with the property continued until November 7th, 1859, when they redeemed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">The point of fact in dispute is whether defendant's were in possession of the saloon as occupants, or whether Reticker occupied it during the six months succeeding the sale under plaintiff\u2019s decree, there being some evidence showing that he Avas in the saloon during the time. Upon this question the findings of the Court, already given, are against defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">Plaintiff had judgment for $1,200 and costs. Defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-7\"><em>Stewart &amp; </em>Thornton, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-8\">1. Defendants are not shown to have been such tenants in possession, as to be held liable, under section two hundred and thirty-six of the Practice Act, for the value of the use and occupation of the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\">In <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>(7 Cal. 46) it was held that the tenant should pay rent to the purchaser, because the Sheriff\u2019s sale was equivalent to an assignment of the lease. Here there was no lease to assign, and the defendants Avere in such position that Reticker <em>could not collect </em>rent, or the value of the use and occupation from them; and the purchaser at Sheriff\u2019s sale cannot acquire a greater right than the judgment debtor had to get rent or the value of the use and occupation of the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-10\">2. The property was redeemed by defendants, and plaintiff received his judgment, interests, costs and per centage. After this he could not recover rents, etc. (Pr. Act, sec. 236.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-11\"><em>W. Camphell, </em>for Respondent, cited <em>McDevitt </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>8 Cal. 592 ; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reynolds et al., </em>13 Id. 514.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-12\">Cope, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"A6f\">Baldwin, J. and Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">The plaintiff sues as purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale to recover the value of the use and occupation of certain premises from the time of the sale until a redemption. The evidence upon the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of occupation is somewhat conflicting, and the findings of the Court are therefore conclusive. We think the defendants must be regarded as tenants in possession within the meaning of the two hundred and thirty-sixth section of the Practice Act. <em>McDevitt </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(8 Cal. 592) and <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(13 Cal. 514) are decisive of this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The facts found by the Court entitle the plaintiff to recover, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>See Kline </em>v. <em>Chase, infra.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
