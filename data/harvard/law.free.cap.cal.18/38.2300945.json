D. 1856, more than three years from the finding of this indictment on the eleventh day of January, 1861, and hence the prosecution of the same is barred by the provision of the act limiting the time of the finding of the indictment in such cases; that the indictment does not charge the time when the defendant absented himself from the State after the twenty-second day of October, 1856, or when he returned; that the indictment does not show that for three years next succeeding the twenty-second day of Oc-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tober, 1856, the defendant was not an inhabitant of, or' usually resident within the State of California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">Overruled.

Cr. Laws, <em>a </em>1878, <em>a </em>437, <em>a </em>438, <em>a </em>439 ; <em>Slate </em>v. <em>Hurrill, </em>5 Humph.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Willberger, 5 </em>Wheat. 76; 4th Curtis, 575 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>12 Cal. 291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-8\"><em>Thos.

The indictment does not charge two offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beatty, </em>14 Cal. 560.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-10\">II. The indictment brings the case within the exceptions contained in section ninety-nine of the Act of Limitations. (Wood\u2019s Dig. 278 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>12 Cal. 291.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-11\">Even if the indictment does not in language follow strictly the provisions of the act referred to, still the defendant cannot be benefited by it, for the reason that instead of being against him, the language of the indictment is more favorable to him than that of the law. The statute exemption is, \u201c not an inhabitant of, or usually resident within the State,\u201d &amp;c., while that of the indictment is, \u201c was not an inhabitant of, or a resident within the said State,\u201d &amp;c., leaving the word <em>usually </em>out. Under the law, he might have been occasionally within the State, and still subject to the effects of the exemption, while the indictment placed the prosecution in the position (if followed strictly) of being compelled to show that-he was not at any time during the period mentioned, within the State.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b39-12\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"ANo\">Field, C.

The indictment does not charge two offenses, but only one\u2014the addition of the word received to the word buy, applied to the same subject and act, though not absolutely necessary, does not make the offense less or different than the buying of the article stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The indictment, which was for receiving stolen goods, avers that the defendant, \u201c after the said twenty-second October, 1856, and after he had feloniously and willfully bought and received the said mule, and before the finding of this indictment, did absent himself from the State of California aforesaid ; and, for the space of time of two years and four months after the said twenty-second October, 1856, and after he had feloniously and willfully bought and received the said mule, and before the finding of this indictment, he, the said Montejo, was not an inhabitant of or a resident within the said State of California.\u201d Art. 1443 of the Criminal Practice Act, (Wood\u2019s Dig.'278) provides, that \u201c if, when the offense is committed, the defendant be out of the State, the indictment may be found within the term limited after his coming within the State, and no time during which the defendant is not an inhabitant of or usually resident within the State, shall be a part of the limitation.\u201d We think it clear that this provision as well includes the case of the defendant leaving the State after the commission of the crime as the case of his absence at the time of its perpetration, and that it applies to all offenses. We think the indictment in the clause quoted sufficiently avers the matter of exception to the operation of the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
