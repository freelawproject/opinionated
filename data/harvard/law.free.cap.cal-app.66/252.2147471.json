Petitioner contends that she is imprisoned without probable cause. Section 496 of the Penal Code fastens the crime of receiving stolen goods upon \u201cEvery person who for his own gain, or to prevent the owner from again possessing Ms property, buys or receives any personal property, knowing the same to have been stolen.\u201d The point made by petitioner is that she was committed without evidence showing that an article received by -her, a certain watch, was taken with guilty knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The evidence before the committing magistrate showed that the watch in question, along with a considerable number of other articles of jewelry, was taken by robbers from a manager of a \u201cloan association.\u201d Upon an occasion after the robbery three peace officers, Cahill, Peoples, and Sweesey, called upon petitioner at the apartment which was her place of residence. The testimony of these men, given in the order in which their names are set forth above, contains the only evidence bearing upon the point presented by petitioner. Cahill was asked who conducted the conversation with petitioner which ensued upon their call at her apartment. He answered: \u201cI was the one that done the first questioning.\u201d He then proceeded: \u201cDeputy Sheriff Peoples was immediately present. I dare say Mr. Sweesey was in the other room at the time. ... I asked the defendant if she had any jewelry that had been left her by Jimmie Blanton, and she said, \u2018What is it all about? Tell me something.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, you are evidently very conversant with what we are trying to get you to help us in.\u2019 I said, \u2018We are looking for the jewelry that you have in your possession,\u2019 and I said, \u2018The easier way is the better way, and we would solicit at this time your co-operation and expedite matters, if the jewelry is here, and save us the trouble of going about and searching for it.\u2019 I said, \u2018We know, or feel that we know where Jimmie is.\u2019 I said, \u2018Did you have a telegram from San Francisco with regard to his coming to-day?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018I know they are out of the city and due to-day. \u2019 I said, \u2018 Then, what became of the jewelry that Jimmie gave you?\u2019 She said, \u2018It is not here.\u2019 Then I said, \u2018Now, I am going to appeal to you again to lend us your co-operation.\u2019 I said, \u2018We are certainly working diligently on this case, and we want to expedite matters, and if you have the jewelry hidden in this house, kindly turn it over and cause us less trouble in searching.\u2019 She said, \u2018No, it is not here.\u2019 Then I said, \u2018Will you take us to where it is? Is it in a safety deposit box?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018I am not saying.\u2019 I said, \u2018Then what is Jimmie to you?\u2019 She said, \u2018He is my husband.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Then do you expect him to-day?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, I am expecting him.\u2019 . . . Peoples was present during that conversation. Then we started to look through the dresser drawers. I said, \u2018If you don\u2019t go about and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>do this,\u2019 I said, \u2018we will go ahead and look for the jewelry in the drawers, that meeting with your approval.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Go ahead.\u2019 . . . Q. Now, was Officer Sweesey present when you asked permission to search the house? A. Yes; he had come in at that time.\u201d The officers then proceeded with a search and Cahill found a small bar pin which, it is to be observed, was not one of the articles of jewelry taken by the thieves from the manager of the loan association. Cahill further testified: \u201cMr. Sweesey at this time was looking through the left and upper drawer of the same dresser, and I turned to the defendant and asked her if that little bar pin was hers. She said, \u2018Yes, that is mine.\u2019 I said, \u2018Where did you get it?\u2019 She said, \u2018From a friend.\u2019 Then I was attracted by Mr. Sweesey asking a question. He had raised a little watch out of the drawer and asked the defendant if that was her watch . . . and she stated, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Now, that was all the jewelry that we x$ere able to find.\u201d Peoples testified that he talked with petitioner after Cahill\u2019s conversation with her. After some questions about other matters, Peoples further said: \u201cMr. Sweesey was present at one conversation, rather through the latter part of it. I was talking with her before, and I said, \u2018Won\u2019t you please tell me where those diamonds are?\u2019 I said, \u2018I know you have got some rings and diamonds, and I would like to get them.\u2019 She said, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about them.\u2019 I said, \u2018Don\u2019t you think it would be better if you tell us and clear this matter up and save us a lot of trouble?\u2019 She said, \u2018I am not telling nothing.\u2019 Just then Mr. Sweesey came up and he started talking about the watch, so she said, \u2018In just a few moments Mr. Peoples. I would have told \u25a0them.\u201d Sweesey testified very briefly. He said upon the subject of present interest: \u201cThe only conversation I had I picked up the watch and asked who that belonged to, and I do not remember the answer. ... I addressed it to the defendant, but I do not remember the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Respondent contends that it may be inferred, with reason, from certain answers and remarks which petitioner made in response to the inquiries of the officers, that she received the watch with knowledge of the fact that it had been stolen. The utterances of petitioner to which this effect is ascribed are these: \u201cWhat, is it all about? Tell me something\u201d; \u201cIt is not here\u201d; \u201cNo, it is not here\u201d; \u201cwell, I am not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>saying\u201d; \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about them\u201d; and \u201cI am not telling nothing.\u201d It is asserted that as the watch was in fact part of the stolen jewelry, petitioner\u2019s answers, being evasive and calculated to deceive, as it is claimed, were such as to justify an inference of guilty knowledge on her part as to that particular article. We think that such an inference cannot properly be drawn from her statements. Cahill, who first talked with her, spoke only of jewelry in general. Peoples, the next inquisitor, was more specific and referred to diamonds and rings. The conversation about the watch came later. If the officers had found in petitioner\u2019s possession diamonds and rings which were a part of the missing loot, then some tangible question would be presented as to whether petitioner\u2019s utterances were so evasive and so calculated to deceive as to justify the inference that her possession of them was coupled with a guilty knowledge. This is not so as to the watch. There was nothing in the remarks and inquiries of the officers which can render her responses applicable to that piece of jewelry, granting that they- were evasive and deceitful as to jewelry consisting of diamonds and rings. In addition to all that we have said it is also to be observed that the officers failed to make petitioner acquainted with the fact that they were seeking stolen goods, except in so far as she might have inferred the fact from their conduct. Further, they never told her that there had been a theft, either by Jimmie Blanton or by any other persons. Further still, although the record before us shows that the manager of the loan association was robbed by several men, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that Blanton was among the lawbreakers or that he had any connection with their criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Petitioner is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finlayson, P.
