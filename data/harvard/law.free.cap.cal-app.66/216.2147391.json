J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqU\">This is an action to recover damages for the alleged breach of an oral agreement by defendants to plow plaintiff\u2019s land. Plaintiff\u2019s demand is based upon the claim that defendants undertook to plow the land to a depth of six inches. Defendants contend that the agreement was to plow to a depth of approximately three to four inches. Whether the agreement was what plaintiff claims it was or whether defendants\u2019 version of it is the correct one is the crucial point in the case. The findings of fact were ' favorable to defendants; judgment was entered accordingly ; plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was denied, and from that judgment for defendants plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The trial court found that defendants did not agree to plow to a depth of six inches but did agree to plow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>land \u201cto a depth sufficient for ordinary dry wheat farming, namely, approximately three or four inches in depth.\u201d Appellant\u2019s first point is that the evidence is insufficient to support this finding. While a contrary finding, if it had been made, would have been sustained by this court, it cannot be held that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the finding as made. The agreement was arrived at in the course of a conversation between the defendant Steele and Barclay McGowan, the president of the plaintiff corporation. McGowan, in whose office the conversation took place, testified: \u201cI told Mr. Steele I wanted section 25, 30-29 plowed for summer-fallow, . . . and that I would pay him $2.00 an acre for plowing that land six inches deep. He said he would do it. He would plow the land six inches deep for $2.00 an acre, to be paid for when the job was finished.\u201d One Daniel Bidwell, who says he overheard the conversation, corroborated'McGowan\u2019s version of it. Steele\u2019s account of the transaction is as follows: \u201cI walked into Mr. McGowan\u2019s office. ... I wasn\u2019t in there but a few minutes with him and I says, \u2018Well, Mr. McGowan, I came up here to see about the plowing that we was talking about some time ago.\u2019 He said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and he asked me what I would plow it for. I told him that I would plow it, give him good ordinary wheat plowing, for $2.00. That is just the words that was said. . . . Mr. McGowan says, \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, \u2018It ought to be plowed six inches,\u2019 and I never said a word more about it. Just before I got ready to go away I says, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll give you a good ordinary wheat plowing for $2.00.\u2019 Mr. McGowan says, \u2018Very well.\u2019 I says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the best I can for you.\u2019 That is just the words, the whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Prom the foregoing it will be seen that there was a conflict in the testimony as to what was said by the parties when entering into their oral agreement, and that the evidence supports the finding that the agreement was to plow to a depth of approximately three or four inches, unless, as appellant claims, Steele\u2019s testimony, when correctly interpreted, is in harmony with that given by McGowan and Bidwell. We are unable to give our assent to appellant\u2019s interpretation of Steele\u2019s testimony. There is evidence to warrant the conclusion that by the words \u2018 \u2018 good ordinary wheat plowing,\u201d as used by the witness Steele, the parties under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>stood that the plowing was to be to a depth of approximately three to four inches. This explains why McGowan, when Steele said he would \u201cgive him good ordinary wheat plowing for $2.00,\u201d replied that it \u201cought\u201d to be plowed six inches. That is, if we interpret Steele\u2019s testimony most favorably to respondents and in the light afforded by all the evidence, as we are required to do, it shows that Steele was willing to plow to a depth of three to four inches for two dollars an acre; that he so informed Me Cowan; that the latter thought that a depth of three to four inches was not sufficient\u2014that he thought the ground ought to be plowed to a depth of six inches; and that finally, when Steele repeated his offer to do \u201cgood ordinary wheat plowing for $2.00,\u201d i. e., to plow to a depth of approximately three to four inches, McGowan replied, \u201cVery well.\u201d The rule that the determination of issues of fact is primarily for the trial court, and that the findings of that court are- to be overthrown on appeal pnly when they totally lack the support of substantial evidence, has been announced so often that it has become trite. In <em>Fomden </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast 8. S. Co., </em>149 Cal. 162 [86 Pac. 182], it is said: \u201cIt is the firmly settled law of the state that this court will not disturb the ruling of the court below on a motion for a new trial upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, if there be a substantial conflict in the evidence, even though this court may, upon the record, consider the verdict clearly against the weight of the evidence.\u201d In cases of mere conflict of evidence the conclusion of the trial jury and judge, says the court in <em>Still </em>v. <em>San Francisco etc. Ry. Co., </em>154 Cal. 564 [129 Am. St. Rep. 177, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 322, 98 Pac. 674], \u201care conclusive on the question as to which side produced the \u2018preponderance of evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In view -of our conclusion that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the finding that the agreement was what respondents claim it to be, it will not be necessary to consider appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in sustaining objections to certain questions. The sole purpose of the questions to which the objections were made was to show the amount of appellant\u2019s damage. But since respondents did not breach the agreement which the court found was the only one which was entered into, there can be no recovery. Prom this it necessarily follows that appellant could not pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>sibly be prejudiced by ^ the rulings of which it now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Works, J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
