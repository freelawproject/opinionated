The answer consists wholly of denials. Plaintiff had judgment for $250 and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The complaint fails to state a cause of action. Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>item of damages is claimed upon the theory that appellant was bound to make delivery of the lease. Such was not his contract. The assignment made transfer to respondent of the entire title of appellant under the lease and the assignment became executed the moment it was delivered (3 Cal. Jur., tit. \u201cAssignments,\u201d see. 21). Therefore, not only did appellant not agree to make physical transfer of the lease, but respondent\u2019s rights under the assignment were as complete without the possession of the instrument assigned as they would have been with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The complaint was demurred to on the ground that it attempts to allege two causes of action without separate statement. This point is good. We do not decide that the joinder would have been proper even if the two causes had been separately stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The second alleged cause of action, the one for damages for $35, is insufficient for the reason that it fails to allege that the lessor\u2019s consent was necessary to an assignment of the lease. This point is not made by appellant, but we do not hesitate to mention it, as the points which are presented by him necessitate a reversal of the judgment. .</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The trial court failed to find upon the issue tendered by the complaint as a basis for the claim for damages in the sum of $1,000. As to that item of damages the court found only \u201cThat by reason of the failure of defendant to deliver said lease to plaintiff, he, the said plaintiff, was greatly inconvenienced and prevented from making or entering into any negotiations for the sale of said store and said lease thereon mentioned in the contract aforesaid, and from properly conducting said store, and was annoyed and harassed by both the demands of said defendant and the landlord for the payment of the rent on said premises for the same month under said lease, and plaintiff was compelled to sell out sooner than he otherwise would have, had he been given said lease by said defendant, and the same had not been withheld from him by said defendant.\u201d This finding did not meet the issue, as it is not a finding that respondent was \u201cprevented\u201d by the acts of appellant from making a sale, or that those acts caused respondent to \u201close a sale\u201d to a particular person.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Finlayson, P. J., and Craig, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u2022A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on April 16, 1924, and a petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on May 19, 1924.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
