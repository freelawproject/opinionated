J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU3\">This action was brought to recover the amount alleged to be due on a promissory note and to foreclose a chattel mortgage given to secure the same. The demurrer to the complaint interposed by the defendants other than Painter was sustained and judgment was entered in favor of the demurring defendants. This appeal is from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In so far as material to the questions raised by this appeal, the complaint alleges that at the times mentioned therein H. Rummelsburg and R. Rummelsburg were partners, \u201cdoing business under the firm name and style of H. Rummelsburg &amp; Son, certificate of said partnership under said name and proof of publication thereof being on file in the manner and form required by law in the office of the county clerk of the County of Solano\u201d; that on the day they bear date the defendant Painter executed and delivered to \u201cH. Rummelsburg &amp; Son\u201d the promissory note and mortgage on which the action is based; that the defendants other than Painter \u201cclaim some right, title or interest in the personal property described in the chattel mortgage above mentioned and referred to; that the claims of the defendants and each of them are subsequent to and subject to the mortgage of plaintiffs. \u2019 \u2019 A copy of the mortgage, containing a copy of the note, is attached to the complaint and made a part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Respondents contend that the chattel mortgage was not given to the plaintiff partnership but to the individual partners. The mortgage recites that it is made \u201cto H.Rummelsburg and Roland Rummelsburg, copartners, doing business under the firm name and style of \u2018PI. Rummelsburg &amp; Son\u2019 . . . mortgagees,\u201d and the plural \u201cmortgagees\u201d is employed throughout. If there were nothing else to indicate the intention of the parties it might be inferred that the words \u201ccopartners, doing business,\u201d etc., are merely descriptive, but the mortgage further recites that it is given \u201cas security for the payment to \u2018H. Rummelsburg &amp; Son\u2019 the said mortgagees.\u201d The promissory note set out therein is made payable \u201cto the order of H. Rummelsburg &amp; Son.\u201d The affidavit on behalf of the mortgagees is made by \u201cH. Rummelsburg of Rummelsburg &amp; Son, the mortgagees.\u201d The most that can be said in favor of respondents\u2019 contention is that on its face the mortgage is uncertain as to whether it was given to the partnership or to the individual partners. The complaint alleges that it was given to \u201cPL Rummelsburg &amp; Son.\u201d If this allegation is true, and on demurrer its truth must be assumed, then the mortgage was executed by H. Rummelsburg on behalf of and as agent of the partnership. If in their answer the defendants shall d\u00a7ny this allegation, parol proof will be admissible at the trial upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the issue thus raised. \u201cThe rule is well settled that where a reading of a simple contract, however inartificially it may he drawn, discloses that it is executed for or on behalf of a principal, or discloses an intent to bind such principal, or even leaves the matter one of doubt, parol evidence may \u25a0be employed to determine whose contract it is, and this even in cases where the instrument is sufficiently clear in its terms .to bind the agent.\u201d <em>(Southern Pac. Co. </em>v. <em>Von Schmidt Dredge Co., </em>118 Cal. 368, 371 [50 Pac. 650, 651]; <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Pioneer Mining Co., </em>66 Cal. 451 [56 Am. Rep. 106, 6 Pac. 86].) In a case involving the question whether a promissory note was the individual note of the signers thereof or the note of the company of which they were officers, their signatures being followed by their official designations, the court said: \u201cPromissory notes, like other instruments, must be given that effect which accords with the obvious intent of the parties to them.\u201d <em>(Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mech. Bank </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>64 Cal. 352 [28 Pac. 118]; <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Stockton etc. R. R. Co., </em>130 Cal. 100, 104 [62 Pac. 267].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In opposition to the foregoing authorities respondents rely on the cases of <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>67 Cal. 143 [7 Pac. 413], <em>Feder </em>v. <em>Epstein, </em>69 Cal. 456 [10 Pac. 785], <em>Maclay Co. </em>v. <em>Meads, </em>14 Cal. App. 363 [112 Pac. 195, 113 Pac. 364], and <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>55 Cal. App. 134 [202 Pac. 938]. There is no inconsistency between the two lines of cases. Those cited by respondents have to do with the question of proper parties to actions and the manner of acquiring jurisdiction over defendants, matters which must be decided in accordance with what is done by a plaintiff rather than by what he intended. The cases hereinbefore reviewed involved the interpretation of contracts, questions in which the intention of the parties is the all-important consideration. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Knox </em>is typical of the cases cited by respondent. The defendants therein were described as \u201cRichard P. Knox, Joseph Osborne, Samuel P. Ely, W. T. Robinson, and Philip Y. R. Ely, copartners, doing business under the firm name of Knox &amp; Osborne.\u201d Three of the defendants were served with summons. The Elys were not served. Section 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201cwhen two or more persons, associated in any business, transact such business under a common name, . . . the associates may be sued by such common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>name, the summons in such eases being served on one or more of the associates.\u201d The court said: \u201cWe are of opinion that this is an action against the individual partners . . . and . . . the plaintiffs can only proceed against the parties served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Respondents urge that the affidavit attached to the mortgage is insufficient. The body thereof reads as follows: \u201cJoseph B. Painter, the mortgagor in the foregoing mortgage named, and H. Rummelsburg of H. Rummelsburg &amp; Son, the mortgagees, in said mortgage named, each being duly sworn, each for himself, doth depose and say: That the aforesaid mortgage is made in good faith and without any design to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor or creditors.\u201d The affidavit is sufficient. <em>(Modesto Bank </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>121 Cal. 223 [53 Pac. 552] ; <em>Alferitz </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>130 Cal. 474 [62 Pac. 735].)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The complaint does not allege that the. mortgage was recorded. Section 2957 of the Civil Code provides: \u201cA mortgage of personal property is void as against creditors of the mortgagor and subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers of the property in good faith and for value, unless ... it is acknowledged or proved, certified, and recorded in like manner as grants of real property.\u201d The complaint does not show that the demurring defendants are creditors of the mortgagor or subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers of the property and, therefore, they cannot, by demurrer, question the sufficiency of the mortgage, which is valid between the parties thereto without being recorded. <em>(Lemon </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>121 Cal. 272 [53 Pac. 801].) The nature of the defendants\u2019 claim of interest in the mortgaged property does not appear from the allegations of the complaint. The allegation that they claim some interest therein which is subsequent and subject to plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage cast the burden upon defendants to set up and prove their interest. <em>(San Francisco Breweries </em>v. <em>Schurtz, </em>104 Cal. 420 [38 Pac. 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">It is urged that the allegation in the complaint of the publication and filing of the certificate of copartnership, as required by sections 2466 and 2468 of the Civil Code, is insufficient. The defendants demurred on the ground that the complaint is uncertain in that it cannot be ascertained therefrom \u201cwhether or not the certificate of partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>. . . was ever published as required by law.\u201d In <em>Spreckels </em>v. <em>Grace Darling Hosp. Assn., </em>28 Cal. App. 646 [153 Pac. 718], it was held that failure to allege such publication and filing cannot be raised by special demurrer for uncertainty but may be raised by special demurrer on the ground of want of legal capacity to sue. In <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Mensinger, </em>175 Cal. 300, 303 [165 Pac. 950], it is said that such failure \u201cmerely subjects the complaint to the special defense of a plea in abatement.\u201d In <em>Amundson </em>v. <em>Shafer, </em>36 Cal. App. 398, 400 [172 Pac. 173, 174], in which case a hearing was denied by the supreme court, it is said that a compliance with the provisions of sections 2466 and 2468 \u201cneed not appear upon the face of the complaint. If the fact be that the person maintaining such an action has not complied with the sections mentioned, the point may be presented as a defense by way of plea in abatement.\u201d It may be stated further that the demurrer herein was not sustained on the ground here urged. The order sustaining the demurrer reads as follows: \u201cIn the above-entitled action, as to the demurrer of certain defendants directed to the point as to whether the mortgage was given to the partnership it is ordered that the said demurrer be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">It is urged that the complaint does not allege that Painter had any interest in the property at the time of the execution of the mortgage. In <em>Sielbeck </em>v. <em>Grothman, </em>248 Ill. 435 [21 Ann. Cas. 229, 94 N. E. 67], it is said, although the statement is not necessary to the decision, that in a foreclosure proceeding \u201cthe bill should allege the title of the mortgagors in the mortgaged premises. (1 Wiltsie on Mortgage Foreclosures [1899 ed.], see. 276.) In the section cited it is said: \u201cIt is not necessary to aver in so many words that the defendant has title to the mortgaged premises; it is sufficient to aver the making of the mortgage. \u201d In Jones on Mortgages, seventh edition, section 1454, it is said: \u201cAn allegation of the execution of the mortgage is also sufficient without any averment of title in the mortgagor. He is estopped by his deed from denying his title.\u201d It is a disputable presumption \u201cthat a person is the owner of property from exercising acts of ownership over it.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1963, subd. 12.) In <em>Henke </em>v. <em>Eureka Endowment Assn., </em>100 Cal. 429 [34 Pac. 1089], the court said: \u201cThe first contention of appellant is that no con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>sideration is alleged in the complaint for the execution by defendant of the agreement upon which a recovery is sought. Section 1614 of the Civil Code provides that \u2018A written instrument is presumptive evidence of a consideration. \u2019 It is a familiar rule of pleading under our code system that every fact which a plaintiff will be called upon to prove at the trial must be averred in his complaint. It is equally a rule that presumptions of law should not, or at least need not, be stated. When the plaintiff averred in her complaint that the defendant executed a contract in writing wherein it promised, at a given date, to pay her a certain sum of money she stated facts from which the law presumed a consideration, hence it was unnecessary to aver it specially.\u201d In this case the complaint alleges that Painter executed the mortgage in question upon the property therein described, and from the exercise of such act of ownership the law presumes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that he was the owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The judgment is reversed, with directions to the trial court to overrule the demurrer and give the demurring defendants a reasonable time to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Plummer, J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
