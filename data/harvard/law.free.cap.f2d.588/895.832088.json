LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Exxon Corporation and Gulf Oil Corporation, in response to a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>have turned over to the Federal Trade Commission a substantial volume of documents many of which are confidential. They then joined with other plaintiffs in the filing of a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that the FTC was not providing and could not provide adequate protection for its confidential documents and that those documents are not obtainable pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. The district court recognized that it possessed jurisdiction to decide the merits of appellants\u2019 claims. The district court decided, however, that it had discretion not to exercise this jurisdiction and dismissed the complaint. <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>436 F.Supp. 1019 (D.Del.1977). Because we conclude that the district court did not have discretion to decline to hear a portion of appellants\u2019 claims, we will reverse with respect to certain claims and remand for a decision on the merits of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">I. A HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">The genesis of this litigation was the filing by the FTC on July 18, 1973 of a complaint (FTC Docket No. 8934) against Exxon Corp., Texaco, Inc., Mobil Oil Corp., Standard Oil Co. of California, Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), Shell Oil Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. The FTC alleged that these oil companies have engaged in a variety of anti-competitive practices. On November 24, 1976, a Commission Administrative Law Judge issued substantially identical subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>to the respondent companies. The information sought related to the companies\u2019 organizational structure, record keeping systems and refining operations. On December 9, 1976, the respondent companies jointly moved for the entry of a protective order by the ALJ. The companies did not, however, withdraw the contention they had previously made, in seeking to limit the scope of the subpoenas, that the FTC did not have the authority to issue an order that would adequately protect the confidentiality of the subpoenaed documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">On January 4, 1977, the ALJ, acting under the powers provided in 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.42(c), issued a protective order covering all the documents subpoenaed. Paragraph 9 of that order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">9. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, in the event of a Freedom of Information Act request or an official request from any Congressional committee or subcommittee for disclosure of any document designated \u201cConfidential\u201d hereunder or any information contained therein, authorized representatives of the Commission\u2019s Office of General Counsel may inspect the document for purposes of advising the Commission on the request and defending the Commission\u2019s interests in court. Furthermore, the Commission shall provide the party which supplied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>confidential document with ten (10) days\u2019 notice prior to releasing the document in response to such a request or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The Commission, on January 31, 1977, approved this paragraph with one modification. In the event of a request for confidential documents through congressional or judicial process, the ten-day notice requirement would not apply. Instead, ten days notice would be given where possible, and as much notice would be given as is reasonably possible under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">On August 1,1978, the Commission issued an order stating that it was the Commission\u2019s intent, in issuing its January 31, 1977 order, to retain the requirement that respondents always be given ten days notice before their documents are turned over to anyone unless in response to congressional or judicial requests. Congressional or judicial requests remain subject to the qualified notice provisions just described.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">All respondents to the FTC proceedings other than Texaco and Shell filed the instant suit against the FTC on February 18, 1977, seeking injunctive relief. On March 3, 1977, the plaintiffs, now including Shell, filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory as well as injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">On August 19, 1977, the district court granted the FTC\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice. A motion for relief from that dismissal was denied on September 30, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Of the companies to whom subpoenas were issued, only Exxon and Gulf decided to comply. As a result, the FTC commenced an enforcement proceeding against the other companies in the District Court for the District of Columbia on July 27, 1977. That court granted enforcement without modifying the Commission\u2019s protective order and rejected claims essentially identical to those made here. <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>442 F.Supp. 1118 (D.D.C.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">II. VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">At the outset, we must face the FTC\u2019s contention, not decided below, that venue was improper in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">The applicable venue statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 1391(e), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-14\">(e) A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal' authority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States, may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (1) a defendant in the action resides, or (2) the cause of action arose, or (3) any real property involved in the action is situated, or (4) <em>the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action. </em>Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and with such other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees, or agencies were not a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-15\">The summons and complaint in such an action shall be served as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought, [emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">The FTC concedes that one of the original plaintiffs, Standard Oil Co. of California, was properly venued in Delaware because it is a Delaware corporation. A second Delaware corporation, Shell Oil Co., joined in the amended complaint. The FTC argues, however, that 1) one or more properly venued plaintiffs do not provide proper venue for other co-plaintiffs and 2) even if this first contention fails, the early dismissal of the properly venued plaintiffs deprives the other plaintiffs of proper venue. We agree with neither argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">With respect to the first contention, requiring every plaintiff in an action against the federal government or an agent thereof to independently meet section 1391(e)\u2019s standards would result in an unnecessary multiplicity of litigation. The language of the statute itself mandates no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>such narrow construction. There is no requirement that all plaintiffs reside in the forum district. <em>See Kenyatta v. Kelley, </em>430 F.Supp. 1328, 1330 n.7 (E.D.Pa.1977); <em>Candarini v. Attorney General, </em>369 F.Supp. 1132, 1135 (E.D.N.Y.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">We are not constrained to reach the opposite conclusion by this court\u2019s per curiam affirmance in <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Celebrezze, </em>352 F.2d 524 (3d Cir. 1965), <em>cert. dismissed as to the venue issue, </em>387 U.S. 136, 157 n.20, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). The district court in the case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed twenty-six of thirty-seven plaintiff corporations because of improper venue. The district court, however, discussed only the issue of where corporations reside for purposes of 1391(e) and apparently assumed, without discussion, that all plaintiffs must independently meet 1391(e) requirements. The following is the full text of this court\u2019s per curiam opinion affirming the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">The named appellants in the above entitled case are some, but not all, of the plaintiffs who joined in the complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-7\">We find no prejudicial error in the dismissal of the complaint as to these plaintiffs, and that action will be affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The Supreme Court in dismissing certiorari with respect to the venue issue noted that this court had not explicitly endorsed the lower court\u2019s construction of 1391(e)\u2019s requirements. 387 U.S. 136, 157 n.20, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 681. The Court stated that the dismissed plaintiffs were adequately represented by the remaining corporate' plaintiffs and especially by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association which was a proper party to the action and of which all the dismissed plaintiffs were members. This court in affirming because of the absence of \u201cprejudicial error\u201d may also have grounded its decision on the adequate protection of the dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 interests by the remaining plaintiffs. Thus, we are not bound by <em>Abbott </em>to construe 1391(e) as requiring that every plaintiff must independently meet that section\u2019s test. Instead we hold that venue is proper for this action because at least one plaintiff did reside in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">The FTC\u2019s second contention is that the residence of one or more plaintiffs in Delaware does not make all plaintiffs properly venued because the resident plaintiffs\u2019 claims were dismissed at the outset of the action. Actually the claims of all plaintiffs were dismissed by the district court through the order which we review today. That dismissal does not, however, deprive nonresident plaintiffs of their right to appeal the district court judgment. This result does not, as the FTC contends, open the doors to the joinder of plaintiffs with frivolous claims so as to circumvent venue requirements. Where a district court finds that such a ploy has been attempted, it may dismiss the frivolous claims and not permit the other parties to use those claims as a basis for providing themselves with proper venue. The relief sought by the resident plaintiffs here was the same as that sought by the other plaintiffs including Exxon and Gulf. The dismissal of those plaintiffs and their failure to appeal does not deprive Exxon and Gulf of proper venue since venue is determined at the outset of the litigation and is not affected by a subsequent change in parties. <em>See </em>3B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 25.05, p. 25-167 (2d ed. 1978). We hold, therefore, that venue was proper here.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">III. THE ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">This is one of those cases in which the greatest difficulties arise in defining the issues rather than in resolving them. The parties\u2019 briefs characterize the issues in divergent terms and, even at oral argument, neither counsel seemed ready to accept the definition of the issues as proffered by the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">Plaintiffs are seeking three declarations which would provide the basis for other possible relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>1. That the FTC has no sufficient means to enforce any protective order it issues <em>regardless of the facial adequacy of the order\u2019s provisions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">2. That the terms of the protective FTC order here, <em>do not </em>provide adequate protection for plaintiffs\u2019 documents (primarily with respect to its notice provisions) <em>regardless of the mechanisms by which those terms would be enforced.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-5\">3. That the documents produced pursuant to the subpoena cannot be obtained by third parties by means of the procedures provided by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">As mentioned, the district court declined to exercise its jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act to decide any of these claims. The central issue on appeal therefore is whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction over any or all of the claims. Two comments, one obvious and the other less obvious, must be made with respect to this formulation of the issue. The obvious comment is that we are deciding only whether the district court must hear the merits of the claims; we are not deciding the merits ourselves. The second comment concerns the applicable standard of review. It is clearly the law of this court that the decision to grant or withhold a declaratory judgment is committed to the discretion of the district court and that decision will not be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. <em>See Davis v. Romney, </em>490 F.2d 1360, 1370 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>General Motors Corp. v. Volpe, </em>457 F.2d 922, 923 (3d Cir. 1972). It is also the law of this court, however, that the Declaratory Judgment Act should \u201chave a liberal interpretation.\u201d <em>See Simmonds Aerocessories v. Elastic Stop Nut Corp., </em>257 F.2d 485, 489 (3d Cir. 1958); <em>Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., </em>137 F.2d 68, 70 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>320 U.S. 761, 64 S.Ct. 70, 88 L.Ed. 454 (1943). Thus, in this context, the ambit of the district court\u2019s discretion is somewhat circumscribed and the range of our review is correspondingly enlarged. At the risk of becoming entrapped in a maze formed by multiple articulations of the standard of review, we will attempt one further elucidation of the standard here. Where the district court has declined jurisdiction, we will not reverse merely because we would decide differently, but the decision to decline jurisdiction will be given closer scrutiny than normally given on an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d review. We recognize that other courts have applied the \u201cmere error\u201d standard of review in this context,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the law of this court is to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">IV. THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION UNDER THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">The exercise of this discretion must be reviewed within the framework provided by the Supreme Court in the <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>trilogy: <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (Abbott I); <em>Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 158, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967) (Abbott II); <em>Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n, </em>387 U.S. 167, 87 S.Ct. 1526, 18 L.Ed.2d 704 (1967) (Abbott III). These cases involved pre-enforcement challenges to regulations promulgated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. Section 301 <em>et seq., </em>seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The Court determined that there was jurisdiction in the federal courts under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act to decide cases challenging the type of agency action involved there. The Court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-5\">A further inquiry must, however, be made. The injunctive and declaratory judgment remedies are discretionary, and courts traditionally have been reluctant to apply them to administrative determinations unless these arise in the context of a controversy \u201cripe\u201d for judicial resolution. Without undertaking to survey the intricacies of the ripeness doctrine it is fair to say that its basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties. The problem is best seen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-6\"><em>Abbott </em>I, 387 U.S. at 148-49, 87 S.Ct. at 1515 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The court below considered the <em>Abbott </em>trilogy not to be directly applicable because it considered those cases applicable only to <em>pre </em>-enforcement review. The district court stated that the action before it was not a pre-enforcement review because, by the time of the opinion (though not when the original or amended complaint was filed), the enforcement action by the FTC had already begun in the District of Columbia District Court. <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>436 F.Supp. at 1024. The district court did note that the considerations stated in <em>Abbott </em>\u201capply with equal force to the instant matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1023. Also, much of the district court\u2019s analysis parallels that prescribed in <em>Abbott. </em>We conclude that <em>Abbott\u2019s </em>teachings apply to <em>extra </em>-enforcement review rather than merely to <em>pre </em>-enforcement review. Thus, the significant question is not when the instant action was filed or acted upon vis-a-vis the enforcement proceeding, but whether declaratory relief should be made available outside the channels normally provided for the challenge of agency action. Appellants also contend that the <em>Abbott </em>trilogy is inapposite because those cases dealt with \u201cripeness.\u201d The above quotation from <em>Abbott </em>does refer to ripeness, but the ultimate issue addressed is when should a court exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Because the Court in <em>Abbott </em>I explicitly found that jurisdiction existed before it proceeded to further analysis,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it was clearly not discussing ripeness in the jurisdictional sense or defining justiciability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">Since we conclude that <em>Abbott\u2019s </em>teachings are applicable here, we will proceed to discuss their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">As the above quotation from <em>Abbott </em>reveals, two primary factors must be analyzed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-13\">1. The fitness of the issues for judicial decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-14\">2. The hardship to the parties of refusing consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">The fitness of the issues for judicial decision is determined by analyzing the subsidiary issues of whether the issues are purely legal or whether they require factual development and whether there has been final agency action. Finality for this purpose is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>to be given a pragmatic definition. The hardship to the parties is determined by looking to the magnitude and immediacy of the impact likely to result from a denial of judicial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">As discussed above, appellants have made essentially three claims for declaratory relief. Each claim must be considered on its own. As to the hardship which would result from denial of judicial consideration, the harm would be the same with respect to each claim. That hardship is the severe competitive injury that could result from public dissemination of appellants\u2019 confidential documents. We cannot say that there is a great likelihood that this competitive injury would occur with any immediacy if appellants\u2019 claims are not heard by the district court. But this case is so extraordinary in terms of the breadth of the underlying investigation and the volume of documents to be sought that the magnitude of the possible injury outweighs the lack of immediacy for the purpose of our <em>Abbott </em>analysis. Although the exact number of the documents produced is not apparent on this record, the FTC\u2019s initial subpoena request was for documents numbering in the tens of millions. Respondents asserted that compliance with a modified request would require the search of hundreds of millions of document pages. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Brief, pp. 4-5. A further indication of the scope of the action here is that both the appellants\u2019 and the FTC\u2019s counsel appear to concur in the estimate that FTC action will not be heard by the ALJ until the mid-1980\u2019s and the ultimate conclusion of the proceedings will not be reached until well into the 1990\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">We therefore conclude that the extraordinary nature of the discovery here, and the resulting possibility of substantial hardship if judicial consideration at this point is denied, require the exercise of declaratory jurisdiction if the issues are fit for judicial resolution. We do not intimate that any claim for more confidential treatment of documents will meet this prong of the <em>Abbott </em>test. Only the incredible magnitude of the discovery contemplated here has brought us to our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">The FTC contends that the possible hardship just discussed is illusory because Exxon and Gulf could have intervened in the FTC\u2019s enforcement proceeding in the District of Columbia or could have refused to comply with the subpoena and thereby become party to the enforcement proceeding or finally could refuse to comply with future subpoenas<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and litigate the issues at a future enforcement proceeding. With respect to the possibility of intervention in the enforcement proceeding, we note that appellants\u2019 action was filed prior to the enforcement action. The enforcement proceeding has already been completed in the district court and is now on appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit. We think it improper to refuse to hear appellants\u2019 claims merely because they refused to abandon their action in order to intervene in a subsequently filed action. With respect to the FTC\u2019s assertion. that appellants could have refused to comply with the subpoena or can refuse to comply with a future subpoena, we deem it unfair to penalize appellants for expeditiously complying with the FTC\u2019s request. \u201cA declaratory judgment . should be granted only as a matter of judicial discretion, exercised in the public interest.\u201d <em>Eccles v. Peoples Bank of Lakewood Village, California, </em>333 U.S. 426, 431, 68 S.Ct. 641, 644, 92 L.Ed. 784 (1948). Discouraging compliance with subpoenas by making the availability of relief from inadequate protective orders <em>always </em>conditioned on refusal to comply with the subpoena would not serve the public\u2019s interest in administrative efficiency and judicial economy. Hence we refuse to alter our conclusion with respect to hardship on the basis that appellants could refuse to comply with past or future subpoenas and thereby litigate their claim in another forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Thus we reach the question of whether the issues here are fit for judicial resolution. We must therefore discuss whether the agency action here is final and whether the issues are purely legal or require factual development. The FTC has already reviewed the most crucial provision of the ALJ\u2019s protective order and we have no reason to believe that any further revision or review of the protective order is contemplated. Thus the finality requirement is met. The second question is whether the issues are purely legal or whether further factual development is necessary. With respect to appellants\u2019 first two claims (that the FTC does not have the power to provide adequate protection for their documents regardless of the terms of the order and that the particular protective order does' not, by its terms, provide adequate protection), the issues seem to be purely legal and any factual development could be easily achieved in the district court. With respect to appellants\u2019 claim that their documents could never be turned over to third persons pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, however, there is a need for further factual development that could not be obtained at this time in the district court. <em>Who </em>requests <em>which </em>document for <em>what </em>purposes may well be relevant to any final determination of this issue. Thus here, as in <em>Abbott </em>II, judicial appraisal would be on a \u201cmuch surer footing in the context of a specific application . than could be the case in the framework of the generalized challenge made here.\u201d 387 U.S. at 164, 87 S.Ct. at 1524.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, appellants\u2019 first two claims are both fit for judicial resolution and substantial hardship may result to appellants if there is no judicial consideration. Therefore, the district court did not have discretion to decline to hear the merits of these claims. With respect to the Freedom of Information Act claim, however, the issues are not sufficiently fit for judicial resolution to warrant the exercise of declaratory jurisdiction. Therefore, the district court\u2019s refusal to exercise jurisdiction to hear that claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">V. THE ISSUES ON REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">We have already noted that appellants should not be penalized for complying with the subpoena. Neither, however, should they be given an advantage in challenging the protections provided by the FTC. Appellants\u2019 claims should be considered under the same test in the district court on remand as they would in an enforcement proceeding. The Supreme Court, in <em>FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. 279, 85 S.Ct. 1459, 14 L.Ed.2d 383 (1965), has made it abundantly clear that it is within the discretion of an agency to determine what protection must be given the confidential information it receives in the course of its investigations. A court cannot impose its own set of protections unless the agency abused its discretion in determining what protection was necessary. The FTC concluded here that the terms of its protective order provided adequate protection for appellants\u2019 documents. It also concluded that the available sanctions, including the criminal penalty imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 on employees of the federal government for disclosure of confidential information are adequate to enforce that protective order. The district court on remand must determine whether the FTC abused its discretion in reaching those conclusions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Otherwise, under <em>Schreiber, </em>there would be no basis for judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>In affirming the dismissal of the Freedom of Information Act claim, we do not prevent the district court from considering whether the FTC\u2019s protective order provides for adequate notice to appellants prior to the turning over of their documents pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request. This question relates to the adequacy of the FTC order and therefore will be properly before the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed insofar as it dismissed the Freedom of Information Act claim and will be reversed insofar as it dismissed the claims pertaining to the adequacy of the terms of the FTC\u2019s protective order and the adequacy of the FTC\u2019s enforcement mechanisms. We will remand for the district court to decide these last two issues in accordance with the discussion set forth in this opinion. We, of course, do not intend to limit the district court\u2019s discretionary power to transfer or consolidate the remanded portion of this action with the enforcement action commenced by the FTC in the District of Columbia<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> if such transfer or consolidation appears desirable and feasible. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-14\">. <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Celebrezze, </em>228 F.Supp. 855 (D.Del.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b994-7\">. The difference between the first two claims for relief is illustrated by the following examples. If the protective order provided that confidential documents could be turned over to a third party without requiring any notice to appellants\u2019 counsel and if the ALJ were somehow given the contempt powers now possessed by district courts, it might be argued that the terms of the protective order were inadequate [claim 2] but the enforcement mechanisms would be clearly adequate [claim 1], If, however, the order provided that documents could only be turned over after appellants\u2019 counsel had given their consent in writing, but a person who violated that order was only subject to a civil penalty of $25, there would be little basis for appellants to challenge the terms of the protective order [claim 2], but the enforcement mechanisms would be clearly inadequate [claim 1], Ultimately, of course, both claims relate to the adequacy of the protection being afforded appellants\u2019 documents, but each claim refers to a different aspect of that protection and, therefore, the two are properly analyzed separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b994-14\">. <em>See, e. g., Beacon Construction Co. v.

The FTC issued new subpoenas on January 12, 1978. Motions to quash these subpoenas were denied by the ALJ per his order of September 8, 1978. The ALJ did order certain modifications of those subpoenas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b997-5\">. The Supreme Court held, in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978), that witnesses\u2019 statements in pending unfair labor practice proceedings are exempt under the Freedom of Information Act and that such determination need not be made on a case-by-case basis. Since the category of requests involved there was much narrower than that here, that decision does not affect our conclusion that case-by-case determination of Freedom of Information Act claims is necessary here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b997-11\">. The District of Columbia District Court has already ruled that there has been no such abuse of discretion. <em>FTC v. Anderson, supra. </em>Appellants here, of course, were not parties to that action and are therefore not bound by the ruling there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b998-7\">. <em>FTC v.

After this opinion was drafted, counsel for the FTC forwarded to the court copies of the opinions in the following cases: <em>Exxon Corp. v.

Counsel for Exxon forwarded to the court a copy of the opinion in the case, <em>Wearly v. </em>FTC, _ F.Supp. _ No. 77-1860 (D.N.J.October 18, 1978).
