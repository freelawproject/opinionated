The pertinent portion of that section renders criminally culpable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">Whoever has in his control, custody, or possession any plate, stone, or other thing in any manner made after or in the similitude of any plate, stone, or other thing, from which any such obligation or other security has been printed,' with intent to use such plate, stone, or other thing, or to suffer the same to be used in forging or counterfeiting any such obligation or other security, or any part thereof .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">Defendant appeals, asserting that a violation of \u00a7 474 was not established because a photographic negative is not a \u201cthing\u201d within the proscription of the statute, and even if a \u201cthing,\u201d the negatives were not shown to have been used to produce counterfeit currency. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">Defendant\u2019s argument that a photographic negative is not a thing proceeds from the premise that, in accordance with the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201cplate\u201d and \u201cstone\u201d as used in the statute create a category which does not include photographic negatives since counterfeit currency cannot be printed directly from them. We reject the argument. We agree with the decision in <em>United States v. Lustig, </em>159 F.2d 798 (3 Cir. 1947), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>338 U.S. 74, 69 S.Ct. 1372, 93 L.Ed. 1819 (1949), which considered the predecessor of present \u00a7 474 and held that the words \u201cplate\u201d and \u201cstone\u201d do not imply that \u201cother things\u201d must be metallic or heavy or elaborate but rather \u201cthe intent of the statute fairly includes all devices by which counterfeit currency may be made.\u201d 159 F.2d at 801. Since it was stipulated that the negatives could be used as part of the overall process of the manufacture of counterfeit currency, we think that this test was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>satisfied and they were \u201cthings\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We do not construe \u00a7 474 to require proof that the \u201cthing\u201d possessed must have been used to print counterfeit currency before a conviction under the statute can be sustained. We reject defendant\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cfrom which any such obligation or other security has been printed\u201d modifies the first reference to \u201cplate, stone, or other thing\u201d rather than the second such reference. For the reasons assigned by the district court, such a construction would render the statute meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In short, we rely on and adopt the opinion of the district court. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>446 F.Supp. 236 (D.Md.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
