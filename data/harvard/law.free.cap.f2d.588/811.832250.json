It found that \u201c[t]he purchasers and prospective purchasers of these goods are obviously aware of the function and characteristics of applicant\u2019s badges.\u201d After considering the nature of the goods and the context in which the mark was used (particularly the advertising literature), it concluded that GASBADGE \u201cleaves nothing for speculation or conjecture\u201d and that \u201c[t]he term immediately and unequivocally describes the purpose and function of applicant\u2019s goods.\u201d It, therefore, held that GAS-BADGE is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d and not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">Citing <em>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>295 F.Supp. 479, 487, 160 USPQ 777, 784 (S.D.N.Y.1968), appellant argues that the proper test for determining mere descriptiveness is whether the mark conveys forthwith an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities, or characteristics of the goods \u201cto the ultimate consumer, who has never seen the product and does not know what it is.\u201d It contends that GASBADGE does not satisfy this test, because: (1) the mark \u201cdoes not convey any idea of the ingredients, qualities, or characteristics of the goods,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the mark is not descriptive; and (2) the mark does not convey such an idea forthwith and immediately, and examination and study of appellant\u2019s literature is required to reach a conclusion regarding the nature of appellant\u2019s goods. Alternatively, appellant contends that, assuming the mark . describes the goods, the mark is not \u201cmerely descriptive,\u201d since considerable thought (over a period of time) is required to arrive at a conclusion regarding the nature of the goods. Appellant also argues that certain third-party registrations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were not given full consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The solicitor agrees with the test used by the board and contends that determination of whether a mark is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d requires consideration of the mark as it is applied to the goods, and not in the abstract as proposed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Marks which are \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of the goods or services have long been denied protection. The Supreme Court, in <em>Beckwith v. Commissioner, </em>252 U.S. 538, 543, 40 S.Ct. 414, 416, 64 L.Ed. 705 (1920), said that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-7\">the law would not secure to any person the exclusive use of a trade-mark consisting merely of words descriptive of the qualities, ingredients or characteristics of an article of trade; this for the reason that the function of a trade-mark is to point distinctively, either by its own meaning or by association, to the origin or ownership of the wares to which it is applied, and words merely descriptive of qualities, ingredients or characteristics, when used alone, do not do this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The major reasons for not protecting such marks are: (1) to prevent the owner of a mark from inhibiting competition in the sale of particular goods; and (2) to maintain freedom of the public to use the language involved, thus avoiding the possibility of harassing infringement suits by the registrant against others who use the mark when advertising or describing their own products. <em>Armour &amp; Co. v. Organon Inc., </em>245 F.2d 495, 498 and 500, 44 Cust.Pat.App. 1010, 1014 and 1016, 114 USPQ 334, 337 and 338 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">The Lanham Act incorporates the common law proscription against \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d marks in section 2(e)(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-16\">No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-17\">(e) Consists of a mark which, (1) when applied to the goods of the applicant is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">Various tests have been used in determining whether a mark is \u201cmerely descriptive.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In early cases the Supreme Court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> considered whether the mark describes the ingredients, qualities, or characteristics of the goods. This court has applied the same test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It has also looked to whether the mark conveys information regarding a function, or purpose, or use of the goods.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Other considerations include whether the mark describes a feature or part of the goods<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and whether it conveys information about any properties of the goods.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although a mark may be generally descriptive, if it also functions as an indication of origin, it is not \u201cmerely descriptive.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>We note that the Seventh Circuit, in <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 379, 188 USPQ 623, 635, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94, 191 USPQ 416 (1976), quoted A. Seidel, S. Dalroff &amp; E. Gonda, <em>Trademark Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 406, at 77 (1963), for what it regarded as the best statement of the distinction between a descriptive and suggestive mark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-4\">\u201cGenerally speaking, if the mark imparts information directly, it is descriptive. If it stands for an idea which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods, it is suggestive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">This is similar to appellant\u2019s alternate proposed test. It is also similar to the test approved by the Second Circuit in <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 11, 189 USPQ 759, 765 (CA 2 1976), namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">A term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the goods. A term is descriptive if it forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the goods.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In <em>In re American Society of Clinical Pathologists, </em>442 F.2d 1404, 1407, 58 CCPA 1240, 1243, 169 USPQ 800, 801 (1971), this court impliedly approved this test by stating that the service mark involved was \u201cmerely descriptive,\u201d since it \u201cwould immediately convey to one seeing or hearing it the thought of appellant\u2019s services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">However, implicit in this test is the requirement that descriptiveness of a mark, when applied to the goods or services involved, is to be determined from the standpoint of <em>the average prospective purchaser.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> In re Andes Candies, Inc., </em>478 F.2d 1264, 178 USPQ 156 (CCPA 1973); <em>In re Automatic Radio Manufacturing, </em>404 F.2d 1391, 56 CCPA 817, 160 USPQ 233 (1969); <em>Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co., </em>294 F.2d 694, 699, 131 USPQ 55, 60 (CA 2 1961). <em>See </em>E. Vandenburg, <em>Trademark Law and Procedure, supra </em>note 12, at 92-93. Evidence of the context in which a mark is used on labels, packages, or in advertising material directed to the goods is probative of the reaction of prospective purchasers to the mark. <em>In re American Society of Clinical Pathologists, supra. See In re Thunderbird Products Corp., </em>406 F.2d 1389, 56 CCPA 969, 160 USPQ 730 (1969). To hold otherwise would be to separate the concept of the average prospective purchaser from the world of reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Appellant\u2019s proposed abstract test is deficient \u2014 not only in denying consideration of evidence of the advertising materials directed to its goods, but in failing to require consideration of its mark \u201cwhen applied to the goods\u201d as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Considering appellant\u2019s trademark GASBADGE when applied to appellant\u2019s goods and considering further the record evidence of appellant\u2019s advertising materials to which the average prospective purchaser is presumed to have been exposed, which clearly identify the gaseous pollutants collection function of appellant\u2019s device and its use in determining personal exposure to such pollutants, leaving nothing for the exercise of imagination when viewing the mark,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we agree with the board that the term GASBADGE immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and unequivocally describes the purpose and function of appellant\u2019s goods.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Accordingly, we hold that GASBADGE is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d for purposes of section 2(e)(1) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AeJ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-9\">.

The perception of the mark to nonprospective purchasers would be irrelevant, because a mark primarily functions to indicate a single quality control source of the goods or services involved, and this is meaningful only to prospective purchasers or patrons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b908-15\">. Conceivably, a \u201cgas badge\u201d could be designed to detect the danger of a gaseous explosion in an area unoccupied by personnel, but such a device is clearly excluded by appellant\u2019s advertising.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b909-10\">. We note that the board did not rest its decision on the ground that GASBADGE is the shortened form of the <em>name </em>GAS MONITORING BADGE. If the board believed that the term was the name for the goods, it would have so held. Also, it is not for this court to indulge in speculation that at some future time the public will inevitably so regard the term. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.064(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b909-7\">RICH, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVd\">concurring, with whom MARKEY, Chief Judge, joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">For all the majority\u2019s extensive review and discussion of various \u201ctests,\u201d propounded from time to time in various places, for determining \u00a7 2(e)(1) descriptiveness, the opinion fails to state why I believe GAS-BADGE is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">My reasoning is very simple and requires no application of an elusive test. The ultimate in descriptiveness is the <em>name </em>of a thing. Weiss <em>Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel &amp; Specialty Co., </em>290 F.2d 845, 48 CCPA 1004, 129 USPQ 411 (1961); <em>In re Cooper, </em>254 F.2d 611, 45 CCPA 923, 177 USPQ 396 (1958). The description of the goods for which GASBADGE is sought to be registered, set forth as the single item of goods named in the application, is \u201cchemically treated badge to determine and to monitor the amount of personal exposure of an individual to gaseous pollutants.\u201d This, of course, is a wordy explanation which does not qualify as a <em>name </em>in the usual sense of the word. So, what is the name of this article? Appellant\u2019s own descriptive literature of record in the PTO provides the answer. The name is \u201cGas Monitoring Badge.\u201d This may be regarded as the <em>full </em>name. However, the users of language have a universal habit of shortening full names \u2014 from haste or laziness or just economy of words. Examples are: automobile to auto, telephone to phone, necktie to tie, gasoline service station to gas station. I regard it as <em>inevitable </em>that a gas monitoring badge will be called a gas badge as the name of the goods to the same extent as gas monitoring badge is the name and for that reason, and without application of some textwriter\u2019s \u201ctest,\u201d deduced from some case having dissimilar facts, I find it \u201cmerely descriptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Appellant\u2019s brief, I note, never comes to grips with this realistic analysis and seems pointedly to avoid discussion of the name of the object to which the mark is applied. The argument is devoted mostly to discussion of other cases which, we have repeatedly said, are of very little value in solving trademark registration problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Furthermore, nearly a half century of dealing with trademark problems persuades me that \u201cdescriptiveness,\u201d \u201cmere\u201d or otherwise, is a many-faceted question which must be decided on a case-by-case basis. I do not believe it is possible to devise any universally applicable test for determining the multifarious problems which arise under \u00a7 2(e) and (f). I note particularly that there is a big difference between a case involving the name of a thing and a case involving a mark which describes or suggests some function, ingredient, quality, or characteristic of the thing. We have here a name problem and I see no point in discussing cases of other types, which are without value as precedents, or other unhelpful generalities. It is not the function of an opinion to write a treatise but to explain why an issue is decided as it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">The majority does not appear to read the board opinion as I do. (See footnote 17). While the board did not use the word \u201cname\u201d in its opinion, it used its equivalent \u2014\u201cappellation.\u201d It noted that the specimen labels \u201cdisplay the notation \u2018WALDEN\u2019 and the notation \u2018GASBADGE\u2019 \u201d and then it immediately pointed out that the labels contain \u201cno generic appellation for the goods * * To me that is equivalent to saying that GASBADGE is the <em>only </em>\u201cappellation\u201d appearing on the labels, espe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>dally when taken with the balance of the opinion which points out that the article is a <em>badge </em>and that it monitors <em>gas. </em>I think it is not speculating to say that the present name of the article is \u201cGASBADGE\u201d and I think I am not departing from the board\u2019s ground of refusal just because the board chose to say the mark is \u201cmerely descriptive.\u201d All names of articles are just that and always within the proscription of \u00a7 2(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The board also said in its conclusion, \u201c \u2018GASBADGE\u2019 leaves nothing for speculation or conjecture. The term immediately and unequivocally describes the purpose and function of appellant\u2019s goods.\u201d That is what <em>names </em>do. They tell you what the thing <em>is. </em>I am sure the board believed GASBADGE to be a name \u2014 in fact, a \u201cgeneric\u201d name in the sense in which trademark lawyers use that term.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b910-6\">BALDWIN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANz\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">I agree with both the analysis and result reached in the majority opinion and accordingly join therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">It appears to me that the mark for which registration is sought not only describes the purpose and function of appellant\u2019s goods, but <em>is </em>also the name of the goods.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
