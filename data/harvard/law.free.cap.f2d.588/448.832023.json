As to his allegation of insufficiency of evidence to convict him, the issue was decided adversely to appellant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>direct appeal and need not be considered again.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">However, appellant\u2019s retained counsel failed to file a petition for certiorari after we affirmed his conviction on direct appeal, 525 F.2d 1406 (5 Cir. 1975), despite counsel\u2019s acknowledgment that he failed to file the petition for certiorari in time and his promise that he would file a motion to file one out of time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As was done in <em>Lacaze v. United States, </em>457 F.2d 1075 (5 Cir. 1972), in which retained counsel likewise failed to file a petition for certiorari, and in <em>Savage v. United States, </em>483 F.2d 67 (5 Cir. 1973), a case involving appointed counsel, we recall our mandate in appellant\u2019s direct criminal appeal, cited above, and direct the issuance of a new mandate affirming our prior affirmance of the judgment of conviction. Appellant Ordonez is hereby advised of his renewed right to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari to review this court\u2019s affirmance of his direct appeal. Since Ordonez has proceeded without counsel in this <em>forma pauperis </em>appeal, we also order appointment of counsel to assist him in prosecution of his petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The original judgment of this court on direct appeal is vacated and a new judgment is entered reaffirming the judgment of conviction, and counsel for appellant is ordered to be appointed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">. Appellant has attached to his application to this court a Xerox copy from his counsel, Richard E. Haynes, Laredo, Texas, to this effect, in support of the allegation made in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
