The defendants shall also give Mr. Alexander preference over any white applicants with equal qualifications for any future vacancy which occurs at the Etowah High School in the Athletic Director or head football coach position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">In July 1976 control of Etowah High School was transferred to the Attalla City Board of Education. The defendant city board thus assumed responsibilities arising out of the prior consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">The present appeal'is from the judgment of the district court in a proceeding initiated on February 2, 1978, by the city bo,ard. The board petitioned for permission to hire Mr. Charles Randall Hearn rather than Mr. Alexander as head football coach of Etowah High School. Following a hearing on February 25, 1978, the district court entered judgment granting the permission sought by the school board. Plaintiff-intervenor, National Education Association, took this appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">Appellant relies primarily on the rule of <em>Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, </em>419 F.2d 1211 (5th Cir.) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, </em>396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477 (1970), and its progeny that when there has been a professional staff reduction in a school district as a result of desegregation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzK\">no staff vacancy may be filled through recruitment of a person of a race, color, or national origin different from that of the individual dismissed or demoted, until each displaced staff member who is qualified has had an opportunity to fill the vacancy and has failed to accept an offer to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-15\"><em>Singleton, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 1218. Apparently Mr. Alexander had been displaced at an all black school at which he had coached both football and basketball. The question, however, is not whether the <em>Singleton </em>rule would control if this matter were before the court for the first time. Application of <em>Singleton </em>in this case would turn the pages of history back too far. Mr. Alexander\u2019s rights were resolved in 1975 by consent of the parties. By the 1975 consent judgment Mr. Alexander was awarded the head basketball coaching position at Etowah High School. He was also awarded a preference for a second position over any other applicant of equal or lesser qualifications. In the findings now before us the district court correctly stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-16\">The Court, of course, is to ultimately make this decision based upon the agreement that was entered into between the parties back in 1975, .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">The question before the district court was simply whether defendant board showed that Mr. Hearn\u2019s qualifications exceeded those of Mr. Alexander. The scope of our review is limited to whether the trial court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous. <em>Lee v. Russell County Board of Education, </em>563 F.2d 1159 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Jennings v. Me</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>ridian Municipal Separate School District, </em>453 F.2d 413 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">When the previous football coach retired and the position became vacant defendant board solicited applications and received ten or twelve of them. It contends that it applied the following criteria: (1) the educational background of the applicants, (2) the type of certificate possessed by each applicant, (3) the applicant\u2019s total experience in education, (4) the applicant\u2019s experience as a head football coach, (5) the win-loss record of the applicant, and (6) the applicant\u2019s experience at the college level.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Hearn has a bachelor\u2019s degree in secondary education with a major in health and physical education, a master\u2019s degree in physical education, a second master\u2019s degree in school administration and thirty-six hours toward a PhD degree. Mr. Alexander has a bachelor\u2019s degree in social studies with only a minor in physical education, and a master\u2019s degree in school administration. Mr. Hearn has a AA certificate, the highest certificate awarded in the Alabama educational system. Mr. Alexander\u2019s certificate is a Class A certificate. The two applicants\u2019 total experience in education is about the same. Mr. Hearn has twenty-five years, and Mr. Alexander twenty-three. As a head coach, however, Mr. Hearn has nineteen years of experience, but Mr. Alexander has only ten or eleven. Mr. Hearn showed a positive win-loss record; Mr. Alexander\u2019s win-loss record was not shown. Mr. Hearn has coaching experience at the college level. Mr. Alexander has none.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">During his coaching career Mr. Hearn had been Alabama High School Athletic Association Coach of the Year for two years and was head coach of the state association\u2019s All-Star team in another year.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Appellant contends that the criteria utilized by the defendant city board were tailored to Mr. Hearn\u2019s qualifications and that it totally ignored other mandatory criteria including experience within the system. Appellant relies on <em>United States v. Texas Education Agency, </em>459 F.2d 600 (5th Cir. 1972), but that case does not support the contention advanced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The trial court reaffirmed that the requirements of the 1975 consent decree remain in full force and effect. It held, however, that while Mr. Alexander is well qualified for the vacancy, Mr. Hearn \u201cnot only is well qualified, but exceptionally well qualified,\u201d and that \u201cthe board has in fact found someone who is better qualified than is Mr. Alexander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">The district court has correctly addressed the controlling question, and appellant has failed to demonstrate that its findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">. For the guidance of the district court and the parties our opinion in <em>Texas Education Agency, supra, </em>incorporated as appendices A, B and C three examples of objective, nonracial and reasonable criteria which previously had been adopted by other school systems or proposed by the United States. Appendix A (the Chilton, and Colbert Counties and Muscle Shoals criteria) contains the specific criteria to which appellant points. Appendix B (the Bullock County criteria) and Appendix C (the proposal of the United States) do not. All three are presented for illustrative purposes only. To contend that specific items in one of the examples were held to be mandatory in all cases is contrary to the clear meaning of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
