We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-26\">By its terms, \u00a7 922(h)(1) does not require proof of knowledge on the part of the defendant as to the maximum penalty which might have been imposed on the charge made in a pending indictment or on a past conviction. By contrast, other portions of \u00a7 922 require either proof of knowledge on the part of a defendant in order to establish their violation, <em>see </em>\u00a7 922(a)(6), (e), (k), (1) and (m), or proof of knowledge or reasonable cause to believe, <em>see </em>\u00a7 922(a)(5), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (f), (i), and (j). In two cases which have considered the extent of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>necessary to show a violation of \u00a7 922(h)(1), it has been held that scienter is not an element of the crime and Congress did not make ignorance of the law a defense in a prosecution under \u00a7 922(h). <em>See United States v. Thrasher, </em>569 F.2d 894, 895 (5 Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Turcotte, </em>558 F.2d 893, 896 (8 Cir. 1977). <em>But see United States v. Renner, </em>496 F.2d 922 (6 Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We are persuaded by <em>Thrasher </em>and <em>Turcotte </em>and follow them. Additionally, we think that <em>Renner </em>is distinguishable. It held that knowledge of a pending indictment need be proved when the fact making receipt of a firearm illegal was the pendency of an indictment charging the violation of a crime punishable by a term exceeding one year. The rationale of <em>Renner </em>is the manifest unfairness of convicting a defendant when the indictment may be unserved or when, under the practice in some states, it may have been dismissed, but with leave to reinstate it. 496 F.2d at 926-27. That rationale is inapplicable here; the previous conviction was bound to be known by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-16\"> Section 922(h)(1), in pertinent part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-17\">It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ5\">(1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-27\">to receive any firearm . . . which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
