WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">In these consolidated cases, Ford Motor Credit Corporation (Ford Credit) and several Ford dealers appeal from adverse judgments finding that they violated provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq. </em>(1976) (Act) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 <em>et seq. </em>(1978) (Regulation Z).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Milhollin cross appeals from a limitation of Ford Credit\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Although plaintiffs below (Consumers) allege a number of violations, we need to decide only two issues common to the above cases and one issue raised by the Milhollins:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">(1) Whether Ford Credit was clearly identified as a creditor on the face of the contract;</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">(2) Whether it is necessary to disclose an acceleration clause on the face of the contract; and</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">(3) Whether an inadequate disclosure made to a husband and wife as joint obligors results in a multiple recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Ford Credit, wholly owned by the Ford Motor Company, provides financing for Ford dealers by extending operating and inventory loans and by purchasing retail installment contracts for the sale of automobiles by dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">A Ford Credit booklet explains its program to dealers and gives guidelines for drafting contracts it is willing to purchase. It also provides forms of credit applications, contracts and rate charts for calculating finance charges. Use of the supplied forms is not mandatory, and Ford Credit purchases contracts on other agreement forms. Many dealers disregard the suggested rate charts and develop their own finance charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">Dealers negotiate all terms of contracts directly with customers, including the interest rate. Contracts are typically assigned shortly after sales are consummated. Although Ford Credit normally is unaware of any specific sale until the contract is proffered for assignment, dealers may get prior approval for customers with marginal credit ratings.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">Ford Credit is not obligated to purchase any contracts from dealers, but usually rejects only a small percentage of those offered. It pays dealers cash for the contracts less its discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-19\">Each dealer here has assigned the great majority of its contracts to Ford Credit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly after each sale Ford Credit purchased the contract, notified the buyer, and provided him a payment book. Consumers made subsequent payments to Ford Credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-21\">DISCLOSURE OF FORD CREDIT AS A CREDITOR</p>\n<p id=\"b849-22\">In each of these cases, the district court found that Ford Credit was not clearly identified as a creditor on the face of the contract, and that this nondisclosure violated the Act and Regulation Z. To uphold the district court, we must conclude that (a) the identity of each creditor is a required disclosure under the Act or Regulation Z; (b) Ford Credit is a creditor in these transactions within the meaning of the Act; and (c) Ford Credit\u2019s status as a creditor was not adequately disclosed on the face of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-25\">Consumers maintain that Regulation Z requires the disclosure of each creditor to a transaction on the face of the contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>number of courts have agreed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consumers also interpret a Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretation of Regulation Z to require disclosure of each creditor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ford Credit reads the Official Interpretation narrowly to reach an opposite result.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Consumers allege that Ford Credit is a creditor within the meaning of the Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because it extended credit directly to them, using the dealers merely as a means to arrange for the credit. Ford Credit argues that it was a subsequent assignee of the retail installment contract, extending only commercial credit to the dealers. It cites the apparently different treatment accorded an \u201coriginal creditor\u201d and a \u201csubsequent assignee\u201d in various sections of the Act as evidence that Congress did not intend subsequent assignees to be subject to the same disclosure requirements as creditors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consumers respond by citing cases that, in certain circumstances, equate subsequent assignees with creditors for disclosure purposes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">For our purposes it is unnecessary to decide whether the identification of each creditor is a required disclosure or if Ford Credit is a creditor of Consumers. Assuming an affirmative answer to these questions, we conclude that the status of Ford Credit, even if it is as a creditor, was adequately disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>On the face of each contract, opposite the signature of Consumers, appears the following disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">The foregoing contract hereby is accepted by the Seller and assigned to Ford Motor Credit Company in accordance with the terms of the assignment set forth on the reverse side hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">Seller_1_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">By_ Title_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Consumers argue that the terms of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6(d) (1978), which provide that \u201ceach creditor . . . shall be clearly identified,\u201d are not met by disclosing that Ford Credit would be an assignee of the contract. They apparently argue that, because the precise word \u201ccreditor\u201d was not used in describing Ford Credit\u2019s prospective involvement in the transaction, the Act was violated. We disagree. Nowhere does Regulation Z require use of the word \u201ccreditor.\u201d Here, the exact role that Ford Credit ultimately played in each transaction was clearly disclosed. Requiring Ford Credit to use the word \u201ccreditor\u201d would not have given Consumers additional information nor better served the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">In <em>Main v. Faller Ford, Inc., </em>Civil Action No. 74-337 (W.D.Pa. Apr. 22, 1976), the court held that an identical statement satisfied the creditor disclosure requirements of Regulation Z:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-11\">Whether Ford Credit may be described as the term is used in [12 C.F.R.] \u00a7 226.-6(d) need not be decided in this factual context because to require such a disclosure by Ford Credit on a separate piece of paper would not be a meaningful disclosure nor would it further the goals of the Truth-In-Lending Act. Ford Credit was accurately described in the contract as the assignee and it is undisputed that plaintiff personally understood that Ford Credit would actually extend her credit and consequently be the recipient of her monthly installment payments. . To require Ford Credit to also disclose to plaintiff that it was also a \u201ccreditor\u201d within the Act would be a meaningless and needless exercise providing plaintiff with duplicative information, and such duplication cannot be justified by the Act\u2019s purpose nor by the practical considerations of these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-15\"><em>Accord, Sharp v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>452 F.Supp. 465 (S.D.Ill.1978) (appeal pending); <em>Antonio v. Canal Motors, Inc., </em>Civil Action No. 74-3163 (E.D.La. Nov. 18,1977) (appeal pending); <em>Augusta v. Marshall Motor Co., </em>453 F.Supp. 912 (N.D.Ohio 1977) (appeal pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">We agree with the reasoning in <em>Main </em>and hold that the district court erred in finding that Ford Credit was not adequately identified as a creditor on the face of the contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-18\">DISCLOSURE OF AN ACCELERATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b851-19\">The reverse side of each contract contained an acceleration clause that did not explain the effect of acceleration on unearned interest. Ford Credit maintains that its uniform practice, although not explicitly disclosed, is to rebate unearned interest to the customer upon acceleration in the same manner as that following a voluntary prepayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">This court faced a similar situation in <em>St. Germaine v. Bank of Hawaii, </em>573 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. 1977). We held there that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-21\">[t]he creditor must disclose whether a rebate of unearned interest will be made upon acceleration and also disclose the method by which the amount of unearned interest will be computed if the debt-is accelerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-22\"><em>Id. </em>at 577. Failure to make these disclosures is a violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-23\">In <em>Milhollin, </em>the district court concluded on different grounds than those stated in <em>St. Germaine </em>that failure to disclose the acceleration clause on the face of the contract was a violation of the Act. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>held, however, that it would result in liability only after the decision in <em>Woods v. Beneficial Finance Co. of Eugene, </em>395 F.Supp. 9 (D.Or.1975), the first Oregon case recognizing this nondisclosure as a violation. In so holding, the district court exceeded its authority because \u201c[t]he application of doctrines limiting the retroactivity of judicial decisions is restricted to appellate courts.\u201d <em>Kessler v. Associates Financial Service Co., </em>573 F.2d 577, 579 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">We hold on the basis of <em>St. Germaine </em>that Ford Credit is liable to the Milhollins for failure to disclose the acceleration clause and its effect on unearned interest on the face of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">RECOVERY FOR INADEQUATE DISCLOSURE BY JOINT OBLIGORS</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">At the time of the transaction in <em>Milhollin, </em>plaintiffs were husband and wife. Both signed the retail installment contract, making them jointly and severally liable for the full debt under Oregon law. They allege that the district court erred in limiting them as joint obligors to one recovery for violations under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-9\">[A]ny creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this part . with respect to <em>any person </em>is liable to <em>such person </em>in an amount equal to the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">(2)(A)(i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge <em>in connection with the transaction ., </em>except that <em>the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000 .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a) (1976). The first quoted words emphasized, \u201cany person\u201d and \u201csuch person,\u201d suggest that each joint obligor is entitled to a separate recovery. The emphasized words in the second paragraph, however, suggest that the liability for any single transaction is limited to $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">The circuits have split on this issue. The Fifth and Seventh Circuits have concluded that a husband and wife as joint obligors are entitled to separate recoveries. <em>Davis v. United Companies Mortgage &amp; Inv. of Gretna, Inc., </em>551 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Mirabal v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>537 F.2d 871, 881-83 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>Allen v. Beneficial Finance Co. of Gary, </em>531 F.2d 797, 805-06 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 885, 97 S.Ct. 237, 50 L.Ed.2d 166 (1976). The Fourth Circuit reached the opposite result in <em>Powers v. Sims and Levin, </em>542 F.2d 1216, 1219-20 (4th Cir. 1976), in which the court limited the recovery of husband and wife as joint obligors to one penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">We believe that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach more closely reflects the intent of Congress. The applicable legislative history states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\">Any creditor failing to disclose required information would be subject to a civil suit with a penalty equal to twice the finance charge, with a minimum penalty of $100 and a <em>maximum penalty not to exceed $1,000 on any individual credit transaction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">H.R.Rep.No.1040, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., [1968] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1962, 1976 (emphasis added). The Milhollins, although joint obligors, entered into one credit transaction with the dealer and Ford Credit. They are entitled to one recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">Because the district court in <em>Andresen </em>and <em>Messinger </em>concluded Ford Credit violated the Act only on the basis of an inadequate disclosure of its creditor status, a conclusion we reject, we remand those cases for a consideration of other alleged violations of the Act not treated by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-19\">Although the district court in <em>Milhollin </em>found liability on the ground used in <em>Andre-sen </em>and <em>Messinger, </em>it also concluded Ford Credit violated the Act by failing to disclose an acceleration clause on the face of the contract. In light of <em>St. Germaine, </em>we disa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>gree with the rationale used by the court, but hold on other grounds that Ford Credit violated the Act by failing to disclose an acceleration clause and its effect on unearned interest. We also disagree with the court\u2019s prospective application of <em>Woods, </em>and hold that Ford Credit is liable to the Milhollins for its nondisclosure. As joint obligors, they are entitled to only one recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">We affirm the holding of the district court in <em>Eaton, </em>again under a different rationale,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on the basis of Ford Credit\u2019s failure to disclose an acceleration clause and its effect on unearned interest on the face of the contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-19\">. Sections of Regulation Z cited here have remained the same in all relevant respects since these actions arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\">. These are the facts common to all above cases. Facts unique to a single case are presented later in the text, as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-14\">. In <em>Messinger, </em>of 600 to 700 contracts assigned six months prior to and six months after the transaction with the plaintiff, the dealer assigned all but 100 to Ford Credit. The dealer in <em>Andresen </em>assigned 90% of its contracts to Ford Credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-15\">. Regulation Z provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-16\"><em>\u201cGeneral rule. </em>Any creditor when extending credit other than open end credit shall, in accordance with \u00a7 226.6 and to the extent applicable, make the disclosures required by this section with respect to any transaction consummated on or after July 1, 1969. . . [S]uch disclosures shall be made before the transaction is consummated. At the time disclosures are made, <em>the creditor shall furnish the customer with a duplicate of the instrument or a statement by which the required disclosures are made and on which the creditor is identified.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-28\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(a) (1978) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-29\"><em>\u201cMultiple creditors or lessors; joint disclosure. </em>If there is more than one creditor or lessor in a transaction, <em>each creditor or lessor shall be clearly identified </em>and shall be responsible for making only those disclosures required by this Part which are within his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>knowledge and the purview of his relationship with the customer or lessee.
