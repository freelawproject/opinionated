Plaintiffs, all citizens and residents of the Commonwealth, were injured in a collision with another car owned by Vicks Corporation, a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Puerto Rico. The automobile was operated by one of Vicks\u2019 employees, W. L. Venable, citizen and resident of North Carolina. The named defendant is Hartford Insurance Company, whose state of incorporation and principal place of business is Connecticut. There was in effect at the time of the accident a liability policy covering Vicks as the <em>named </em>insured and employees such as Venable under the <em>omnibus </em>or <em>other </em>insured clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">Plaintiff brought suit against Hartford only under Puerto Rico\u2019s direct action statute, 26 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 2003, which permits suits directly against an insurance company without joining the named insured or the alleged tort-feasor. The district court dismissed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c), for lack of jurisdiction, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">The section 1332(c) amendment to the diversity jurisdiction statute was a direct response to the fact that \u201cdirect action\u201d statutes in Louisiana and Wisconsin had inundated the federal district courts there with diversity cases arising out of automobile accidents involving citizens of the same state. Since the named defendant was an insurance company with its state of incorporation and principal place of business far removed from the' state of the accident, diversity jurisdiction was created and the federal district courts in Louisiana and Wisconsin flooded with cases which normally would have been handled in the state courts. The purpose of the amendment was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkC\">to eliminate under the diversity jurisdiction of the U.S. distinct courts, suits on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>certain tort claims in which both parties are local residents, but which, under a State \u201cdirect action\u201d statute, may be brought directly against a foreign insurance carrier without joining the local tort-feasor as a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">S.Rep.No.1308, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1964] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2778, 2778-79. <em>See </em>13 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 3629 at 830-31 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The question of whether the word \u201cinsured\u201d in section 1332(c) includes a person covered under the <em>omnibus </em>clause has been answered in the affirmative by the courts that have considered it. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Company, </em>468 F.2d 1207 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Anderson v. Phoenix of Hartford Insurance Company, </em>320 F.Supp. 399 (W.D.La.1970), <em>affirmed, </em>No. 71-1295 (5th Cir. July 8, 1971); <em>Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Le Bleu, </em>272 F.Supp. 421 (E.D.La.1967). In the light of the reason for the statute and its explicit congressional history, the only logical conclusion is that the word \u201cinsured\u201d includes any alleged tort-feasor covered by the policy under the <em>omnibus </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The question, therefore, is whether the citizenship of the named insured, Vicks, or the <em>omnibus </em>insured, Venable, is attributed to the insurance carrier. Appellant argues that, since the tort-feasor was a citizen of North Carolina, not Puerto Rico, there is diversity jurisdiction. This approach blithely ignores the fact that the action was brought by plaintiffs against Hartford. It is true, as appellants point out, that, if suit had been brought against Venable, there would have been no jurisdictional obstacle. The short answer is that plaintiffs chose to sue Hartford, not the driver of the ear. Under Puerto Rican law, plaintiffs had three target defendants: Hartford, under the direct action statute; Vicks; and/or its employee, Venable. The advantages of having a large insurance carrier as a named defendant are obvious, but once the choice is made, the consequences cannot be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">It is clear that section 1332(c) restricts jurisdiction. Its provision for multiple citizenship of the insurer was designed to restrict diversity jurisdiction. <em>See Hercules Inc. v. Dynamic Export Corp., </em>71 F.R.D. 101, 106-07 (S.D.N.Y.1976). While the merits of diversity jurisdiction continue to be hotly debated,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the general trend by the courts has been restrictive rather than expansive. <em>See Owen Equipment and Erection Company v. Kroger, Admx., </em>437 U.S. 365, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">While our reading of section 1332(c) has not been as restrictive of jurisdiction as that of the Fifth Circuit, <em>compare Hernandez v. Travelers Insurance Company, </em>489 F.2d 721 (5th Cir. 1974), and <em>White v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, </em>356 F.2d 746 (1st Cir. 1966), we feel that, in this situation, the purpose of the section compels an interpretation that will restrict diversity jurisdiction. We, therefore, hold, under these facts, that the insurer is deemed to be a citizen of the same state as the plaintiff if either the <em>named </em>insured or the tortfeasor <em>omnibus </em>insured is a citizen of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. <em>See generally </em>P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System (2d ed. 1973). <em>See also </em>A.L.I. Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">One of the most perceptive comments on \u201cthe mounting mischief inflicted on the federai judicial system by the unjustifiable continuance of diversity jurisdiction\u201d is Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Casualty Co. v. Elbert, </em>348 U.S. 48, 53-60, 75 S.Ct. 151, 99 L.Ed. 59 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">For an opposing view, <em>see </em>Weckstein, <em>The 1964 Diversity Amendment: Congressional Indirect Action Against State \u201cDirect Action\u201d Laws, </em>1965 Wis.L.Rev. 268, 269-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">At least one bill that would eliminate or severely limit diversity jurisdiction was before the last Congress and similar legislation is expected to be reintroduced in the next.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
