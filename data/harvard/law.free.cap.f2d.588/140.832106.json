Southard, a dealer in antique automobiles and chairman of the board and principal stockholder of plaintiff Classic Car Investments, Inc. (\u201cClassic\u201d), brought this libel suit on the basis of an article about the plaintiffs\u2019 line of business in <em>Forbes </em>magazine, published by the defendant Forbes, Inc. (\u201cForbes\u201d). The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the article was not defamatory of the plaintiffs and was protected by the privilege of fair comment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-27\">In its July 15, 1974, issue <em>Forbes </em>published an article entitled \u201cDegradation of a Hobby.\u201d The article was written by Alvin A. Butkus, a regular <em>Forbes </em>writer with ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>years experience, as part of a series which the magazine publishes dealing with the investment aspects of \u201ccollectibles,\u201d items such as artwork that generally have interested collectors rather than investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The article discussed the growing field of investment in \u201cclassic,\u201d or antique, cars. It was clearly critical of speculators and promoters in this field, whom it called \u201cthe quick buck boys.\u201d The subheading of the article stated: \u201cWant to be the first on your block to get burned in the latest speculative craze? Then get yourself an \u2018old\u2019 car.\u201d The gist of the article was to question the certainty of enormous appreciation in the value of old cars claimed by some of the promoters of the investment, and to warn would-be investors of some of the pitfalls of such investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The article included a chart, headed \u201cHottest Cars Around,\u201d illustrating some of the most dramatic instances of appreciation in value of old cars and including projections of future prices. A fine print footnote to the chart attributed as the source of the information it contained \u201cOld Car Value Guides and Classic Car Investments.\u201d In fact, Classic did not furnish all of the future price estimates and the chart did not include the quality rating criteria used in the antique ear industry to rate prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The final paragraph of the article discussed Southard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">How far can the craze go? Who can say? The Dutch tulip bulb mania in the 17th century was the prototype of such irrational booms. Some professionals are already licking their chops over prospects for the next round of higher prices. Jim Southard, a former Atlanta stockbroker turned auto collector-dealer, is readying investment programs in classic cars for profit-sharing and pension plans. His strategy is to sell such programs to groups of doctors, lawyers and corporations. They will get the appreciating value of the car and he will get a management fee and possibly even storage fees. \u201cInvesting in cars is just like buying stocks, except you don\u2019t have the downside risk,\u201d argues Southard. \u201cYou buy the highest quality, where demand is greatest and supply is small. The value .of those cars never goes down, so you\u2019re guaranteed to make money.\u201d If he made claims like that for stocks, Southard would be in the soup. But there is no Securities &amp; Exchange Commission for classic cars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">The quotations attributed to Southard in this paragraph were not verbatim quotes but a \u201cdistillation\u201d of comments he made to reporter Butkus. Butkus\u2019 transcript and notes showed that Southard used similar, but less emphatic, language.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">The day after this article appeared, the Securities and Exchange Commission, prompted by the article, began an informal inquiry to determine whether Southard and Classic were selling unregistered securities in violation of federal securities law. The inquiry led to no formal SEC action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Southard and Classic filed suit for defamation against Forbes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. They alleged that the article was libelous because it charged antique car dealers in general with unethical business practices, and Southard and Classic in particular with violations of federal securities law or with unethical business practices. Following substantial discovery, the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that as a matter of Georgia law nothing in the article was defamatory of either plaintiff, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the misquotations of Southard were privileged under the doctrine of fair comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Both parties agree that Georgia law governs this case. Georgia law defines libel as a publication \u201ctending to injure the reputation of any individual and expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule . . .\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 105-701, 703.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although part of the definition of slander, a charge \u201cmade against another in reference to his trade, office, or profession\u201d which is \u201ccalculated to injure him therein\u201d also gives rise to a libel action. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-702.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">A publication which on its face is necessarily within these statutory definitions is considered libelous per se. <em>Holmes v. Clisby, </em>118 Ga. 820, 822, 45 S.E. 684 (1903) (predecessor statute). It is for the court, upon appropriate motion, initially to determine whether the publication at issue is defamatory as a matter of law. If as a matter of law the publication is not defamatory, the case must be dismissed. <em>Garland v. State, </em>211 Ga. 44, 46, 84 S.E.2d 9 (1954). If the publication is defamatory per se, the jury is instructed accordingly. <em>Weatherholt v. Howard, </em>143 Ga. 41, 42, 84 S.E. 119 (1915). If the publication has no necessarily defamatory meaning, but can be understood in more than one way, one of which is defamatory, then it is for the jury to decide if, on the basis of some innuendo resulting from the circumstances surrounding the publication, the publication in fact had that defamatory meaning. <em>Holmes v. Clisby, supra, </em>118 Ga. at 822-23, 45 S.E. at 685-86; <em>Sheley v. Southeastern Newspapers, Inc., </em>87 Ga.App. 167, 171, 73 S.E.2d 211 (1952) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">These distinctions between libel per se and libel by innuendo do not affect the court\u2019s initial task of determining whether, the publication is capable of defamatory meaning. Accordingly, the essential question before us in reviewing the grant of summary judgment in this case is whether the publication in <em>Forbes </em>is reasonably capable of some meaning defamatory of James Southard or Classic Car Investments, Inc. In considering this question, we must construe the publication \u201cas a whole . in [its] plain, natural, and ordinary meaning, ... as other people would understand [it], according to the sense in which [it] appear[s] to have been published and the idea [it was] meant to convey.\u201d <em>Garland v. State, supra, </em>211 Ga. at 46, 84 S.E.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">The appellants urge that the <em>Forbes </em>article defamed them because it charged them with illegal activities, namely violation of federal securities laws. The crux of their argument is that the statements in the article that Southard was \u201creadying investment programs in classic cars for profit-sharing and pension plans\u201d in which investors \u201cwill get the appreciating value of the car and [Southard] will get a management fee and possibly even storage fees\u201d charged him with the sale of \u201cinvestment contracts.\u201d Since the willful sale of an unregistered security is unlawful,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201csecurity\u201d includes an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the appellants argue, the effect of this charge was to impute to Southard the unlawful sale of a security. They contend that this charge was reinforced by final sentences of the article: \u201cIf he made claims like that for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>stocks, Southard would be in the soup. But there is no S.E.C. for classic cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The district court correctly found that nothing on the face of the article explicitly accuses Southard of violating federal securities law. Nor do the activities explicitly attributed to Southard on their face make out the elements of a securities law violation. Thus, we cannot accept that the article was defamatory of Southard and Classic Car Investments as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The appellants contend that even if the article is not defamatory on its face, the article as a whole nevertheless can be understood as implying violation of securities law or at least unethical business conduct. They argue that, to a reading audience as sophisticated in business affairs as <em>Forbes \u2019, </em>\u201cinvestment program\u201d plus \u201cmanagement fees\u201d equals investment contracts. In the context of the misquoted guarantees of a large return on classic car investments, the omission of the rating system in the price chart, the article\u2019s derogatory attitude towards the claims of classic car dealers in general, and the article\u2019s comment that Southard\u2019s statements would put him \u201cin the soup\u201d if he were selling stocks, this equation would lead the reader to conclude that he was selling unregistered securities. As evidence of this implication, the appellants point to the S.E.C. inquiry that followed the publication of the article. They also introduced the affidavit of Thomas Sherrard, a professor of corporate and securities law, who stated that he interpreted the article as implying that Southard was selling unregistered securities. Accordingly, the appellants maintain that the <em>Forbes </em>article was capable of defamatory interpretation, and the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the appellant should have had the opportunity to have a jury determine if in fact the defamatory interpretation should be placed upon the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The meaning which the appellants urge as a basis for denying summary judgment goes beyond that which the ordinary reader of <em>Forbes </em>would place on the article. It requires too attenuated a series of inferences: the reader would have to conclude first that the sale of antique autos as part of an investment program in which the seller would receive management fees was a sale within the legal definition of a security; then that this security was unregistered; and finally that the violation of securities law was willful. We are not satisfied that the inferences drawn by legal experts in securities law show that an audience as undoubtedly sophisticated in securities transactions as <em>Forbes\u2019 </em>reasonably would draw the same conclusion, much less that the \u201cperson of ordinary capability\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">While the statement that Southard would be \u201cin the soup\u201d is clearly capable of defamatory meaning, that statement was conditioned on Southard\u2019s selling stocks and thus coming within SEC purview. The article then said: \u201cThere is no SEC for classic cars.\u201d As the appellants conceded at oral argument, the latter language explicitly takes Southard out of \u201cthe soup,\u201d negating the implication that Southard\u2019s activities or statements were unlawful. The appellants thus seek by the innuendo they claim to impart to the <em>Forbes </em>article a meaning which the article itself denies. But, words which are not defamatory \u201ccannot have their natural meaning enlarged by innuendo.\u201d <em>Central of Ga. Rwy. Co. v. Sheftall, </em>118 Ga. 865, 867, 45 S.E. 687, 689 (1903). \u201cThe purpose of innuendo is to explain ambiguities in the charge made in the statement, and cannot introduce any new matter.\u201d <em>Garland v. State, </em>211 Ga. 44, 46, 84 S.E.2d 9, 11 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">We find that the <em>Forbes </em>article, in its ordinary and natural meaning reasonably can be understood as suggesting at worst that Southard and other classic car dealers were puffing the value of investment in classic cars to an extent beyond that permitted in the marketing of securities; that this puffing was exploitative; and that some SEC-like regulation perhaps should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>intervene against such puffery. The fundamental message was caveat emptor to potential customers of Southard and others in his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">This caveat undoubtedly was unfavorable publicity for Southard, but unfavorable commercial publicity as such is not defamation. \u201c[I]t lacks the element of personal disgrace necessary for defamation.\u201d W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 111 at 740 (4th ed. 1971). It does not amount to a publication which tends to expose Southard and Classic \u201cto public hatred, contempt, or ridicule . . .,\u201d as required by Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 105-701, 703. Nor does it charge Southard with activities incompatible with the proper exercise of Southard\u2019s business. The publication was therefore not \u201ccalculated to injure him\u201d in his trade, as required by Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-702.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold as a matter of law that this publication was not capable of a meaning defamatory of Southard or of Classic Car Investments, Inc.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In so deciding, we have the benefit of a record fully developed through affidavits and depositions presented on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Where there is such a record and it \u201cdemonstrates that, construing all of the facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom in favor of the party against whom the judgment is entered, he would not be entitled to have a jury verdict stand, we have not hesitated to hold that the grant of summary judgment is proper.\u201d <em>Time, Inc. v. McLaney, </em>406 F.2d 565, 572 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>395 U.S. 922, 89 S.Ct. 1776, 23 L.Ed.2d 239 (1969). We bear in mind that a careful look at whether an eventual jury verdict could stand is especially appropriate in libel actions, because the very pendency of a lawsuit may exert the chilling effect which <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and its progeny seek to guard against. <em>Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 858, 865 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Time, Inc. v. McLaney, supra, </em>406 F.2d at 566; <em>Thompson v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>129 U.S.App.D.C. 299, 394 F.2d 774, 776, <em>cert. denied </em>393 U.S. 884, 89 S.Ct. 194, 21 L.Ed.2d 160 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Our approval of the use of summary judgment in libel cases has come where judgment has been granted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>issue of \u201cactual malice\u201d as defined in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an issue which lends itself to summary judgment because actual malice must be shown with \u201cconvincing clarity,\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 285-86, 84 S.Ct. 710. Summary judgment is equally appropriate on the issue whether there is defamation. The protective rationale for summary judgment in libel cases remains the same no matter what the issue on which judgment is granted. Moreover, where no \u201csubstantial danger to reputation is apparent\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the press should be more carefully guarded against exposure to liability for defamation than where clearly defamatory content warns it of liability. <em>See Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 348, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). Too broad a definition of defamation may curtail \u201cuninhibited, robust and wide-open\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> discussion as much as may too low a standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">For these reasons, we hold that the district court did not err in granting Forbes, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">.

The district court considered the article\u2019s references to each of the plaintiffs separately. With respect to Classic Car Investments, the court considered only the effect of the attribution to Classic as the source for the chart \u2019showing various instances of appreciation in the value of classic cars because there was no mention of Classic in the text of the article. The court concluded that even if this attribution or the concomitant omission of the point rating system for antique cars was a misrepresentation, the misrepresentation did not rise to the level of defamation within the meaning of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-701. The district court also ruled that it is \u201cwell-settled\u201d that Classic would not be defamed vicariously by references to Southard, one of its officers, or to the industry of which the company is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Although Classic Car Investments, Inc. appeals from the district court\u2019s ruling, the appellant\u2019s brief does not challenge these rulings concerning Classic. In any case, we need not address ourselves to these rulings because if the <em>Forbes </em>article was not defamatory of Southard, a fortiori it was not defamatory of Classic.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The district court also issued a secondary ruling that the misquotations of Southard\u2019s comments concerning the reliability of investment in antique cars were protected by the privilege of \u201cfair comment\u201d because they fairly represented what Southard said. In addition to this question of privilege, the parties have argued the question whether Southard was a public figure within the meaning of <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 351, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974) and whether, accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate because there is insufficient evidence that <em>Forbes\u2019 </em>statements concerning Southard were made with the knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth required by <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Because we find at the threshold that there was no defamation, we need not consider whether either of these privileges against liability apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b239-15\">. 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">. <em>See, e. g., Bon Air Hotel, supra, </em>426 F.2d at 864.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\">. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 155, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b240-14\">. <em>New York Times Co. v.

I am compelled, however, to register my dissent because I believe there is a jury question presented whether the <em>Forbes </em>article is capable of a defamatory meaning. To support my position, I need not demonstrate that the article is defamatory: I need only show that the article is capable of two meanings, one defamatory and the other not defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">Southard has presented this court with a plethora of theories why this article is defamatory. Most of his arguments can be dismissed out of hand and the court properly does so. He presents two, however, that are at least colorable. His first theory suggests that the article falsely accuses him of securities law violations in that Southard sold investment contracts without the proper registration. I agree with Judge Tuttle that this theory is strained and simply requires inferences that are too sophisticated for the average <em>Forbes </em>reader.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">Southard\u2019s second argument, however, I believe, presents a jury question. Essentially, this theory is based upon the concluding sentences in the arricie: \u201cIf he made claims like that for stocks, Southard would be in the soup. But there is no Securities &amp; Exchange Commission for classic cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">The majority states that this statement is \u201cclearly capable of defamatory meaning.\u201d At 144. But the majority states that since the second sentence explicitly takes Southard \u201cout of the soup\u201d any implications that Southard was guilty of illegal conduct is negated. I disagree. The second sentence does not negate the inference that Southard is guilty of illegal conduct. It negates the inference that the SEC can do something about it. In effect, the article can be read as accusing Southard of improper business practices, albeit practices outside the jurisdiction of the SEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-20\">I would not be surprised to find that the public associates the work of the SEC with stock fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given this inference, I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Southard should be allowed to argue to a jury that the <em>Forbes </em>article accuses him of fraud or improper business practice with relation to classic cars, but that the traditional guardian against fraudulent business activities is without power to do anything about it because Southard\u2019s fraud is outside the jurisdiction of the SEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Because I think the article has two reasonable readings \u2014 the non-defamatory one posited by Judge Tuttle and the defamatory one suggested by myself \u2014 I think a jury question is presented and summary judgment is inappropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I reach this conclusion notwithstanding my agreement with the standard by which we consider the grant of summary judgment in libel cases as stated by Judge Tuttle.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Since I have made these comments under the protective luxury of a dissent, I need not speculate about Southard\u2019s status as a plaintiff nor his ability to prove <em>Forbes </em>guilty of actual malice, if Southard is a public figure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-21\">.
