The issue is the right to possession of $763. <em>See United States v. Palmer, </em>565 F.2d 1063 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">The remand permitted the district court to consider any claims made against the fund by the government. The government asserted a two-count claim to the money. The first basis for the claim was that the money was an exhibit offered by the government and that it should be returned to the government as the offering party when its use as an exhibit was finished. That claim was effectively denied in the former appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">The second basis of the government\u2019s claim was that Palmer had not listed the asset in his affidavit seeking counsel at government expense. The government therefore asserted an equitable lien on the fund to secure partial recovery for the cost of the defense provided by the government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">The trial court found for the government on the second issue. The findings of fact are sufficient to withstand review under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52. The court\u2019s conclusion that the government has an equitable lien is consistent with justice in this case, and the appellant\u2019s motion for the return of the money was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
