For purposes of the motion to dismiss the complaint, we must assume that the judge in question accepted a bribe. Decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court require us to adhere to the doctrine of judicial immunity. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">According to the complaint, the plaintiffs, trustees, operated oil and gas wells on land adjacent to property owned by the defendant Duval County Ranch Company, Inc. (DCRC), a corporation wholly owned by the defendant Clinton Manges. The complaint alleges that Manges entered into a conspiracy with the defendant O. P. Carrillo, who served as a judge of the 229th District Court of Duval County, Texas, from November 1970 to January 23, 1976, when he was removed from office by the Texas Senate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the alleged conspiracy, Manges bestowed financial favors upon Carrillo, who in return would rule as Manges directed in cases before his court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The complaint charges that, on August 15, 1972, Manges filed suit in Carrillo\u2019s court to enjoin the plaintiffs\u2019 oil production. Manges alleged that the plaintiffs\u2019 operations were polluting DCRC\u2019s land. According to the complaint, Manges\u2019s true motivation was to stop the plaintiffs\u2019 production and thereby cause their oil lease to be terminated under the nonproduction clause it contained. The complaint next asserts that, at Manges\u2019s direction, Carrillo entered an order on January 18, 1973, temporarily enjoining the plaintiffs\u2019 oil production. The defendants Clarence Martens and Orville Dennis served as sureties for the injunction bond. That temporary injunction remained in effect until June 25, 1975, when the Texas Court of Civil Appeals dissolved it. <em>Winslow v. Duval County Ranch Company, </em>1975, Tex.Civ.App., 519 S.W.2d 217. The complaint asserts that, because of the conspiracy between Manges and Carrillo, the plaintiffs lost over two years of oil production on the land in question. The complaint states a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for the alleged conspiracy to deprive the plaintiffs of their oil production. The complaint also states a pendent state claim based on the alleged wrongful injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The district court dismissed the complaint. It determined that judicial immunity barred suit against Carrillo and that, with the state judge eliminated as a defendant, there were no \u00a7 1983 claims under color of state law against the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Because we are reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we must assume the existence of all facts pleaded in the complaint. The defendants argue that Carrillo\u2019s act in entering the temporary injunction is protected by judicial immunity even if it had been induced by a bribe from Manges. We must agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">Over a century ago, the Supreme Court embedded judicial immunity into our jurisprudence. In <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>1872, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 347, 20 L.Ed. 646, the Court stated that it is \u201ca general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal consequences to himself\u201d. Therefore, the Court held that \u201cjudges of courts of superior or general jurisdiction are not liable to civil actions for their judicial acts, even when such acts are in excess of their jurisdiction, and are alleged to have been done maliciously or corruptly\u201d. 80 U.S. at 351. The Court drew a distinction between acts in excess of jurisdiction, which are protected by immunity, and acts in the clear absence of all jurisdiction, which are unprotected. The Court illustrated this distinction by stating that a probate judge with jurisdiction over only wills and the settlement of estates who tried a criminal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>would be acting in clear absence of all jurisdiction, while a criminal court' judge who convicted a defendant of a nonexistent crime would merely be acting in excess of jurisdiction. 80 U.S. at 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>1967, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288, the Court held that judicial immunity applied to suits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">This immunity applies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly . . . . His errors may be corrected on appeal, but he should not have to fear that unsatisfied litigants may hound him with litigation charging malice or corruption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">386 U.S. at 554, 87 S.Ct. at 1218. The Court recently reaffirmed that a judge may be liable in a civil action only when his act was in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Stump </em>v. <em>Sparkman, </em>1978, 435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331. <em>See also Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>1976, 424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (prosecutorial immunity).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Because it is clear that Carrillo had jurisdiction over the action filed by Manges against the plaintiffs, we must affirm the district court\u2019s determination that Carrillo\u2019s act in entering the temporary injunction was cloaked with judicial immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since Carrillo is immune, the remaining defendants, who are all private citizens, did not conspire with any person against whom a valid \u00a7 1983 claim can be stated. Thus, the district court also properly dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claim against the other defendants. <em>Slavin v. Curry, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 574 F.2d 1256; <em>Perez v. Borchers, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 567 F.2d 285; <em>Humble v. Foreman, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 563 F.2d 780; <em>Hill v. McClellan, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 490 F.2d 859; <em>Guedry v. Ford, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 660. With the federal claim dismissed, of course, the district court did not err in dismissing the pendent state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. The Supreme Court of Texas also removed Carrillo from the bench. See <em>Matter of Carrillo, </em>1976 Tex., 542 S.W.2d 105. According to the most recent submission in this case by the Attorney General of Texas, Carrillo is presently incarcerated in a federal penitentiary on income tax charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">. This Court has faithfully followed this line of cases by applying judicial immunity even when corrupt or otherwise intentionally wrongful judicial acts are alleged. <em>See Slavin v. Curry, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 574 F.2d 1256; <em>Perez v. Borchers, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 567 F.2d 285; <em>Humble v. Foreman, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 563 F.2d 780; <em>Connor v.
