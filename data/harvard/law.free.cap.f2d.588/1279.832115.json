We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-21\">On October 18,1971, Mileham, an Arizona state prisoner, was convicted of escaping in violation of Ariz.R.S. \u00a7 13-392. At that time, he was serving a term of 25 to 40 years under a 1964 conviction for robbery with a prior conviction, Ariz.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-641, 13-643. His sentence on the escape charge, one to two years, was made consecutive to the robbery sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-22\">When .Mileham was convicted of escape, the Board of Pardons and Paroles, pursuant to a letter to the Board from an Assistant Attorney General, dated March 23, 1971, determined the time when a prisoner subject to consecutive sentences would become eligible for parole under Ariz.R.S. \u00a7 31-411A by adding the minimum sentences on the charges and dividing by three. On this basis, Mileham would have become eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>after serving a total of eight years and eight months. Mileham says that he thus became eligible for parole consideration July 6, 1973, but that the Board refused to consider him for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">On October 24,1973, the Attorney General of Arizona ruled that under Ariz.R.S. \u00a7 13-392 a sentence for escape does not begin to run until the prior sentence has been served in full. The statute provides that a prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment for escape \u201cshall commence at the time when he would otherwise have been discharged from the prison.\u201d This statute was in effect when Mileham was convicted of escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">Mileham carried his case to the Arizona Supreme Court, which ruled against him. <em>Mileham </em>v. <em>Arizona Board of Pardons and Paroles, </em>1973, 110 Ariz. 470, 520 P.2d 840. The court concluded that \u00a7 13-929 \u201cforeclosed any possibility that the prisoner may be released on parole. Parole is not-a discharge of a sentence. It is a service of the balance of the sentence outside the prison. Since petitioners\u2019 sentences for escape cannot commence until they have been discharged from their original sentences, respondents are not required to give them an opportunity to appear to apply for parole until they are discharged on their original sentences and have served the minimum on the escape sentences.\u201d 110 Ariz. at 473, 520 P.2d at 843. Under this ruling, Mileham will have to serve 40 years and four months before becoming eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">The District Judge, relying on our decision in <em>Love v. Fitzharris, </em>9 Cir., 1972, 460 F.2d 382, <em>vacated as moot, </em>409 U.S. 1100, 93 S.Ct. 896, 34 L.Ed.2d 682, ordered the Board to grant Mileham a parole hearing. This was error. In <em>Love, </em>the California Department of Corrections had in effect, when Love received consecutive sentences, a rule similar to that stated in the Arizona Assistant Attorney General\u2019s letter of March 23, 1971. Shortly after, the Department, on advice of the California Attorney General, changed its rule, thereby lengthening the time Love had to serve before becoming eligible for parole. We held that the change, coming after Love was sentenced, amounted to an <em>ex post facto </em>increase in punishment, although imposed by \u201cadministrative fiat\u201d rather than be \u201clegislative action.\u201d Mileham\u2019s case is different. The Supreme Court of Arizona has now authoritatively construed the statute that was in effect when Mileham was convicted, thus holding that the Assistant Attorney General\u2019s interpretation was erroneous. The <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution does not give Mileham a vested right in such an erroneous interpretation. In <em>Love </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMsg\"><em>Absent a court pronouncement on the matter, </em>the interpretation of the relationship between the statutes placed upon them by the administrative agency charged with their enforcement has the force and effect of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">(Emphasis added) (p. 385)</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">In Mileham\u2019s case, we have \u201ca court pronouncement on the matter\u201d by Arizona\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-10\">More closely in point is <em>In re Costello, </em>9 Cir., 1958, 262 F.2d 214, in which we held that the California rule that, if a parolee violates the terms of his parole, his sentence is redetermined at the maximum, even though previously fixed at a lesser term, does not present a federal question. <em>See also, Forman v. Wolff, </em>9 Cir., 1978, 590 F.2d 283; <em>Rifai v. United States Parole Commission, </em>9 Cir., 1978, 586 F.2d 695. In <em>Forman, </em>we found the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the applicable statute not to be \u201cunforeseeable.\u201d We here find the Arizona Court\u2019s construction of the applicable statute not to be \u201cunforeseeable.\u201d <em>DePeralta v. Garrison, </em>9 Cir., 1978, 575 F.2d 749, is not in point, for the reasons stated in <em>Rifai, supra, </em>586 F.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
