Sarkar says his method of constructing a mathematical model is capable of accurately providing the flow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>parameters of a river over a period of time, even though it (1) contains obstructions such as dams or bridges, tributaries, and by-passes, (2) experiences flooding, (3) has lateral inflow, (4) has actual inflow at its upstream end, and (5) empties into a tidal body. The ability to account for additional complexities is said to comprise the principal advance over 'more idealized models in the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">The claims take two forms. The first includes claims 1-13, of which claim 1 is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-6\">1. A method of constructing a mathematical model of at least a portion of an open channel segmented into at least one reach and in which there is spatially varied unsteady flow and including the existence of at least one gravity wave during a given period of time comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-7\">(a) measuring the cross-sectional dimensions of the channel at a specifically chosen, predetermined number of locations usable for schematizing said dimensions into a rectangularized cross-section for each regularly spaced but arbitrarily chosen distance Ax along the length of the channel irrespective of the chosen value of the interval of time At;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-8\">[steps (b)-(h)]. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">Step (b) recites the mathematical equations used to define the open channel flow. Steps (c)-(g) recite additional data-gathering steps, and step (h) recites the method of solving the flow equations using the collected data of steps (a) and (c)-(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-10\">The second form includes claims 14-39, reciting construction activity with the mathematical model of claims 1-13. Claim 14 is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-14\">14. A method of locating an obstruction in an open channel to affect flow in a predetermined manner comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-15\">a) obtaining the dimensions of said obstruction which affect the parameters of flow;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-16\">b) constructing a mathematical model of at least that portion of the open channel in which said obstruction is to be located in accordance with the method of claim 1 using those dimensions obtained in step (a) above;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-17\">c) adjusting the location of said obstruction within said mathematical model until the desired effect upon flow is obtained in said model; and thereafter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-18\">d) constructing said obstruction within the actual open channel at the specified adjusted location indicated by the mathematical model.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-19\">\n<em>The Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-20\">The board rejected all claims solely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it considered them as not being directed to a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There were two distinct rationales for the \u00a7 101 rejection. The first concerned the interpretation and significance of step (a) of claim 1. The second concerned the significance of \u201cpost-solution activity\u201d steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-21\">Respecting step (a) of claim 1, Sarkar sought to meet the examiner\u2019s rejection based upon <em>Gottschalk v. Benson, </em>409 U.S. 63, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273, 175 USPQ 673 (1972), as interpreted in <em>In re Christensen, </em>478 F.2d 1392, 178 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1973), with an argument that step (a), <em>i. e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>measuring the channel dimensions at arbitrarily chosen distance intervals Ax along the length of the channel, irrespective of the chosen value of time interval At, is a novel, nonobvious physical step, taking claims 1-13 outside the holdings of <em>Benson </em>and <em>Christensen. </em>In response, the board said step (a) was old, as indicated by Otter and Day, <em>Tidal Flow Computations, </em>The Engineer, January 29, 1960, at 177-82 (Otter). As the board stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-4\">The nature of the results of the calculations, that is, stable or oscillatory, is not set out in the claims at bar and we think that the general .commentary in Otter, for example page 181, column 3, first paragraph,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] is indicative of the fact that values for Ax and At have been selected in arbitrary fashion in the past even though such selection may take on non-arbitrary characteristics in order to achieve stable results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">The board, therefore, considered step (a) as nothing more than one of \u201cthe old and necessary antecedent steps of establishing values for the variables in the equation,\u201d citing <em>In re Christensen, supra </em>at 1394, 178 USPQ at 37. The board concluded that the claims at issue would preempt all meaningful use of the formulas recited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">Concerning claims 14-39 and the' significance of \u201cppst-solution activity,\u201d like building a bridge or dam, the board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av2\">While it is true that the final step in each of these claims makes reference to the mathematical result achieved by performing the prior recited steps, we consider the connection to be so tenuous that the several steps recited in each claim when considered as a whole do not constitute a proper method under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbX\">That the claimed invention was as a whole new, useful, and nonobvious, is nowhere challenged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-12\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">The broad issue under the statute is whether the processes of claims 1-39 constitute statutory subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The specific issue, occasioned by the presence of a mathematical algorithm, is whether measuring step (a) establishes that the claimed invention as a whole is not the algorithm but an application thereof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-14\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-15\">Section 101, the threshold provision of the patent statute, enumerates categories of inventions possibly subject to patenting and includes <em>any </em>process and any improvement thereof. Given the fundamental purposes of the patent law to encourage inventions, their disclosure, and their commercialization, Congress employed broad language in enumerating the types of inventions coming within the statute. Judicial exclusion of an invention from the \u201cany process\u201d provision by Congress, and its consequent relegation to the caves of secrecy (as here), must be approached with great care lest the intent of Congress and the constitutionally stated purpose it has implemented be thwarted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>The <em>in camera </em>procedure invoked herein has underlined appellant\u2019s determination not to disclose the invention absent the quid pro quo of a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-4\">Congress cannot be expected to foresee, or to annually amend Title 35 to incorporate, every future breakthrough onto entirely new technological terrain. The Constitution granted Congress the power to \u201cpromote * * * progress * * *,\u201d not the power to foretell its direction. Congress was granted authority not prescience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">Further, the patent system encourages disclosure of technological breakthroughs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It deals largely with disclosure of the unforeseen, the obviously foreseeable being rejected, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Hence, to limit \u201cany process\u201d to familiar or predicted arts would be to stifle much technology at its birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Though every set of steps, of whatever nature, may properly be labeled a \u201cprocess,\u201d \u00a7 101 (\u201cWhoever invents\u201d) limits the patent system to invented processes. Sets of steps conducted entirely by nature are not subject to patenting; they are not invented by man. Sets of steps occurring only in the mind have not been made subject to patenting because mental processes are but disembodied thoughts, whereas inventions which Congress is constitutionally empowered to make patentable are tangible embodiments of ideas in the useful, or technological, arts. <em>See In re Waldbaum, </em>457 F.2d 997, 1003, 59 Cust. &amp; Pat.App. 940, 173 USPQ 430, 434 (1972) (commenting on the synonymity of useful arts and technological arts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\">Mathematical exercises, or methods of calculation, are within the myriad of mental processes of which the human mind is capable. Though they may be represented by written formulae, symbols, equations, or \u201calgorithms,\u201d mathematical exercises remain disembodied. They may not, therefore, cross the threshold of \u00a7 101. On the other hand, the mere presence of a mathematical exercise, as a step or steps in a process involving nonmathematical steps, should not slam the door of the Patent and Trademark Office upon an applicant seeking eventual disclosure of that process. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the intent and purpose expressed (\u201cany process\u201d) by Congress in \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">Thus a series of steps is a \u201cprocess\u201d within \u00a7 101 <em>unless </em>it falls within a judicially determined category of nonstatutory subject matter exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-14\">The advent of computer technology, with its accompanying computer programs, requires neither abandonment nor revision of the foregoing considerations. It requires merely their careful application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In making that application, each invention must be evaluated as claimed; yet semantogenic considerations preclude a determination based solely on words appearing in the claims. In the final analysis under \u00a7 101, the claimed invention, as a whole, must be evaluated for what it is.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>Sarkar\u2019s claims recite a mathematical \u201calgorithm.\u201d <em>See Benson, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 65, 93 S.Ct. 253, 175 USPQ at 674; <em>In re Freeman, </em>573 F.2d 1237, 1245-46, 197 USPQ 464, 471 (CCPA 1978). Although not disclosed in this opinion,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> mathematical equations expressed in algebraic form, and a technique for solving them are recited in each claim. In an effort on this appeal to establish that his claimed invention as a whole is not merely a mathematical exercise, but a process in which mathematics is but a part, Sarkar makes three arguments, all related to measuring step (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">First, in an effort to show his invention to be other than a mathematical exercise, Sarkar contends that his claims would not preempt the mathematical algorithms, because prior mathematical models and solution techniques suffered the disadvantage that channel dimensions could not be measured at arbitrarily chosen distance intervals Ax irrespective of time interval At, /. e., the values of Ax and At had to satisfy the Courant condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-12\">A* &lt;_ _Ax_<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgOS\">M + c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">Sarkar says his formulae and algorithms could be freely used without infringement by simply so choosing Ax and At as to satisfy the prior art Courant condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">That contention does not comport with the language of the claims. Step (a) says only that Ax is selected arbitrarily relative to At. It thus covers those situations where, though chosen arbitrarily, the values of Ax and At do satisfy the Courant condition. Sarkar\u2019s argument that \u201carbitrarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>chosen\u201d is a term of art explained in his specification, and that it should be read as precluding satisfaction of the Courant condition, is without merit. The specification says the relationship between Ax and At <em>need </em>not satisfy the Courant condition. It does not, as Sarkar would have us read it, say the relationship <em>must </em>not do so. In sum, we agree with the solicitor\u2019s position that step (a) does not preclude coincidental satisfaction of the Courant condition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hence Sarkar\u2019s first argument, that his claims do not preempt the algorithm because they do not encompass satisfaction of the Courant condition, must fail.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Sarkar\u2019s second contention is that measuring step (a) is not just an old and necessary antecedent step of establishing values for the variables in the formulae recited in the claims.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">In <em>In re Christensen, supra </em>478 F.2d at 1394, 178 USPQ at 37-38, (emphasis added) this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-7\">Given that the method of solving a mathematical equation may not be the subject of patent protection, it follows that the addition of the <em>old and necessary </em>antecedent steps of establishing values for the variables in the equation cannot convert the unpatentable method to patentable subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\"><em>Accord, In re Chatfield, </em>545 F.2d 152, 158, 191 USPQ 730, 736 (CCPA 1976). The reason for so holding is clear. No mathematical equation can be used, as a practical matter, without establishing and substituting values for the variables expressed therein. Substitution of values dictated by the formula has thus been viewed as a form of mathematical step. If the steps of gathering and substituting values were alone sufficient, every mathematical equation, formula, or algorithm having any practical use would be per se subject to patenting as a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101. Consideration of whether the substitution of specific values is enough to convert the disembodied ideas present in the formula into an embodiment of those ideas, or into an application of the formula, is foreclosed by the current state of the law. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">Though Sarkar admits that arbitrary selection of Ax and At was used in the prior art, he says that is not determinative, because prior algorithms were unstable when used with arbitrarily chosen Ax and At, contending essentially that earlier arbitrary selection was inoperative. We-decline the underlying invitation to treat the mathematical properties of Sarkar\u2019s algorithm as divorced from the algorithm itself. Whether arbitrary selection is operative or inoperative is a function, respectively, of the stable nature of Sarkar\u2019s algorithm and the oscillatory nature of prior algorithms. Indeed, Sarkar\u2019s second contention supports the view that his invention as a whole is his new and stable algorithm. There exists, in any event, no basis for treating data-gathering step (a) differently from the data-gathering steps in <em>Christensen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">Thirdly, Sarkar asserts that step (a) is novel (because his algorithm makes it operative) and nonobvious. Sarkar says that makes his invention an \u201cinventive application\u201d of the algorithm, citing this from the majority opinion in <em>Parker v. Flook, supra </em>note 9, at 2528, 198 USPQ at 199:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-13\">Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, an inventive application of the principle may be patented. Conversely, the discovery of such a phenomenon cannot support a patent unless there is some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>other inventive concept in its application.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">Beyond the irrelevance of novelty and nonobviousness considerations to determinations under \u00a7 101, Sarkar\u2019s difficulty is that step (a), to the extent that it be considered novel, derives such \u201cnovelty\u201d solely from the algorithm itself.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">Sarkar\u2019s claimed invention as a whole consists of a mathematical exercise, wherein a new formula is provided, formula-dictated values are gathered and substituted for the variables- in that formula, and the calculations required by the formula are made. Sarkar\u2019s offer to disclose his process by patenting must, in the present state of the law, be declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">The decision of the board, rejecting claims 1-39 as not directed to a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">.

But not for its patentability. Considerations of novelty and nonobviousness have no place in evaluations under \u00a7 101 as to whether an invention is within the categories of possibly patentable inventions. Those considerations arise, as the statute makes plain, under \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103, respectively. <em>See Nickola v. Peterson, </em>580 F.2d 898, 906-07, 198 USPQ 385, 395-96 (CA6 1978). Cognitive dissonance arises from references to \u201cnovelty,\u201d or to \u201cpatentability,\u201d in reviewing a rejection under \u00a7 101. If the subject matter as claimed is subject to patenting, <em>i. e., </em>if it falls within \u00a7 101, it must then be examined for compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103. Absent such examination (or admissions), no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>record basis exists for determination or discussion of novelty, nonobviousness, or ultimate patentability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">This court is required to consider appeals from the PTO on the record there made. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. It is not at liberty to consider issues never raised below.

Since the 1952 Patent Act, and especially since <em>Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed. 545 (1966), it has been clear that a \u00a7 101 determination in no way involves consideration of the existence of \u201cinvention,\u201d if it ever did. The words \u201cWhoever invents\u201d in \u00a7 101 are used in the sense of \u201cwhoever originates,\u201d patentability of the thing originated being dependent, as \u00a7 101 states, on its meeting the \u201crequirements of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">.

The board\u2019s analysis of the significance of step (a), and appellant\u2019s emphasis on that step, manifest a careful analysis of the claims to determine whether the invention as a whole resides in the algorithm or in its application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1428-20\">. v = mean velocity across a channel cross-section.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-21\">c = celerity of the wave = (gy)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0MH\">wherein g = acceleration due to gravity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4He\">y = depth of flow with respect to channel bottom as datum.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">. Sarkar contends in his reply brief and at oral argument that the solicitor\u2019s position on this issue is wholly new, the examiner and the board having agreed with appellant\u2019s interpretation of the breadth of step (a). But the board cannot be viewed as so interpreting \u201carbitrarily chosen,\u201d while holding that \u201cthe instant claims preempt all meaningful use of the formulas and algorithms recited.\u201d Moreover, appellant introduced this issue in his main brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1429-14\">. Whether there may be other grounds for holding that the present claims do not preempt the algorithms has not been argued. That question is not, therefore, before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1429-15\">. Sarkar asserts that the PTO agreed with that view. At oral argument the solicitor did not disavow the views of the examiner and the board, but said it makes little if any difference, citing <em>Parker v. Flook, supra </em>note 9. The suggested interpretation of <em>Flook </em>is overbroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">. Patent law is statutory. Hence, the word \u201cinventive\u201d must be read as meaning \u201cnovel and nonobvious.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102, 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">. If step (a) had been novel and nonobvious, that circumstance would not alone have changed the result here. Concerning the particular antecedent data-gathering steps in <em>In re Richman, </em>563 F.2d 1026, 1030, 195 USPQ 340, 343 (CCPA 1977), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-13\">In the present case too, notwithstanding that the antecedent steps are novel and unobvious, they merely determine values for the variables used in the mathematical formulae used in making the calculations. Thus, such antecedent steps do not suffice to render the claimed methods, considered as a whole, statutory subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-25\">The antecedent steps in <em>Richman </em>were dictated by the mathematical formulae. The same is true of Sarkar\u2019s step (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-26\">Whether a data gathering step <em>not </em>dictated by a formula may exist, whether it would enable a claim to pass muster under \u00a7 101, and whether it would render patentable the claimed process including that step, if the claimed process is examined and found novel and nonobvious under \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103, are questions not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
