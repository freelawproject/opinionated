Bright, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation) favoring the United States (government), and dismissing with prejudice CCFA\u2019s complaint for refund of federal income taxes of $8,020.31, plus interest, paid for fiscal years 1970 and 1971.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CCFA, a nonexempt cooperative, was denied deduction of patronage dividends because it did more than 50% of its business with nonmembers. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-23\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-24\">The material facts appear in the uncontested findings of the District Court and in the parties\u2019 fact stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-25\">CCFA is an Arkansas agricultural cooperative association engaged primarily in the sale of agricultural supply products. It was organized in 1949 under Act 153 of 1939, as amended (Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 77-1001 through 1027) (the enabling legislation for agricultural cooperative associations), with its principal place of business in Morrilton, Conway County, Arkansas. CCFA is not now \u201cexempt\u201d from federal income taxation as a farmers\u2019 cooperative organization under Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) \u00a7 521 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 521).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CCFA had been exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>before November 30, 1969 (the end of its fiscal year), but it voluntarily surrendered that status and now operates as a \u201cnonexempt\u201d cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Though the stipulated facts describe CCFA as \u201can agricultural supply cooperative,\u201d its Amended Articles of Incorporation describe it as both a purchasing and marketing cooperative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">ARTICLE II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">THE ASSOCIATION IS FORMED FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">To purchase, acquire, distribute, and sell for and to members any or all agricultural products produced by the members or any products derived from processing of agricultural products produced by the members and to engage in any activity in connection with the picking, gathering, harvesting, receiving, assembling, handling, grading, standardizing, packing, preserving, drying, processing, transporting, storing, financing, advertising, selling, marketing and distributing of any agricultural products delivered by its members or any of the products derived therefrom. To purchase for its members seed, feed, [etc.] and to conduct any other business authorized or allowed to associations organized under [enabling Act], all on a cooperative basis for the mutual benefit of members, and other patrons as producers of agricultural products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">Membership in CCFA may be obtained, on application, by any agricultural producer or person having farm income from crop rent. Members must (1) purchase a $10 common stock certificate, (2) refrain from competing with CCFA, and (3) trade with CCFA. Members must also agree that distributions with respect to patronage or volume of business conducted with CCFA shall be treated as required by I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1383 and 1385 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1383 and 1385).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">The authorized capital stock of CCFA consists of common stock, owned by the members, and two classes of preferred, noncumulative, nonvoting stock. Net income is first allocated to preferred stock in an amount not to exceed 6% of its par value. Income attributable to business with nonmembers is set aside as a tax-paid reserve. Remaining net income is allocated to member patrons in proportion to the volume of business each conducted with CCFA during the fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">For fiscal years ended November 30, 1970, and November 30, 1971, CCFA conducted a greater volume of business with nonmembers than with members:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Fiscal Year Nonmember Member Total % Nonmember Ended Business Business Business Business</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">11/30/70 $493,196 $320,303 $813,499 61%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">11/30/71 $564,176 $354,968 $919,144 62%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">For 1970 and 1971, CCFA filed corporation income tax returns (IRS Form 1120) claiming deductions for patronage dividends paid to members in the amount of $14,520 and $5,465, respectively. Upon audit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that CCFA was not entitled to deductions for patronage dividends and assessed deficiencies of $6,818 for 1970, and $1,202.31, for 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">CCFA paid the assessed deficiencies, plus interest. Its administrative claims for refund having been denied, it instituted this suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">\n<em>The District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">The district court concluded that \u201c[t]he question whether [CCFA] is entitled to the tax benefits available to organizations under Part I of Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 depends on the interpretation of the term \u2018operating on a cooperative basis\u2019 \u201d in I.R.C. \u00a7 1381(a)(2) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381(a)(2)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">Citing Revenue Ruling 72-602, 1972-2 Cum.Bull. 511,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court held that to be considered a \u201ccorporation operating on a cooperative basis\u201d under \u00a7 1381(a)(2) an organization must do more than 50% of its business with members. On the basis of that Ruling and the historical nature of \u201ccooperatives,\u201d the lower court concluded that CCFA, by conducting the majority of its business during fiscal years 1970 and 1971 with nonmembers, failed to qualify as a cooperative for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, the patronage dividends<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> paid to its member-stockholders were not deductible under I.R.C. \u00a7 1382(b) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(b)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The district court further concluded that \u201c[i]nasmuch as [CCFA] does not qualify for treatment as a cooperative organization under the federal income tax laws, [CCFA] must be treated for tax purposes as an ordinary for-profit corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">CCFA had argued that, if all of its operations were to be taxed as though made for profit, the \u201cpatronage dividends\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> should be deductible as \u201cordinary and necessary business expenses\u201d under I.R.C. \u00a7 162 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162). The district court denied that claim, \u201cinasmuch as there is no evidence of any profit-making intention of [CCFA] in making such payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>The Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The dispositive question of law on appeal is whether CCFA was an organization \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d within the meaning of Subchapter T, I.R.C. \u00a7 1381 (a)(2), <em>supra </em>note 3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">As the district court stated from the bench, this \u201ccase is really one of first impression\u201d involving a \u201cclose question.\u201d The business transactions of the earliest cooperatives were conducted entirely with or for their members alone, and none of those transactions was taxed. When cooperatives began to do some business with nonmembers, the tax-exemption of all their transactions was continued for a few years. Congress then enacted the predecessor of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 521, <em>supra </em>note 2, limiting total tax-exemption to cooperatives meeting certain criteria, including a requirement that they do more than 50% of their business in value with members. Nonexempt cooperatives thereafter had their transactions with nonmembers taxed on a for-profit basis and their transactions done with members taxed on a cooperative basis, i. e., patronage dividends to members were deducted (on the apparent theory that the moneys involved had never in reality belonged to the organizations).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is uncontested that Congress intended \u201cpatronage dividends\u201d to be deductible. I.R.C. \u00a7 1382(b), <em>supra </em>note 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">In 1972, a cooperative marketing a single product for 10 members and 90 nonmembers sought a revenue ruling. Because the 10 members were large producers, the value of the member business comprised over 75% of the total. The specific question was whether the cooperative qualified under Subchapter T, in view of its doing 90% of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>its business transactions with nonmembers. The IRS, in Revenue Ruling 72-602, <em>supra </em>note 6, found the number of transactions irrelevant, the criteria being the <em>value </em>of business done. The cooperative was found qualified because 75% of its business in value was done with members. The IRS, however, went beyond the facts presented to it and, by way of dictum, interpreted the words \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d in \u00a7 1381(a)(2) as a requirement that a cooperative must do more than 50 percent in value of its business with members.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Thus, determination of the issue requires statutory interpretation. That function was described by the Court in <em>United States v. Amer. Trucking Ass\u2019ns., </em>310 U.S. 534, 542, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940): \u201cIt is to construe the language so as to give effect to the intent of Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In giving effect to congressional intent, the relevant provisions of the same revenue act, here Subchapter T,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> must be considered as an entirety, not in isolation. <em>Alexander v. Cosden Pipe Line Co., </em>290 U.S. 484, 496, 54 S.Ct. 292, 78 L.Ed. 452 (1934). We begin with the unquestioned congressional intent that admittedly true patronage dividends, such as those here involved, should be deductible by an organization \u201cto which this part applies.\u201d \u00a7 1382(b). The issue is whether that intent is broad enough to include such patronage dividends when an organization does more business in value with nonmembers than with members, <em>i. e., </em>whether Congress intended that that circumstance alone should render Part I inapplicable and make patronage dividends actually paid non-deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">In determining whether an exception was intended by Congress to the deductibility of patronage dividends, the relevant provisions of Subchapter T are the two paragraphs of \u00a7 1381(a) making Part I of that subchapter applicable to two types of organizations: \u00a7 1381(a)(1) defines the first type as \u201cany organization exempt from tax under section 521 * * * ; \u201d \u00a7 1381(a)(2) defines the second type as <em>\u201cany </em>corporation operating on a cooperative basis other than an organization [specifying exceptions immaterial here].\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">To meet the \u201cexempt from tax under section 521\u201d language of \u00a7 1381(a)(1), an organization must meet certain organizational, operational, and quantitative requirements. The \u00a7 521 organization is required to be: (1) \u201corganized * * * on a cooperative basis\u201d (\u00a7 521(b)(1)), (2) \u201coperated on a cooperative basis\u201d (\u00a7 521(b)(1)), and (3), with respect to the quantitative requirement (transactions with nonmembers), \u201c[exemption shall not be denied any such association which markets the products of nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed the value of the products marketed for members * * * \u201d (\u00a7 521(b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">The \u00a7 1381(a)(2)-type organization is defined solely in terms of an operational requirement: \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d In marked contrast to \u00a7 1381(a)(1)\u2019s incorporation of \u00a7 521, Congress did not require that \u00a7 1381(a)(2)-organizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>transact more business with members than with nonmembers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That CCFA is \u201corganized\u201d on a cooperative basis is unquestioned. That it is \u201coperating\u201d on a cooperative basis is unquestioned, except for the amount of business done with nonmembers. If \u201coperated\u201d on a cooperative basis required that over 50% of business be done with members, the third requirement of \u00a7 521 would be superfluous. It is well established that statutes will not be interpreted as though Congress enacted superfluous provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Significance resides not only in Congress\u2019 inclusion of a quantitative requirement in \u00a7 1381(a)(1), and the absence thereof from the very next paragraph of the statute, but in the facility with which Congress has often stated quantitative requirements when it so intended. <em>See, e. g., </em>(1) 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 291 (quantitative requirement in definition of cooperative in Capper-Volstead federal antitrust exemption); (2) 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141j(a) (quantitative requirement in definition of cooperative for farm credit purposes); (3) 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2129 (quantitative requirement in definition of cooperative for borrowing from bank for cooperatives); (4) 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (quantitative requirement in definition of cooperative for ICC exemption); and (5) 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3015 (\u00a7 105(a), Pub.L. 95-351, 92 Stat. 499, 506 (August 20, 1978)) (quantitative requirement in definition of cooperative in National Consumer Cooperative Bank Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The sole basis for the government\u2019s contention that CCFA was not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis,\u201d lies in CCFA\u2019s having conducted more than 50% of its business with nonmembers in fiscal years 1970 and 1971. The government further argues that its Rev.Rul. 72-602, <em>supra </em>note 6, correctly interpreted \u00a7 1381(a)(2), because a \u201ctrue cooperative\u201d must operate \u201cprimarily\u201d on a cooperative basis to obtain the Subchapter T patronage dividend deduction, that is, \u201cthe cooperative must do over 50 percent in value of its business with members on a patronage dividend (f. e., nonprofit) basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The words of statutes, including the tax laws, \u201cshould be interpreted where possible in their ordinary, everyday senses.\u201d <em>Crane v. Commissioner, </em>331 U.S. 1, 6, 67 S.Ct. 1047, 1051, 91 L.Ed. 1301 (1947) (footnote omitted). Absent a contrary indication somewhere in the statute, the ordinary meaning of \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d includes the conduct of some operations on a cooperative basis. In its dealings with its members, CCFA was necessarily \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d That it was also operating on a for-profit basis, in its dealings with nonmembers, does not change the nature of its cooperative-type operations. The wording of \u00a7 1381(a)(2) is broad and comprehensive, reflecting a broad intent of Congress. It would do violence to that intent to read the statute, as the government would have us do, as though it contained words not present, <em>i. e., </em>as though it read \u201coperating primarily on a cooperative basis.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Congress having inserted no quantitative requirement in \u00a7 1381(a)(2), after having done so in \u00a7 1381(a)(1) and in so many other acts dealing with cooperatives, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>neither we nor the IRS are at liberty to make that insertion in \u00a7 1381(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Determination that the language of the statute itself imposes no quantitative requirement may be viewed as putting an end to inquiry. The statutory language appears unambiguous. Nonetheless, an illumination of congressional intent may on occasion be gleaned from legislative history. In this regard, the Supreme Court, in deciding tax questions, has frequently referred to legislative committee reports. <em>See, e. g., Don E. Williams Co. v. Commissioner, </em>429 U.S. 569, 97 S.Ct. 850, 51 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977); <em>Neuberger v. Commissioner, </em>311 U.S. 83, 61 S.Ct. 97, 85 L.Ed. 58 (1940); <em>Hassett v. Welch, </em>303 U.S. 303, 58 S.Ct. 559, 82 L.Ed. 858 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In the instant case, the House and Senate Reports referring to \u00a7 1381 state: \u201cThe tax treatment outlined here applies to the so-called tax-exempt farmers\u2019 cooperatives, to other farm cooperatives, to consumer cooperatives, and also to other corporations operating on a cooperative basis.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The recognition of different groups or classes of organizations, including three called \u201ccooperatives\u201d and one described as formed of \u201cother corporations\u201d which are \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d casts an uncertain light. The classes may be differentiated on the basis of title, <em>i. e., </em>\u201ctax-exempt,\u201d \u201cother farm,\u201d \u201cconsumer\u201d and \u201cother.\u201d They may also be differentiated on the existence of a. quantitative requirement thought to be inherent in the word \u201ccooperatives,\u201d and the absence of a quantitative requirement for \u201cother\u201d corporations which are not total \u201ccooperatives\u201d but are \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In all events, we find nothing in the legislative history of the applicable statutory provisions to indicate a congressional intent to insert a quantitative requirement in \u00a7 1381(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">The government also asserts, post-hoc, that the \u201cprimarily cooperative\u201d test of Rev.Rul. 72-602 was \u201csuggested by Congress\u201d in enacting the tax return filing deadline for Subchapter T cooperatives. I.R.C. \u00a7 6072(d) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6072(d))<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> allows a cooperative to file its tax return <em>9xh </em>months after the end of the tax year if it is \u201cunder an obligation to pay patronage dividends * * * in an amount equal to at least 50 percent of its net earnings from business done with or for its patrons * * From this provision for an extended filing deadline, the government constructs an argument concerning deductibility, saying \u00a7 6072(d) \u201cstrongly suggests that Congress expected that only corporations conducting at least half their business on a patronage, nonentrepreneurial basis would be entitled to such patronage deductions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">Section 6072(d), however, was passed simultaneously with Subchapter T and does not support the government\u2019s basic position in this case. That section grants an extend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ed filing deadline to those organizations \u201cdescribed in section 1381(a)\u201d which are under an obligation to pay, or did pay, patronage dividends equalling \u201cat least 50 percent of its net earnings from business done with or for its patrons.\u201d <em>Other </em>organizations \u201cdescribed in section 1381(a)(2)\u201d must meet the normal deadline. Thus \u00a7 6072(d) continues the distinction made in \u00a7 1381(a) between exempt and nonexempt earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The legislative committee reports further demonstrate the absence of merit in the government\u2019s \u00a7 6072(d) argument. The House and Senate Reports state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">6. <em>Returns of cooperatives. </em>\u2014 Because tax-exempt cooperatives under present law are given until 8V2 months after the end of the year to allocate, or pay, patronage dividends, they also have been given the same period of time in which to file their tax returns. This additional time is necessary since whether or not there is an allocation or payment of the dividends, determines the size of the taxable income of the cooperative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">Allowing taxable cooperatives this same time in which to make cash and qualified allocations of patronage dividend distributions, and to redeem non-qualified allocations, has presented the same filing problem in the case of their returns as well. Therefore, the bill provides that the tax return filing date for cooperatives generally is to be 8V2 months after the end of their taxable year. <em>However, to prevent an organization allocating relatively little of its income on a patronage basis from obtaining this postponement in the filing date for its return </em>[emphasis added], the bill limits this postponement to those organizations which are either exempt cooperatives or (1) are under an obligation to allocate, or pay, at least 50 percent of their net patronage earnings in patronage dividends or (2) actually allocated, or paid, at least that percentage of their earnings in patronage dividends during the last year in which they had any such earnings.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The quoted passage reflects the intent of Congress that an organization \u201callocating relatively little of its income on a patronage basis,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>less than 50%, would continue to be an organization under \u00a7 1381(a)(2), <em>i. e., </em>an organization \u201coperating on a cooperative basis,\u201d but that such organization would not be granted the extended filing date of \u00a7 6072(d). Though the section concerns quantity of income, rather than quantity of business in value done, it reflects congressional recognition that a nonexempt cooperative under \u00a7 1381(a)(2) may be doing relatively little patronage business, and to that extent argues against the government\u2019s basic position in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The phrase \u201coperating on a cooperative basis,\u201d though not specifically defined in the statute, is not, for the reasons outlined above, ambiguous. Our task is not to substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner, but to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s rule \u201cimplement[s] the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.\u201d <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. 299, 307, 88 S.Ct. 445, 450, 19 L.Ed.2d 537 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The language of \u00a7 1381(a)(2), and the legislative reports consistent therewith, impel the conclusion, however, that Rev. Rul. 72-602, <em>supra </em>note 6, is an unreasonable interpretation of the statute, making an unwarranted exception to the intent expressed in \u00a7 1382(b) by adding as it does a quantitative requirement in conflict with the intent of Congress. A revenue ruling cannot narrow the scope of a statute when Congress has intended otherwise. <em>Neuberger v. Commissioner, supra, </em>311 U.S. at 89, 61 S.Ct. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for plaintiff (CCFA).

The government\u2019s brief concedes that the payments CCFA made to its member-patrons \u201cmet the requirements for deductibility contained in Code Sections 1382 and 1388,\u201d and were thus \u201ctrue patronage dividends.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b690-12\">. We need not reach the question of whether the patronage dividends were deductible as \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d under I.R.C. \u00a7 162. The apparent anomaly is noted, however, in a denial of tax treatment of particular transactions as patronage dividends because of the nature of the organization, regardless of the nature of the transaction, and denial of tax treatment of the same transactions as ordinary and necessary expenses because of the nature of the transaction, regardless of the nature of the organization. A nonexempt cooperative doing 51% in value of its transactions with members, has the 49% of its transactions with nonmembers taxed on a for-profit basis. In the present case, the 60% of business done with nonmembers will be taxable on a for-profit basis. A nonexempt cooperative doing 99% in value of its business with nonmembers would have all of those transactions taxed on a for-profit basis. Tax treatment based on the nature of a cooperative\u2019s transactions would have at least the merit of placing substance over form. See, in another context, <em>Frank Lyon Co. v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 561, 572-73, 98 S.Ct. 1291, 55 L.Ed.2d 550 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b690-16\">.

On different facts, courts have faced the \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d question. <em>Brookings Plywood Corp. v. United States, </em>78-1 USTC \u00b6 19103, 40 AFTR 2d 77-6119 (D.Ore.1977), involved a nonexempt worker-owned cooperative, contending it was not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d because no patronage allocations to stockholder-employees were made in its records, no patronage dividends were paid, and the by-law requiring patronage dividends had been retroactively abolished. The court agreed. <em>Farmers Union Marketing &amp; Processing Assn. v. United States, </em>77-1 USTC <em>\u00b6 </em>9213, 39 AFTR 2d 77-9631 (D.Minn.1977), involved an agricultural cooperative, contending it was not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d because during two years in which it had net losses, no patronage dividends were paid. The court disagreed, holding that the test is not whether the cooperative actually paid patronage dividends but whether it would have been obligated to do so if it had made a profit. In both cases the phrase \u201coperating on a cooperative basis\u201d was interpreted without reference to the relative amount of business in value done with members and nonmembers. Indeed, both cases turned on whether patronage dividends were paid or owed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">. The government erects a straw man in arguing that AT&amp;T and General Motors could deduct payments to their customers or suppliers who are also stockholders if its position is not upheld. Such payments would not be to \u201cmembers\u201d and would not be the \u201ctrue patronage dividends\u201d involved here. Moreover, AT&amp;T and General Motors are to no extent \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d Nor are they likely, in view of federal antitrust law, to enter exclusive-dealing and non-competing agreements with any customers or suppliers. In all events, the IRS and the courts would have no difficulty in finding that such corporations were not \u201coperating on a cooperative basis.\u201d See, for examples of cases denying claims to cooperative status by organizations at least ostensibly so operating, <em>Mississippi Valley Portland Cement Co. v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 827 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 944, 89 S.Ct. 2015, 23 L.Ed.2d 462 (1969), and <em>Druggists\u2019 Supply Corp. v.
