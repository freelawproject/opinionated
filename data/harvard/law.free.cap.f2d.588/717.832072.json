We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">\n<em>Facts and Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts: Prior to bankruptcy, the creditor loaned $50,000 to the bankrupt. To secure repayment, the parties entered into a security agreement and filed a financing statement. The security agreement describes the collateral securing the loan as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">All of the furniture, fixtures, leasehold improvements, inventory, and accounts receivable . . . located at:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">California Pump &amp; Manufacturing Co., Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">436 Rozzi Place</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaX1\">So. San Francisco, CA 94080</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArG\">owned by the corporation . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">The financing statement contained a similar, though slightly different, description.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The operating equipment of the bankrupt, however, was located at the bankrupt\u2019s plant in Fresno, California and later in Hayward, California. It was never located at the South San Francisco address given in the security agreement and financing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">The property located in Fresno and Hayward is the subject of this appeal. Pursuant to a stipulation between the trustee and the creditor, the bankruptcy estate sold all the property of the bankrupt which had been located in Fresno and Hayward and is holding the net proceeds subject to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">\n<em>Security Agreement and Parol Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AnFM\">The creditor contends that parol evidence, had it been admitted by the court below, would have established that the parties intended to give the creditor a security interest in all the bankrupt\u2019s property including the Fresno-Hayward property. The trustee argues that parol evidence cannot be used to establish the creditor\u2019s claim to the Fresno-Hayward property. Of course, if it is determined that the creditor does not have a security interest in the disputed property enforceable against the bankrupt, the trustee, who succeeds to the rights and defenses of the bankrupt, would have a superior claim to that property. Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 70(c), 11 U.S.C. 110(c); <em>see </em>J. White and R. Summers, <em>Handbook of the Law Under the Uniform Commercial Code </em>866 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">The California Commercial Code requires that parties take certain steps to create an enforceable security interest. Section 9203 requires that the debtor sign a security agreement \u201cwhich contains a description of the collateral . . . .\u201d Section 9110 elaborates on what constitutes a sufficient description of the collateral:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-18\">[A]ny description of personal property or real estate is sufficient whether or not it is specific if it reasonably identifies what is described. Personal property may be referred to by general kind or class if the property can be reasonably identified as falling within such kind or class or if it can be so identified when it is acquired by the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-19\">Tested against the \u00a7 9110 standard, a description limited to property situated in South San Francisco does not \u201creasonably identify\u201d property actually located in Fresno or Hayward. Though \u00a7 9110 allows reference to personal property of a \u201cgeneral kind or class,\u201d we are unable to convert a clear and unambiguous designation of personal property located in a specific place into a description of all of the debtor\u2019s personal property wherever situated. When parties freely sign an agreement covering certain property, this court will not alter the clear language the parties employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-20\">The creditor argues that any defect in the description of the collateral can be cured by the introduction of parol evidence and reformation of the security agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>These arguments, however, do not find support either in the language of the California Commercial Code or in the cases which interpret it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Comment 3 to \u00a7 9203 indicates that one purpose of that section\u2019s formal requirements for the creation of a security interest is to minimize \u201cthe possibility of future dispute as to the terms of a security agreement and as to what property stands as collateral for the obligation secured.\u201d Comment 5 states in a similar vein that the requirement of a signed writing is in the \u201cnature of a statute of frauds.\u201d Clearly, these purposes would be undermined were this court to permit the creditor to adduce parol evidence in an attempt to alter the unambiguous language of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In discussing the statute of frauds aspects of \u00a7 9203, Professors White and Summers noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">[Presumably the written agreement must contain at least a general description which an objective observer would find to include the collateral in question. If it does not, the court should find that the writing requirement is not met and should not allow parol evidence further to define the type of collateral in fact covered by the security agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">White &amp; Summers, <em>supra </em>at 788. We approve of this statement. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the evidentiary purposes \u00a7 9203 is designed to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The approach urged by the creditor would prove detrimental not only to the goals of \u00a7 9203 but also to the fundamental goal that Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code, adopted by California, is intended to promote. As expressed in the comment to \u00a7 9101: \u201cThe aim of this Article is to provide a simple and unified structure within which the immense variety of present day financing transactions can go forward with less cost and with greater certainty.\u201d We would detract from commercial certainty were we to disregard the parties\u2019 written instruments and determine commercial relationships according to parol evidence. We thus hold that parol evidence may not be admitted to reform the instant security agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\"><em>In re Amex-Protein Development Corp., </em>504 F.2d 1056 (9th Cir. 1974), is consistent with our present holding. There a promissory note incorporated by reference invoices which described the collateral. Such incorporation being consonant with the liberal reading which \u00a7 9203 should be given, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-11\">[T]here is no requirement that the description of the collateral be complete within the four corners of the security agreement or other single document. The description in the security agreement is sufficient, however, if it provides such information as would lead a reasonable inquirer to the identity of the collateral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZD\"><em>Id. </em>at 1060. Here, however, the parties do not seek to incorporate documents. Rather, the creditor seeks to offer oral testimony to contradict the clear language of the agreement. Introduction of such parol evidence is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">We hold that the security agreement did not create a security interest in the Fresno-Hayward property. Therefore, we need not inquire into whether the elements necessary for perfection of that interest are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-13\">. The financing statement described the collateral as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">All furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory and accounts receivable owned by Debtor and located at 436 Rozzi Place, South San Francisco, California 94080.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">. The creditor argues that (1) reformation of the security agreement is appropriate, (2) parol evidence is admissible in a reformation action, and (3) the financing statement, as written, is sufficient to perfect the security agreement as reformed. His first two arguments, however, rely on common law decisions and general equitable principles rather than the statutes on secured transactions contained in the California Commercial Code. Though his third argument focuses on the relevant statutes, our holding <em>infra </em>makes any discussion of its merits unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-16\">. Moreover, the drafters of the Code \u201creduce[d] formal requisites to a minimum\u201d in order to obviate the need for judicial \u201cescape from the elaborate requirements\u201d antedating the UCC. \u00a7 9203, comment 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
