The arrest warrant involved was issued by a Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under the authority of \u00a7 561(c), Title 23, District of Columbia Code. It was the defendant\u2019s position at trial that such a warrant did not qualify as one issued under a \u201claw of the United States,\u201d within the terms of \u00a7 1071. After the jury had rendered its verdict, the defendant made a motion in arrest of judgment on this ground. The district court denied the motion and the defendant was subsequently sentenced. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The defendant raises as her single ground of appeal the contention that her conviction was improper, since the arrest warrant in question was not issued under a \u201claw of the United States.\u201d We do not find the contention persuasive. Under the terms of the District of Columbia Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Congress authorized Judges of the Superior Court of that District to issue search warrants subject to the procedures set out in Title 23 of that Code. In Title 23, Congress provided that an arrest warrant so issued by a Judge of such Superior Court could be directed to a \u201cspecific law enforcement officer\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defined in \u00a7 501(2) of the same Title to include, among others, \u201can investigative officer or agent of the United States,\u201d with the further provision that if the warrant covered a felony, it could \u201cbe served at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The arrest warrant in this case covered a felony and was directed to any United States Marshal. Such an arrest warrant, properly directed to an United States officer, and capable of being served \u201cat any place within the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is not confined in its authorization to the District of Columbia as a jurisdictional entity but its authority is as extensive as \u201cthe jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d A warrant, which, under the appropriate Congressional legislation, can thus be served by any officer of the United States anywhere in the United States, cannot be said, as the defendant argues, to be \u201cpurely one of local application within the District of Columbia,\u201d confined exclusively to the reaches of the District itself, and \u201cwithout any effect throughout the United States.\u201d In giving to such a warrant nation-wide reach, the Congress was exercising its power as a national and not as a strictly local legislature. Such an exercise of national power, it seems to us, qualifies as a \u201claw of the United States\u201d within the intendment of \u00a7 1071. The district court accordingly did not err in .so ruling, and the conviction of the defendant is</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-5\">. 11, District of Columbia Code \u00a7 941, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cSubject to title 23, judges of the Superior Court may, at any time, including Sundays and legal holidays, on complaint or application under oath or actual view, issue warrants for arrest ... in connection with crimes and offenses committed within the District of Columbia . . . .\u201d (July 29, 1970, Pub.L. 91-358, \u00a7 111, Title I, 84 Stat. 487).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-18\">. 23, District of Columbia Code \u00a7 561(c), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-19\">\u201cAn arrest warrant may be directed to a specific law enforcement officer or to any classifications of officers of the Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia or othe<em>r </em>agency authorized to make arrests or execute process.\u201d (July 29, 1970, Pub.L. 91-358, \u00a7 210(a), Title II, 84 Stat. 627).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-21\">. 23, District of Columbia Code \u00a7 563(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
