The answer to the question is complicated somewhat by the tortured, not to say obfuscating, legislative history of the FOIA so incisively remarked upon by Kenneth Culp Davis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But finding our way through the maze of the legislative history is not as difficult as first appears. We do find the information sought exempt as \u201ccommercial information obtained from any person and privileged or confidential\u201d under the fourth exemption to the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly we reverse the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Kevin T. Duffy, Judge, 453 F.Supp. 430 (S.D.N.Y.1978), which would have required such disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., which since 1936 has covered air carriers, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181, was enacted, among other reasons, as was its analogue the National Labor Relations Act, to prevent \u201cany limitation upon freedom of association among employees\u201d and to ensure \u201cthe prompt and orderly settlement\u201d of labor-management disputes. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each party has the right to designate its bargaining representative \u201cwithout interference, influence, or coercion by [the other] party,\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Third.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under <em>International Association of Machinists v. Street, </em>367 U.S. 740, 759, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961), construing 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Fourth,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is unlawful for carriers to interfere with an organization of employees or to influence or coerce them in an effort to induce them to join or not to join a labor organization or otherwise to interfere with employees\u2019 rights. These prohibitions are similar to those found in the somewhat better-known National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">The Board has two principal duties. First, upon request, it determines and certifies the bargaining representative of any class or craft of air or rail employees, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Ninth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It has adopted regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>lations set out in full in the margin<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> describing the procedure by which a party seeking certification as the bargaining representative for a \u201cclass or craft\u201d of employees may apply to the Board for an investigation to determine the representation wishes of the employees in the particular class or craft. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Ninth; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1203.2. Under the regulations the application must show specifically the name or description of the craft or class involved, the estimated number of employees in such craft or class, and the number of signed authorizations submitted from employees in each craft or class. <em>Id., </em>note 9 <em>supra. </em>Then, <em>after </em>the Board has made its investigation and determined the precise scope of the craft or class involved and whether there has been a \u201cshowing of proved authorizations from at least thirty-five percent of the employees in the craft or class,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1206.2(b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Board will authorize an election or determination proceeding. The thirty-five percent minimum requirement is not imposed upon the Board by statute; rather the Board has adopted it as a regulation presumably to avoid frivolous elections and determination proceedings. It is also significant to note that under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(b), the Board regulations require it to \u201ctreat as confidential the evidence submitted in connection with a representation dispute and the investigatory file pertaining to the representation function.\u201d Once the Board certifies a union based on a majority of the votes in an election or as above provided, the parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith on labor-management issues under judicial construction of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Second. <em>See, e. g., Pyzynski v. New York Central Railway, </em>421 F.2d 854 (2d Cir. 1970). It is only then that the Board\u2019s second principal function of providing mediation services to assist in settlement of labor-management disputes, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 155, 183, comes into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Intervenor-defendant-appellant here, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division (IBT), filed an application (sometimes called a petition) for investigation of representation on September 9,1977. The union sought a determination under the statute and regulations of the representation wishes of passenger service employees of American Airlines (American). A week after the filing the Board, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>its powers under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Ninth,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requested from American the number of its passenger service employees and whether they were already represented by a bargaining representative. In reply American provided the information as required but also demanded from the Board under the FOIA the number of authorization cards filed, the dates of such filings, the number of cards filed on each such date, the form or forms of the cards used, and the number of cards filed in each such form. Ultimately the Board did provide American with the date of filing of the cards and the forms of cards but on the basis of Exemptions 4 and 7(A) to the FOIA declined to provide the number of cards either in toto or by form of card.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because we hold that the forms were exempt under Exemption 4, we omit reference to Exemption 7(A), relating to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, as to which see our own <em>Title Guarantee Co. v. NLRB, </em>534 F.2d 484 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 834, 97 S.Ct. 98, 50 L.Ed.2d 99 (1976), and the more recent <em>NLRB v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978) (statements of employees in labor dispute under NLRA held to be exempt as gathered in the course of the Board\u2019s investigatory function).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">As action on the IBT petition proceeded, American contested the IBT\u2019s definition of the appropriate class or craft and requested a hearing on the issue. The hearing commenced in November, 1977, and concluded in March, 1978; although the parties had filed post-hearing briefs at the time this case was argued, the hearing officer had not as yet made any recommendation. Until the examiner makes his recommendation as to the appropriate class or craft and the Board acts upon the recommendation, the application is still \u201cpending,\u201d no election will be held, and, obviously, it would be impossible to determine whether the IBT had satisfied the Board\u2019s thirty-five percent requirement. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, it is not known whether the Board will order an election in accordance with the regulation above. Nevertheless, American commenced suit to compel the Board to disclose the information denied, and after the filing of appropriate cross-affidavits the district court granted American\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that the information did not \u201cconstitute commercial information in its ordinary sense\u201d within the meaning of Exemption 4 and that the representation investigation was not a \u201claw enforcement\u201d proceeding under Exemption 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">The affidavits filed by the Board and the union allege that disclosure during an organizing campaign of the number of authorization cards would disadvantage the union in a number of respects, e. <em>g., </em>by giving the employer an incentive to attempt to affect the timing of an election; by enabling the employer to convey the impression that unionization is a lost cause, that the employees should not make the effort, or that impending defeat would entail adverse consequences; or by assisting carrier resistance through the use of small selective layoffs or hirings. The affidavits also refer to raiding by other unions and damage to the union\u2019s credibility. American\u2019s affidavits disputed these propositions, but in the posture of the case we must accept them as true even though we might take them somewhat with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">As Professor Davis notes, <em>supra </em>note 2, the legislative history of Exemption 4 is confusing, if not misleading. Nevertheless, the case law has essentially followed the lead of the late Judge Thomas Croake of the Southern District of New York in <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Veterans Administration, </em>301 F.Supp. 796 (S.D.N.Y.1969), <em>appeal dismissed as moot, </em>436 F.2d 1363 (2d Cir. 1971), which rejected the argument that noncommercial or nonfinan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>cial information may be exempt if it is simply privileged or confidential and held that \u201c[t]he plain language of this section exempts only (1) trade secrets and (2) information which is (a) commercial or financial, (b) obtained from a person, and (c) privileged or confidential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802. As Judge Croake said, the exemption given by Congress does not apply to information [other than trade secrets] which does not satisfy the three requirements stated in the statute. <em>Id. </em>Judge Croake\u2019s construction was adopted in <em>Getman v. NLRB, </em>450 F.2d 670, 673, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 212 (1971) (list of names and addresses of employees which employers are required by law to give to the National Labor Relations Board not exempt where there was no express promise of confidentiality); and <em>Getman, </em>in turn, has been followed in <em>National Parks &amp; Conservation Association v. Morton, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 223, 224, 498 F.2d 765, 766 (1974) (information about national park concessions operated is \u201cfinancial\u201d but exempt only if also confidential); <em>Washington Research Project, Inc. v. HEW, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 176-177, 504 F.2d 238, 244-45 (1974) (information about certain research projects funded by HEW not a trade secret or commercial), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 963, 95 S.Ct. 1951, 44 L.Ed.2d 450 (1975); and <em>Brockway v. Department of Air Force, </em>518 F.2d 1184, 1188 (8th Cir. 1975) (witness\u2019s statements about airplane crash, even though given in confidentiality to safety investigators, were not exempt because not commercial or financial information). <em>See generally </em>Davis, <em>Administrative Law of the Seventies, supra </em>note 1, at \u00a7 3A.19. Thus it is not surprising that American argues here that the information it seeks is not \u201ccommercial information,\u201d a view adopted by Judge Duffy below, and that even if commercial the information is not \u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d because its disclosure will not impair the Government\u2019s ability to obtain such information in the future or subject the IBT to cognizable competitive harm. American concedes that the information was \u201cobtained from a person.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>The Freedom of Information Act: A Seven-Year Assessment, </em>74 Colum.L.Rev. 895, 948-53 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">The first question, then, is whether the number of authorization cards submitted is commercial information. The legislative history is of limited assistance to us because the words \u201ccommercial or financial\u201d were added to the 1964 bill, S. 1666, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), when it was reintroduced in 1965 as S. 1160, and the congressional reports on S. 1160 simply adopted the Senate Report on the 1964 bill, S.Rep.No.1219, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), without altering the commentary specifically to reflect the addition of these words, <em>see Consumers Union, supra, </em>301 F.Supp. at 802,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> except as below stated. Professor Davis considers Exemption 4 to be \u201cprobably the most troublesome provision in the Act,\u201d <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 3A.19, at 146 (1970 Supp.), and the professor\u2019s commentary plainly destroys the explanation of this language in the Attorney General\u2019s Memorandum which would have'exempted information that was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>even \u201ccommercial or financial.\u201d In the cases cited above, at least, the professor\u2019s views have carried the day with the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">This does not mean, however, that in seeking to determine the scope of the exemption for commercial information we can or should discard the legislative history altogether. Whatever other uncertainties may surround the \u201ccommercial or financial\u201d language, at least in the view of the House of Representatives it protects the confidentiality of the information that American seeks. The House Report, <em>see </em>note 13 <em>supra, </em>did amend the commentary to speak of \u201cdisclosures made in procedures such as the mediation of labor-management controversies\u201d and state that the exemption would mclude \u201cnegotiation positions or requirements in the case of labor-management mediations.\u201d Moreover, the House added this language to the Senate\u2019s legislative history after holding hearings on the bill and apparently in direct response to a request by a spokesperson for the National Mediation Board for express protection of labor-management mediation proceedings and information. The House took the view that the phrase \u201ccommercial or financial\u201d included labor-related information of this nature, <em>i. e., </em>pertaining to \u201cnegotiation positions\u201d (to which a representation election is a prelude). It amended the legislative history accordingly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In a statute with as con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>fused and tortured a legislative history as this one, one House\u2019s version must be accorded great weight, absent compelling contraindications, which American does not here provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Evidently the district court thought, and American argues, that the information sought is not commercial or financial because the IBT does not have profit as its primary aim. This interpretation gives much too narrow a construction to the phrase in question. \u201cCommercial\u201d surely means pertaining or relating to or dealing with commerce. Labor unions, and their representation of employees, quite obviously pertain to or are related to commerce and deal with the commercial life of the country. The cases on which American relies are entirely inapposite. <em>Getman v. NLRB, supra, </em>involving lists of employees\u2019 names and addresses, is the closest; but the employers there did not receive a promise of confidentiality, and the information in and of itself served no commercial function. Here the information sought directly affects the status of the union\u2019s effort to obtain majority support and ultimate certification. The Board has traditionally treated this information as confidential, and the union provides it under the express promise of confidentiality in the regulations above set forth. In <em>Washington Research Project, Inc., supra, </em>there was insufficient proof that the information was commercial; the court held that the National Institute of Mental Health scientists were not engaged in \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d or that in any event their commercial interest in their work was \u201cextremely remote.\u201d Here the commercial nature of the information is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">We cast aside as quite irrelevant to a construction of the FOIA American\u2019s reliance upon the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the exemption of labor organizations from the antitrust laws. The Clayton Act\u2019s exclusion of \u201clabor of a human being\u201d from regulation as a commodity or article of commerce does not detract from the clearly commercial nature of the activity of a labor organization seeking to organize and its substantial effect on commerce. American\u2019s reliance on the definition of a labor organization in the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(5)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is even less helpful to its position. That Act after all was enacted as an exercise of the Commerce power.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Relying upon the two-pronged test set forth originally by the District of Columbia Circuit (in an opinion written by Judge Lumbard of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation) and adopted for our circuit in <em>Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Co. v. SEC, </em>566 F.2d 373, 375 (2d Cir. 1977), American also argues that the information here submitted was not \u201cconfidential.\u201d In <em>Continental, we </em>said that \u201c[t]he information to be confidential must have the effect either (1) of impairing the government\u2019s ability to obtain information \u2014 necessary information \u2014 in the future, or (2) of causing substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.\u201d We do not dwell on the first prong of this test \u2014 the ability of the Government to obtain such information \u2014 because in the context of certifying a bargaining representative the Government of course can legitimately require disclosure. We also need not address the more recent criticism that both the courts and Professor Davis have leveled at the restrictiveness of the \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d concept. <em>See Washington Research Project, Inc. v. HEW, supra, </em>504 F.2d at 244; Davis, <em>Administrative Law of the Seventies </em>\u00a7 3A.19, at 91, because in this case we find that the standard was met. It seems apparent that the disclosure of this information which was supplied on a confidential basis would adversely affect the union\u2019s competitive position vis-avis both other unions and the employer itself. Not only does the union supply this information in reliance upon the promise in the regulations that the Board will keep the information confidential, a promise perhaps not binding upon the courts in their construction of the FOIA, although certainly entitled to the court\u2019s careful consideration,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but the information relates to the very delicate area of labor relations with which as we pointed out in <em>Title Guarantee, supra, </em>and the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra, </em>the courts should be very hesitant to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">What we have said suffices to reverse the judgment and support our holding that the information sought is exempt. We must comment, however, upon American\u2019s argument in its brief on appeal that the real purpose for which it seeks the information is to determine whether the Board is fraudulently or otherwise violating its regulations by ordering the initiation of investigations where the union has not satisfied the thirty-five percent showing of interest requirement. American says that it requested the information because it did \u201cnot wish[ ] to be subjected to a long, complicated, and expensive hearing as to what constitutes a craft or class unless the IBT has submitted the required percentage of authorizations to justify the initiation of such an investigation.\u201d There are two short and simple answers to this. First, as we sought to point out at the beginning of this opinion, the regulations do not require thirty-five percent authorizations at the time the Board initiates an investigation but at the time it orders an election. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1206.2, <em>supra </em>note 10. Second, if indeed, as American suggests, the Board has over an unspecified period of time acted arbitrarily by ignoring its own regulations and imposing a variety of unfair burdens on the air carriers, American already has sufficient information about past proceedings to prove this; and it does not need information about the current one. Indeed by its second FOIA request American sought the representation petitions in all 198 cases since July 4, 1967, including nine still pending, involving passenger service or seven other specified classes of air carrier employees. The Board, believing that certain records were no longer exempt, complied by releasing to American showings of interest in all cases closed by certification of a bargaining representative or closed more than two years before the request. Because the Board has commendably reached its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>determination that these materials may be disclosed, we need not decide whether it would have been required to do so under the FOIA. American can certainly evaluate the Board\u2019s compliance with the regulations on the basis of the information already disclosed; if it has a legitimate objection to the Board\u2019s actions, it can present it in an appropriate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Judgment reversed with directions to deny American\u2019s application for an order of disclosure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-12\">.

It exempts such material if it would not customarily be made public by the person from whom it was obtained by the Government. The exemption would include business sales statistics, inventories, customer lists, scientific or manufacturing processes or developments, and negotiation positions or requirements in the case of labor-management mediations. It would include information customarily subject to the doctor-patient, lawyer-client, or lender-borrower privileges such as technical or financial data submitted by an applicant to a Government lending or loan guarantee agency. It would also include information which is given to an agency in confidence, since a citizen must be able to confide in his Government. Moreover, where the Government has obligated itself in good faith not to disclose documents or information which it receives, it should be able to honor such obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b963-6\">. The text of the House Report, <em>supra </em>note 13, refers by way of footnote to testimony from the hearing before the House subcommittee that was considering the Freedom of Information Act. At that hearing H. T. Herrick, general counsel for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, appeared to request an expansion of Exemption 4 to reflect expressly the confidentiality of information acquired during mediation or conciliation of labor disputes. Mr. Herrick emphasized how dependent the mediator\u2019s effectiveness is on keeping the parties\u2019 confidences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-7\">[I]n any tabulation of the qualities that a mediator should have before he can be truly skilled, one thing is absolutely essential: He must be able to earn and keep the confidence of the parties. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-8\">. . . No mediator can possibly play this role if the parties think that the things he learns in confidence will be told to the public \u2014 which includes the party on the other side of the bargaining table.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Bills to Amend Section 161 of the Revised Statutes with Respect to the Authority of Federal Officers and Agencies to Withhold Information and Limit the Availability pf Records: Hearings on H.R.5012 <em>et al. </em>Before the Subcomm. on Foreign Operations and Government Information of the House Comm, on Government Operations, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 37 (1965) (statement of H. T. Herrick).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Mr. Herrick also explained the Service\u2019s regulation authorizing nondisclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-12\">We feel that labor and management and other interested parties must be assured that information which is given to Commissioners and other employees of the Service will not be disclosed, and the regulation goes on to classify the files, reports, letters, memorandums, et cetera, which are basically our case files.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 40. In response, Representative Monagan acknowledged that \u201cwhile a dispute is actively going on, . . . it would seem to me that there would not be much question about the fact that communications of the sort that you mentioned should be kept protected at that time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">Mr. Herrick addressed his comments to the original version of the bill, in which Exemption 4 did not contain the \u201ccommercial or financial\u201d language, apparently because at the time that the House Committee asked the Service to consider the proposed legislation, the bills had not yet been amended. By the time the hearings were held, however, the bill had been amended to include the disputed \u201ccommercial or financial\u201d language, although apparently no one alerted Mr. Herrick to this development. Under the Service\u2019s proposal to amend the earlier version of the act the exemption would have read \u201c[t]rade secrets and other information obtained from the public and customarily privileged or confidential, or information acquired during mediation or conciliation of labor disputes.\u201d The Service also requested incorporation of the following language into the committee report of the legislative history: \u201cThe exception would also include information given to Federal mediators in the regular performance of their duties in mediating and conciliating labor disputes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. These changes were required, Mr! Herrick felt, to make it clear that the relationship between the mediator and the disputants was included in the exemption for the traditionally privileged information between lawyer and client to which the Senate Report already referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">At the conclusion of Mr. Herrick\u2019s statement, Representative Griffin expressed his agreement with Mr. Herrick\u2019s position: \u201cI think there is [a lawyer-client] relationship that the mediator has with the parties to collective bargaining. Even though they might both be present, they are dealing jointly on a confidential basis within the room where the bargaining is taking place. I do not think that either party would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>expect that what they are saying within the confines of that room would be made public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45. At the conclusion of the hearing, Representative Griffin assured Mr. Herrick that \u201cI feel confident that some of the committee, if it does enact this legislation, would certainly implement your suggestion in someway to make sure that that is done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">As noted above, the House Report did in fact refer to Mr. Herrick\u2019s testimony as support for its exemption from disclosure of the mediation of labor-management controversies as \u201ccommercial or financial information obtained from any person and privileged or confidential.\u201d Thus, by incorporating the reference in the legislative history to labor mediation even while retaining the newly amended \u201ccommercial or financial information\u201d clause, the House, it may be inferred, \u201cintended\u201d that matters pertaining to labor mediation were exempt as \u201ccommercial.\u201d This history cannot be considered conclusive, however, for there is nothing in the legislative history by which the Senate may be said to have acquiesced in this interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b964-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-8\">The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.
