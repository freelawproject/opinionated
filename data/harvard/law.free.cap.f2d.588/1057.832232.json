Participation in this school breakfast program is voluntary, but Congress left it unclear whether the choice to participate is to be made by the individual school, the local school board, or the state. A Texas state statute requires certain school districts to participate. One of those districts, the Garland Independent School District (GISD), resisted and filed this suit in federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief. GISD named state education authorities as defendants and claimed that the Texas statute is unconstitutional because it conflicts with the federal program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and GISD appeals. We are faced with a question of standing as well as the substantive issue of whether the Texas statute violates federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-16\">The school breakfast program is one of several federal programs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> designed to improve the nutrition of school children. It is administered by the Department of Agriculture. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1771, 1779. Participating schools must agree to abide by several regulations governing the quality and availability of the breakfasts. <em>See generally </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.8. Children from poorer families are eligible to receive the breakfasts free or at a reduced price. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 220.19, 245.1-245.11. A participating school receives a subsidy for each breakfast it serves; free breakfasts, naturally, are subsidized at a higher rate than reduced price or full-price breakfasts. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-17\">Federal law does not require any school, school district, or state to participate in the breakfast program. But in 1977, Texas enacted a statute, \u00a7 21.914 of Title 2 of its Education Code, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-18\">If at least 10 percent of the students enrolled in one or more schools in a school district are eligible for free or reduced-price breakfasts under the national school breakfast program . . . the governing board of the district shall participate in the program and make the benefits of the program available to all eligible students in said schools.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-20\">GISD does not currently serve breakfasts in its schools and does not wish to subscribe to the federal breakfast program. Section 21.-914, however, would require GISD to serve federally subsidized breakfasts in at least twenty-two of its schools. GISD says that in order to do so it would have to spend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>approximately $26,000 to modify its buildings and purchase new equipment, and then spend an additional $114,000 annually for salaries and utilities. These expenses, it says, would not be covered by federal reimbursements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">GISD claimed that \u00a7 21.914 is void under the supremacy clause because it conflicts with the statutes establishing the federal school breakfast program and with regulations issued pursuant to those statutes. Specifically, GISD says that the state statute, mandating the participation of certain school districts, conflicts with the federal statute and regulations, which, according to GISD, give it the right to refuse to participate. The members of GISD Board of Trustees in their official capacities joined in the suit, as did several taxpayers in the Garland School District. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that none of the plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit; it also ruled that there was no conflict between \u00a7 21.914 and the federal program. For reasons we give in the next section we believe that plaintiff GISD has standing. Since the district court had jurisdiction over GISD\u2019s claim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we can reach the merits without deciding whether the suit could have been brought by taxpayers of the GISD or by members of the GISD board of trustees suing in their official capacities. On the merits we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">Texas asserts that GISD has no standing to bring this suit. Texas relies entirely on a line of cases which, it claims, hold that a municipality has no standing to sue the state of which it is a creature, <em>see, e. g., Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>289 U.S. 36, 40, 53 S.Ct. 431, 77 L.Ed. 1015 (1933); <em>City of Trenton v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 187, 43 S.Ct. 534, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923), and argues that these decisions require us to deny standing to a political subdivision attempting to sue the state that created it. But before we can discuss these decisions, we must decide whether GISD can bring this suit under the more general principles developed by the Supreme Court to govern standing in all federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-12\">Three of those principles are particularly important here. First, in order to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must allege \u201ca distinct and palpable injury\u201d to itself. <em>E. g., Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Second, ordinarily a plaintiff \u201cmust assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 95 S.Ct. at 2205. Third, a claim must present a genuine, live case or controversy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under Article III.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case GISD has alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>$26,000, plus $114,000 annually, worth of \u201cthreatened or actual injury,\u201d <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). This satisfies the first requirement, but the other two criteria pose more difficult problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\">It might be argued, for example, that GISD is asserting not its own rights but the rights of its trustees, who are legally third parties. GISD seems to assert, and can plausibly assert,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> only one right allegedly arising under the federal breakfast statutes \u2014 the right to decide, on the local level, whether to accept the breakfast program. This right, instead of belonging to the GISD itself, may belong to the members of the GISD board of trustees; there is some authority that members of a governmental body have an \u201cinterest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,\u201d <em>Coleman v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 433, 438, 59 S.Ct. 972, 975, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939), which entitles them to sue if the body is deprived of some lawful prerogative. <em>See id. </em>(state legislators); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 511 F.2d 430 (1974) (United States Senators). See <em>also Board of Educ. v. Allen, </em>392 U.S. 236, 241 n.5, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968) (school board members\u2019 oath to support Constitution gives them standing to challenge constitutionality of statute they must administer). If this right does belong solely to the members of the GISD board of trustees, the GISD itself ordinarily<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would be barred from asserting it by the principle that a party can assert only its own claims and not those of a third party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">We believe, however, that the policies underlying this principle dictate that the GISD itself be allowed to assert the supposed right to decide whether to accept the breakfast program. For example, one reason for prohibiting a litigant from asserting another person\u2019s rights is to ensure that the inappropriate party cannot force an issue to be decided in court, or, as the Supreme Court has said, to \u201cavoid . the adjudication of rights which those not before the Court may not wish to assert.\u201d <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study </em>Group, 438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). For better or worse, it is a premise of the federal judicial system that not all disputes are to be resolved in court. And this premise suggests that if a dispute can be resolved in some other way to the satisfaction of those most concerned, that resolution should not be upset by a court. The limits on asserting third parties\u2019 rights ensure that such a resolution will not be upset by those whom the legislature was not interested in protecting. <em>Cf. </em>Stewart, The Reformation of American Administrative Law, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 1667, 1735-36 (1975) (requirement of an actual injury protects such resolutions from being upset by those who are not affected at all). Of course, these principles do not excuse or justify a narrow and cramped approach to standing that excludes persons who are en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>titled to relief and can gain it only in a court. And in many cases it will be appropriate, for a variety of reasons, to permit a litigant to assert another party\u2019s rights. <em>See generally </em>Note, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 423 (1974). In theory, however, a principal purpose of standing doctrine is to prevent the inappropriate party from forcing a judicial resolution of an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">When we apply this theory to GISD\u2019s claim we are compelled to conclude that the GISD is an appropriate party to force a judicial resolution of the issue it raises. GISD alleges that Congress has made it the proper body to decide at least some significant questions under the breakfast program. This is not a frivolous allegation, so for the purposes of deciding this preliminary question of standing we must assume that it is correct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If Congress did repose such powers in the GISD, it plainly wanted GISD to affect decisions about whether and when the program was adopted. This suggests that Congress would not have objected to GISD\u2019s forcing a judicial resolution of a conflict between itself and the state over this issue. By contrast, a suit by an interested outsider might upset a political accommodation acceptable to GISD, the party which, by hypothesis, is entitled to decide what should be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">We are led to the same conclusion\u2014 that GISD should be allowed to bring this suit \u2014 by another policy underlying the rule against claiming third parties\u2019 rights. One reason to confer standing on a party is to encourage the court to approach the case from that party\u2019s point of view; the rule against asserting third parties\u2019 rights is intended partly to ensure that the court will approach the case from the point of view of those whom Congress wants to aid or protect or whose rights Congress wants to vindicate. A case arising under a statute restricting a bank\u2019s activities, for example, may appear in one light when seen from the point of view of the bank\u2019s competitors and quite another from the perspective of the bank\u2019s customers. The decision whether the customers or competitors have standing to raise a claim is important partly because it affects the way the court is likely to focus on the issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-23\">In this case the most appropriate perspective for us to adopt in focusing on the issues is that of the GISD. The issue in this case is whether GISD or the state has been empowered, by Congress, to make a certain central decision about the breakfast program. The school board and the state represent different political interests with different degrees of influence; a group can be a statewide minority, for example, but a majority in certain localities. The issue we must decide, then, is which particular combination of interests Congress intended to protect and promote. We can best focus on this issue by having before us the repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>sentatives of the two competing combinations of interests. In other words, the school board itself should assert the plaintiff\u2019s case. The perspective we might adopt if a taxpayer brought this suit, for example, might be significantly different, and would be less likely to focus our attention on the combination of interests Congress was attempting to protect when, and if, it empowered the school board to accept or reject the breakfast program.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For these reasons, the rule against asserting third parties\u2019 claims does not bar GISD from bringing this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">There remains only the third requirement; this litigation must present a genuine case or controversy under Article III. One aspect of the requirement of a genuine case or controversy is the principle that a federal court may not resolve \u201chypothetical or contingent questions.\u201d <em>Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, </em>325 U.S. 450, 461, 65 S.Ct. 1384, 89 L.Ed. 1725 (1945). Nor may a federal court render advisory opinions. <em>E. g., Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950-51, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968); <em>United States v. Freuhauf, </em>365 U.S. 146, 81 S.Ct. 547, 554, 5 L.Ed.2d 476 (1961). As the Supreme Court has recently emphasized in a context that is only slightly different, an injured party cannot sue unless \u201cthe exercise of the Court\u2019s remedial powers would redress the claimed injuries.\u201d <em>See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2631, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). There must be a \u201csubstantial probability . . . that, if the court affords the relief requested,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 legal injuries will be remedied. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 504, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2208, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">In the case before us it might be thought that our judgment is unlikely to relieve the plaintiffs\u2019 injury because Texas can defeat any judgment simply by abolishing the GISD. For this reason, it might be argued, our decision would be purely advisory, or at least \u201chypothetical and contingent,\u201d and the requirements of Article III would be unmet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">It is, to be sure, undisputed that Texas can abolish the GISD.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>States Constitution contains no general<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> limit on a state\u2019s ability to abolish or reorganize a municipality or another political subdivision like a school district. <em>See e. g., Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 46, 52 L.Ed. 151 (1907). But it scarcely follows that because Texas can, in this sense, circumvent our judgment, our judgment would be only advisory or hypothetical. Texas can abolish the GISD only by enacting a statute; an administrative regulation will not suffice. <em>See </em>Tex.Educ. Code Ann. tit. 2, \u00a7 11.14. Moreover, the GISD performs a variety of functions connected with education. <em>See </em>p. 1065 <em>infra. </em>If Texas abolished the GISD it would presumably have to undertake many of those functions itself, and to that extent administer Garland schools directly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is a heavy price to pay to avoid a judgment dealing with only one aspect of education. The political difficulty of passing a statute abolishing GISD in the face of the well-known tradition of local autonomy in education, and the burdens Texas would have to bear if it did take over a GISD\u2019s functions directly, convince us that there is at least a \u201csubstantial probability,\u201d <em>see Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2208, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), that GISD would receive the fruits of a favorable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">The relatively few Supreme Court decisions addressing this issue reinforce our conclusion. The Court has indicated its willingness to decide a suit between states for money damages, in its original jurisdiction, even if it has no way to enforce its award against a recalcitrant loser, <em>see e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, </em>192 U.S. 286, 24 S.Ct. 269, 275-77, 48 L.Ed. 448 (1904); the Court said that it was prepared to \u201crely on the good faith of state governments or other public bodies to respond to its judgments.\u201d <em>Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, </em>370 U.S. 530, 571, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 1483-84, 8 L.Ed.2d 671 (1962) (plurality opinion). Here we have, as surety for Texas\u2019s good faith, the difficulty \u2014 practical and political \u2014 of circumventing our decision. Similarly, in <em>Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, </em>370 U.S. 530, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 8 L.Ed.2d 671 (1962), the Supreme Court agreed to review decisions of the Court of Claims even though large money judgments could, at that time, be enforced against the United States only if Congress specifically appropriated the funds. <em>See id. </em>at 1482-84.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court said that \u201cCongress . . . has sought to avoid interfering with\u201d the collection of Court of Claims judgments, and that historically parties awarded money judgments against the United States have had far more success in collecting than parties who won in private litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1483. Similarly, the tradition of local autonomy in education seems long and powerful in Texas. <em>See generally San Antonio Ind. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 6-7, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). Moreover, the <em>Glidden </em>court distinguished an earlier case, <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>69 U.S. (2 Wall.) 561, 117 U.S. 697 (1885), in which the Supreme Court had refused to take jurisdiction over appeals of the Court of Claims when that court\u2019s judgments could be revised by the Secretary of the Treasury. This suggests that we should be influenced by the fact that the GISD can be abolished only by statute, not by an administrative rule or fiat. <em>See </em>p. 1064 <em>supra. See also Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 437, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948). Finally, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number><em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), the Supreme Court acknowledged that the President could \u201ctheoretically\u201d revoke the regulation empowering the Watergate Special Prosecutor; but at least until the President did so, the Court held, litigation between the Special Prosecutor and the President was a justiciable controversy. <em>Id. </em>at 695-97, 94 S.Ct. 3090. The Court did mention that \u201cthe delegation of authority to the Special Prosecutor . . . [was] not an ordinary delegation by the Attorney General to a subordinate officer\u201d because regulations provided that the special prosecutor was not to be removed without a \u201cconsensus\u201d of certain members of Congress. 418 U.S. at 696, 94 S.Ct. at 3102.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But as we have noted, p. 1064 <em>supra, </em>Texas can disestablish the GISD only by passing a statute, not by administrative action. Moreover, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon </em>the Court emphasized \u201cthe unique facts of this case\u201d; this may suggest that the key to the decision was the political cost of dismissing the Special Prosecutor. <em>See </em>The Supreme Court, 1973 Term, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 41, 52-53 (1974). For all of these reasons, the danger that our opinion will prove to be only advisory or hypothetical does not deter us from allowing GISD to bring this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">Closely related to the proscription of advisory opinions, however, is the principle that a federal court may not decide a case unless it \u201cpresents] a real and substantial controversy,\u201d <em>Poe v. Ullmann, </em>367 U.S. 497, 509, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1759, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (Brennan, J., concurring); in particular we may not decide a case in which one party \u201chas no active participation\u201d and \u201cover which [it] has exercised no control.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>319 U.S. 302, 304-05, 63 S.Ct. 1075, 1076, 87 L.Ed. 1413 (1943). Some state agencies may well be so closely identified with the state government, and so thoroughly controlled by the body they are suing that the litigation amounts to a suit by the state against itself; such a suit lacks the live adversariness we must find before we can entertain a case. <em>See South Spring Hill Gold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., </em>145 U.S. 300, 12 S.Ct. 921, 36 L.Ed. 712 (1892) (Court will not decide case in which plaintiff in error and defendant in error are controlled by same persons). <em>See also Fenner v. Continental Diving Service, Inc., </em>543 F.2d 1113 (5th Cir. 1976). The GISD is not this sort of agency, however. Both legally and practically, the GISD seems sufficiently independent of the state of Texas to ensure that a suit between them will be a genuinely adversary contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Legally, independent school districts in Texas have a variety of powers. They perform \u201call educational functions not specifically delegated\u201d to the state education agencies. Tex.Educ.Code Ann., tit. 2, \u00a7 11.-01. They are specifically empowered to make contracts, <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23.26, 23.28, to levy and collect taxes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 23.27, to obtain property by eminent domain, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 23.31, and generally \u201cto manage and govern the public free schools of the district,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 23.26(b). They can sue and be sued. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 23.26(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">The state can, to be sure, supervise the local boards to some degree. The state education authorities may review local school boards\u2019 decisions, Tex.Educ.Code Ann., tit. 2, \u00a7 11.13, and the local boards are bound by regulations issued by the state agency, <em>Bear v. Donna Ind. School Dist., </em>85 S.W.2d 797, 798 (Tex.Civ.App.1935). But local boards are then free to attack the state agency\u2019s decisions in court. <em>See e. g., Board of Trustees v. Briggs, </em>486 S.W.2d 829 (Tex.Civ.App.1972). Thus it seems clear that local boards have some significant legal rights that the state agency cannot take away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-11\">As a practical matter, too, local school boards seem likely to enjoy a good deal of freedom from state authorities. The mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>bers of the local boards are elected by the people of the district, not appointed from above. Tex.Educ.Code Ann., tit. 2, \u00a7 23.-10(b). Moreover, the local boards have their own funds. They can levy and collect taxes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 23.27, and funds disbursed by the state to the districts become the property of the local board of trustees, which holds them in trust for the district; they cannot be taken away by the state. <em>Wright v. Houston Ind. School Dist., </em>393 F.Supp. 1149, 1155 (S.D.Tex.1975), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>569 F.2d 1383 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Love v. City of Dallas, </em>120 Tex. 351, 40 S.W.2d 20, 26 (1931). Thus in addition to its independent legal powers, the GISD seems likely to have a mind of its own; we think it improbable that its litigation will be controlled by the state authorities to any significant extent. We conclude, then, that GISD is sufficiently independent of the state of Texas to bring this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">This conclusion is supported, by analogy, by two recent Supreme Court decisions. In these decisions, the Court relied heavily on the premise that the actions of a school district are not to be treated as if they were the direct actions of the state. In other words, the school district and the state were to be treated as separate entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">In <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973), the Supreme Court upheld Texas\u2019s system of financing public education. Under that system a substantial portion of each school district\u2019s expenditures is financed by an ad valorem property tax levied by the district. Because the property in some districts has a higher assessed value, there are wide disparities in per-pupil expenditures among the school districts. The Court rejected a number of constitutional challenges to these inequalities, among them the argument that \u201cthe Texas system is unconstitutional . because it allows . . the quality of education to fluctuate on the basis of the fortuitous positioning of boundary lines of political subdivisions.\u201d 411 U.S. at 53, 93 S.Ct. at 1307. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-7\">[A]ny scheme of local taxation \u2014 indeed the very existence of identifiable local governmental units \u2014 requires the establishment of jurisdictional boundaries that are inevitably arbitrary. It is equally inevitable that some localities are going to be blessed with more taxable assets than others. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 93 S.Ct. at 1307; <em>see McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 427, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); <em>cf. Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, 707-09 (1962), (Clark, J., concurring) (inequalities in legislative apportionment unconstitutional because unrelated to any coherent theory of representing local units of government); <em>Mahan v. Howell, </em>410 U.S. 315, 325-26, 93 S.Ct. 979, 985, 35 L.Ed.2d 320 (1973) (\u201cmaintaining the integrity of political subdivision lines\u201d justifies significant deviation from equality in apportionment of state legislature). It seems likely, however, that the Court accepted these disparities only because they resulted from an established system in which each school district regulated some of its own affairs. In other words, if there were no school districts and the state itself assessed and collected all taxes and then directly financed all public education in such a highly disparate fashion \u2014 in which expenditures varied not just according to various residents\u2019 willingness to tax themselves but according to the value of neighboring property \u2014 we strongly suspect that the Court would not have accepted the disparities. If we are correct, then the <em>Rodriguez </em>Court was refusing to treat the actions of school districts as if they were the direct acts of the state itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\"><em>Milliken v. Bradley, </em>418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974), also suggests that school districts\u2019 actions are not to be treated as if they were the direct acts of the state. <em>Milliken </em>held that a federal court\u2019s remedy for unconstitutional school segregation had to take account of school district lines drawn by the state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-10\">Before the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>cross-district remedy, it must first be shown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant segregative effect in another district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-5\">The [district] court\u2019s analytical starting point was its conclusion that school district lines are no more than arbitrary lines on a map drawn \u201cfor political convenience.\u201d . . [This] notion that school district lines may be casually ignored or treated as a mere administrative convenience is contrary to the history of public education in our country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 744-45, 741, 94 S.Ct. at 3125, 3127.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\"><em>Milliken </em>did not, however, suggest that a state might insulate itself from a decree remedying its own constitutional violations merely by drawing \u201carbitrary lines on a map,\u201d see 418 U.S. at 741, 94 S.Ct. at 3125. Rather, the <em>Milliken </em>Court emphasized that school districts are traditional units of local government, see 418 U.S. at 741-42, 94 S.Ct. at 3125-3126, with a variety of functions, see <em>id. </em>at 742, 94 S.Ct. at 3126, n. 20, and subject to local control, see <em>id. </em>at 742, 94 S.Ct. at 3126, and suggested that for these reasons a school district\u2019s violations were to be attributed only to it and not to the state. <em>See id. </em>at 770, 777-79, 94 S.Ct. at 3139, 3143-44 (White, J., dissenting). <em>Milliken </em>and <em>Rodriguez, </em>then, agree on a central principle: the actions of certain sorts of political subdivisions are not always to be treated as if they were the direct acts of the state itself. It follows that the decision to sue Texas which was made by the GISD \u2014 a subdivision much like those involved in <em>Milliken </em>and Rodriguez<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>\u2014 was not a decision by the state to sue itself but the decision of a government that is treated, for at least some constitutional purposes, as an independent actor. Strictly as a matter of logic, it does not follow that the state and the school district are distinct entities for Article III purposes. But the analogy to <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Milliken </em>does support our conclusion that we are presented with a sufficiently live controversy under Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">Under the criteria normally governing standing to sue in federal court, then, GISD would be able to bring this suit against Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">Texas, however, cites a series of Supreme Court decisions which seem to hold that a municipality<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> cannot sue the state that created it. In some of these cases the state altered the municipality\u2019s boundaries or consolidated different municipalities; <em>Hunter v. Pittsburgh, </em>207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151 (1907), is usually considered the leading example.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In other cases, of which <em>Trenton v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 43 S.Ct. 534, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923) is typical, the state attempted to modify a grant or charter it had previously given to the municipality.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Invariably federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>courts have ruled against the municipality\u2019s claim that the state actions violated the municipality\u2019s rights under the contract clause, <em>see, e. g., Railroad Comm\u2019n v.

Mayor of Baltimore, </em>289 U.S. 36, 53 S.Ct. 431, 77 L.Ed. 1015 (1933); <em>City of Newark v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 192, 43 S.Ct. 539, 67 L.Ed. 943 (1923); <em>Williams v.

While these cases do not always speak of standing, the Supreme Court has said that \u201c[bjeing but creatures of the State, municipal corporations have no standing to invoke the contract clause or the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution in opposition to the will of their creator.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 433, 441, 59 S.Ct. 972, 976, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939). And these decisions are frequently said to establish that a municipality has no standing to sue the state that created it. <em>See, e. g., Aguayo v. Richardson, </em>473 F.2d 1090, 1100 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1146, 94 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed.2d 101 (1974); P. Bator et al., Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System (2d ed.) 182 (1973). Some of the language in the opinions is indeed broad enough to support this interpretation. <em>See, e. g., Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>289 U.S. 36, 40, 53 S.Ct. 431, 432, 77 L.Ed. 1015 (1933) (\u201cA municipal corporation, created by a state for the better ordering of government, has no privileges or immunities under the Federal Constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the will of its creator.\u201d); <em>City of Trenton v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 187, 43 S.Ct. 534, 537, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923) (\u201c[A] municipality is merely a department of the state, and the state may withhold, grant or withdraw powers or privileges as it sees fit. However great or small its sphere of action, it remains the creature of the state exercising and holding powers and privileges subject to the sovereign will.\u201d). <em>See also Hunter v. Pittsburgh, </em>207 U.S. 161, 178-79, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">We believe, however, that these decisions, properly interpreted, do not require us to deny GISD standing in this case. The Supreme Court itself said, in a somewhat different context from that facing us here, that \u201ca correct reading of the seemingly unconfined dicta of <em>Hunter </em>and kindred cases is not that the State has plenary power to manipulate in every conceivable way, for every conceivable purpose, the affairs of its municipal corporations, but rather that the State\u2019s authority is unrestrained by the particular prohibitions of the Constitution considered in those cases.\u201d <em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot, </em>364 U.S. 339, 344, 81 S.Ct. 125, 128, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960). We agree. We think these cases are substantive interpretations of the constitutional provisions involved; we do not think they hold that a municipality never has standing to sue the state of which it is a creature. In fact, correctly interpreted, these cases do not deal with \u201cstanding,\u201d in the sense in which we use the term, at all. We reach these conclusions for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>line of cases are descendents of <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819). That great case prohibited New Hampshire from modifying a charter that the colonial government had issued to Dartmouth College. Applying the contract clause to the charters and grants of a government, however, created a serious problem; many state actions might be said to be contracts with those who benefitted from them, and a state barred from impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>ing any such contract would be practically unable to legislate in large, important areas.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-4\">[T]he word \u201ccontract,\u201d in its broadest sense, would comprehend the political relations between the government and its citizens, would extend ... to many of those laws concerning civil institutions, which must change with circumstances, and be modified by ordinary legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amf\"><em>Id. </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 627, 4 L.Ed. at 657. Such an interpretation of the contract clause, said Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, \u201cwould be an unprofitable and vexatious interference with the internal concerns of a state,\u201d and would be \u201cunnecessary, . . . mischievous, and . . . repugnant to [the] general spirit\u201d of the Constitution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">To solve this problem the <em>Dartmouth College </em>Court distinguished between two types of state actions. The contract clause applied to grants of \u201cprivate\u201d powers, or grants to private institutions. Allocations and regulations of \u201cpolitical\u201d powers, however, were exempt from the contract clause. 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 630, 629, 4 L.Ed. at 657. And while <em>Dartmouth College </em>itself dealt with the contract clause alone, Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s reasoning was broader; he erected the general principle that the entire Constitution does not interfere in a state\u2019s internal organization of its political functions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">[T]he framers of the constitution did not intend to restrain the states in the regulation of their civil institutions, adopted for internal government, and the instrument they have given us is not to be so construed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-9\">If the act . . . be a grant of political power, if it create a civil institution to be employed in the administration of government . . . the subject is one in which the legislature of the state may act according to its own judgment, unrestrained by any limitation of its power imposed by the constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 629-630, 4 L.Ed. at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-14\">As we read them, the <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>line of cases are simply faithful to this principle of <em>Dartmouth College. </em>They hold that the Constitution does not interfere in the internal political organization of states. Decisions in the <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>line dealing with claims under the equal protection or due process clauses, <em>see </em>pp. 1067-68 <em>supra, </em>extend this principle to the fourteenth amendment. In some respects the Court has retreated from this absolute position, <em>see, e. g. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, </em>364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960); <em>id. </em>at 128-29 (citing cases), but these retreats are not our present concern. Our point is that <em>Hunter, Trenton, </em>and allied cases are substantive holdings that the Constitution does not interfere in states\u2019 internal political organization. They are not decisions about a municipality\u2019s standing to sue its state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-15\"><em>Hunter </em>itself confirms our view; it continues the <em>Dartmouth College </em>distinction between allocations of political or public powers, on the one hand, and allocations of private powers, on the other. After a classic description of the unlimited power of states over municipalities, the <em>Hunter </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-16\">It will be observed that, in describing the absolute power of the state over the property of municipal corporations, we have not extended it beyond the property held and used for governmental purposes. Such corporations are sometimes authorized to hold and do hold property for the same purposes that property is held by private corporations or individuals. . it has been held that, as to the latter class of property, the legislature is not omnipotent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-17\">28 S.Ct. at 47. <em>See also City of Trenton v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 43 S.Ct. 534, 537-38, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923). The Court went on to acknowledge, implicitly, that a municipality could raise the claim that its \u201cprivate\u201d contract and property rights had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>been impaired. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This acknowledgement is, of course, flatly inconsistent with the position that a municipality can never sue the state that created it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">The opinions in the <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>line do occasionally \u2014 but by no means uniformly \u2014 speak of \u201cstanding,\u201d and deny that a municipality has \u201cstanding\u201d to sue the state. But when those cases were decided, \u201cstanding\u201d generally meant something somewhat different from what it means today. A party had standing \u2014 or a \u201cright to sue\u201d \u2014 if it was correct in its claim on the merits that the statutory or constitutional provision in question protected its interests; standing was not seen as a preliminary or threshold question. <em>See, e. g. Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA, </em>306 U.S. 118, 139-40, 59 S.Ct. 366, 83 L.Ed. 543 (1939); <em>Ashwander v. TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 343, 56 S.Ct. 466, 481, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting); Albert, Standing to Challenge Administrative Action: An Inadequate Surrogate for Claims for Relief, 83 Yale L.J. 425, 427-42 (1974). In speaking of \u201cstanding,\u201d cases in the <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>line meant only that, on the merits, the municipality had no rights under the particular constitutional provisions it invoked. This is why the <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>series of cases did not mention the criteria we now associate with inquiries into standing \u2014 the extent of an actual injury and of a genuine case or controversy, for example. When we applied these criteria, <em>see </em>pp. 1060-67, <em>supra, we </em>found no bar to conferring standing on GISD in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">The <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>cases, then, do not deal with standing; they adhere to the substantive principle that the Constitution does not interfere with a state\u2019s internal political organization. This principle is not relevant to the case before us. GISD\u2019s claim is that <em>Congress, </em>exercising its power under Article I, has interfered with Texas\u2019s internal political organization, at least to the extent of allowing a school district to ignore the state\u2019s mandate and to decide for itself whether to accept the breakfast program. There is every reason to think that Congress may interfere with a state\u2019s internal political organization in ways that the Constitution itself does not interfere; the Supreme Court has never said otherwise. <em>See City of New York v. Richardson, </em>473 F.2d 923, 929 (2d Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 950, 93 S.Ct. 3012, 37 L.Ed.2d 1002 (1973); <em>NAACP v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc., </em>426 F.Supp. 919, 926 n.1 (D.Del.1977); <em>Triplett v. Tiemann, </em>302 F.Supp. 1244 (D.Nev.1969). The Court has, to be sure, limited Congress\u2019s power in a way faintly analogous to the <em>Dartmouth College </em>distinction between private and governmental powers; it has held that Congress may not \u201cimpermissibly interfere with the integral governmental functions\u201d of states and their subdivisions. <em>National League of Cities v. Usery, </em>426 U.S. 833, 851, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 2474, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976). It is unclear whether this limitation ever applies to an act of Congress which, like the breakfast program, does not necessarily require anything of the states or their subdivisions but only offers funds to states or subdivisions which comply with certain conditions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Our decision on the merits, <em>see </em>Part III <em>infra, </em>makes it unnecessary to discuss whether this limit on Congress\u2019s power would keep it from doing what GISD claims it has done, <em>cf. Public Utility Dist. No. 1 v. FPC, </em>113 U.S.App.D.C. 363, 366-68, 308 F.2d 318, 321-23 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 908, 83 S.Ct. 719, 9 L.Ed.2d 716 (1963) (FPC may empower municipality to condemn land despite state statute prohibiting municipality from doing so); <em>Alabama NAACP State Conference of Branches v. Wallace, </em>269 F.Supp. 346 (M.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>Ala.1967) (declaring unconstitutional a state statute prohibiting localities from obtaining federal money by complying with federal desegregation guidelines), for we hold that GISD is incorrect in asserting that Congress has empowered school districts to decide for themselves whether to accept the breakfast program. But in any event these are substantive limits on Congress\u2019s power. They are not material to our inquiry into GISD\u2019s standing. We conclude that the <em>Hunter </em>and <em>Trenton </em>line of cases do not, properly speaking, deal with a municipality\u2019s standing to sue the state that created it. Therefore they do not deny GISD standing to bring this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">GISD contends that \u00a7 21.914 is inconsistent with the federal school breakfast statutes and regulations and therefore unconstitutional under the supremacy clause. For the most part, GISD relies on a section of the principal statute establishing the breakfast program and on one of the regulations. The statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1773(a), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-7\">There is hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to assist the States through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain, or expand nonprofit breakfast programs <em>in all schools which make application for assistance </em>and agree to carry out a nonprofit breakfast program in accordance with this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">(emphasis added). The regulation, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.7(a), says that \u201cThe School Food Authority shall make written application to the state agency . . . for any school in which it desires to operate the School Breakfast Program . . . .\u201d The \u201cSchool Food Authority\u201d is defined as \u201cthe governing body which is responsible for the administration of one or more schools and which has legal authority to operate a breakfast program therein.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.2(w). GISD argues in effect that the phrase \u201cin all schools which make application for assistance\u201d in \u00a7 1773(a) implies that no school which has not applied shall have the program forced on it. And GISD of course argues that the School Food Authority is the school board, and that \u00a7 220.7(a) expressly gives it the power to decide whether to accept the breakfast program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-12\">These texts alone do not settle the issue. Section 1773(a) says \u201cschools,\u201d not \u201cschool boards,\u201d and GISD does not seem to contend that each individual school can decide to reject the program.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In any event, this interpretation of the statute would make the very regulation GISD relies on illegal. Moreover, the same sentence speaks of \u201cassisting] the States,\u201d suggesting that the states have primary responsibility over the breakfast program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-13\">In fact, the legislative history indicates that this portion of \u00a7 1773(a) has nothing to do with specifying the local body which is to decide whether to participate. The earlier version of the first sentence of \u00a7 1773(a) had read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-14\">\u201cThere is hereby authorized to be appropriated for each of the fiscal years 1972 and 1973 not to exceed $25,000,000 to carry out a program to assist the States through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain, or expand nonprofit breakfast programs in schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amu\"><em>See </em>42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1773. This was a limited authorization; it provided funds for the program in only some of the schools that wanted to participate. In 1972 Congress decided to authorize enough funds to provide breakfasts in every school that wanted to participate. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 92-1027, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 3380, 3392. Not unnaturally, it said so by rewriting the statute to authorize \u201csuch sums as are necessary [to fund the program] in all schools which make application . . . There is no indication that Congress intended to change \u00a7 1773(a) from an authorization of funds into a provision dealing with the rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>tive powers of states and local school boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">The regulation cited by GISD, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.7(a), similarly is not dispositive. It may just be a traffic control device specifying the agency that is to handle paperwork connected with the application. See <em>id.; id. </em>\u00a7 220.7(b) (administrative responsibilities associated with application). Moreover, a \u201cSchool Food Authority\u201d is defined as the body \u201cwhich has legal authority to operate a breakfast program.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.2(w). Presumably it is state law which defines the legal authority of various local bodies; by enacting \u00a7 21.914 Texas has removed from GISD the legal authority to decide whether to participate in the program. Of course, \u00a7 1773(a) and 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.7(a) lend no support to Texas\u2019s argument that the federal program permits statutes like \u00a7 21.914, but they do not decide the case in GISD\u2019s favor either. They leave the question open.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">We must, therefore, examine the statutory and regulatory scheme, and the legislative history, in an effort to answer two questions. First, in establishing the federal breakfast program, did Congress indicate any general distrust of state governments? That is, did Congress seem to believe that decisions made by local school boards would, in general, better effectuate the policies of the program? And second, even if Congress expressed no <em>general </em>reluctance to allow state governments to make decisions about the breakfast program, does this particular Texas statute, mandating breakfast programs in schools with a substantial number of children from poorer families, clash with any specific congressional policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">There are few signs that Congress and the Department of Agriculture generally distrusted state governments; indeed the evidence is rather that Congress wanted to involve the states fully in the administration of the program. The state educational agencies receive the local authorities\u2019 applications, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1773(a), and enter into contracts with local schools or school districts to run the program, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.7(a). Subject to the federal guidelines, the state authorities can set the rates at which school districts will be reimbursed. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.9. They decide which school districts will receive additional payments if the uniform national rates of reimbursement do not cover all their costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1773(d); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.9(c). Under an earlier version of the breakfast program, when only limited funds were authorized, states could select \u2014 according to certain federal criteria \u2014 the schools that would be permitted to participate in the programs; now states can, at least, still choose which schools to reimburse if appropriated funds are insufficient to reimburse all the schools that want to participate. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1773(c). All of these tasks require the state to make important and potentially controversial decisions. Congress would not have assigned them to the states if it distrusted the states, wanted to insulate local school boards from the states\u2019 mandates, or thought that local boards\u2019 decisions were singularly likely to further the policies of the program.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">Finally, \u00a7 21.914 itself seems quite consistent with the policies of the federal breakfast program. In many ways, Congress made clear its desire to expand the program generally. Perhaps even clearer is Congress\u2019s particular concern that as many poor children as possible be served free or reduced-price breakfasts.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-10\">The policy in favor of expanding the program is made explicit in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1773(g), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>As a national nutrition and health policy, \u201cit is the purpose and intent of Congress that the school breakfast program be made available in all schools where it is needed to provide adequate nutrition</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">In addition, participating states are required to submit to the Secretary of Agriculture, annually, a plan demonstrating their intention \u201cto use the funds provided under [the school breakfast program] . to the maximum extent practicable to reach needy children.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1759a(e)(1)(C). The regulations specify that \u201cstate agencies have a positive obligation ... to extend the benefits of the School Breakfast Program to children attending schools where poor economic conditions exist.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.7(c). Arguably, these provisions themselves authorize state statutes like Texas\u2019s \u00a7 21.914, requiring school districts with a high percentage of poorer children to participate; in any event, they reveal Congress\u2019s hospitality to such state statutes. In the past, when Congress did not authorize enough funds to reimburse every school that wanted to participate in the program, it made its concern with reaching poor children even more explicit; in selecting the schools that would participate, states were to give priority to schools with children from poorer areas, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1773(c), and to schools in which \u201cthere is a special need for improving the nutrition and dietary practices of children of working mothers and children from low-income families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Now that Congress has authorized funds sufficient to cover all schools that want to participate, <em>see </em>p. 1072 <em>supra, </em>these priorities are less important, although they still govern states\u2019 decisions about which schools to reimburse when appropriations fall short. But there is no reason to think that Congress has retreated from the concern for reaching the poor demonstrated by those priority provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">Congress was not coy about its ambitions for the federal breakfast program. It wanted \u201cto meet more effectively the nutritional needs of our children,\u201d and \u201cto safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation\u2019s children,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1771, particularly those children who, because of their family\u2019s poverty or for some other reason, are inadequately fed. To this end Congress wanted the program to expand and to reach every school where it is needed. In \u00a7 21.914 Texas has tried to bring Congress\u2019s plan to fruition; it has been faithful to Congress\u2019s intentions. We do not agree with GISD that such fidelity is outlawed by the program itself. In this context we cannot accept GISD\u2019s pretension to be a rulemaker instead of just a housekeeper, for GISD\u2019s claim would take the starch out of the breakfast program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">For all of these reasons, we think that Congress \u2014 in addition to trusting the states generally, and not wanting to limit their control over the breakfast program \u2014 particularly favored state efforts to expand the program to reach poorer children. The federal breakfast program, and the policies underlying it, are entirely compatible with Texas\u2019s \u00a7 21.914. The district court was correct to hold that \u00a7 21.914 is constitutional. Its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1153-21\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1751-1769a (school lunch program); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1772 (special milk program); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1773 (school breakfast program).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">. <em>See </em>footnote 3 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">. GISD claims that participating in the program will force it to spend well over $10,000 on equipment, utilities, and additional salaries. Since the federal government will not necessarily reimburse GISD for those expenses, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1773(d), 1774, we cannot say \u201cto a legal certainty,\u201d <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemn. Co. v. Red Cab Co., </em>303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938), that $10,000 or less is in controversy. Thus, the district court had jurisdiction over GISD\u2019s claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a). <em>See also Opelika Nursing Home, Inc. v. Richardson, </em>448 F.2d 658, 663 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">. Depending on how broadly it is interpreted, this requirement is either identical with or an aspect of the rule that a case must be \u201cjusticiable.\u201d <em>See generally Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1949-50, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Standing is also an aspect of justiciability. <em>Id. </em>at 1950.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1154-14\">. These three criteria, among others, were in effect specified by the Supreme Court in its most recent substantial treatment of standing. <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2630-34, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). To be precise, the Court made explicit the constitutional requirement of injury in fact and the \u201cgeneral prudential\u201d rule that a party can usually assert only its own claims. <em>Id. </em>at 2631, 2634. Instead of speaking of the need for a genuine case or controversy, however, it said that a plaintiff must establish a reasonable \u201ccausal connection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2630. As we discuss, this is a variation of the requirement of a real controversy. <em>See </em>p. 1063 and n. 12 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>infra. </em>If GISD claimed that the federal statutes are intended to protect school districts against possible expenses resulting from the state\u2019s imposing the program, it would be asserting its own right to such protection. But as our discussion of the merits suggests, <em>see </em>Part III <em>infra, </em>that claim is far weaker than the claim that Congress intended simply to protect the right to decide whether to accept the program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">. There are some exceptions to this principle that a litigant can assert only its own claims and not those of a third party, see, <em>e. g., Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976), but we need not decide if any are applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">. This requirement serves much the same function as the rule, apparently applicable at least in determining standing under \u00a7 10(a) of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, that a complaining party has standing if \u201cthe interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d <em>Association of Data Processing Serv.

Carolina Environmental Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978), the limit on asserting third parties\u2019 claims \u201cbear[s] some resemblance\u201d to the requirement, applied only in taxpayers\u2019 suits, <em>id. </em>at 2633-34, that a plaintiff show a \u201cnexus\u201d between its injury and the legal right it asserts. <em>See Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">. In <em>Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), the Supreme Court rejected the view that a plaintiff has standing only if it can show a \u201cprotected legal interest\u201d; that inquiry, the Court said, \u201cgoes to the merits\u201d, and standing is a preliminary issue. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830. The Court then' specified that an injured party has standing if it asserts an interest <em>\u201carguably </em>within the zone of interests to be protected ... by the statute ... in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This test seems to align the inquiry into standing with the test for federal question jurisdiction, which is that a complaint asserting a federal claim can be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction only if it is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d or \u201cpatently without merit.\u201d <em>Bell v.

There the Court granted banks\u2019 competitors standing to challenge an agency\u2019s decision that various activities were permitted by the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24(7). Commentators have criticized the decision on the ground that it led the Court to examine issues under the Act from the competitors\u2019 point of view when the Act is more plausibly seen as an effort to protect customers. As a result, commentators say, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Act was distorted. <em>See </em>Stewart, <em>supra, </em>88 Harv.L.Rev. at 1732-33. Instead of simply granting standing to the competitors, these commentators say, the Court should have recognized an exception to the rule against raising third parties\u2019 claims and allowed the competitors standing explicitly to assert the customers\u2019 rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1733.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">. We do not mean to decide whether the taxpayers would have had standing to bring this suit.

The Court has equated this principle to its rule that a plaintiff has no standing unless its injuries \u201cfairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,\u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 41, 43, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 1926, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). <em>See also Warth v.

In the recent cases discussing this rule, the issue had been whether the actions of some \u201cthird part[y] not before the court,\u201d <em>see Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 264, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), would nullify the court\u2019s decree and leave the plaintiff with no relief from its injuries, <em>see Duke Power Co. v.
