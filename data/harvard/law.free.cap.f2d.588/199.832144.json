The boat entered the inlet and was found to contain 4,565 pounds of marijuana. Defendants O\u2019Shea and Pinder were on board. In O\u2019Shea\u2019s shirt pocket was a paper bearing a drawing of a boat labelled \u201c110 foot\u201d and the following notations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-25\">You are BALLYO II UHF channel 68 70 looking for the Fish Hawk Capt Matillia Light east about 3-6 miles Or call me at 1-942-2212 Mr. Hugh\u2019s code 9m</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ari\">At trial a customs patrol officer testified that Matanilla Reef and Shoals is located in Bahamian waters, about 75 miles northeast of Lake Worth Inlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-29\">Defendants were convicted of importation of marijuana, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 952(a) and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Each was sentenced to four years imprisonment on each count with sentences to run concurrently.

Eulberg, </em>581 F.2d 1216, 1217 (5th Cir. 1978), we have reviewed the record and conclude that the jury could infer from the evidence presented that O\u2019Shea and Pinder were, guilty of importation of marijuana beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>doubt. <em>United States v.
