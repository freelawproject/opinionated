WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A__\">Small and Buffington were injured in an industrial accident on a construction job. Buffington has since died and the administratrix of his estate joins with Small in this appeal from the denial of motions for mistrial and new trial. The motions followed statements, heard by the jury, referring to workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. The appellants challenge also the reference of the case to a United States Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">An appeal has also been taken by Olympic Prefabricators, Inc. (Olympic) from a summary judgment which denied its claim for indemnity from third party defendants Harbor Mechanical, Inc., Schuchart Industrial Contractors, Inc., and Howard S. Wright Construction Co., d/b/a WrightSchuchart-Harbor (Harbor). Harbor cross appeals from the denial of -its request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">We affirm the denial of a mistrial and new trial and reject the claim of error as to referral to the Magistrate. It is unnecessary to consider Olympic\u2019s appeal. We affirm the denial of attorney\u2019s fees to Harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-20\">FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-21\">A. <em>Small and Abbott v. Olympic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-22\">Small and Buffington, employees of Harbor, were injured when a prefabricated building purchased by Harbor from Olympic collapsed during construction. Being unable to sue Harbor directly because of the exclusive remedy of Oregon\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Or.Rev.Stat. 656.001 <em>et seq., </em>they brought this diversity action against Olympic. The parties stipulated to a jury trial before a United States Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-23\">In his opening statement, counsel for Van Egdom, a co-plaintiff below but not party to this appeal, referred to workmen\u2019s compensation payments received by his client.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Van Egdom also gave direct testimony about such payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel referred to workmen\u2019s compensation in an attempt to impeach Van Egdom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the next day, defendant\u2019s counsel again referred to workmen\u2019s compensation in his cross-examination of Dr. Knox, one of Van Egdom\u2019s physicians.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Counsel for Small and Abbott did not object to these statements. Only later on the second day of trial did they join Van Egdom\u2019s counsel in a motion for mistrial based upon the cross-examination of Dr. Knox. A motion for new trial on the same grounds was made after a jury verdict of no liability for Olympic. The court denied all of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-19\">B. <em>Harbor v. Olympic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-20\">The contract between Harbor and Olympic provided that Olympic furnish all draw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ings necessary for the construction of the building and an advisor during the first two days of work. Harbor was to supply all other labor. The collapse of the building occurred on the third day of construction, after Olympic had fulfilled its advisory obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In a third party complaint against Harbor, Olympic alleged that the injuries to Small and Buffington were the result of Harbor\u2019s negligence in not following the directions for the building\u2019s construction. After Harbor\u2019s successful motion for summary judgment, Harbor applied for attorney\u2019s fees under the following indemnity clause in its contract with Olympic, wherein Olympic agreed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">1. To indemnify and save harmless the contractor [Harbor] from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, losses, costs, penalties and damages of whatsoever kind or nature including attorney\u2019s fees arising out of, in connection with or incident to the subcontractor\u2019s performance of this subcontract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The district court denied Harbor\u2019s motion, concluding that the third party complaint was not a suit or action arising from or in connection with Olympic\u2019s performance of its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">A. <em>References to Workmen\u2019s Compensation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 656.595(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">(2) In any third party action brought pursuant to ORS 656.001 to 656.794, the fact that the injured worker or his beneficiaries are entitled to or have received benefits under ORS 656.001 to 656.794 shall not be pleaded or admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Small and Abbott cite a number of cases applying Oregon law in which reference to workmen\u2019s compensation coverage constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They rely particularly on <em>Strandholm v. General Construction Co., </em>235 Or. 145, 382 P.2d 843 (1963), to excuse their failure to object promptly to statements regarding workmen\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">In <em>Strandholm, </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel failed to object to statements elicited by defense counsel regarding workmen\u2019s compensation coverage until the end of trial. The trial court had specifically warned defense counsel not to introduce such evidence. Upon plaintiff\u2019s belated motion, the trial court granted a new trial. The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">Apart from the factual differences that distinguish that case from this, <em>Strandholm </em>does not support appellants\u2019 position. The Oregon court in that case merely confirmed a trial court\u2019s discretion to order a new trial even in the absence of an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">An appellate court applies a much different standard for ordering a new trial. Language from an earlier Oregon case cited by the court in <em>Strandholm </em>makes clear the distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-18\">\u201cIn respect to the necessity of there having been a ruling in the lower court and an exception taken which is requisite to a reversal upon appeal, there is a clear and well-recognized distinction between the power of the trial court on the one hand to set aside a judgment and grant a new trial, and the power of the Supreme Court to reverse a judgment upon appeal, for it has been repeatedly held by this court that it is not error alone, but error legally excepted to, that constitutes grounds for reversal.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">235 Or. at 153, 382 P.2d at 846 (citing <em>Timmins v. Hale, </em>122 Or. 24, 32, 256 P. 770, 773 (1927)). This is consistent with Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1), which requires a \u201ctimely objection\u201d to preserve an assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">There was no timely objection here to references regarding workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. Small and Abbott did not object to the opening statement of Van Egdom\u2019s counsel, to Van Egdom\u2019s direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>testimony, or to his cross-examination by defense counsel. There was no immediate objection to the cross-examination of Dr. Knox. Only later on the second day of trial did they object.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Although the trial court, in its discretion, could have overlooked the untimeliness of the objection and ordered a new trial, it was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Small and Abbott assert that the denial of their motions for mistrial and a new trial was \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 103(d) permits an appellate court to \u201ctak[e] notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights\u201d, even in the absence of an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Or.Rev.Stat. 656.595(2) prohibits references to \u201cthe fact that <em>the injured work[man] or his beneficiaries </em>are entitled to or have received benefits\u201d under workmen\u2019s compensation. (Emphasis added.) In each of the cases cited by appellants, reference was made at trial to the fact that the plaintiff-appellant had received benefits. Further, in each instance, defense counsel deliberately introduced statements regarding workmen\u2019s compensation without prior reference to the subject by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Here, appellants are objecting to statements regarding receipt of benefits by Egdom. No statements were made concerning their own coverage under or receipt of payments from workmen\u2019s compensation. The subject was raised by co-plaintiff\u2019s counsel and pursued in his direct examination of Van Egdom. Defense counsel, who could justifiably believe that the subject had been legitimately opened, referred to workmen\u2019s compensation briefly in his cross-examination of Van Egdom and Dr. Knox.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">The trial judge and a reviewing district judge found no prejudice to appellants by the statements. Apparently, Small and Abbott also were not fearful that the statements would affect the jury on the liability issue,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but only on the question of damages, which the jury never reached. We agree that the statements did not prejudice appellants and find no plain error affecting their substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">B. <em>Use of a Magistrate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Appellants claim that a magistrate \u201chas no power, either statutory or constitutional, to preside over a diversity jury trial.\u201d They are unable to cite any authority for this proposition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">The only relevant case cited by appellants, <em>DeCosta v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>520 F.2d 499 (1st Cir. 1975), held that parties may constitutionally consent to try a civil matter before a Magistrate. The First Circuit discussed what standard of review should apply to a magistrate\u2019s opinion and concluded that \u201cfactual findings of the magistrate adopted by the district court [are] subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 53(a), and . the legal decision of the magistrate [is] subject to the full review of this court.\u201d 520 F.2d at 509. <em>See also Campbell v. United States Dist. Court for the N. Dist. of Cal., </em>501 F.2d 196 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>419 U.S. 879, 95 S.Ct. 143, 42 L.Ed.2d 119 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Later cases have also confirmed that the district court must first review the proceedings of a civil trial conducted by a magistrate before it can enter final judgment. <em>See, e. g., Kendall v. Davis, </em>569 F.2d 1330 (5th Cir. 1978). But no court has limited the right of a magistrate, with the consent of the parties, to try a civil matter and make an initial decision upon which the district court, after review, may enter final judgment. The fact that this action is based upon diversity jurisdiction and was tried before a jury is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Here, a district judge reviewed the transcript of the trial to determine the effect of references to workmen\u2019s compensation and concluded that no error occurred. We agree. Under these circumstances, use of a Magistrate to hear the case was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">C. <em>Harbor\u2019s Application for Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">After the granting of its motion for summary judgment on Olympic\u2019s third party complaints, Harbor filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and disbursements based on the indemnity provision in the contract between the parties. Because we sustain the jury verdict, Olympic\u2019s appeal from the granting of summary judgment is moot. Harbor\u2019s appeal from the denial of attorney\u2019s fees, however, is still at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Olympic\u2019s action against Harbor did not \u201caris[e] out of, in connection with or incident to\u201d its performance of the subcontract with Harbor, as required by the indemnity provision, because Harbor\u2019s own negligenc\u00e9 caused the accident after Olympic had fulfilled all of its contractual obligations. In addition, Harbor\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The denials of Small and Abbott\u2019s motions for a mistrial and a new trial and Harbor\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs are</p>\n<p id=\"b386-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-15\">. \u201cHis wage loss actually compared to the extent of the injury is comparatively small, because all during the time Mr. Van Egdom was in the hospital, his employer paid him his salary, less the amount of the compensation that he received. He has to pay the compensation back, so actually his wage loss is just the compensation that he received for that time and a couple short periods when he was in between these jobs that he had to quit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>because they were too strenuous for him.\u201d (Tr. 15-16)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\">. \u201c[Mr. Evans] Now, going back to your work record, as I understand it, your employer paid your wages continuously since the day of the accident \u2014 Wright Company \u2014 until you terminated with them, except for the amount of compensation you received?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">[Mr. Van Egdom] I\u2019d like to elaborate on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">Q Would you please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">A Wright, Schuchart-Harbor paid my salary, less workmen\u2019s compensation, for my five weeks that I was not able to be on the job site. However, after the fifth week they had a high-rise job going in Olympia, and I started that job in my sixth week of injury with a full leg cast, and they paid my salary less, again, the compensation.\u201d (Tr. 106)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201cQ As I understand it from your testimony, as far as wage loss, the only wage loss you really sustained is the compensation that you\u2019re going to have to pay back out of any recovery, plus the one month that you were off between those jobs while you were looking for another, and essentially, you received your full salary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">A That\u2019s correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">MR. EVANS: Counsel has also agreed to stipulate that the amount of compensation was paid him for wage loss, which he will have to reimburse in the amount of recovery is $48.94.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">MR. COSGRAVE: Yes, but he has no obligation to pay unless there is a recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-15\">MR. EVANS: That\u2019s right. If there is a recovery and, of course, they don\u2019t admit liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">MR. COSGRAVE: So stipulated without any admission of liability for those amounts.\u201d (Tr. 112-13)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b383-17\">. \u201c[Mr. Cosgrave] I will ask you, Mr. Van Egdom, if you remember when you were questioned by Mr. Schroeder who was questioning you in connection with your compensation claim against your employer? Remember Mr. Schroeder interviewed you by telephone?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-21\">[Mr. Van Egdom] I have never, to my recollection, ever met the man, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-22\">Q But you remember back on March 23rd of 1972 when you were interviewed over the telephone, did you not, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-23\">A I have had an interview over the telephone, sir.\u201d (Tr. 123)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-24\">\u201cQ You have told us that after this accident occurred, then you had no loss because you had your compensation benefits because you were injured on the job, but your employer made up the difference during that time that you were off work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-25\">A I think that\u2019s a little confusing, sir. Let me explain this, if I may. The five weeks I was off, the total, I was two weeks in the hospital and three other weeks I was home, I received full pay from my employer, less the compensation which amounted to $85 a week. When I went to work up in Alaska on that high rise project, that status remained the same for approximately eight or nine months. I\u2019m not specifying a certain day. I can\u2019t remember when the compensation portion just stopped and my employer picked up that gap again and made the total sum of the monthly salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-26\">Q Whatever it was, you were fully paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aca\">A Yes.\u201d (Tr. 124-25)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b383-27\">. \u201cBY MR.
