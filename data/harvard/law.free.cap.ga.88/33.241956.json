Where the claimant admits that he paid to the defendant a considerable amount on purchasing the land in question from a third person who had purchased it at a tax sale, it was not error for the court to charge the jury that if they believed from tbe evidence that the defendant, for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, suffered the property to go to sale for taxes, and that the purchaser at that sale at the time he received his deed either knew of this fraudulent purpose or had grounds for reasonable suspicion that it existed, and if they further believed that when the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>from such purchaser to the claimant was executed the claimant also knew of such fraudulent purpose on the part of the defendant or had grounds for reasonable suspicion, the jury ought to' find that the tax title is void as against the plaintiffs in <em>ft. fa., </em>(these plaintiffs being mortgagees of the property by a mortgage executed prior to the tax sale, and the <em>ft. fa. </em>being founded on the j udgment of foreclosure.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-4\">2.
