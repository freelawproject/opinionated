In order for the debtor to redeem the land or resist an action brought by the creditor for its recovery, he must tender the principal of the debt together with 7 per cent, per annum interest, or the balance thereof after deducting all partial payments.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b223-7\">December 28, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">Interest and usury.

Cyrus Dial pleaded the general issue, and that the deed was given to secure an usurious debt not in writing, drawing interest at twelve per cent., entered into on April 18, 1877, and was therefore void. The verdict was for the defendant, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
