For the following reasons, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-27\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-28\">Limonteco pleaded guilty in December 1996 to transporting an alien within the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A), and he received a sentence of probation in March 1997. In 2008, when he attempted to reenter the United States after a trip abroad, the Department of Homeland Security instituted removal proceedings, alleging that his prior offense was an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) that rendered him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The immigration judge (IJ) found that Limonteco was removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) based on his prior conviction, and Limonteco sought a waiver under former \u00a7 212(e). At the time that Limonteco pleaded guilty in December 1996, \u00a7 212(c) allowed the Attorney General to grant a waiver of deportation to certain lawful permanent residents who, for example, had engaged in alien smuggling. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(l), (c) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996; repealed 1997). Limonteco argued that the waiver remained available to him and should be applied in his case under <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), which held \u201cthat \u00a7 212(e) relief remains available for aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">By the time Limonteco pleaded guilty in December 1996, however, Congress had enacted statutory amendments that would affect Limonteco\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. First, in April 1996, Congress enacted \u00a7 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AED-PA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1277, which amended \u00a7 212(e) to bar relief for aggravated felons. \u00a7 1182(c) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996; repealed 1997); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996) (re-codified as amended at \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)); <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Gonzales (Carranza-De Salinas I), </em>477 F.3d 200, 204 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">Second, in September 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546, which generally took effect in April 1997, <em>see </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a), 110 Stat. at 3009-625. Although IIRIRA \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. at 3009-597, generally repealed \u00a7 212(c), the IJ ruled that this did not bar Limonteco\u2019s application because \u00a7 304(b) did not take effect until April 1997 \u2014 after Limonteco\u2019s guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the IJ ruled that a different part of IIRIRA \u2014 \u00a7 321(a) \u2014 changed the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d and rendered Limonteco ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. IIRIRA, \u00a7 321(a), 110 Stat. at 3009-627 to -628. Before IIRIRA, the INA\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d did not include an offense like Limonteco\u2019s under \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) unless the sentence imposed for the offense included a prison term of \u201cat least 5 years,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996), but IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a) deleted the five-year prison term requirement so that all \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) offenses became aggravated felonies, 110 Stat. at 3009-627 to -628 (codified at \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N)). Limonteco argued that his prior conviction was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the pre-IIRIRA definition because he received only a probationary sentence, but the IJ ruled that Congress had clearly expressed its intent that IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a)\u2019s amended definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d apply retroactively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the IJ ruled that Limonteco was ineligible for relief under former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>\u00a7 212(c) and ordered him removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Limonteco timely appealed to the BIA, which likewise ruled that he was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief as it existed after the enactment of the AEDPA because of Congress\u2019s clearly expressed intent that IIRIRA\u2019s new aggravated felony definition apply retroactively. Limonteco timely petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Limonteco argues that the BIA erroneously applied IIRIRA retroactively in his case to preclude him from seeking relief under \u00a7 212(c). The BIA\u2019s determination that Limonteco is ineligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c) is a conclusion of law, which we review de novo. <em>Garrido-Morato v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir. 2007). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), which allows us to review questions of law even where \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) otherwise bars review of removal orders against aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">\u201cDespite the dangers inherent in retroactive legislation, it is beyond dispute that, within constitutional limits, Congress has the power to enact laws with retrospective effect.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 316, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Therefore, although there is a \u201cdeeply rooted presumption against retroactive legislation,\u201d <em>Vartelas v. Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 1484, 182 L.Ed.2d 473 (2012), a statute generally \u201cmust be given retroactive effect if Congress has communicated, with clarity, its intent that the law be applied retroactively,\u201d Her<em>nandez-Castillo, </em>436 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court found Congress\u2019s intent unclear with respect to the retroactivity of IIRIRA \u00a7 304(b), <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, but the Court has repeatedly stated that Congress clearly intended IIR-IRA \u00a7 321(a)\u2019s amendment of the \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition to be retroactive, <em>Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1487; <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 319, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Accordingly, we have held that IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a)\u2019s new \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition applies retroactively. <em>Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 324 (citing IIRIRA \u00a7 321(b)-(c), 110 Stat. at 3009-628). Thus, the BIA properly treated Limonteco\u2019s prior \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) offense as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the post-IIRIRA statute regardless of when he pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">Limonteco attempts to isolate the definition of his prior offense as an aggravated felony from the legal consequences of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>definition, namely, ineligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. We rejected such an approach in <em>Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 320-24. There, the alien pleaded guilty in June 1996 to an offense that was not an aggravated felony before IIRIRA but would be under IIRIRA\u2019s new definition. <em>Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 320-22. The alien sought discretionary relief under former \u00a7 244(a)(2) of the INA, but that provision required the alien to prove herself \u201ca person of good moral character.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2) (repealed 1997); <em>see Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 321. At the time the alien pleaded guilty (and still today), the INA forbade treating anyone \u201cwho at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony\u201d as \u201ca person of good moral character.\u201d \u00a7 1101(f)(8) (2012); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1101(f)(8) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996) (same). Thus, when we upheld the BIA\u2019s denial of discretionary relief under former \u00a7 244(a)(2) in <em>Gamdo-Morato </em>based on the retroactive application of IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a)\u2019s aggravated felony definition, we implicitly rejected any distinction between the retroactive application of the definition itself and the consequences of that change under the law in effect at the time the alien pleaded guilty. <em>See Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 320-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">At the time Limonteco pleaded guilty in December 1996, Congress had already enacted \u00a7 440(d) of the AEDPA, which made aggravated felons ineligible for discretionary relief under former \u00a7 212(c). \u00a7 1182(c) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996; repealed 1997); <em>see </em>\u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996) (re-codified as amended at \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)); <em>see Carranza-De Salinas I, </em>477 F.3d at 204. The treatment of Limonteco\u2019s prior offense as an aggravated felony therefore makes him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief as it existed when he pleaded guilty. <em>See Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 320-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">That Limonteco pleaded guilty after \u00a7 440(d) of the AEDPA had already narrowed \u00a7 212(c) relief also distinguishes his case from cases on which he relies, <em>St. Cyr </em>and <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Holder (Carranza-De Salinas II), </em>700 F.3d 768 (5th Cir. 2012). The aliens in <em>St. Cyr </em>and <em>Carranza-De Salinas II </em>were eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their convictions despite having been convicted of aggravated felonies because their convictions occurred in March 1996 and 1993, respectively, before Congress enacted the AED-PA in April 1996. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 293, 121 S.Ct. 2271; <em>Carranza-De Salinas II, </em>700 F.3d at 769-70. By contrast, when Limonteco pleaded guilty in December 1996, \u00a7 212(c) relief had already become unavailable to aggravated felons through the AEDPA. \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Limonteco\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Vartelas </em>that retroactively applying other parts of IIRIRA is impermissible, <em>Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1483-92, is also unavailing. Before IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents (LPRs) could reenter the United States after brief trips abroad even if they were excludable (in today\u2019s terms inadmissible) so long as they were not deportable. <em>Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1484-85. After IIRIRA, such aliens would be subject to removal when they attempted to reenter. <em>Id. </em>Applying those changes retroactively in <em>Vartelas </em>meant that the alien faced a \u201cnew disability\u201d as an excludable-but-not-deportable LPR, who would have been allowed reentry before IIRIRA but was now subject to removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1487.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">It is true that Limonteco was also an LPR placed in removal proceedings upon his attempt to reenter the United States after a trip abroad. Also, Limonteco conceded before the IJ that, like the alien in <em>Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1485 &amp; n.3, he was excludable under pre-IIRIRA law. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996). But the similarities end there. The LPR in <em>Var\u00ede-las </em>was not an aggravated felon but had a single prior conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, which rendered him excludable but not deportable under pre-IIRIRA law. <em>Vartelas, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1485 &amp; n.3. In contrast, the treatment of Limon-teco\u2019s prior offense as an aggravated felony \u2014 which as explained above is proper even if it is retroactive \u2014 means that under the pre-IIRIRA law otherwise in effect at the time Limonteco pleaded guilty in December 1996, he would have been deporta-ble whether he traveled abroad or not. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (eff. Apr. 24, 1996) (re-codified as amended at \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">The BIA did not err in finding Limon-teco ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See Gar-rido-Moraio, </em>485 F.3d at 320-24. We therefore DENY his petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">. We need not address whether Limonteco\u2019s guilty plea after IIRIRA's enactment but before the effective date of its repeal of \u00a7 212(c) truly implicates the holding in <em>St. Cyr, </em>which was based on the premise that aliens who pleaded guilty before Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c) \"almost certainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of receiving \u00a7 212(c) relief] in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial.\" <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 325, 121 S.Ct. 2271; <em>see also Carranza-De Salinas v. Holder </em>(Carranza-<em>De Salinas II), </em>700 F.3d 768, 773 (5th Cir. 2012). Also, we need not address whether the application of IIRIRA's new \"aggravated felony\" definition to Limonteco\u2019s guilty plea in December 1996, which was after the enactment of \u00a7 321(a), truly resulted in a retroactive impact. <em>Compare </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a) (setting general effective date for IIRIRA in April 1997), <em>with Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 323 (treating IIRIRA \u00a7 321(b)-(c) as making IIRI-RA \u00a7 321(a) applicable to actions taken after IIRIRA\u2019s enactment in September 1996). Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the application of IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a) here creates a retroactive impact that would otherwise implicate <em>St. </em>Cyr\u2019s holding, we deny Limonteco\u2019s petition for review because Congress has clearly expressed its intent that IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a) apply retroactively. <em>See Garrido-Morato, </em>485 F.3d at 320-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
