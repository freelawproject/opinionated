The district court found that the petition was untimely filed under the one-ye\u00e1r statute of limitations established by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Whether Dolphy\u2019s petition was timely turns on when his state habeas proceedings stopped \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of AEDPA\u2019s tolling provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The district court concluded that those proceedings became complete once the Georgia Supreme Court denied Dolphy\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause and the period for seeking reconsideration of that denial lapsed. However, Dolphy argues that his proceedings were pending until the Georgia Supreme Court issued the remittitur for the denial. We agree with Dolphy. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">Dolphy filed a state habeas petition 280 days after his convictions became final. The state superior court rejected the petition, and Dolphy timely sought review by the Georgia Supreme Court, applying for a certificate of probable cause. The Court denied the application. Dolphy then had 10 days to seek reconsideration of the denial, but he did not do so. Eighteen days after that 10-day period expired, the Court issued the remittitur for its denial of Dol-phy\u2019s application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dolphy filed his \u00a7 2254 petition 84 days after the Court issued the remittitur. In considering Dolphy\u2019s petition, the district court found that his state habeas proceedings tolled his AEDPA one-year statute of limitations. However, the court determined that those proceedings became complete once Dolphy\u2019s 10-day reconsideration period expired. Therefore, it held that Dolphy filed his \u00a7 2254 petition 17 days after the one-year statute of limitations lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that Dolphy\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was time barred under \u00a7 2244(d). <em>Bridges v. Johnson, </em>284 F.3d 1201, 1202 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">Under AEDPA, prisoners like Dolphy have one year from when their convictions become final to file a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). This one-year statute of limitations is subject to tolling while \u201ca properly filed application for [sjtate post-conviction\u201d relief is \u201cpending.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). Until a state habeas petition \u201chas achieved final resolution through the [s]tate\u2019s post-conviction procedures, by definition it remains \u2018pending.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 219-20, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2138, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002); <em>see also Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 635, 638, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2554, 2556, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (concluding that the one-year statute of limitations \u201cclock again began to tick\u201d when the state supreme court issued its mandate because, at that time, its decision on the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition became final). Hence, the one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition is tolled \u201cas long as the [petitioner\u2019s] ordinary state collateral review process is \u2018in continu<em>ance\u2019 </em>\u2014 i.e., \u2018until the completion of that process.\u201d <em>Carey, </em>536 U.S. at 219-20, 122 S.Ct. at 2138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">Here, we must determine when Dolphy\u2019s state habeas proceedings became complete. If his proceedings were final 10 days after the Georgia Supreme Court decided to deny his request for a certificate of probable cause, then \u2014 as the district court found \u2014 he filed his \u00a7 2254 petition 17 days after his one-year statute of limitations lapsed. On the other hand, if the proceedings did not become complete until the Georgia Supreme Court issued the re-mittitur for the denial, then Dolphy filed his \u00a7 2254 petition one day before his limitations period lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">To determine the point at which a petitioner\u2019s state habeas proceedings become complete, we look to the state\u2019s procedural rules. <em>See Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1260-62 (11th Cir. 2004) (per cu-riam). In Georgia, after a superior court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>denies a petitioner\u2019s state habeas petition, the petitioner must obtain a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial to the Georgia Supreme Court. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-52(a). In other words, the Court\u2019s decision to deny an application for a certificate of probable cause disposes of the petitioner\u2019s habeas proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Thus, once such a decision becomes final, the petitioner\u2019s proceedings are complete. This occurs when the remittitur for the decision is transmitted. A Georgia Supreme Court \u201cdecision is amendable during the term of rendition and therefore not final until the remittitur is transmitted.\u201d <em>See Radford v. State, </em>238 Ga. 532, 233 S.E.2d 785, 786 (1977); <em>Ramsey v. State, </em>212 Ga. 381, 92 S.E.2d 866, 869 (1956) (\u201c[D]uring the time before the remittitur is transmitted, this [CJourt may alter, amend, or set aside its judgments.\u201d); <em>Atkins v. Estate of Callaway, </em>329 Ga.App. 8, 763 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2014) (\u201cUntil the remittitur is issued, the direct appeal is still pending.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Accordingly, when a state habeas petitioner seeks a certificate of probable cause from the Georgia Supreme Court and the Court denies the request, the petitioner\u2019s case becomes complete when the Court issues the remittitur for the denial. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-52(a); <em>Radford, </em>233 S.E.2d at 786; <em>Ramsey, </em>92 S.E.2d at 869; <em>Atkins, </em>763 S.E.2d at 371. This means that the case remains pending \u2014 and tolled\u2014 under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) until the Court issues the remittitur. <em>See Carey, </em>536 U.S. at 219-20, 122 S.Ct. at 2138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">As noted above, Dolphy filed his state habeas petition 280 days after his convictions became final, tolling his one-year statute of limitations. He then filed his \u00a7 2254 petition 84 days after that tolling period ended. That is to say, he filed the petition 84 days after the Georgia Supreme Court issued the remittitur for its denial of his request for a certificate of probable cause. As such, only 364 days lapsed on Dolphy\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, and his petition was timely, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">We hold that, for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), when the Georgia Supreme Court denies a state habeas petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause, the petitioner\u2019s proceedings remain \u201cpending\u201d until the Court issues the remit-titur for the denial. Applying this holding to Dolphy, his \u00a7 2254 petition was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">. Because reversal is warranted based on our conclusion that Dolphy\u2019s state habeas pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>ceedings were pending until the Georgia Supreme Court issued the remittitur for its denial of his request for a certificate of probable cause, we need not address the other \"timeliness\u201d arguments that he raises on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1370-12\">. The Georgia Supreme Court must transmit a remittitur to the court from which the case was received \"as soon as practicable after the expiration of 10 days after the entry of the judgment or upon the denial of a motion for reconsideration.\u201d Ga. R. S. Ct. 60.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
