On appeal, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in deciding against a sentence reduction after considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), even though Frazier was eligible for a reduction based on the amendment. He also requests that we reassign the case to a different district court judge on remand. After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-19\">This appeal concerns Frazier\u2019s third \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for sentence reduction and is his third sentencing appeal before this court. Since 2008, the Sentencing Commission has passed a number of retroactive amendments directed at reducing the disparity in sentencing between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Such efforts culminated in Congress\u2019s passing of the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which prompted the Sentencing Commission to pass several sweeping amendments to reduce crack cocaine sentences. In 2008 and 2011, Frazier filed his first two \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions under Amendments 706 and 750, respectively. On appeal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>Frazier\u2019s second motion, this Court vacated the denial of a sentence reduction and remanded for the district court to detail its analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, since the court\u2019s denial provided only a conclusory statement that they had been considered. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>502 Fed. Appx. 863, 866-67 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam). At a hearing on remand, the district court acknowledged that Frazier would have received a lower guideline range if he had been sentenced after Amendment 750, but concluded that Frazier\u2019s history and characteristics did not support, a sentence reduction because he had not shown respect for the law. It denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and this Court affirmed on appeal. See <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>554 Fed.Appx. 842, 846 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">Frazier now appeals the denial of his third \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, this time based on Amendment 782.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a short, one-page order, the district court concluded that \u201c[although [Frazier] is eligible for a reduced sentence, his career offender status, post-sentence conduct in prison, additional state court conviction for murder, and his leadership role in a large-scale drug trafficking organization! ] counsel against this Court exercising its discretion to reduce [Frazier\u2019s] sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision of whether to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 926 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201cThe district court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making its determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-9\">A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When the district court considers a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, it must engage in a two-part analysis: (i) recalculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range under the amended guidelines, then (ii) \u201cdecide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir. 2000). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the nature and severity of the danger to any person or the community posed by a sentence reduction. <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927. It also may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-10\">Section 3553(a) sets forth the factors to be considered when imposing a sentence, including: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d; (2) \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; (3) \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment\u201d; (4) the need for \u201cadequate deterrence\u201d; (5) the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes\u201d; (6) the guideline range; and (7) \u201cany perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>nent policy statement ... issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). A district court can demonstrate that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by stating which pertinent factors weigh against granting a sentence reduction, even if it does not present particular findings for each individual factor. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (affirming the denial of a sentence reduction where the district court mentioned the defendant\u2019s significant involvement in a large crack cocaine conspiracy and his lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility). The district court has discretion to determine how much weight to grant to a specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Alvarado, </em>808 F.3d 474, 496 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. It complied with the two-part procedure for analyzing Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion by determining that he was eligible for a sentence reduction, but the reduction was not warranted based on its analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81. In reaching such a conclusion, the district court referenced several facts relating to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that weighed against a sentence reduction, including the severe nature of Frazier\u2019s offense and his history of violent crime. The court also asserted that Frazier\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, which included several disciplinary infractions, weighed against a sentence reduction. Such an analysis is all that is required to survive our level of scrutiny. <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927-28 (A court \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by failing to address explicitly the effect of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 or Frazier\u2019s positive efforts to improve his character because the record shows that it otherwise considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Brovm, </em>104 F.3d at 1255-56. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to amend Frazier\u2019s sentence. <em>See Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">We have the supervisory authority to reassign a criminal case to a different district court judge, but reassignment \u201cis an extraordinary order.\u201d <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 891 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201cWhere there is no indication of actual bias, we consider at least three factors to determine whether to reassign a case: (1) whether the original judge would have difficulty putting his previous views and findings aside; (2) whether assignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of justice; (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to gains realized from reassignment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">We decline to reassign Frazier\u2019s case to a different district court judge because there is no need for a remand and \u201creassignment is unnecessary to preserve the appearance of justice and would require undue duplication of effort.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaygan, </em>652 F.3d 1297, 1318-19 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">Accordingly, the denial of Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">. Though Amendment 782 reduces Frazier\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to 33, Frazier acknowledges that his offense level actually would be 34 because of his career-offender status. Even so, he contends that Amendment 782 reduces his guideline range to 262 to 327 months' imprisonment, which is lower than his current range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
