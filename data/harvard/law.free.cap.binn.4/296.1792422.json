On the 9th of August 1811 the report of the referees was filed in the prothonotary\u2019s office, awarding \u00e1 sum due to the plaintiffs, and judgment <em>nisi </em>was entered. On the 12th of August notice of the report was given to Messrs. <em>Hazard </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>who on the 22d of October, and not before, filed exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-10\"><em>Meredith </em>and <em>Hallowell</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqcG\">contended that by the perfectly established practice of this court, the exceptions should have been filed within four days after notice, and that of course the present exceptions could not stand. They cited Shewell <em>v. </em>Wykoff, 1 Dali.- 312, and Kyd on awards 380, note (a).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-11\"><em>JRawle </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXz\">relied upon the following certificate of the referees, which had been filed on the 16th October 1811, as taking the case out of the general rule. \u201c <em>We </em>beg *leave to certify to the court, that upon reflection on the report made in the above case, we are all satisfied that we have committed a plain mistake, considerably to the prejudice of Ebenezer Hazard .and Benjamin B. Morgan, by the omission of two items in our statements, one of 112 dollars, the other of 240 dollars and interest thereon. If the court think proper to recommit the case to us, we are willing to act again as referees, on due notice to the oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>site parties.\u201d The court will receive exceptions after the four days, if they arise out of the face of the report; Buckley <em>v. </em>Durant, 1 Dall. 129 ; which shows that the rule is not inflexible, but is intended principally if not wholly for the government of the attorneys in the cause. The defendants cannot complain of the delay, because the award was in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-4\"><em>Reply. </em>The certificate of the l\u2019eferees is merely evidence of a mistake. It does not conclusively prove it; and therefore the mistake must stand upon the same footing with any other latent error, to be made out by due proof, after regular exception. The certificate is <em>ex parte. </em>To admit it, may lead to tampering with referees, and to the complete overthrow of the rule. As to the delay, this and other cases between the same parties in the Common Pleas, wrere referred at the same time. We are precluded from exceptions there, because a term has intervened. It never was heard of that the court has granted a new trial after the four days, upon a certificate of mistake by the jury; and yet the cases are the same.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-5\">Tilgbman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq-_\">I consider the certificate of the referees as of itself constituting an exception to the general rule. It was given before the next term after the report was filed; and as the judgment was in favor of the plaintiff; he, and not the defendants, is the sufferer by delay. Besides, the rule requiring exceptions within the four days seems to be for the government of the attorneys; but this is the case of a certificate by the referees that they have committed a plain mistake. The case has never occurred before; and I am . *sat\u2019s;6-e(i that the present circumstances form a safe exception to the general rule. As to the case of a jury, I give no opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b282-6\">Yeates J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARyi\">I am satisfied that the decision of the question shall be as a majority of the Court incline; but I do not feel authorized to go so far.</p>\n<author id=\"b282-7\">Brackenridge J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akp\">I do not think that the general rule extends to such a case as the present; and there is in my mind a clear distinction between this ease and that of a jury. It may be very wrong to permit a jury to state their mistakes after they are completely discharged; but referees are never treated with the same strictness as juries. They explain the ground of their award, and I see no impropriety in permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ting them to be heard under circumstances like the present, when they certify to the court, that they are satisfied they have committed a plain mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"><em>Rawle </em>then proceeded with the exceptions, of which the first two embraced the matter referred to by the referees. When he was about opening the third, the Chief Justice informed him that the Court were unanimously of opinion that he should be confined to the errors alleged by the referees themselves in their certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The case was then arranged by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">[See <em>contra </em>Tilghman <em>v. </em>Fisher, 9 Watts 441.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
