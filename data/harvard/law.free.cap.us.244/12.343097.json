In that case and in <em>Nobel\u2019s Explosives Co. </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1896), L. R., 2 Q.

If the duty be to protect the different interests from threatening danger, then, when the duty is performed, liability cannot grow out of the performance of it. Such officers and directors in these days of wireless telegraphy may owe the duty of taking even peremptory action for the protection of all interests. But if they do owe such duty, and exercise their best judgment, they are entitled to the benefit of it.

The uniform course adopted by all German shipowners in issuing warnings to their ships on July 30th and 31st, 1914, is in itself a clear indication that the interruption of the Cecilie\u2019s voyage was fully justified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The order received by wireless from the Imperial Marine Office may, in itself, be considered a restraint. At least, it shows that in the opinion of the German Government, English, French and Russian ports would not be safe for German vessels on and after August 1, 1914, and, therefore, constitutes authoritative and conclusive proof of the wisdom of Captain Polack\u2019s course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals have confused principles which are peculiar-to the law of marine insurance with those which are applicable to cases arising under bills of lading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">Policies of insurance are contracts of indemnity. To warrant a recovery under a policy covering arrest and restraint of princes, etc., it is not sufficient to show that the subject of insurance, was in danger of loss, or that a loss was actually sustained through fear of a peril insured against, or in attempting to avoid such peril. The peril insured against must have operated directly upon the subject of insurance. See <em>Olivera </em>v. <em>Union Ins. Co., </em>3 Wheat. 183; Phillips on Insurance, vol. 1, \u00a7 1114. This rule is largely aimed at fraudulent and factitious claims of constructive loss. <em>Hadkinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 388. It is based also on the consideration that the thing insured is not totally destroyed: <em>Ibid.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">A bill of lading constitutes the contract between the shipper and carrier, and where the latter undertakes to exercise reasonable care to prevent a loss-from an excepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>peril, there is a corresponding assent by the former that the carrier may adopt reasonable precautions to avoid such peril.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">It would be an absurdity to hold that the performance of a duty creates a liability for damages.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">In the case of a bill of lading, even though the excepted peril be the proximate cause, this will not protect the carrier if the negligence of his servants be a contributing cause, nor if after a loss without such contributory negligence they fail to take reasonable care to minimize the damage. In the latter case the carrier will be responsible for the increased damage although not liable for the original damage. It being the duty of the carrier not to expose the shipper\u2019s goods to a restraint, he incurs no liability by performing this duty, even if the precautions adopted involve a deviation from his course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">The true rule is as follows: A reasonable apprehension of capture or other imminent peril justifies a master in deviating from his direct course and taking such steps as a prudent man would take for the purpose of avoiding danger, and in so doing he is entitled to' consider the safety of his ship as well as the cargo, and the safety of the belligerent as well as of the neutral cargo. <em>Nobel\u2019s Explosives Co. </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra; Pole </em>v. <em>Cetovich </em>(1860), 9 C.

The voyage was not abandoned because of \u201carrest and restraint of princes.\u201d . The master received specific and definite orders from his owners to turn back. This message was designedly false in its statement of fact, for war had not broken out between Germany and England, France or Russia, or between any two. The master accepted the message as an'order and acted accordingly. His testimony shows that unless and until-he received the order from the owners he never intended to abandon his voyage. The exception of \u201cenemies\u201d and \u201carrest and restraint of princes,\u201d is found in juxtaposition with other exceptions dealing with loss or damage caused by violence or by .uncontrollable forces. It is, of course, to be construed as <em>ejusdem generis </em>with the other excepted causes; that is, it is to be limited to actual arrests and restraints by force, or to steps taken to avoid the reasonable certainty of an arrest and restraint by force, in case the voyage should be continued. In <em>The Styria, </em>186 U. S. 1, the exception was merely \u201crestraints of princes.\u201d Having been introduced into the contract by the shipowners, the exception is to be construed against them. <em>The Caledonia, </em>157 U.

B. 326, where arrest was a practical certainty. The law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>America is clear that a defense, based on an exception of \u201carrest and restraint of princes\u201d where there is no actual arrest, must establish a danger of capture that was imminent, apparently remediless and morally certain. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>United Insurance Co., </em>6 Johns. 226; <em>Corp </em>v. <em>United Insurance Co., </em>8 Johns. 277; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Maryland Insurance Co., 7 </em>Cranch, 487; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Universal Insurance Co., </em>6 Wheat. 176; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Maine Ins. Co., </em>6 Massachusetts, 102.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">While these cases arose under policies of insurance, the clause of restraint of princes received the same construction that would be given to it in a charter party or bill of lading. <em>The Xantho </em>(1887), L. R., 12 App. Cas. 503; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pandorf </em>(1887), L. R., 12 App. Cas. 518; <em>The G. R. Booth, </em>171 U. S. 450. In case of a deviation to avoid an arrest the shipper must be able to recover his loss either from his insurer, on the ground that the certainty of arrest which is thus avoided is equivalent to an actual arrest within the meaning of his policy, or from the carrier on the ground that the danger was so remote and uncertain that the deviation was not justified. 1 Parson\u2019s Ship, and Adm., p. 172.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">The law in England on the subject accords completely with the decisions in our courts. <em>Hadkinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 388; <em>Forster </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>11 East, 205; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>10 East, 530; <em>Nickels </em>v. <em>London &amp; Provincial Marine &amp; General Insurance Co., </em>6 Com.

It must be inferred that both parties expected that the contract would be completely carried out unless in the happening of contingencies mentioned in the bill of lading that might prevent performance. It is not to be presumed, in the absence of all evidence, that either France or England would have committed the hostile act of attempting to arrest and detain this German vessel before a state of war between them and the German Empire existed. <em>Prinz Adalbert, </em>the <em>Kronprinzessin Cecilie, </em>1916, 32 Times L. R. 378. The liability of the petitioner is to be determined by the posture of affairs that existed. <em>The Savona </em>(1900), Prob. 252, 259. The claimant has been unable to produce any proof that the vessel could not have\" completed the voyage without the intervention of any excepted peril. On the contrary there is no reason on this record to doubt that if the steamer had proceeded on her voyage, she would have reached Plymouth, discharged her cargo, and left in safety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-4\">The abandonment of the voyage would not have been justified if it resulted from an exercise of the master\u2019s discretion. If the master can be considered as having exercised any discretion or concurred in judgment with what the owners ordered, it could only be on the assumption that the facts given to him by the owners, in their message, were true. They deliberately told the master a falsehood because they did not dare to rely on his discretion if they told him the truth. The owners\u2019 hands are not clean in the matter and they should not be permitted to gain any benefit from their own wrong. <em>King </em>v. <em>Delaware Insurance Co., </em>6 Cranch, 74. The owner cannot justify its order by assuming there was a shortage of coal. The duty of supplying the vessel with a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>quantity of coal for the expected contingencies of the voyage in all its stages was on the shipowner. <em>The Vortigern </em>(1899), Prob. 140; <em>Thin </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1892), 2 Q.

B. 657.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-4\">The possibility of increased political tension must have been in the owners\u2019 minds when the vessel sailed, and they were bound to supply sufficient coal to meet such expected contingencies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">The master had no general discretion to deviate from the voyage except under the compulsion to avoid an excepted peril, imminent, pressing and which had begun to operate. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Shaw S. &amp; A. Co. </em>(1916), 1 K. B. 747, 758; 1 Parson\u2019s Ship. &amp; Adm., p. 21; <em>The Julia Blake, </em>107 U. S. 418, 427, 428; <em>Blackenhagen </em>v. <em>London Assurance Co., </em>1 Camp. 454. His action was not for or in the interest of the shippers. It was not for the success of the voyage but for the sake of the ship. <em>Nobel\u2019s Explosives Co. </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>and <em>The Styria, supra, </em>do not apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-6\">The master had no general discretion to violate the contract for the sake of other goods and passengers. The case is not one in which the doctrines of general average could have application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-7\">It is a necessary inference from <em>The Julia Blake, supra, </em>and other recent authorities that the ordinary authority of a master has lessened very much in recent years. The telegraph has enabled the owner to perform much of the master\u2019s work in foreign ports. The system of printed bills of lading, and the extensive development of regular lines of steamers, with their accompanying agents and branches abroad, have converted the master into little more than the chief navigator of the ship. The master had no right to disobey the owners\u2019 orders. <em>Codwise </em>v. <em>Hacker, </em>1 Caines, 526; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Hinckley, 2 </em>Paine, 547, 20 Fed.

Rep. 668. 228 Fed. Rep. 946, 965. The libels alleged breaches of contract by the steamship in turning back from her voyage from New York and failing to transport kegs of gold to their destinations, Plymouth and Cherbourg, on the eve of the outbreak of the present war. The question is whether the turning back was justified by the facts that we shall state.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The Kronprinzessin Cecilie was a German steamship owned by the claimant, a German corporation. On July 27,1914, she received the gold in New York for the above destinations, giving bills of lading in American form, referring to the Harter Act, and, we assume, governed by our law in respect of the justification set up. Early on July 28 she sailed for Bremerhaven, Germany, via the mentioned ports, having on board 1892 persons, of whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>667 were Germans, passengers and crew; 406, Austrians; 151, Russians; 8, Bulgars; 7, Serbs; 1, Roumanian; 14, English; 7, French; 354, Americans; and two or three,from Italy, Belgium, Holland, &amp;c. She continued on her voyage until about 11.05 P. M., Greenwich time, July 31, when she turned back; being then in 46\u00b0 46' N. latitude and 30\u00b0 21' W. longitude from Greenwich and distant from Plymouth about 1070 nautical miles. At that moment the master knew that war had been declared by Austria against Servia, (July 28,) that Germany had declined a proposal by Sir Edward Grey for a conference of Ambassadors in London; that orders had been issued for the German fleet to concentrate in home waters; that British battle squadrons were ready for service; that Germany had sent an ultimatum to Russia, and that business was practically suspended on the London Stock Exchange. He had proceeded about as far as he could with coal enough to return if that should prove needful, and was of opinion that the proper course was to turn back. He reached Bar Harbor,. Maine, on August 4, avoiding New York on account of supposed danger from British eruisers, and returned the gold to the parties entitled to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">On July 31 the German Emperor declared a state of war, and the directors of the-company at Bremen, knowing that that had been or forthwith would be declared, sent a wireless message to the master: \u201cWar has broken out with England, France and Russia. Return to New York.\u201d Thereupon he turned back. The probability was that the steamship, if not interfered with or prevented by accident or unfavorable weather, would have reached Plymouth between 11 P. M. August 2, and 1 A. M. August 3, and would, have delivered the gold destined for England to be forwarded to London by 6 A. M., August 3. On August first at 9.40 P. M., before the earliest moment for probably reaching Plymouth, had the voyage kept on, the master received a wireless message from the German Imperial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Marine Office: \u2018 \u2018 Threatening danger of war. Touch at no port [of] England, France, Russia.\u201d On the same day Germany declared war on Russia. On August 2, Germany demanded of Belgium passage for German troops, and seized two English vessels with their cargoes. Explanations were offered of the seizures, but the vessels were detained. The German Army entered Luxembourg, and there were skirmishes with French troops. On August 3 Germany was at war with France, and at 11 P. M., on August 4, with England. On August 4 some German vessels were detained by England, and early on the fifth were seized as prize, <em>e. g., Prinz Adalbert </em>[1916] P. 81. No general history of the times is necessary. It is enough to add that from the moment Austria declared war on Servia the great danger of a general war was known to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">With regard to the principles upon which the obligations of the vessel are to be determined it is plain that, although there was a bill of lading in which the only exception to the agreement relied upon as relevant was \u201carrest and restraint of princes, rulers or people,\u201d other exceptions necessarily are to be implied, at least unless the phrase restraint of princes be stretched beyond its literal intent. The seeming absolute confinement to the words of an express contract indicated by the older cases like <em>Paradine </em>v. <em>Jane, </em>Aleyn, 26, has been mitigated so far as to exclude from the risks of contracts for conduct (other than the transfer of fungibles like money,) some, at least, which, if they had been dealt with, it cannot be believed that the contractee would have demanded or the contractor would have assumed. <em>Baily </em>v. <em>De Crespigny, </em>L. R. 4 Q. B. 180, 185. Familiar examples are contracts for personal service, excused by death, or contracts depending upon the existence of a particular thing. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>3 Best &amp; Smith, 826, 839. It has been held that a laborer was excused by the prevalence of cholera in the place where he had undertaken to work. <em>Lakeman </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>43 Maine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>463. The same principles apply to contracts of shipment. If it had been certain that the vessel would haye been seized as prize upon reaching England there can be no doubt that it would have been warranted in turning back. See <em>Mitsui &amp; Co., Limited, </em>v. <em>Watts, Watts &amp; Co., Limited, </em>[1916] 2 K. B. 826, 845. <em>The Styria, </em>186 U. S. 1. The owner of a cargo upon a foreign ship cannot expect the foreign master to run greater risks than he would in respect to goods of his own nation. <em>The Teutonia, L. R. </em>4 P. C. 171. <em>The San Roman, </em>L. R. 5 P. C. 301, 307. And when we add to the seizure of the vessel the possible detention of the German and some of the other passengers the proposition is doubly clear. Cases deciding what is and what is not within the risk of an insurance policy throw little light upon the standard of conduct to be applied in a case like this. But we see no ground to doubt that Chief Justice Marshall and Chief Justice Kent would have concurred in the views that we express. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Maryland Insurance Co., </em>7 Cranch, 487, 493. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>United Insurance Co., </em>6 Johns. 226, 250, 253. See also <em>British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. Co., Limited, </em>v. <em>Samuel Sanday &amp; Co., </em>[1916] A. C. 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">What we have said so far we hardly suppose to be denied. But if it be true that the master was not bound to deliver the gold in England at the cost of capture it must follow that he was entitled to take reasonable precautions to avoid that result, and the question narrows itself to whether the joint judgment of the master and the owners in favor of return was wrong. It was the opinion very generally acted upon by German shipowners. The order from the Imperial Marine Office if not a binding command at least shows that if the master had remained upon his course one day longer and had received the message it would have been his duty as a prudent man to turn back. But if he had waited till then there would have been a question whether his coal would hold out. Moreover if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>he would have been required to turn back before delivering, it hardly could change his liability that he. prophetically and rightly had anticipated the absolute requirement by twenty-four hours. We are wholly unable to \u00e1ccept the argument that although a shipowner may give up his voyage to avoid capture after war is declared he never is at liberty to anticipate war.
