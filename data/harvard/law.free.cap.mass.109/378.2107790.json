Williams, dated at New Orleans March 21, 1862, payable to the order of the defendants at their office in New Orleans, and indorsed by them. Answer, among other things, that the notes were given upon a contract for a loan of Confederate money, and were therefore without consideration, the defendants being accommodation indorsers ; and were also void for illegality of the consideration. Trial in this court, before <em>Wells, </em>J., who made a report thereof, which, so far as it relates to the point decided, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-8\">\u201c The evidence tended to show that Williams was a planter in Louisiana; that the defendants were his brokers or agents in New Orleans ; that the loan was made by the plaintiff to Williams in New Orleans through the intervention of the defendants; that at that time all the parties were resident within the limits and were adherents of the Confederacy, and New Orleans was in the possession and control of the so called Confederate government; and that the amount of the loan was advanced by a check on a bank in New Orleans, and the proceeds used by Williams chiefly in the payment of debts, some of which had been contracted prior to the attempted secession. There was evidence also that there was no money in circulation at that time in New Orleans except Confederate currency, and it was generally known that checks upon any bank in New Orleans would be paid in such money. I ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>apon this evidence that the notes were not void for illegality or for want of consideration. But in order to present the question to the full court, the evidence was submitted to the jury for the purpose of a special finding thereon. A general verdict was rendered for the defendants. The special finding was as follows: \u2018 <em>Question. </em>Whether it was the agreement or the understanding of the parties upon both sides, that the loan then to be made was a loan of Confederate notes or currency, as such? <em>Answer. </em>Yes.\u2019 If the ruling was wrong, and the defendants were entitled to a verdict upon this ground, judgment is to be entered for them upon the verdict. The statutes and judicial decisions of Louisiana may be referred to.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-5\"><em>JR. JMJ. Morse, Jr., f W. P.

But the supreme court of the United States, in <em>Thorington </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>8 Wallace, 1, have held that a contract for the payment of Confederate money can be enforced, and thereby overruled such of them as rest upon the first ground.

Story Confl. Laws, \u00a7 243. 2 Kent Com. (6th ed.) 458. <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Demand, </em>103 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">,By the Civil Code of Louisiana, art. 2026, \u201c every condition of a thing impossible, or <em>contra bonos mores, </em>or prohibited by law, is null, and renders void the agreement which depends on it.\u201d It was adjudged by the supreme court of Louisiana in 1865, that, by virtue of this article, a merchant, who had deposited money in a bank in New Orleans in 1862 \u201c on condition that the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>is to be drawn in Confederate money,\u201d could maintain no action against the <em>bank; </em>because the condition on which the deposit was-received, and to which the plaintiff voluntarily assented, provided for and contemplated aiding the circulation of notes issued by rebels in arms against the United States, for the express purpose of facilitating and carrying on the rebellion, and which on their face, being payable m \u201c six months after the ratification of peace between the Confederate States and the United States,\u201d anticipated and purposed a disruption and dismemberment of the general government. <em>Schmidt </em>v. Barker, 17 Louisiana Annual, 261. Presently afterwards, it was repeatedly and uniformly decided by the same court to be the established law of that state, that all notes and obligations, the consideration of which was a loan of Confederate currency, were void. 19 Louisiana Annual, 161, 164, 257, 269, 288, 359, 432, 464. 20 Ib. 37,138.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The principle of these decisions was embodied in the Louisiana Constitution of 1868, art. 127 of which declared that \u201c all agreements, the consideration of which was Confederate money, notes or bonds, are null and void, and shall not be enforced by the courts of this state.\u201d The subsequent decisions of the supreme court of Louisiana to the same effect are put upon the ground that the question was settled in the jurisprudence of the state, and not merely upon the constitutional provision. 21 Louisiana Annual, 14,18, 620. 22 Ib. 142, 462, 485. 23 Ib. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In one of these cases, which was a suit on a mortgage made in 1862 to secure the payment of promissory notes, the considera tian of which was a loan of Confederate currency, a writ of erra*, was sued out to the supreme court of the United States, and was dismissed by that court, because the decision of the state court was not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, but \u201c simply held that the promissory notes, together with the mortgage in question, were nullities, on the ground that the Confederate currency, which constituted the consideration, was illegal according to the law of the state at the time the contract was entered into.\u201d <em>Bethel </em>v. Hawkins, 21 Louisiana Annual, 620; <em>S. C. nom. Bethell </em>v. Demaret, 10 Wallace, 537. This judgment of the supreme court fully confirms the view that the decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the Louisiana court declared the law of the state previously tc and independently of the Constitution of 1868; for if those decisions had been based upon that Constitution, the question whether it impaired the obligation of contracts would have been subject to revision in the supreme court of the United States. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. McClure, 10 Wallace, 511. And it is peculiarly significant in the light of the fact that the supreme court had previously decided, in a case which came up from a federal court in Alabama, that a contract, made in that state during the rebellion for the payment of a certain number of dollars, and shown to have been in fact made for the payment of that sum in notes of the so called Confederate States, might be enforced, and damages assessed at the value of those notes in lawful money of the United States at the time and place of the contract. <em>Thorington </em>v. Smith, 8 Wallace, 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We are not required to consider whether the decisions of the supreme court of Louisiana are or are not founded in reason. It is enough that they are conclusive evidence thiit by the law of that state, where the notes in suit were made and payable, and where both parties to this action resided, these notes never had any legal validity there, and consequently cannot be enforced in any other state or country. As this view is decisive of the case, it is unnecessary to pass upon the other questions which have been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"AvH\"><em>Judgment on the verdict for the </em>defendants.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\"> See <em>Hannauer </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>10 Wallace, 482, and 15 Wallace, 439; <em>Bank of West Tennessee </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Bank of Louisiana, </em>14 Wallace, 9; <em>Delmas </em>v <em>Insurance Co. </em>Ib. 661; <em>Tarver </em>v. <em>Keach, </em>15 Wallace, 67; <em>Planters' Bank </em>v. <em>Union Bank, </em>16 Wallace, 483.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
