The court, however, also found for plaintiff on the other two counts and gave judgment in her favor for the sum of $3,646.41. Defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Appellant refers us to the evidence in an effort to prove that it is insufficient to support the finding that there was a partial failure of consideration and appellant further claims that respondent\u2019s laches should prevent a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Having reviewed the record, we are satisfied with the conclusion of the court below. There is ample evidence to support the findings and judgment and to warrant the court in holding that recovery is not barred by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Shenk, J., Seawell, J., Curtis, J., Langdon, J., Thompson, J., and Waste, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
