On January 18,1977, a judgment entry in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant was entered for the failure of defendant to answer plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. On March 1,1977, defendant filed a motion for relief from judgment, requesting that the court set aside the default judgment and permit defendant to plead or otherwise defend against the complaint. An affidavit of Raymond S. Tonti, the Secretary of defendant corporation, stated that Alfred E. Tonti was the President of the defendant corporation and had also been President of the three plaintiff corporations, and that it was the custom of Alfred E. Tonti to engage in intercompany loans and evidenced such loans by written memoranda on the various checks and endorsements. On September 13, 1977, the trial court set aside the default judgment and permitted defendant to plead or defend against the complaint. On September 21, 1977, defendant filed an answer to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. On November 30, 1977, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted by the trial court on February 3, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cWhere cancelled checks drawn on the accounts of Plaintiffs made payable to Defendant, endorsed by Defendant and deposited in Defendant\u2019s bank account, which checks had the word \u2018loan\u2019 noted on the face of each check, it was erroneous for the trial court to hold that such checks did not constitute agreements, contracts, or promises in writing, within the fifteen (15) year statute of limitations as provided in Ohio Revised Code, Section 2305.06, and that the causes of action thereon was governed by the six (6) year statute of limitations as provided in Ohio Revised Code 2305.07.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the checks in question endorsed by defendant and deposited to its account constitute\u2018an agreement, contract or promise in writing by defendant to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>plaintiffs, relying upon the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Eyler </em>(1930), 37 Ohio App. 210. We find that the facts of that case are clearly distinguishable from those of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">In <em>Davis </em>the instrument read \u201cDue L. Eyler from Sam Davis One Hundred and Fifty $150.00,\u201d and was signed by the one acknowledging the obligation. This court held that there was a definite and distinct acknowledgement from the writing itself that Davis owed Eyler the sum of $150, and from that acknowledgement there would be an obligation for the payment thereof. In the present case the single word \u201cloan\u201d written on the instrument gives no indication as to who owes whom or whether the check is a loan or the repayment of a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In order for an action to come within the statute of limitations governing actions upon a specialty or an agreement, contract, or promise in writing under R. C. 23Q5.06, the action must grow out of a written instrument which first acknowledges indebtedness or second promises to pay in such terms as to make supplemental evidence unnecessary. <em>Rudolph Brothers </em>v. <em>Husat </em>(1961), 9 Ohio Law Abs. 1. In this case it is clear that supplement\u00e1l evidence would be required to complete the terms of whatever understanding the parties may have had. In addition, a check is not itself a promise from the payee to pay money to the maker of the check. Although plaintiffs argue that a promise may be implied from the use of the word \u201cloan,\u201d the use of the word \u201cloan\u201d may equally indicate payment of a loan. Plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error is overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">Whiteside and McCormac, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
