He was charged with two counts of aggravated burglary in violation of R. C. 2911.11, one count of possessing a criminal tool in violation of R. C. 2923.24, one count of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of R. C. 2923.12, and one count of grand theft in violation of R. C. 2913.02. The defendant entered a plea of guilty to two counts of aggravated burglary <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on July 20, 1976, and upon the recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mendation of the prosecutor, the remaining charges were nolled. At the sentencing hearing, the defendant requested that he be sentenced under R. C. 2911.12, the burglary-statute. The trial court refused and sentenced the defendant to four to twenty-five years on each count under R. C. 2911.11, the aggravated burglary statute, the sentences to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed from that sentence and assigned two errors. For the reasons stated below, we find both errors to be without merit and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">There is a preliminary question confronting this court as to whether the defendant\u2019s guilty plea precludes him from attacking the constitutionality of the statute under which he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The applicable law has been set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Menna </em>(1975), 423 U. S. 61. That case makes clear the distinction that, while constitutional violations which go to the establishment of factual guilt are rendered irrelevant by a plea of guilty, those violations which go to the ability of the state to prosecute regardless of factual guilt may be raised on appeal from a guilty plea. <em>See also Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1974), 417 U. S. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The question raised by this appeal stems from the state\u2019s power \u201c***to invoke criminal process against the defendant.***\u201d <em>Journigan </em>v. <em>Duffy </em>(C.A. 9, 1977), 522 F. 2d 283, 289. Since the state cannot convict and sentence under an invalid statute regardless of factual guilt, appellant\u2019s attack is not barred by the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The first error assigned by appellant charges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred by sentencing the appellant pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>suant to aggravated burglary, Ohio Rev. Code \u00a72911.11 (A) (3), where that subsection prohibits exactly the same activity as burglary, Ohio Rev. Code \u00a72911.12, where the former carries a heavier penalty than the latter, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ohio Rev. Code \u00a72901.04 (A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cA. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a72911.11 (A) (3) and Ohio Rev. Code \u00a72911.12, by their clear and unambiguous language, are identical in their prohibitions, yet they provide different penalties for the very same conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cB. As a result of the duplication of offenses embodied in the two statutes at issue, and in light of their differing penalties, the more burdensome of the two cannot stand under the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and thus, the appellant must be sentenced under the lesser of the two.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The issue raised by this assignment of error is whether R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3) and R. C. 2911.12 proscribe behavior requiring identical proofs, but allow for two different penalties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Consideration of this question requires a comparison of the statutes regarding burglary and aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The statutory proscription against burglary is set forth in R. C. 2911.12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP1\">\u201c(A) No person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure as defined in section 2909.01 of the Revised Code, or in a separately secured or separately occupied portion thereof, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or any felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201c(B) Whoever violates this section is guilty of burglary, a felony of the second degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The referenced definitions of occupied structure are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201c\u00a72909.01 Definitions. As used in sections 2909.01 to 2909.07 of the Revised Code, an \u2018occupied structure\u2019 is any house, building, outbuilding, watercraft, aircraft, railroad car, truck, trailer, tent, or other structure, vehicle, or shelter, or any portion thereof, to which any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c(A) Which is maintained as a permanent or temporary dwelling, even though it is temporarily unoccupied, and whether or not any person is actually present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201c(B) Which at the time is occupied as the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, whether or not any person is actually present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201c(C) Which at the time is specially adapted for the overnight accommodation of any person, whether or not any person is actually present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201c(D) In which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">The statute which makes aggravated burglary a criminal offense is set forth in R. C. 2911.11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201c(A) No person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure as defined in section 2909.01 of the Revised Code, or in a separately secured or separately occupied portion thereof, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or any felony, when any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">\u201c(1) The offender inflicts, or attempts to inflict physical harm on another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201c(2) The offender has a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance as defined in section 2923.11 of the Revised Code on or about his person or under his control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201c(3) The occupied structure involved is the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, in which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">\u201c(B) Whoever violates this section is guilty of aggravated burglary, a felony of the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">If the two statutes operate to prohibit identical activity, require identical proof, and yet impose different penalties, we would conclude that to sentence a defendant under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>statute with the higher penalty violates the equal protection of the law. However, we have concluded that the statutes are not identical. Rather the two statutes consist of different elements and impose different burdens on the state. The test of equal protection in this context is not whether a particular defendant may be charged under either statute and receive different penalties based upon prosecutorial discretion. To the contrary, the test is whether, if the defentant is charged with the elevated crime, the state has the burden of proving an additional element beyond that required by the lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In <em>Roush </em>v. <em>White </em>(N. D. Ohio 1975), 389 F. Supp. 396, the Federal District Court considered the relationship of prosecutorial discretion and equal protection in the context of determining the constitutionality of Ohio marihuana laws. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201c***[I]t is important to note that prosecutorial discretion, in and of itself is not unconstitutional. See 16A CTS Constitutional Law 3563, for 16.10. Only when that discretion is unfettered, when it is the prosecutor, not the legislature, enacting the laws, is the Constitution offended. Thus, technically, the question is whether the above quoted statutes each prosecute the <em>same acts. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Further, we acknowledge at this point the well-established principle of law that \u201ccourts will refrain from declaring legislation unconstitutional unless the posture of the cause leaves no logical alternative thereto.\u201d <em>Washington Court House </em>v. <em>McStowe </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 228, 230, <em>quoting Bedford Hts. </em>v. <em>Tallarico </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 211, 212. <em>See also </em>R. C 1.47, R. C. 1.49 and R. C. 1.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">It is upon this basis that we conclude that not one of the subparts of R. C. 2909.01, incorporated by reference in R. C. 2911.12, is identical to all of the elements imposed by R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3). Consequently, the crimes of burglary and aggravated burglary are not identical statutes, but rather involve different elements of proof. As a result the sentencing procedure utilized in the case at bar does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The process of our analysis involves careful scrutiny of the relevant statutes^ At the outset, we emphasize that the definitions of occupied structure contained in R. C 2909.01 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>are not meant to be read cumulatively. The statute provides that an \u201coccupied structure is any * * * structure * * * to which <em>any </em>of the following applies:***(Emphasis added.) While \u201cany\u201d may be used as either a singular or plural pronoun, the use of the verb \u201capplies\u201d leaves no doubt but that the word \u201cany\u201d is intended to carry a singular meaning in this statute. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">That this, is a proper reading of the statute is supported by a comparison with R. C. 2911.11, aggravated burglary. That statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201c(A) No person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure* * * when <em>any </em>of the following <em>apply:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c(1) The offender inflicts, or attempts to inflict physical harm on another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201c(2) The offender has a deadly weapon or dangerous ordinance as defined in section 2923.11 of the Revised Code on or about his person or under his control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c(3) The occupied structure involved in the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, in which at the time any person is present, or likely to be present.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">In contra-distinction to R. C. 2909.01, these parts were intended to operate collectively. The uses of the verb \u201capply\u201d plus the fact that the three subparts may logically be read together point up the different statutory organization and legislative intent in the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">While it should be sufficient to state that R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3) does not equate to any one of the subparts of R. C. 2909.01, our conclusion is buttressed by an examination of the specific differences which occur when the relevant portion of the aggravated burglary statute is compared to each subpart of the burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">In regard to R. C. 2909.01 (A), (B) and (C), not one of the subparts requires proof of the element \u201cpresent or likely to be present\u201d as is essential to the proof of aggravated burglary. In other words, if the state is to carry its burden on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>aggravated burglary, it must prove that a person is either present or likely to be present at the time. The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilby </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 21, has held that some evidence must be presented in order to meet the required burden. <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>unreported, Eighth Appellate District, No. 34856, decided June 10, 1976, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Doss, </em>unreported, Eighth Appellate District, No. 34697, decided April 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">While admittedly it may not be difficult to prove \u2014 even beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 that any person is present or likely to be present in a habitation at a particular time, that is precisely what the statute requires and it may be justified by the strong policy of protecting families from intrusion in their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">One of the definitions of occupied structure included in R. C. 2909.01 (D) is a \u201chouse\u201d in which at the time any person is present or likely to be present. Aggravated burglary pursuant to R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3) is distinguished from this definition by the language \u201cpermanent or temporary habitation.\u201d Brief reflection suggests that a \u201chouse\u201d need not be permanently or temporarily inhabited and yet still have a person be present or likely to be present. For example, a vacant house which is being repaired at the time by an artisan would comply with the essential requirements for a charge of burglary, but not aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In conclusion, a person who burglarizes a \u201chouse\u201d may indeed be potentially charged with either burglary or aggravated burglary, but if that person is charged with aggravated burglary, the state carries the burden of proving, not only that the house is a permanent or temporary habitation, but also that at that time a person is present or likely to be present. This necessarily is a higher burden because it requires proof of an additional element.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Therefore, we are convinced that R. C. 2911.11, Ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>gravated Burglary, and R. C. 2911.12, Burglary, require proof of distinctly different elements, and consequently the aggravated burglary statute under which defendant was convicted is not a violation of the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The second error assigned by appellant charges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201cAssuming arguendo that the duplication existing between burglary and aggravated burglary is not violative of the Equal Protection Clause, subsection (A) (3) of aggravated burglary constitutes a denial of Due Process of Law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, where one of the elements of that offense need not be proved by the state in order to sustain a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Appellant contends, by this argument, that the element of \u201cpresent or likely to be present\u201d need not be proved and, therefore, the statute is violative of due process of law as established by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Initially, we observe that as set forth more fully in the first assignment of error, the statute under which the appellant was sentenced is capable of a constitutional construction which would require the state to prove this element beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U. S. 352. Since it is capable of this construction and since the trial court was bound to give it this construction, the statute cannot be said to be void on its face. <em>See Washington Court House </em>v. <em>McStowe, supra, </em>and R. C. 1.47, R. C. 1.49, and R. C. 1.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Thus, the only question when the matter proceeds to trial is whether the statute would be void because the state was unjustly relieved of its burden of proof on one of its elements. If there had been a trial and that did occur, both the Ohio and United States Constitutions would be violated. However, we have no way of knowing how this portion of the statute would have been applied in the case at bar because the appellant plead guilty and thereby relieved the state of any burden of proof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Accordingly, we find this assignment of error to be without merit, and the decision of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-5\">Corrigan, C. J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b401-6\">Day, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-15\"> The first count of Aggravated Burglary brought against the defendant reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajm\">\u201cAggravated Burglary R. C. \u00a72911.11. The Jurors of the Grand Jury of the State of Ohio, within and for the body of the County aforesaid, on their oaths, in the name and by the authority of the state of Ohio, do find and present, that the above named Defendants), on or about the date of the offense set forth above, in the Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ty of Cuyahoga unlawfully and purposely and by force, stealth, or deception trespassed in an occupied structure as defined in Section 2909.01 of the Revised Code, or in a separately secured or separately occupied portion thereof, with the purpose to commit therein a theft offense as defined in Section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or a felony, and the occupied structure involved is the permanent or temporary habitation of Luther Hayes, in which at the time he is present or likely to be present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The language of the second count of Aggravated Burglary is substantially the same. The sole difference is the substitution of the name \u201cRonnie Thompson\u201d for that of Luther Hayes. Although the indictment does not specify a particular section of R. C. 2911.11, it is apparent from the wording that Defendant was indicted only under R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3). This conclusion is supported by the prosecutor\u2019s oral argument in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\"> R. C. 2901.04 (A) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201c(A) Sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">For the reason that we find the meaning of the relevant statutes to be distinguishable, rather than ambiguous, they need not be construed and there is no need for application of the provisions of R. C. 2901.04 (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-14\"> Aggravated burglary is a felony in the first degree and imposes a minimum term of 4, 5, 6, or 7 years fixed by the court and a statutory maximum term of 25 years. Burglary is a felony in the second degree and imposes a minimum term of 2,3, 4, or 5 years and a statutory maximum term of 15 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\"> If the state legislature had intended the subparts to operate collectively they could have used the following language: \u201cif <em>any one or more </em>of the following apply.\u201d In that case, the legislature would have been required by the basic rules of grammar to use a plural verb: apply. Since they did not do so, we must presume that their use of the pronoun \u201cany\u201d and the singular verb \u201capplies\u201d is purposeful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"> As we understand the dissenting position, it is that R. C. 2909.01 (B) and (D) may be read together and thus required the same proof for burglary as is required for aggravated burglary under R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3). Our disagreement is twofold. First, as we interpret the burglary statute it does not contemplate that the subparts may be read together. Second, while burglary may be proved by carrying the burden on 2909.01 (A), (B), (C) <em>or </em>(D), aggravated burglary may be proved only by proving the equivalents of R. C. 2909.01 (B) <em>and </em>(D) together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\"> The trial court did in fact give the statute the proper construction in the process of explaining the nature of the charge to the defendant pursuant to defendant\u2019s guilty plea. The transcript from the proceeding includes the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Now, the prosecutor as well as your attorney have indicated that you want to withdraw your plea of not guilty to the offenses of aggravated burglary which are contained in the first and third counts of the indictment.

The state must prove that you broke and entered the residence of another person for the purpose of committing a theft <em>and that someone was either present in the home or was likely to be present at the time you broke and entered. </em>Now, that is what to this point you have pleaded not guilty to. Do you understand me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">\u201cThe Court: And then <em>it is the burden of the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of these two crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>In other words, it is not your burden to prove that you are innocent. It is the state or the prosecutor\u2019s job to prove you guilty. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">\u201cThe Court: For an example, <em>the state would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that on or about May the 25th of 1976 and in Cuyahoga County that you did break and enter into an occupied structure which was the residence of Luther Hayes for the purpose of committing a theft and that at the time you broke and entered, <em>someone was either in the house or was likely to be in the house. </em>Now, this is what the state must prove before a jury can find you guilty, and the state must prove each of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

This distinction is, at best, a thin one. For any statute can be deemed unambiguous if the reading ignores all facets of the alleged ambiguity except one. Once the possibility of ambiguity is accepted, R. C. 2901.04 (A) compels a narrow interpretation of the reach of the substantive criminal statute, R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3). With this in mind, consider the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In my view, the issue presented is whether the plea and sentencing under the aggravated burglary statute violates equal protection because precisely the same act could have been charged under the simple burglary statute carrying a lighter minimum sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This possibility, appellant claims, quickens the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the defendant cannot be dealt the heavier sentence.

That statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">\u201c2911.11 Aggravated burglary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">\u201c(A) No person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure as defined in section 2909.01 of the Revised Code, or in a separately secured or separately occupied portion thereof, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or any felony, when any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\">\u201c(1) The offender inflicts, or attempts or threatens to inflict physical harm on another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">\u201c(2) The offender has a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance as defined in section 2923.11 of the Revised Code on or about his person or under his control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\">\u201c(3) The occupied structure involved is the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, in which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">\u201c(B) Whoever violates this section is guilty of aggravated burglary, a felony of the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">Each of the statutes specifically refers to the Arson chapter of the Revised Code for the definition of \u201coccupied structure.\u201d The definition is found in R. C. 2909.01:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-19\">\u201c\u00a72909.01 Definitions. As used in sections 2909.01 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>2909.07 of the Revised Code, an \u2018occupied structure\u2019 is any house, building, outbuilding, watercraft, aircraft, railroad car, truck, trailer, tent, or other structure, vehicle, or shelter, or any portion thereof, to which any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201c(A) Which is maintained as a permanent or temporary dwelling, even though it is temporarily unoccupied, and whether or not any person is actually present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201c(B) Which at the time is occupied as the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, whether or not any person is actually present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201c(C) Which at the time is specially adapted for the overnight accommodation of any person, whether or not any person is actually present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u201c(D) In which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Under Burglary, any person who trespasses in an occupied structure with purpose to commit a theft offense or a felony is guilty of a second degree felony. \u201cOccupied structure\u201d under R. C. 2909.01 includes a house:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201c(B) Which at the time is occupied as the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, whether or not any person is actually present; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\u201c(D) In which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Under Aggravated Burglary (A)(3), a person who trespasses in an occupied structure with purpose to commit a theft offense or felony is guilty of a first degree felony when the structure is: \u201c * * *the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, in which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.\u201d R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">When the definitional phrases specifically incorporated into the statute by the legislature are inserted, it is apparent that the elements of Burglary and Aggravated Burglary, R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3), are the same. For each statute prohibits a trespass in a structure that is a permanent or temporary habitation in which a person is present or likely to be present.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>This identity renders R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3) constitutionally infirm because it carries a more serious criminal classification than R. C. 2911.12 without proscribing an act coupled with an aggravating circumstance distinct from those found in the Burglary statute. This discrepancy mounts a constitutional fault, for the Equal Protection Clause mandates that persons in like situations be dealt with in a like manner under the law, <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1942), 316 U. S. 535, 541. Thus, the flaw in the instant statute is that it gives the prosecutor unfettered discretion to charge a person under the first degree felony statute (R. C. 2911.11 [A] [3]) without having to prove anything more than is required under the second degree felony \u201csimple\u201d Burglary statute. This power to invidiously discriminate through arbitrary selection between two identical statutes with different penalties cannot be permitted because of its inherent potential for abuse:</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u201cWhere***there are no standards governing the exercise of the discretion, * * *the scheme permits and encourages an arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law. It furnishes a convenient tool for \u2018harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville </em>(1972), 405 U. S. 156, 170, 31 L.Ed. 2d 110, 120, quoting <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1940), 310 U. S. 88, 97-98. Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Favors </em>(Colo. 1976), 556 P. 2d 72, 74; see also, <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Delmore </em>(1956), 295 P. 2d 324, 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">This unfettered discretion is not only inconsistent with the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, but it also raises serious questions under the fundamental fairness doctrine of the Due Process Clause. In order to comport with the requirements of that clause a statute: \u201c***must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U. S. 104, 108-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Identical proscriptions with different penalties provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>classic opportunity for a capricious act of discretion. Such an occasion for official arbitrariness ought not survive a due process test.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\"> This issue appears to be one of the first impression. In <em>State, ex rel. Corrigan, </em>v. <em>White </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 29, the problem of duplicity was raised, but the Supreme Court found that it was not relevant to the disposition of the writ of <em>mandamus, id. </em>at 30. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilby </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 21, the present constitutional problem was not raised at all. Although defendant was convicted under R. C. 2911.11 (A) (3), his allegations of error went only to the weight of the evidence and the jury instructions, <em>id. </em>at 22. The court, accordingly, decided the appeal solely on those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b403-20\"> Felony 1 carries a minimum term of 4, 5,6, or 7 years fixed by the court and a statutory maximum term of 25 years. Felony 2 has court determined minimum terms of 2, 3, 4, or 5 years and a statutory maximum of 15 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> The argument is made that the R. C. 2909.01 definitions (B) and (D) cannot be read together. However, this argument fails because the legislature made plain its intent to allow combinations of qualifying subparagraphs when it introduced them with the phrase \u201cany of the following applies.\u201d Moreover, one may read (B) and (D) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>very closely without discovering a substantive difference between the two. Both R. C. 2911.11 and .12 incorporate the 2909.01 definition of \u201coccupied structure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
