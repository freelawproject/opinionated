J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN5\">The state appeals a judgment of the Wayne County Municipal Court dismissing a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol (R. C. 4511.19) against the defendant, Joseph Savage, for a failure to serve a copy of the charge upon him as provided by Traf. R. 3(E). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">Savage was operating a motor vehicle when he was stopped by State Patrolman Carpenter. Carpenter had him per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>form some field tests and then took him to the patrol post for a breathalyzer test. The defendant was arrested, posted bond and told to pick up a copy of the ticket at the patrol post. He never picked it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The defendant entered a plea of not guilty, filed a jury demand and appeared for trial. At that time, he moved for a dismissal under Traf. R. 11 because he was not served with the traffic citation by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We hold that the plea of not guilty was an appearance before the court and constituted a waiver of any objection he might have had to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over him. The lack of service was a defect in the institution of the proceeding which should have been raised by a motion to dismiss prior to the plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for a trial upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\"><em>Judgment reversed and cause </em>remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-8\">Bell, and Victor, J J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
