There is no bill of exceptions. This is an attack on the validity of the decree by reason of its failure to include a finding that the husband is unable to support such children. It is contended that such a finding is necessary because of the duty imposed by R. C. 3103.03, which provides in part: \u201cThe husband must support himself, his wife, and his minor children out of his property or by his labor. <em>If he is unable to do so, </em>the wife must assist him so far as she is able.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">R. C. 3103.06 provides in pertinent part: \u201cA husband and wife * * * <em>may agree </em>to an immediate separation and <em>make provisions for the support of </em>either of them and <em>their children during </em>the separation.\u201d (Emphsis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">Also the last sentence of R. C. 3105.20 applies in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>case. It states: <em>\u201cIn any matter concerning domestic relations the court shall not be deemed to be deprived of its full equity powers and jurisdiction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Sections 3103.03, 3103.05 and 3105.20 are to be read in <em>pari materia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">A decree of divorce carries with it a presumption of regularity. The decree here does not affirmatively indicate that such presumption has been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In our opinion, substantial justice has been done the party complaining. (R. C. 2309.59) and the decree under review is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-8\">Rutherford, P. J., Putman and McLaughlin (Retired. Assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Constitution.), JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
