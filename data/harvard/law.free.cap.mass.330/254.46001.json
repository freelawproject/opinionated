The defendant is an intrastate common carrier. There was evidence that the plaintiff arrived with her trunk at the South Station in Boston late in an evening in May, 1949, and went to the defendant\u2019s office there. She was not asked the value of her trunk, but was given a small pasteboard check by the defendant which was not read to her and which she did not read, but put in her purse. The trunk was to be delivered at her home in Boston. The defendant failed to deliver her trunk, and admitted that it had been lost. The small check had on one side the order number and the words \u201cRead contract on reverse side,\u201d and on the other the words, \u201cThe holder of this check agrees that the value of the baggage checked does not exceed $100 unless a greater value has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>been declared at time of checking and additional payment made therefore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The defendant excepted to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $100. The defendant excepted to the refusal of several requested instructions to the effect that the plaintiff was bound by the limitation printed upon the check, whether she read it or not. The judge instructed the jury, over the exception of the defendant, that the plaintiff is bound by that limitation if she had knowledge of it when she took the check, and otherwise is not. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,700, and the defendant brought the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Where what is given to a plaintiff purports on its face to set forth the terms of a contract, the plaintiff, whether he reads it or not, by accepting it assents to its terms, and is bound by any limitation of liability therein contained, in the absence of fraud. <em>Grace </em>v. Adams, 100 Mass. 505 (bill of lading). <em>Gott </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>111 Mass. 45, 52 (assent necessary). <em>Redpath </em>v. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>112 Mass. 71 (telegraph blank). <em>Monitor Mutual Fire Ins.

But we may say that our conclusions are supported by well reasoned cases in New York as well as other jurisdictions. <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>137 N. Y. 460. <em>Healy </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>153 App. Div. (N. Y.) 516, affirmed 210 N. Y. 646. <em>Blossom </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>43 N.

In our opinion no error is disclosed by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
