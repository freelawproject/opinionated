The plaintiff had a verdict and the case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission and exclusion of evidence and to a portion of the judge\u2019s charge. It is conceded by the defendant that apart from evidence admitted over her objections and exceptions there was evidence to warrant the submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">There was evidence that the plaintiff and her husband, Henry L. Ross, were married in New Haven, Connecticut, on February 11, 1928, and continued to live there and in Syracuse, New York, until 1937 when they moved to Way-land, Massachusetts. Two children were born of the marriage. The plaintiff and her husband met the defendant and her husband, Frederick R. Nourse, Junior, in June, 1942. Ross was then thirty-six years of age and Mrs. Nourse twenty-five. The Nourses with their three children lived in Dedham. In June, 1942, Nourse entered the military service and went to North Carolina. At about the same time the plaintiff with her children went to Kennebunkport, Maine, for the summer. Throughout that season Ross saw the defendant four or five times a week but spent the week ends at Kennebunkport. About Labor Day Ross and the defendant went to New Haven and stayed at a hotel, being registered as \u201cMr. and Mrs. Henry L. Ross.\u201d Thereafter Ross and the defendant made numerous trips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>together, were registered where they stopped as Mr. and Mrs. Henry L. Ross, and occupied the same room. When Nourse came home on leave on February 11, 1943, the defendant asked him for a divorce to which he agreed after an interview with Ross. Later on the same night Ross asked the plaintiff for a divorce so that he could marry the defendant, but the plaintiff did not consent. Nourse was killed in an automobile accident on June 5, 1943. During that summer Ross went to Kennebunkport only once. He had no sexual relations with his wife between June, 1943, and November, 1945. The Rosses gave up the house where they lived in Wayland in the fall of 1943 and the plaintiff returned to New Haven, Ross remaining in Massachusetts. He entered the navy in December of that year and remained in active service until November 9, 1945. When he was ashore the defendant visited him at various places \u2022in the eastern part of the country. After going on inactive duty Ross joined his wife in New Haven and announced that he \u201cwas back to stay.\u201d He was affectionate and kind. Nevertheless he and the defendant went to Florida and Nassau in January, 1946, and remained away until the middle of February. He returned to New Haven but did not resume marital relations with his wife. In the . summer of 1946 Ross rented a cottage in Kennebunkport and occasionally went there on week ends to visit his family. But after September he moved to Boston and never returned to live with the plaintiff. In June, 1947, there were negotiations between Ross and the plaintiff's attorneys regarding a divorce and the establishment of a trust fund, but no settlement was reached. In January, 1948, the defendant accompanied Ross to Florida where, on application by him, he obtained a decree of divorce on July 20, 1948. He married the defendant three days later. They now have a child born December 4, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">During 1943 and 1944 when Ross and the defendant were together she contributed toward the expenses of their trips. Her contributions in 1943 amounted to $1,064. On their trip to Florida in 1946 she contributed $1,000 or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>to their joint expenses. In 1947 she gave Boss checks totaling $8,334 of which $2,500 was paid in June, 1947, when he consulted Boston counsel. In 1948, up to the time of their marriage, she contributed $2,292 toward their expenses. During the years 1946, 1947, and 1948 her checks drawn to Boss totaled $12,958, and in 1943, 1944, and 1945, $2,589.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The defendant excepted to the admission of a letter (exhibit 4) dated April 18 (presumably 1945) written by Boss to his wife when he was in the navy and serving in the Pacific area. It appeared to be an affectionate letter, containing a reference to the children, and, in connection with an expected attack on Japan, a suggestion of the possibility of something happening to him. It read in part: \u201cI want you to know that I\u2019m desperately sorry for all the unhappiness I\u2019ve caused you \u2022 \u2014 you haven\u2019t deserved it, one bit.\u201d This letter was written before the time when, as it could be found, he finally deserted his wife. It was clearly admissible as evidence of the state of his affection for his wife. The loss of his affection was an element of her damage. <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>234 Mass. 307, 316-317. <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>258 Mass. 420, 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The defendant also excepted to the admission of a letter (exhibit 19) post marked April 21, 1945, from the defendant to Boss. She sent him her love, addressed him as \u201cdearest,\u201d and asked him to keep writing. The defendant contends that the letter should have been excluded because it included the following paragraph: \u201cIt has been quite a hectic day \u2014 Pete Sawyer \u2014 my cousin from Houlton, came out this morning on his way back from Washington \u2014 and presented me with $25,000 more \u2014 due me from my grandfather\u2019s estate. Everything seems to come at once \u2014 and it\u2019s too bad that it didn\u2019t come a little earlier \u2014 not that we ever really had to deny ourselves much \u2014 but anyway sweet \u2014 the greater part of it will be reinvested against a happier day.\u201d It could be found that at the time of the letter the relations of Boss to the defendant had reached the stage where they contemplated living together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The letter was admissible as evidence tending to show that the defendant held out to Ross the expectation of future financial security as a means to persuade him to abandon his wife for the defendant. The judge properly instructed the jury that the amount of the defendant\u2019s wealth was not in issue and that the letter could only be considered by them on the question of enticement. See <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Benbow, </em>211 Mass. 366, 368; <em>Georgacopoulos </em>v. <em>Katralis, </em>318 Mass. 34, 37; <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Cramer, </em>106 Wash. 681, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Portions of another letter from the defendant to Ross post marked April 17, 1945, were read to the jury subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. Therein the defendant wrote of selling some jewelry for $2,800 and referred to a Gilbert Stuart painting worth $10,000 or $15,000. She stated that she was enclosing a check \u201cout of . . . [her] good fortune\u201d and as to the painting said, \u201cSo as money in the bank really makes more sense, we will probably sell it, and naturally everything will go in equal shares.\u201d These excerpts from the letter were admissible for the reasons stated in reference to the letter of April 21. The judge carefully restricted their use to the issue of enticement. In respect to the April 17 letter the defendant was asked by her counsel, \u201cThere is testimony that at a certain time you made a sale of some jewelry. Was this done on your own initiative?\u201d She answered \u201cNo.\u201d The following question, \u201cWere you advised to do so?\u201d was excluded, and the defendant excepted. While the context seems to show that an affirmative answer was expected, in the absence of an offer of proof as to what further facts were intended to be shown, it does not appear that the defendant was harmed. See <em>Falk </em>v. <em>Falk, </em>279 Mass. 530, 532; <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>Lewis Furniture Co. </em>292 Mass. 500, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The defendant offered a letter (exhibit B for identification) dated March 28, 1947, from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in New Haven to Ross in Boston which read as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\u201cMrs. Ross has discussed with us your desertion of her and failure to provide her with any support. From the discussions with her, we understand that you are not in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>position to furnish her adequate support. We understand you have paid her nothing since September of 1946. We further understand that you are paying for the education of your minor son, Leigh S. Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, we have advised Mrs. Ross that her only means of effectively securing adequate funds for her support would be to seek damages from Mrs. Frederick Nourse, in an action for alienation of affections, which would be commenced in the court having jurisdiction over Mrs. Nourse in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\u201cMrs. Ross has directed us to notify you that unless you are able to make arrangements for the satisfactory support of Mrs. Ross and for the children until such time as they cease to be minors, and unless you advise us of these plans in the near future, we are to make arrangements to have suit brought against Mrs. Nourse in Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The second and third paragraphs were admitted, and the first paragraph was excluded subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">It was not questioned that the letter was written under authority given by the plaintiff. See <em>W. </em>A. <em>Robinson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>327 Mass. 670, 674-675. Although the present action was not commenced until October, 1948, the paragraphs admitted had a bearing on the motive of the plaintiff in resorting to legal proceedings against the defendant. The first paragraph also might properly have been admitted (see <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Morse, 271 </em>Mass. 501, 504) but we think its exclusion did not harm the defendant. The advice given by the attorneys to the plaintiff and her direction to them were contained in the succeeding paragraphs. Their import was not affected by the preliminary statement respecting the understanding of the attorneys as to the failure of Ross to furnish support. In the second paragraph it was clearly stated that their advice to bring an action against the defendant was for the purpose of securing adequate support. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Another letter (exhibit A for identification) from the same attorney to Ross, dated June 4, 1947, was excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. It read, \u201cAs I said to you on the telephone yesterday, your suggestion for settlement is not satisfactory to Mrs. Ross. . . . She feels that unless you can continue to carry on the boy\u2019s tuition and make some provision for her safeguard in the future, she must do what she can to secure that by suit. This can be avoided if you will meet the following conditions.\u201d The conditions were listed. The letter was plainly a proposal to Ross for settlement of a controversy between him and his wife over the future support of his family. The only portion material to the present case was the suggestion of suit and the way in which it could be avoided. If this suit was the one of which mention had previously been made by the attorney, the letter was admissible as evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s motive. It added nothing to the earlier letter except a more definite statement of the conditions imposed. The evidence of motive which it provided was merely cumulative and in our opinion its effect on the result of the trial would have been unimportant. \u201cThe admission or exclusion of merely cumulative evidence, that adds nothing to evidence already in the case, does not require the sustaining of exceptions, even though there was technical error.\u201d <em>Bendett </em>v. <em>Bendett, </em>315 Mass. 59, 65-66, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The only other exception argued was to the \u201csingling out the reading of letters [by the judge in his charge] to show what was an undisputed situation in the case,\u201d namely, the knowledge of the defendant that the Rosses were married. An examination of the charge discloses no prejudicial emphasis on that point. The judge stated that the question of knowledge did not appear to be in dispute and brought to the attention of the jury the instances where the defendant had been in the company of the Rosses. He also read an excerpt from a letter from the defendant to Ross in which she referred to the plaintiff. There had been no agreement of counsel on the matter and it was for the judge to decide to what extent he should state the evidence and discuss the possible inferences of fact that might be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>from it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polian, </em>288 Mass. 494, 499, and cases cited. <em>R. Dunkel, Inc. </em>v. <em>V. Barletta Co. </em>302 Mass. 7, 12. We find in the charge no suggestion of bias or prejudice. There is no merit in the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
