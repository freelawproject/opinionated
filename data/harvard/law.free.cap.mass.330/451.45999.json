L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 239, begun in a District Court. That court found for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 239, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1946, c. 175, \u00a7 1, the appeal bond given by a defendant in such an action must be with sufficient surety or \u201csecured by cash or its equivalent deposited with the clerk, in a reasonable amount to be fixed by the plaintiff or court.\u201d In the present case there was no surety on the appeal bond, but there was deposited with the clerk a bank book in the savings department of The First National Bank of Northampton, standing in the name of \u201cKenneth D. or Jeannette G. Childs,\u201d who were husband and wife, together with an order for $500 on the account, signed by Kenneth D. Childs but not by Jeannette G. Childs.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">In the Superior Court the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal \u201cupon the ground that the defendant\u2019s appeal has not been legally taken and that therefore the Superior Court has no jurisdiction.\u201d A judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion to dismiss the appeal, and from that action the defendant appealed to this court. No exception appears to have been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Appeals from the Superior Court to this court in actions at law are governed by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. The only part of that section that might be thought to permit the appeal in this case is the provision for appeal from an order \u201cdecisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d Unless the present case falls within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>that provision, appeal will not lie. <em>Styrnbrough </em>v. <em>Cambridge Savings Bank, </em>299 Mass. 22. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>312 Mass. 442, 449. The word \u201crecord\u201d in that section does not include everything that may have come to this court. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>316 Mass. 187, 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">It may be that the bond given on appeal from the District Court became part of the record. But the face of the bond does not disclose whether the bond was \u201csecured by cash or its equivalent.\u201d Whether it was or not depended upon evidence upon which a finding had to be made. Findings of fact are not part of the record. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>316 Mass. 187, 192. The dismissal of the appeal is not shown to have been an order \u201cdecisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
