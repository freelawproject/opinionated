G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. The decedent, a man fifty-three years of age, had worked for the company about thirty-two years. On the morning of December 9 he began work at 7 a.m. and worked until 12 noon cleaning out the furnace by breaking up and removing heavy clinkers. It was work of a kind he was accustomed to perform. He had lunch and then worked at the purifier removing oxide until about 2 p.m., when he went out in the yard to smoke. Shortly thereafter he was found in the yard dead, his body face down upon the ground with a cut extending across the nose. Blood was coming from the nose and mouth. According to the death certificate the cause of death was \u201cCoronary 0 cclusion. Coronary Sclerosis. Chronic Myocarditis. \u2019 \u2019 The only medical evidence other than the death certificate was from the decedent\u2019s physician who testified that he had examined the decedent on November 2, 1950, and then \u201creached the conclusion that this man was suffering from a heart condition, more specifically, the beginning of a coronary heart disease,\u201d that \u201conce that coronary disease progresses, there is no way of telling when the blood vessels will become stopped or occluded, causing death,\u201d and that the nature of the coronary disease from which the employee was suffering was such \u201cthat he was liable to pass away at any time. People with this coronary disease pass away frequently when in bed asleep or when they are walking around the house or on the street.\u201d Although the doctor prescribed rest and advised the employee to stay away from</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>work, the latter continued with his usual employment. On the night before his death, he complained to his wife of pain in his upper left chest. On the following morning he made no complaints but laughed and joked with his fellow employees and was \"jolly\u201d when he left for the smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The single member who heard the case stated in his decision that \"1 cannot escape the conclusion that since the employee\u2019s heart condition was so advanced on December 9, 1950, it was not necessary to place any strain or stress on his heart to cause death, that it necessarily follows, and it is fair to assume, that the least exertion required in this particular work was sufficient on this day to hasten his death sooner than it ordinarily would occur. 1 am of the opinion that these facts warrant a finding that the death arose out of and in the course of his employment and claimant is entitled to the benefit of the presumption under \u00a7 7A of the act. I find that the employee\u2019s death was hastened by the exertion from the work he was doing on December 9, 1950. On all of the evidence, 1 rule and find that the deceased employee\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d On review it was stated by the reviewing board in its decision: \"The reviewing board, on consideration of all the evidence, affirm and adopt the findings and decision of the single member and find further that on the day of the employee\u2019s death he was required in the course of his work to perform work which involved considerable strain and stress and that in all probability affected his heart, inducing the injury which resulted in his death and that accordingly, his death was causally related to such work. <em>(Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113.) The reviewing board find further that the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>7A, </em>have application to this claim and the reviewing board find the insurer has failed by substantial evidence to overcome the presumption in favor of the claimant in the latter section.\u201d Section <em>7A </em>of c. 152, inserted by St. 1947, c. 380, to which reference was made, provides in part that \"where the employee has been killed ... it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that the claim comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>within the provisions of this chapter . . ..\u201d This presumption \u201capplies to every element of the claim to compensation, to the requirement that the injury arise out of the employment as well as the requirement that it arise in the course of the employment\u201d <em>(Woloshchuck\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 10, 12), and the words \u201csubstantial evidence to the contrary\u201d mean evidence \u201csuch \u2018as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.' \u201d <em>Goddu\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 397, 401. In our opinion the reviewing board erred in ruling that the presumption was applicable to the present claim. The evidence as to the likelihood of the decedent's death from a coronary attack independent of any physical exertion and of his apparently normal conduct on the morning of December 9 until practically up to the time of his death was substantial evidence that the death was caused solely by his coronary heart disease and was not attributable to his employment. See <em>Stepner\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 230; <em>Lysaght\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 281. Compare <em>Lapinsky\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 13,16. Apart from the presumption there was sufficient evidence to warrant the decision of the board. <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113. The ruling as to the applicability of \u00a7 7A appears to be supplementary to the findings on which the conclusion of the board was based and not a necessary part of the decision. See <em>O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 303; <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, supra. </em>It may be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Costs under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
