An auditor, whose findings of fact were final, reported as follows. The plaintiff is a corporation which for nineteen years has engaged in the manufacture and sale of women\u2019s shoes in popular styles and colors, including white suede. It leases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>from the defendant twelve or more machines which are used in \u201ca process known as backing whereby the leather vamp is reinforced by having cemented to it on its underneath side a piece of stiff cloth material called a backer.\u201d The backer is cemented to the vamp under machine pressure by means of a backing adhesive. This adhesive has been furnished by the defendant during the years that, the plaintiff has been in business, and the plaintiff has always relied on the defendant\u2019s skill and judgment to supply it with adhesive that was reasonably fit for the purposes for which it was customarily used. During December, 1949, and January, 1950, backing adhesive was ordered by the plaintiff and delivered in due course by the defendant. This adhesive was used in affixing backing on white suede shoes. The shoes were shipped south and within a few weeks 4,300 pairs were returned by the purchasers as defective. They had developed brown spots on the outside of the shoes opposite the points where the backing machine came in contact with the backer. The spots were caused by a \u201cdark brown oily substance\u201d contained in the adhesive which had been furnished by the defendant. This adhesive had a synthetic rubber base while other adhesive previously furnished had a natural rubber base. In compounding backing adhesive for his customers the defendant was accustomed to use ingredients based upon the needs and requirements of his individual customers. He knew that the adhesive sold to the plaintiff in December, 1949, and January, 1950, was to be used for the manufacture of women\u2019s shoes of various colors, including white suede. For five or six years the adhesive furnished to the plaintiff had, as a matter of convenience, been given the designation \u201c3200 H.\u201d Since it was given this number the plaintiff used the same grade of adhesive at all times and continued to \u201crely upon the skill and judgment of the defendant to\u2019 see that the backing adhesive sent to it would be suitable and proper according to . . . [jits] needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The auditor found that the adhesive which caused the damage to the shoes was sold to the plaintiff by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>fendant; that it was not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was purchased; that there was a breach by the defendant of the implied warranty of fitness (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 106, \u00a7 17 [1]); and that the resulting damage to the plaintiff amounted to $10,031.90. The judge allowed motions of the plaintiff to confirm the auditor\u2019s report and to enter judgment for the plaintiff in the above amount with interest to the date of the report. The defendant appealed from the \u201corder\u201d confirming the auditor\u2019s report and from the \u201corder\u201d that judgment be entered for the plaintiff. As there is no provision for confirming an auditor\u2019s report <em>(United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>English Construction Co. </em>303 Mass. 105, 112), the first appeal requires no consideration. The second appeal is properly before us since the allowance of the motion for judgment was equivalent to an order for judgment and was decisive . of the case. <em>Monaghan </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>320 Mass. 367, 368. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The only question argued by the defendant is whether as matter of law the auditor was warranted in finding that the adhesive was sold to the plaintiff. He contends that \u201cthe transaction . . . was not a sale . . . [and] that the adhesive was furnished ... as a means of measuring the royalty or rent due for the use made of the leased machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The terms of the lease or leases were not in evidence but the auditor had before him three invoices similar in form dated December 12, 1949, January 5, 1950, and January 27, 1950, relating to the shipments or deliveries of the adhesive in question. The invoice of December 12, 1949, which is stated by the auditor to be a sample of these invoices, was captioned with the defendant\u2019s name, was addressed to the plaintiff, and referred to the plaintiff\u2019s order number. It contained the following \u201clegend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u201c6 Kegs 3200 H Backing Adhesive 279 lbs. Royalty 1.00 279.00</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Less 51.3% 135.87\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">It also stated that \u201ca 2% discount would be allowed if paid within ten days\u201d and that \u201call prices\u201d were subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>change. There appeared the notation \u201cthe seller represents that, with respect to the production of the articles covered by this invoice, it has fully complied with Section 12 (A) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended.\u201d The auditor found this to be \u201ca bill ... for the sale of the described goods for which the purchase price was $135.87\u201d and that \u201ceach of these three transactions represented by these bills of sale constituted a sale.\u201d He stated that the only explanation given for the use of the term \u201cRoyalty\u201d was that it was used to describe the discount given, based on the quality of the adhesive ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The phrasing of the sample invoice is obscure. The defendant uses the term \u201cRoyalty\u201d which \u201ccommonly imports payment for permissive or lawful use of a property right.\u201d <em>Raytheon Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Radio Corp. of America, </em>286 Mass. 84, 94. He also refers to himself as the \u201cseller\u201d and alludes to \u201cprices\u201d and \u201cdiscount,\u201d expressions ordinarily associated with the terms of a sale rather than of a lease. See <em>Cousbelis </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>315 Mass. 729, 731; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>209 Mass. 501, 508; <em>Napier </em>v. <em>John V. Farwell Co. </em>60 Colo. 319. We think that there was no error in the finding of the auditor that the invoice was a billing of goods by way of sale and in his conclusion that the transactions evidenced by the invoices were sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
