L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 255, \u00a7 13A, as appearing in St. 1939, c. 509, \u00a7 1. The controversy is between the conditional vendor, hereinafter called the plaintiff, and a subsequent mortgagee, hereinafter called the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">The facts are these. On April 9, 1952, the plaintiff sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>to the A &amp; J Transportation Co., Inc., two tracks under a conditional sale agreement whereby the plaintiff retaihed title to the trucks until the balance of the purchase price was paid in full. The unpaid balance at the time of the sale was $20,232 and was to be paid in thirty-six monthly instalments of $562. On September 18, 1952, the A &amp; J Transportation Co., Inc., gave to the defendant a chattel mortgage which included the two trucks in question. The mortgage was duly recorded. At the time of the hearing below the A &amp; J Transportation Co., Inc., owed the plain-. tiff $19,670 together with interest and an attorney\u2019s fee. Being of opinion that the conditional sale agreement was invalid because it did not comply with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 255, \u00a7 13A, the judge held that the plaintiff lost his security title in the trucks and that the defendant\u2019s mortgage was good. From a decree, entered accordingly the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Section 13A provides that no instrument evidencing a conditional sale of personal property, with an exception not material, shall be valid unless it contains a provision that in case of repossession and sale all sums paid on account of the price and any sum remaining from the proceeds of the sale after deducting <em>\u201cthe reasonable expenses of such repossession and sale\u201d </em>shall be applied in reduction of the price (emphasis supplied). If such a provision is not included in the agreement the conditional vendor loses his security title. <em>Lehan </em>v. <em>North Main Street Garage, Inc. </em>312 Mass. 547. <em>Mogul </em>v. <em>Boston Acceptance Co. Inc. </em>328 Mass. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The pertinent provision of the agreement in question reads: \u201cFrom proceeds of any such sale, seller shall deduct all reasonable expenses for retaking, <em>repairing </em>and selling such property <em>including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. </em>The balance thereof shall be applied to amount due; any surplus shall be paid over to purchaser\u201d (emphasis supplied). It will be noted that the italicized words are not found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u00a7 13A. The language of that section is \u201creasonable expenses of such repossession and sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">We are of opinion that the judge rightly held the security invalid. The case is governed by our recent decision in <em>Mogul </em>v. <em>Boston Acceptance Co. Inc. </em>328 Mass. 424. There the conditional sale agreement contained a clause under which the conditional vendor could deduct \u201call expenses for retaking, <em>repairing </em>and selling said property\u201d (emphasis supplied). It was held that this clause by reason of the word \u201crepairing\u201d was not the equivalent of the provision required by the statute and rendered the agreement invalid to the extent that the conditional vendor lost his security. Th\u00e9 only difference in that respect between the contract there and the one in question is that the latter uses the words \u201creasonable expenses for . . . repairing.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the word \u201creasonable\u201d saves the agreement. We do not agree. In the <em>Mogul </em>case, to be sure, we intimated that there might be instances where slight repairs might be reasonable in order to effect a sale, but we also observed that under the wording of the contract there involved the conditional vendor \u201cwould be under a constant temptation to make greater or different repairs than necessary to effect a sale, all at the expense of the conditional vendee\u201d (pages 425-426). We are not satisfied that, as the plaintiff contends, the present agreement authorizes deductions only for repairs which are reasonably necessary to repossess or sell the property. It is susceptible of a broader construction. And, as we said in the <em>Mogul </em>case, \u201cAt the very least, without attempting to determine just how the words of the contract would be construed, the variation from the words of the statute introduces doubt where the Legislature intended clarity and would enable excessive claims to be made by the vendor against the vendee which could not plausibly be made under the words of the statute. It is difficult to think of a reason for making such departures from the statutory wording unless the vendor hopes thereby to gain wider freedom of action than the statutory wording would allow him\u201d (page 426).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The defendant does not argue that the agreement also offended against \u00a7 13A because it authorized <em>\u201ca </em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to be deducted from the proceeds of the sale. Belying on an incidental remark in <em>Morris Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Totoni, </em>324 Mass. 182, the plaintiff argues that this provision is valid. Since, as we hold, the agreement violates \u00a7 13A apart from this provision we need not determine its validity. It may not be inappropriate to point out that an examination of the original papers in the <em>Gordon </em>case discloses that the question whether the conditional sale agreement there satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 13A was not in issue. Hence the statement that it did was dictum. In so far as that statement can be construed as sanctioning deductions in excess of those permitted by the statute it must be disregarded. We are not to be understood, however, as intimating that in collecting a deficiency properly established after making the deductions sanctioned by \u00a7 13A a conditional vendor may not recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee if the contract so provides. In the <em>Gordon </em>case we held that he could. It ought to be apparent now from our decision in the <em>Mogul </em>case and from what we decide here that the legislative policy, of which \u00a7 13A is a manifestation, of protecting conditional vendees against imposition by conditional vendors is not to be \u201cweakened or chipped away by a series of small encroachments\u201d (328 Mass. 424, 426). The permissible deductions are set forth in the statute in plain and simple language. Amplification of it in the agreement is not only unnecessary but extremely hazardous.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b372-7\">Counihan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhL\">I am unable to concur with the opinion in this case. I believe that the judge was in error in holding the security afforded by the conditional sale contract invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The opinion is grounded upon the cases of <em>Lehan </em>v. <em>North Main Street Garage, Inc. </em>312 Mass. 547, and <em>Mogul </em>v. <em>Boston Acceptance Co. Inc. </em>328 Mass. 424, with both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>which I am in accord but neither of which to my mind is controlling. In the <em>Lehan </em>case the security was held invalid by failure to include in the conditional sale contract the pertinent or similar words of c. 255, \u00a7 13A, relating to the deduction of \u201cthe reasonable expenses of such repossession and sale,\u201d and in the <em>Mogul </em>case the same result was arrived at because no limitation of any kind was imposed upon the \u201cexpenses for retaking, repairing and selling said property,\u201d which was the language used in the conditional sale contract there under consideration. In the case at bar the situation is entirely different for a limitation is imposed by the use of the words \u201creasonable expenses for retaking, repairing and selling such property including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d I think that the use of the word \u201creasonable\u201d in the conditional sale contract here saves it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The <em>Mogul </em>case says explicitly at page 425 that \u201cThe deduction of <em>\u2018all </em>expenses for retaking, repairing and selling\u2019 is not the same as the deduction of 'the <em>reasonable </em>expenses of such repossession and sale\u2019\u201d as required by the statute. And most significantly it says, \u201cUnder the statutory wording it is plain that the expenses of repairs <em>can </em>be deducted only if they constitute part of the <em>reasonable </em>expenses of repossession and sale\u201d (emphasis supplied). That language is unmistakably clear and capable of no misinterpretation. It follows therefore that, if expenses for reasonable repairs may be legally deducted in the absence of any language referring to such repairs in the conditional sale contract, the inclusion of the word \u201crepairing\u201d in it as describing the nature of such \u201creasonable expenses of such repossession and sale\u201d is not inconsistent with the statute and does not render the contract invalid. The use of the word \u201creasonable\u201d definitely precludes the suggestion in the <em>Mogul </em>case that an argument might be made that, if all expenses of repairs may be deducted, expenses could be allowed \u201cwhether or not reasonably necessary'in order to effect a sale.\u201d No such contention can be made under the contract here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>And yet of even more significance is the language of the <em>Mogul </em>case where it was said at page 426, \u201cWe do not go so far as to say that there can be no change in the statutory words, but we do say that if different words are used they must be equally effective in every respect with those of the statute to accomplish the exact statutory purpose.\u201d And further the conditional sale agreement is held to be valid \u201cwhere the statutory language was adopted in its entirety without change and other words were added not inconsistent with the statutory language.\u201d This is the situation here as I see it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The use of the word \u201crepairing\u201d is merely descriptive of the kind of expenses which are deductible as part of \u201cthe reasonable expenses of such repossession and sale\u201d and does no violence to the statute. The words used in this contract are equally effective in every respect with those of the statute to accomplish the desired statutory purpose. The vendor gains no \u201cwider freedom of action than the statutory wording would allow him\u201d and the statute is not \u201cweakened or chipped away by a series of small encroachments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The opinion seems to cast doubt on the provision in this conditional sale agreement allowing the vendor to deduct from the receipts of the sale \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d in connection with the \u201creasonable expenses of such repossession and sale\u201d and implies that a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee may be allowed a vendor only for collecting a deficiency properly established under \u00a7 13A. I am unable to agree with this conclusion. I think it no violation of \u00a7 13A to include a provision for the allowance of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee if the vendor finds it necessary to consult an attorney to be certain that he is taking proper legal steps to repossess and sell the property covered by the conditional sale agreement. Indeed I think the advice of counsel will usually be required to determine just what expenses for repairs are allowable as part of \u201cthe reasonable expenses of such repossession and sale\u201d as set forth in the <em>Mogul </em>case. I think that the limitation imposed upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>amount of such fee by the use of the word \u201creasonable\u201d saves this provision also.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">I agree and sympathize with the thought behind the opinion that it was the intent of the Legislature to curb plans of rapacious money lenders to take advantage of borrowers but, as I have said, I believe that purpose is accomplished by the inclusion of the word \u201creasonable\u201d in so far as it applies to expenses for retaking, repairing, and selling. Conditional sale agreements serve a useful purpose in the modern business world and permit the expansion of business by the use of credit obtained in this manner which otherwise could not be had. Reputable business men, banking and other financial institutions ought not to be discouraged from advancing money on such agreements if the rights of borrowers are protected to the extent provided in the agreement in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">To hold this conditional sale agreement invalid would be to give the holder of the chattel mortgage a most unfair and inequitable advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">I believe that the decree ought to be reversed with costs and a new decree be entered granting the plaintiff the relief prayed for. In view of the conclusions I arrive at the demurrer of the defendant mortgagee was properly overruled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\"> The defendant appealed from an interlocutory _ decree overruling his demurrer, but this was waived at the arguments in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
