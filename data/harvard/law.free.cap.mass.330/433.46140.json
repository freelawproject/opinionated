L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 39, as amended by St. 1933, c. 254, \u00a7 36, and St. 1939, c. 451, \u00a7 22,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> certified to the assessors the valuations at which the machinery, poles, wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes of American Telephone and Telegraph Company, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, and Western Union Telegraph Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> located in Springfield should be assessed as of January 1, 1952. The assessors, deeming themselves aggrieved on the ground that the commissioner\u2019s valuations were too low, appealed to the Appellate Tax Board under the provisions of \u00a7 39. That board held a hearing which began on December 3, 1952, and later, on December 17, 1952, rendered a majority decision in which it more than doubled the valuations certified by the commissioner to the assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">At the beginning of the hearing before the board, on December 3, 1952, the commissioner moved that the assessors\u2019 appeal to the board be dismissed as moot. The motion ought to have been granted for the reason that any assessment made after December 1 upon any valuation by the board would necessarily be made too late to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the taxpayers to apply to the commissioner for an abatement under \u00a7 73, which requires application \u201con or before December first of the year to which the tax relates.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This same point was decided in <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Springfield, </em>329 Mass. 419, where on page 422 we said, \u201cViewing the pertinent statutory provisions as a whole, it is clear that the Legislature intended the decision of the Appellate Tax Board to be \u2018final and conclusive, except as provided in section seventy-three, relative to abatements.\u2019 As between the commissioner and the Appellate Tax Board, the commissioner under \u00a7 73 has the later function to perform. He has the duty to make an abatement if he finds a company taxed \u2018at more than its just proportion,\u2019 or upon an assessment of property \u2018in excess of its fair cash value.\u2019 Where the Appellate Tax Board defers its decision until after December first, the later function of the commissioner on abatements would become a dead letter. It seems plain to us that the Legislature never meant that to happen.\u201d In <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., ante, </em>198, at page 200, in referring to the previous decision from which we have just quoted, we said that the proceeding before the board \u201cwas ordered dismissed as moot for the reason that any decision of the board would then necessarily come so late that the company would lose the right of appeal to the commissioner secured to it by \u00a7 73, which it must exercise not later than December 1, 1950.\u201d These statements are equally applicable to the year 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We note the assessors\u2019 argument in their brief now before us to the effect that it is \u201csenseless\u201d to allow the assessors to appeal to the Appellate Tax Board from the commissioner\u2019s certification and then to allow the taxpaying company, after decision by the board, to apply for an abatement to the same commissioner, and that therefore the right of the taxpaying company to an abatement under \u00a7 73 must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>exist only where the assessors have not appealed to the Appellate Tax Board, and that where the assessors have appealed the remedy of the taxpaying company is by application to the assessors for abatement followed by appeal to the Appellate Tax Board under c. 59, \u00a7 59, as most recently amended by St. 1946, c. 199, \u00a7 1, and c. 59, \u00a7 65, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 621, \u00a7 6. But this contention runs directly contrary to the wording of \u00a7 39 by which it is expressly provided in substance that valuations by the Appellate Tax Board shall be subject to abatement by the commissioner as provided in \u00a7 73. Sections 39 and 73 are companion sections originally enacted together as \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 5 of St. 1915, c. 137, and are still to be read together in spite of the fact that as the result of subsequent revisions they have been placed in different parts of the chapter. It will not do simply to read the sections of c. 59 as they now appear in the General. Laws without regard to their history or to the several purposes intended to be accomplished when they were enacted. The assessors persist in refusing to recognize that the act of 1915 relieved the poles and wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of telephone and telegraph companies from ordinary methods of valuation and assessment and substituted a different method which must now be followed, and that this was done to avoid the difficulties that had arisen from the inconsistent local assessment of fragments of larger systems and to provide necessary consistency and uniformity through the determinations of an officer having State wide jurisdiction. <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., ante, </em>198, 201-204. It is at least seriously doubtful whether these companies, which come under the special provisions introduced by the statute of 1915, have any rights under the general provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 65, and at any rate to deny them relief through abatement by the commissioner under \u00a7 73 would restore by means of separate appeals to the Appellate Tax Board as to particular local assessments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the very method of separate valuations of fragments of systems which it was the clear purpose of the act of <em>1915 </em>to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Moreover, if there is any incongruity in giving the commissioner power at the instance of the taxpayer to abate an assessment after a valuation by the Appellate Tax Board on an appeal by the assessors from the commissioner\u2019s certification there would seem to be an equal incongruity in the procedure suggested by the assessors whereby the taxpayer would be remitted for an abatement to the same Appellate Tax Board that would already have fixed the valuation upon the assessors\u2019 appeal on which the taxpayer would have had no opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The decision is reversed. The order denying the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the assessors\u2019 appeal to the Appellate Tax Board is reversed. Instead an order is to be entered granting the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the assessors\u2019 appeal on the ground of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> The amended section is quoted in full, together with the substance of the companion \u00a7 73, at page 199, <em>ante. </em>See now St. 1953, c. 468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\"> It does not appear, however, that any valuation was made as to machinery of Western Union Telegraph Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> The date December 1, which calls for prompt action in cases of this type, first appears in St. 1933, c. 254, \u00a7 44.
