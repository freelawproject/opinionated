L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34, as appearing in St. 1939, c. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The judge made a report of material facts which we summarize as follows: The school committee of Everett submitted to the mayor an itemized estimate of the amounts deemed necessary for the support of the schools for the year 1952, the total of which was $1,841,221. The mayor thereafter transmitted to the city council a recommendation that $1,706,040.41 be appropriated for this purpose, and the council appropriated this amount. The sum so appropriated was less by $135,180.59 than the estimates submitted by the school committee. An additional appropriation of $35,000, however, reduced the amount of this discrepancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to $100,180.59 and a deficiency in that amount was determined by the judge. From a decree ordering the respondent to provide, by borrowing, the amount of this deficiency together with a sum equal to twenty-five per cent thereof, the respondent appealed. The evidence is not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The sole question presented is whether G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34, is controlling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The respondent contends that certain provisions of its special charter (St. 1892, c. 355<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) exempt it from the requirement imposed by \u00a7 34 \u201cannually [to] provide an amount of money sufficient for the support of the public schools as required by this chapter.\u201d The provisions relied upon require in substance that the school committee\u2019s requests for appropriations be passed upon by the mayor, who \u201cshall recommend such appropriations as he shall deem necessary\u201d; that the school committee shall incur no liability in excess of the amount appropriated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>its use by the city council \"Unless thereto required by law\u201d; and that the acts of the school committee involving the expenditure of money shall be passed upon by the mayor in the same manner as acts of the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The petitioners, on the other hand, rely upon the Commonwealth\u2019s long standing policy with respect to the support and maintenance of the public schools, of which G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34, as appearing in St. 1939, c. 294, is the current manifestation. That policy, with the exception of the sanctions for its enforcement, has remained unchanged since 1647.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In broad terms it may be stated as a determination by the Legislature that the maintenance of adequate public schools is of paramount importance. Since the enactment of St. 1826, c. 143, \u00a7 5, each city and town has been required to elect' a school committee to manage the public schools, and to these committees the Legislature has given substantially final authority to decide upon the needs of the school systems in their charge. See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Springfield, </em>241 Mass. 325, 328-330.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This is not the first occasion of an apparent conflict between the duties imposed upon a school committee by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71 and the limitations placed upon municipal expenditures by charter or by the municipal finance act, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 44. See, for example, <em>Watt </em>v. <em>Chelmsford, </em>323 Mass. 697; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>317 Mass. 465; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Pittsfield, </em>316 Mass. 283; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>313 Mass. 641; <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>311 Mass. 679; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>306 Mass. 265; <em>School Committee of Lowell </em>v. <em>Mayor of Lowell, </em>265 Mass. 353; <em>Decatur </em>v. <em>Auditor of Peabody, </em>251 Mass. 82; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Springfield, </em>241 Mass. 325. In each of those cases this court recognized, and where possible enforced, the supremacy of the school committee\u2019s authority in matters pertaining to the management of the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The respondent seeks to differentiate this case from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>just cited on the basis of the authority given to the mayor in \u00a7 49 of its charter to transmit the school committee\u2019s request for appropriations to the city council and to \u201crecommend such appropriations as he shall deem necessary.\u201d The argument in substance is this: In the above mentioned cases the power of the mayor to recommend appropriations was given in general terms comparable to the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 44. Those provisions, admittedly, do not impinge upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34. But here the general provisions are supplemented by' the precise language of \u00a7 49 which is specifically applicable to the school committee\u2019s requests for appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">This argument is not persuasive. The procedure generally prevailing in cities and towns is that the school committee submits its requests for appropriations to some body or official charged with the duty of passing upon the \u2022appropriation of public funds. The school committee has no power to tax or to appropriate or borrow money, and G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34, clearly contemplates that the governmental body which has such power may choose to exercise it in derogation of the requirements of the general law governing schools and school committees. In no other way could a deficiency in the \u201camount necessary . . . for the support of public schools\u201d come about. It is true, as the respondent argues, that \u00a7 49 of the charter applies in terms to the school committee, and that it gives to the mayor the authority to \u201crecommend such appropriations as he shall deem necessary.\u201d The provision upon which the respondent relies, aside from its specific applicability to the school committee, differs in no significant particular from the general grant of a similar authority to the mayor in \u00a7 32 of the charter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor does \u00a7 49 differ materially from G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 44, \u00a7 32, as appearing in St. 1941, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>c 473, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which gives to the mayors of all cities except Boston authority similar to that granted by \u00a7 32 of the charter before us. It is well settled that despite the importance and the broad sweep of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 44, which regulates municipal finance, \u00a7 32 of that chapter does not deprive school committees of the final authority to determine the financial needs of the public schools. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Springfield, </em>241 Mass. 325, 331-332. <em>Decatur </em>v. <em>Auditor of Peabody, </em>251 Mass. 82, 87-89. See <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>306 Mass. 265, 270, 273; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>313 Mass. 641, 649-650. Beyond the point stressed by the respondent, nothing in the city\u2019s charter supports the contention that \u00a7 49 thereof was intended to deprive the public schools of the city of Everett of the protection of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71 or to permit the mayor and city council to ignore the basic standards there set out for the maintenance of public school systems throughout the Commonwealth. The charter itself, in \u00a7\u00a748 and 50, recognizes that the school committee\u2019s powers and duties are those imposed by general law; these, in a sense, are incorporated by reference. We are, accordingly, of opinion that the bare reiteration in \u00a7 49 of the respondent\u2019s charter of a power probably contained in \u00a7 32 thereof does not have the effect of cutting down the traditional and well established power of the school committee. We hold, therefore, that the provisions of \u00a7 49 of the respondent\u2019s charter do not preclude the petitioners from invoking the remedy afforded by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We recognize, as the respondent points out, that statutory limitations may be, and have been, imposed upon the powers or duties of a school committee. <em>School Committee of Gloucester </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>324 Mass. 209, 216. But this court has consistently sought such limitations in express language, <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Springfield, </em>241 Mass. 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>331-332, or has restricted the operation of an implicit limitation so as to avoid interference \u201cin the traditional supremacy of the school committee in the field of education . . . .\u201d <em>School Committee of Gloucester </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>324 Mass. 209, 218, 220. Nor is the reliance of the respondent upon <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>312 Mass. 560, well founded. There a petition under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34, was dismissed because the city charter made special provision for submission of \u201cany measure\u201d passed by the school committee to popular vote. Spec. St. 1916, c. 300, \u00a7 48. That provision, substantially identical with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 43, \u00a7 42, was held to supersede G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 71, \u00a7 34. Compare, however, <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>313 Mass. 641, and <em>Decatur </em>v. <em>Auditor of Peabody, </em>251 Mass. 82. In the respondent\u2019s charter there is no comparable provision whereby the acts of the school committee may be referred to the electorate for approval or disapproval. The power granted to the mayor in \u00a7 49 of the respondent\u2019s charter is not, in contradistinction to the provisions in the Peabody charter and in the \u201cplan\u201d charters contained in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 43, a manifestation of the \u201chome rule\u201d policy discussed in the <em>Gorman </em>case. It cannot be said, therefore, that disapproval by the mayor of proposed expenditures for school purposes stands on the same footing as disapproval by a majority of the voters at a popular election.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">No contention is made that the amount of the deficiency determined by the judge was improper, if \u00a7 34 was applicable, and we have considered the case on that footing. The final decree is affirmed with costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> The pertinent provisions of the statute read as follows: \u201cEvery city and town shall annually provide an amount of money sufficient for the support of the public schools as required by this chapter.

[W]hen such an order is made after the annual tax rate has been fixed according to law such sums shall be required by such order to be provided by borrowing in the same manner and for the same period of time as is provided under clause (11) of section seven of chapter forty-four in the case of final judgments, subject to all other applicable provisions of chapter forty-four .... Said court may order .that the sum equal to the deficiency be appropriated and added to the amounts previously appropriated for the school purposes of such city or town in the year in which such deficiency occurs and may order that the amount in excess of the deficiency be held by such city or town as a separate account, to be applied to meet the appropriation for school purposes in the following year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> The provisions in question are \u00a7\u00a7 49-51: \u201cSection 49.
