After having waived a jury, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tried by a judge, found guilty, and sentenced. It does not appear that Mooney has ever been arraigned or tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The case comes here upon the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motion for a \"finding for the defendant,\u201d to the denial of certain of his requests for rulings, and to the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The material evidence may be summarized as follows: The defendant over a period from January 3, 1950, to June 25, 1951, caused to be sent to one \" Jno Mooney, East St. Louis, Illinois,\u201d approximately 347 telegrams with money orders aggregating about $30,121.89. They were sent from an office of the Western Union Telegraph Company, hereinafter called the company, in Hudson at the request of and for the defendant by one Fahey, the manager of that office. Original records of these telegrams and money orders were in evidence. They were all in Fahey\u2019s handwriting and were sent in the name of Paul Adams, an alias used by the defendant. They were all sent as bets on the results of horse races in various parts of the United States and Cuba. The defendant furnished the money to make these bets. The method of making such bets was to write out a telegram accompanied by a money order for the amount bet upon a horse and send it to Mooney.' The following sample is illustrative of the practice, \u201cMr. Kilroy [[name of horse] 40-0-0,\u201d meaning $40 on the horse to win and nothing for finishing second or third. Acknowledgment of receipt of the telegrams and money orders was sent by telegraph by Mooney to the defendant under the name of Paul Adams. The defendant under the same alias received from Mooney during the same period approximately 77 telegraphic money orders for about $26,796.75 which could have been found to be winnings. These were all indorsed by the defendant and in most instances were cashed by him at the company\u2019s office in Hudson. Questioned by the chief of police of Marlboro the defendant said nothing more than that he knew Mooney was a \u201cbookie\u201d and that he had placed a bet with him once in a while in 1944 and 1945. When arrested on October 9, 1951, the defendant had on his person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>a telegram from Mooney to him quoting odds on the results of football games.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion for a \u201cfinding for the defendant/\u2019 which was denied, and certain requests for rulings of which the following were refused. \u201c2. Upon all evidence and the law the defendant is entitled to an acquittal. 3. The prosecution on all the evidence has not made out a case of unlawful conspiracy as charged.\u201d \u201c7. The evidence does not support the unlawful object of the alleged conspiracy. 8. The prosecution has not shown by all the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there existed an unlawful conspiracy in which the defendant was involved with another individual.\u201d The motion has no standing as such and we do not consider it for any purpose because the requested rulings which were denied properly raised the question whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a conviction. We are of opinion that at least request numbered '2 should have been granted and that as a result the defendant should have been acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The familiar and classic description of what constitutes criminal conspiracy in this Commonwealth was set forth by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>4 Met. 111, where at page 123 he said, \u201ca conspiracy must be a combination of two or more persons, by some concerted action, to accomplish some criminal or unlawful purpose, or to accomplish some purpose, not in itself criminal or unlawful, by criminal or unlawful means. We use the terms criminal or unlawful, because it is manifest that many acts are unlawful, which are not punishable. by indictment or other public prosecution; and yet there is no doubt, we think, that a combination by numbers to do them would be an unlawful conspiracy, and punishable by indictment. \u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>.122 Mass. 43, 57. This general principle was affirmed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>243 Mass. 472, where at page 485 it was said, \u201cIt is the consensus of opinion that conspiracy as a criminal offence is established when the object of the combination is either a crime, or if not a crime, is unlawful, or when the means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>contemplated are either criminal, or if not criminal, are illegal, provided that, where no crime is contemplated either as the end or the means, the illegal but non-criminal element involves prejudice to the general welfare or oppression of the individual of sufficient gravity to be injurious to the public interest.\u201d From these descriptions of elements necessary to establish the crime of conspiracy it follows that a conspiracy, agreement, or combination to do an act which is not criminal or unlawful as prejudicial to the general welfare, by means which are not criminal or unlawful, is not an indictable offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">At the outset of our consideration of this case we must examine the indictment itself- and the position taken by the Commonwealth in connection with it. The Commonwealth in its brief and at the oral argument contended that the conspiracy of which the defendant was found guilty was one to violate G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 271, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">No violation of that part of \u00a7 17 emphasized in the margin is alleged in the indictment, and nowhere in the evidence can be found any suggestion that either the defendant or Mooney did anything violative of that part of \u00a7 17. We do not therefore consider it as relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The indictment significantly does not allege a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 17 as such but merely alleges a conspiracy between the defendant and Mooney \u201cto commit . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>crime of registering bets\u201d upon horse races. But registering bets as such is not made a crime by \u00a7 17. \"\\Vhat is criminal is the keeping of a building or room, or occupying or being found in any place, with apparatus, books or device for registering bets, and the registering of bets by such keeper, occupant, person found or person present in such a place. Despite the provisions of c. 271, \u00a7 28 (misnomer and variance), c. 277, \u00a7 34 (immaterial defects), and c. 277, \u00a7 40 (bill of particulars), it does not appear to us that any criminal or unlawful act is in substance set forth in the indictment and certainly no evidence of any criminal or unlawful means has been shown. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>4 Met. 111. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>1 Cush. 189. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>7 Cush. 514. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prius, </em>9 Gray, 127, 128. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>16 Gray, 221, 222-223. In passing it may be well to quote from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eastman </em>where at page 226, citing with approval a Pennsylvania case of <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Barr, 60, it was said, \u201cbut if the object of the conspiracy be to do an act which is an offence merely by statute, the intended purpose must in such case be set forth with so much detail, as may be necessary to bring it within the description of the statute offence.\u201d Obviously the indictment in this case did not do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">But assuming that this indictment was in form sufficient to allege a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 17, which we seriously doubt, the evidence at the trial falls short of sustaining a conviction. There was no evidence that either the defendant or Mooney conspired to register bets as a keeper, occupier, person found or present in any place \u201cwith apparatus, books or any device, for registering bets.\u201d \u201cRegistering bets\u201d as such has been defined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clancy, </em>154 Mass. 128, 133-134, and in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Vorenberg, </em>241 Mass. 319, 321. In both of these cases bets were placed, in a room where apparatus, books or other devices were present for that purpose, by a bettor who received a written memorandum by the person taking or \u201cregistering\u201d the bet. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferry, </em>146 Mass. 203, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>207-208. In the present case it is equally consistent from the evidence to infer that the defendant was merely placing bets for himself with Mooney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>154 Mass. 135, 139-140. We do not pause to consider whether such conduct constitutes a crime, for that is not the charge upon which he was indicted. It may be well to note, however, that the only statutes referring to the placing of bets which have been brought to our attention have no applicability. See c. 271, \u00a7 1 (penalty for winning money by gambling); \u00a7 2 (gaming at cards, dice or other game in a public conveyance or public place, and so forth); \u00a7 6 (gaming at cattle shows, and so forth); and \u00a7 42 (betting on a boxing match).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Because of what we have said we do not consider the exceptions relating to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-14\"> \u201cThe Jurors, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on their oath present, That Philias J.
