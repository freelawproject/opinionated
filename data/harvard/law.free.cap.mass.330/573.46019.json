MacFarlane,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who contracted a case of silicosis arising out of and in the course of his employment and, in consequence thereof, died on January 11, 1951. The self insurer contends that the claimant\u2019s right is barred because during the life of her husband she participated with him in signing a lump sum agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The reviewing board adopted the decision of the single member, which so far as material is: \u201cThe employee under date of October 15, 1950, resolved his rights to incapacity compensation by an agreement to redeem liability by the payment of a lump sum of $6,584.62, making [with] weekly payments theretofore received by him a total of $8,391.77. It is the contention of the self insurer that any claim of the widow for dependency compensation was concluded by the agreement of the deceased when he settled his rights to incapacity compensation. This attitude of the self insurer may be because the now widow signed with the employee in connection with said settlement, and, as administratrix of his estate, cashed the settlement check. I rule that the self insurer\u2019s position is not well taken, that the \"widow had no rights which she could sign away in connection with her husband\u2019s settlement of his rights, and that his settlement of his claim could not defeat any rights of the claimant widow. <em>(Cripps\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 586; <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8; and <em>Cherbury\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 397.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The self insurer does not take the position that the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ployee\u2019s settlement of his claim is a bar to the widow, but argues that what she did herself with respect to that settlement does constitute a bar. See <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lux Clock Co. 120 </em>Conn. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The reviewing board did not undertake to find all the facts upon which the self insurer\u2019s defence is based. At the hearing before the single member the agreement, dated October 15, 1950, for redeeming liability by payment of a lump sum, approved by the board on November 20, 1950, was made part of the record by agreement. This was signed by the employee and by the claimant upon a form apparently provided by the department of industrial accidents. It reads: \u201cReceived of Glenwood Range Co. the lump sum of 6584 dollars and 62 cents ($6584.62), making, with weekly payments already received by me, the total sum of 8391 dollars and 77 cents ($8391.77). Said payments are received in redemption of the liability for all weekly payments now or in the future due me under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, for all injuries received by me on or about the 15th day of December 1948, or any other date, while in the employ of the above named employer, subject to the approval of the Department of Industrial Accidents. This includes all medical and legal expenses. [Signed] Oscar W. MacFarlane Employee or Dependent [Signed] Alice MacFarlane wife 29 N. Precinct Street Street and number East Taunton City or Town [Signed] Glenwood Range Company Insurer By James C. Gahan, Jr.\u201d The agreement was witnessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Also in the record is a check on a Boston bank dated January 2, 1951, for $5,609.62 payable to Oscar W. MacFarlane, signed \u201cBrown, Field <em>&amp; </em>McCarthy Settlement Account for Glenwood-Lloyd Claims by James C. Gahan Jr.\u201d The indorsement is \u201cAlice MacFarlane administratrix of the estate of Oscar W. MacFarlane deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The three cases cited by the reviewing board do not sustain its ruling that the widow had no rights she could sign away. The only case of the three to which we need refer is <em>Cripps\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 586, which held that a release solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>by the employee did not bar the widow\u2019s claim arising after his death. At page 589, it was said, \u201cThe right of recovery expressly given to his widow cannot accrue until his death. Having been created for her benefit, it is independent of his control, and under \u00a7 22<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> can be discharged only by herself where she is the sole dependent, or by those authorized to act in her behalf.\u201d Compare <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co. </em>219 Mass. 420, 422-423. In <em>Brophy\u2019s Case, </em>327 Mass. 557, 561, there appears the following pertinent language: \u201cWhile it is true that the right of a dependent does not arise until after the death of the employee, it is also true that the right of the dependent to payment originates in the injury and particularly depends upon the date of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">At the time of the lump sum agreement the wife had a right contingent upon her surviving the employee. There is nothing in the workmen\u2019s compensation act which takes this unmatured right out of the general rule that a right which has not yet arisen may be released or made the subject of a contract not to sue. <em>Radovsky </em>v. <em>Wexler, </em>273 Mass. 254, 257. <em>Continental Corp. </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>283 Mass. 204, 215-216. <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>J. C. Pitman &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>324 Mass. 371, 375. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 402, comment (b). Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 900. Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 1823.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Whether the claimant in fact did contract to give up her claim, as the self insurer contends, is another matter. Findings as to the circumstances of the claimant\u2019s signing the lump sum agreement are lacking. The reason for the wife\u2019s signature on the agreement is not at all clear from an inspection of the writing alone. On this record, we are in no position to say that it is surplusage and of no legal effect, as she contends. The erroneous ruling of the reviewing board deprived the self insurer of findings upon the subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of its defence. We cannot make those findings. <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 581, 585. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 735. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, ante, </em>1, 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The decree of the Superior Court is reversed, and a decree is to be entered remanding the case to the Industrial Accident Board for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> There was also an order for the payment of $250 into the special fund in the custody of the State Treasurer.
