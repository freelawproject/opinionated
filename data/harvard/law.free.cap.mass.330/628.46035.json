J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYo\">This is a bill in equity brought in the Superior Court by an owner of land in Attleboro by way of \"appeal\u201d from a decision of the board of appeal. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40, \u00a7 30, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 269, \u00a7 1, and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>amended by St. 1935, c. 388, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, by St. 1941, c. 198, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, by St. 1945, c. 167, and by St. 1951, c. 205. The board upheld the inspector of buildings in his refusal of a building permit to the plaintiff and declined to grant either a \u201cspecial exception\u201d or a variance. The Superior Court declined to annul or to modify the decision of the board. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The zoning ordinance of Attleboro took effect on February 10, 1942. Section 12 of the ordinance, in so far as need be stated for the purposes of this case, read, \u201cIn single residence districts . . . there shall be provided for each dwelling house . . . hereafter constructed, altered or placed, a lot containing not less than . . . twelve thousand square feet . . . and hereafter no dwelling house . . . shall be erected or placed on a lot containing less than such minimum area; but nothing contained in this section shall prevent the erection or placing of any building on any lot . . . containing a smaller area, provided such lot on the effective date hereof does not adjoin other land of the same owner available for use in connection with said lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\u201cNo lot on which a dwelling house . . . is situated, whether heretofore or hereafter placed, shall be reduced in area if such lot is smaller than is hereby prescribed, or if by such reduction it would be made smaller than is hereby prescribed . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">There were also provisions for \u201cspecial exceptions\u201d in certain circumstances which need not be set forth in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">At the time when the ordinance took effect the plaintiff was the owner of a tract of land on the northerly side of Payson Street in an area which was restricted by the ordinance to single dwellings to be located on lots not smaller than 12,000 square feet. The plaintiff\u2019s tract contained 12,793 square feet. It was composed of two so called lots shown as lots 11 and 12 on \u201cNew Plat #49 on file at the Assessors\u2019 Office.\u201d Each \u201clot\u201d contained slightly more than 6,000 square feet. The plaintiff had acquired these \u201clots\u201d at different times from different sources. There was a dwelling house and garage on \u201clot 11.\u201d There was only a garage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>on \u201clot 12.\u201d In 1944 the plaintiff sold \u201clot 11\u201d with the buildings thereon to one Morris. The plaintiff now desires to build another dwelling house on \u201clot 12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">It is plain that any house now built by the plaintiff on \u201clot 12\u201d would not be provided with a lot containing not less than 12,000 square feet as required by the ordinance for any dwelling house thereafter erected. But the plaintiff argues that he should have the benefit of the exception in \u00a7 12 of the ordinance that the section shall not prevent the erection of any building on any lot containing a smaller area if such lot on the effective date of the ordinance did not adjoin other land of the same owner available for use \u201cin connection with said lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The difficulty with this argument is, we think, .that on the effective date of the ordinance the plaintiff\u2019s lot did not contain a smaller area than 12,000 square feet. His lot was then composed of the two \u201clots\u201d shown on the assessors\u2019 plan, contained slightly more than 12,000 square feet and had one house upon it. There is nothing to show that any part of this tract had been physically walled off or separated in any way from any other part, if that would make a difference, which we do not decide. The plaintiff\u2019s argument would require us to construe the word lot as used in the exception in \u00a7 12 as referring to a lot which corresponded with some \u201clot\u201d shown on a plan in the assessors\u2019 office rather than to the lot as it actually existed upon the surface of the earth. We find nothing in this record to suggest that lots under the ordinance were to be determined by assessors\u2019 plans or assessments or according to sources of title. It would seem to us that an attempt to do this might lead to confusion in the enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The idea behind the exception in \u00a7 12 of the ordinance, even if obscurely expressed, seems to us to have been to save a person who at the time when the ordinance took effect had a vacant tract of a total area less than 12,000 square feet from the hardship of not being able to use it at all for residence purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The result is that when the ordinance took effect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s land, like other land in the zone not within the exception, became subject to the restriction that he could not build a new dwelling upon it without providing a 12,000 foot lot for the new dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">There is nothing in the record to show that the plaintiff comes within the class of those who may be allowed <em>\u201c </em>special exceptions\u201d under \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It was for the board to decide whether a variance ought to be granted.. No error appears in its refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
