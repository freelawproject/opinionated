Rice, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 and breach of peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a)(1). He claims that (1) the state presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and (2) the court violated his right to confrontation by improperly limiting his cross-examination of a state's witness. We disagree, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as reasonably could have been found by the jury, and procedural history are relevant. On January 3, 2013, at approximately 11 p.m., Gina Phillips-Jackson was waiting for a train at Union Station in New Haven with her\n   husband. She left her belongings with her husband and walked to the women's restroom. As she approached the restroom, she passed by the defendant, who was drinking from a nearby water fountain. The women's restroom contained several stalls, including a stall in the back for disabled persons. Phillips-Jackson initially proceeded to the stall in the back, but changed her mind. Turning around to exit the stall, she saw the defendant standing approximately two to three feet away from her. Phillips-Jackson informed the defendant that he was inside the women's restroom. The defendant responded, in a calm, quiet voice with a flat affect, \"Come here,\" and he made a corresponding\n   hand gesture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant then repeated the phrase to her more than once. Phillips-Jackson testified that in that moment she felt \"nervous\" and looked to the front entrance to the restroom for a way to \"get out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Without her consent, the defendant \"grabbed\" Phillips-Jackson's right hand, though not in a forceful manner, for approximately a second. Immediately she said \"get off me\"; then recoiled and \"sprung around him.\" In doing so, she lost her balance and fell on her back. The defendant continued to stand near Phillips-Jackson and repeated the phrase \"come here.\" At one point the defendant tried to quiet Phillips-Jackson by saying, \"Shhh.\" Phillips-Jackson was in pain, and, screaming loudly, she began to crawl toward the exit using her elbows. Her screams prompted a security guard to come to her assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-95, and breach of peace in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a)(1). The court imposed a total effective sentence of five years incarceration. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for unlawful restraint. Specifically, he claims there was insufficient evidence as to the elements of (a) specific intent and (b) actual restraint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test.

The defendant testified that after having a cigarette outside on the platform, he picked up two of his bags, but forgot the third. He testified that he noticed the third bag was missing after he stopped at a drinking fountain near the women's restroom. He thought that Phillips-Jackson had taken his bag. He testified that, acting on that belief, he followed her into the restroom \"[b]ecause somebody grabbed my bag and I've been robbed before. The first thing that came into my head, somebody got my bag and I want justice.... I want to find out ... who got my bag.\" He further testified that he did not want the person who took his bag \"to get away,\" but, rather, he wanted that person arrested. He testified that \"[i]f anybody was running or trying to leave.... I wanted justice, I didn't want them to run, I wanted a cop to be around.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jury additionally could have inferred from the defendant's conduct that he intended to cause the confinement of Phillips-Jackson. There was evidence that he briefly held Phillips-Jackson, that he blocked her\n   egress from the restroom, and that he discouraged her from calling for help; this activity, moreover, occurred in a confined place out of public view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant's reportedly mistaken assumption that Phillips-Jackson had stolen his bag, coupled with his intention to locate the person who had stolen the bag and his desire not to let that person \"get away,\" combined with actions consistent with an intent to restrain, demonstrated his intention to prevent Phillips-Jackson's liberation. The jury reasonably could have determined that he intentionally prevented Phillips-Jackson from exiting the restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant also argues that his only intention when he entered the restroom was to find his missing bag. Because of a speech impediment and an episode of diabetic shock, he claims that he had difficulty explaining his intent to Phillips-Jackson. Even if the jury credited his testimony regarding the speech impediment and diabetic shock, the jury nonetheless reasonably could have concluded that the defendant intended to prevent Phillips-Jackson's liberation, as these concepts are not inconsistent. He further contends that Phillips-Jackson never testified that she believed his intent was to restrain her from exiting the restroom and that holding Phillips-Jackson's hand for a moment is not inconsistent with an intent to find his missing bag. That Phillips-Jackson perhaps may have been unaware of the defendant's intent is immaterial; the defendant testified quite clearly as to his intent and the jury was free to credit that testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v. Goriss,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754691\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/108/264/#p269\">\n    108 Conn.App. 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20A.2d%201041\">\n    947 A.2d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting jury's right to accept some, none or all of evidence presented), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964815,3964140,3964895\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/904/\">\n    289 Conn. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20A.2d%20873\">\n    957 A.2d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant contends that it was unreasonable for the jury to conclude that his brief grasping of Phillips-Jackson's hand satisfied the element of actual restraint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the context of this case, we\n   need not decide whether a brief grasp is sufficient to constitute \"restraint.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the encounter, the defendant briefly grasped Phillips-Jackson's hand, but there was also more evidence that the jury could have considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Phillips-Jackson testified that when she turned around to leave the stall in the back of the restroom, the defendant was standing between her and the exit. She further testified that she informed the defendant that he was in the incorrect restroom. Instead of leaving upon being informed that he was in the women's restroom, the defendant stood between Phillips-Jackson and the exit and instructed her three times to \"come here.\" During this encounter, the defendant was standing two to three feet from her, an arm's distance away. The jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant effectively was blocking Phillips-Jackson\n   from exiting the restroom, thereby constraining her liberty of movement. Once Phillips-Jackson fell backwards and began screaming, the defendant's response was to whisper, \"Shhhh.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition to the defendant's actions, there was evidence of the requisite intent, as set forth in part IA of this opinion. The duration of the confinement at issue is not in itself determinative of whether an unlawful restraint has occurred. Rather, the question is whether an actual restraint or confinement was accomplished with the requisite intent to prevent liberation. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Winot,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768355\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/753/#p768\">\n    294 Conn. at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20A.2d%20188\">\n    988 A.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (using definition of restraint under \u00a7 53a-91 [1] in the context of kidnapping). Evidence of the defendant's actions, coupled with evidence of intent to restrain, satisfies the element of \"restraint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court violated his right to confrontation by limiting his cross-examination of a state's witness. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant argues that the court improperly limited his cross-examination of Phillips-Jackson regarding a conversation she had with police concerning the charges brought against the defendant. Phillips-Jackson testified on cross-examination that she returned to Union Station shortly after the incident and, after inquiring, discovered what crimes the defendant had been charged with committing. Defense counsel further inquired, \"[W]hen you went down there did you inquire as to what the charges were that were lodged against [the defendant]?\" The state objected and the court sustained the objection on the basis that it was \"not relevant to what this jury has to decide.\" After defense counsel asked to make a record, the court excused the jury. Defense counsel proceeded with\n   his offer of proof\n   by asking Phillips-Jackson what charges the police officer had told her had been brought against the defendant. She said she had been told \"breach of peace.\" Defense counsel asked, \"Did you indicate to him that you didn't believe those are the appropriate charges? Did you ask them to charge him with assault or anything like that?\" Phillips-Jackson responded, \"No, sir.\" Defense counsel argued that Phillips-Jackson's interest in the prosecution of the defendant and dissatisfaction with the minor nature of the charges were relevant to motive and bias and were appropriate subjects of cross-examination. The court sustained the state's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[T]he sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him.... The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination ... and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying.... Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted ... The constitutional standard is met when defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"However, [t]he [c]onfrontation [c]lause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.... We have emphasized in numerous decisions ... that the confrontation clause does not give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination.... [For example, a] defendant may elicit only relevant evidence through cross-examination.... The court determines whether the evidence sought on cross-examination is relevant by determining whether that\n   evidence renders the existence of [other facts] either certain or more probable.... The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the [trial] court's ruling....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless a proper foundation is established, the evidence is irrelevant.... Relevance may be established in one of three ways. First, the proffering party can make an offer of proof.... Second, the record can itself be adequate to establish the relevance of the proffered testimony.... Third, the proffering party can establish a proper foundation for the testimony by stating a good faith belief that there is an adequate factual basis for his or her inquiry.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

He contends that Phillips-Jackson's return to Union Station days after the incident to learn of the charges brought against the defendant shows bias, in that the witness, rather than being objectively disinterested, wished to see the defendant punished rather severely. Further inquiry would have revealed, according to the defendant, that Phillips-Jackson was dissatisfied with the misdemeanor charges that originally were brought against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Phillips-Jackson did testify on cross-examination in the presence of the jury and\n   without objection that she returned to Union Station after the incident to find out what charges had been brought against the defendant. The defendant, however, was not permitted to question\n   Phillips-Jackson regarding her satisfaction with the charges initially brought. The defendant's argument that the court improperly limited cross-examination into Phillips-Jackson's dissatisfaction with the charges initially brought\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   against the defendant is negated by the fact that Phillips-Jackson did not testify during the offer of proof that she was, in fact, dissatisfied. Rather, during the proffer no facts were elicited that were probative of motive or bias. She testified in the course of the offer of proof that she did not indicate to officers at Union Station that she was dissatisfied with the charges initially brought and that she did not ask the officers to charge the defendant with assault or a similar felony. Accordingly, the defendant's right to confrontation was not violated and the court acted within its discretion in limiting this line of questioning. The questions themselves, of course, were not evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.
