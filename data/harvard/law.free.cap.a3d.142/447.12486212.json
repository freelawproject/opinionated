In a single, consolidated trial, a jury found the defendant, Michael Guerrera, guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 (a) and 53a-59 (a)(1), conspiracy to commit the assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-59 (a)(1), and tampering with physical evidence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155 (a)(1). The jury found the defendant not guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree and conspiracy to commit murder. The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to the remaining charges of murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the first degree, felony murder, and kidnapping in the first degree. The defendant moved to dismiss these remaining charges, and the court denied in part and granted in part the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In AC 37171, the defendant claims that the trial court erred by (1) concluding that the state had no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   obligation to review or to disclose the contents of telephone recordings preserved by the Department of Correction (department) at the state's request; (2) excluding from evidence a recording of a coparticipant's jail visit with his mother; (3) refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on a possible violation of a sequestration order; and (4) concluding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the defendant's conviction of tampering with physical evidence. In AC 38312, the defendant claims that the state is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy clause from retrying him on the charges of murder, kidnapping, and felony murder with the predicate felony of kidnapping. In its cross appeal, the state claims that the court\n   improperly dismissed the charge of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the first degree. We do not agree with any of the defendant's claims in either of his appeals, nor do we agree with the state's claim in its cross appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As an initial matter, the underlying factual and procedural histories of these appeals warrant a thorough recitation and review. The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and his brother, Dennis Guerrera, grew up in separate homes, but at some point Dennis Guerrera moved in with the defendant; Naomi Ball, their biological mother; and the defendant's stepfather at their home in Waterbury. Dennis Guerrera had grown up in Bristol, and he eventually introduced the defendant to his friends in the area. These friends included Sarah Boilard and Michael Boilard, as well as Jonathan Wilcox, and Dylan Sherman, the victim. Sarah Boilard had dated both the victim and Dennis Guerrera at different times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The events surrounding the victim's death began on February 21, 2011. That afternoon, Sarah Boilard and Michael Boilard picked up the defendant and Dennis Guerrera from their apartment in Waterbury, went to a Blockbuster store and then brought the brothers to the apartment the Boilards shared with Michael Boilard's children at 56 Ingraham Place in Bristol. At one point during the evening, the victim called Sarah Boilard and asked if he and his cousin, Josh Desrosier, could come over to the Boilard residence. Sarah Boilard and Dennis Guerrera went to meet the victim and Desrosier at Fast Freddies,\n   a Bristol gas station. The four returned to the Boilards' apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sarah Boilard, the victim, and Desrosier went into Sarah Boilard's bedroom while Michael Boilard, the defendant, and Dennis Guerrera watched a movie. At one point during the movie, the defendant went into\n   Sarah Boilard's bedroom to retrieve a pair of Michael Boilard's pants, which contained Michael Boilard's wallet, keys, and cigarettes. The defendant gave Michael Boilard his pants. The victim and Desrosier left the apartment shortly thereafter. The defendant and Dennis Guerrera spent the night at the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following morning, Michael Boilard claimed that he had discovered that $750 in cash was missing from his wallet. When the defendant and Dennis Guerrera woke up, Michael Boilard demanded that they empty their pockets so that he could see whether either of them had the missing money. Both the defendant and Dennis Guerrera refused to let him search their pockets. Michael Boilard approached the defendant and attempted to frisk him. The defendant replied, \"Are you serious? [The victim] was probably the one who stole it, not [me].\" Id. Michael Boilard told the brothers \"to do what they have to do, just get the money back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant, Dennis Guerrera, and Sarah Boilard then spent approximately one hour walking around Bristol in search of the victim. At about noon, Sarah Boilard called Michael Boilard to pick up her, and the defendant and Dennis Guerrera. He brought the three of them back to the Boilards' apartment. Michael Boilard left for work at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. After Michael Boilard left, Sarah Boilard called the victim. She asked him if he had taken the money, and the victim replied that he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the next several hours, the defendant, Dennis Guerrera, and Sarah Boilard went to various stores, watched a movie, listened to music, and ate dinner. They were not looking for the victim at that time, but after dinner Dennis Guerrera told Sarah Boilard that he wanted to try to call the victim again. She refused to let him use her cell phone. The defendant used the cell phone he shared with Dennis Guerrera to call the\n   victim himself. The defendant argued with the victim and threatened to \"kick his ass.\" After five minutes of arguing, the defendant asked the victim to come over to talk about the situation and figure out what had happened to the money. The defendant assured the victim that if he came over, \"there won't be any problems.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While waiting for the victim to arrive, Dennis Guerrera grabbed a wooden baseball bat from the bedroom. He then told Sarah Boilard to \"get out,\" and she went outside of her apartment building and paced around. She was afraid that the defendant and Dennis Guerrera planned to fight the victim. The victim arrived and went into the Boilards' apartment. A neighbor outside of the apartment overheard arguing, glass breaking, and a man's voice screaming from inside the apartment. The neighbor specifically heard a man yell, \"[d]ude, please stop!\" The defendant testified that Dennis Guerrera had struck the victim in the head with the baseball bat numerous times. The defendant claimed that he had been injured from attempting to stop Dennis Guerrera from attacking the victim. The state police later obtained blood from inside the apartment matching the victim's and the defendant's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant, Dennis Guerrera and the victim exited the apartment. The defendant ordered Sarah Boilard to \"clean up the mess.\" When she refused, the defendant called her an \"ungrateful spoiled bitch.\" He also told her that if she talked\n   to the police, and he \"gets put away or locked up, that when he gets out that [Sarah Boilard was] next.\" As Sarah Boilard started to walk away, she overheard the victim say, \"I want to go home, please let me go home, I won't tell anybody.\" When she finally returned to the apartment, Sarah Boilard observed that the wooden baseball bat had been placed back in the bedroom closet and was stained with blood.\n   She also noticed that her brother's aluminum baseball bat was missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, Wilcox received a telephone call from either the defendant or Dennis Guerrera. The caller-Wilcox could not discern which brother had placed the call-stated that they had fought with the victim at the Boilards' apartment and requested that Wilcox pick them up at Fast Freddies. When Wilcox arrived at Fast Freddies, Dennis Guerrera got in the front seat and the defendant and the victim sat in the back of the car. The defendant held an aluminum baseball bat. The victim asked Wilcox to take him to the hospital, but the defendant told him to be quiet. Wilcox suggested that they take the victim to an area referred to as Buttermilk Falls in Terryville, and the defendant and Dennis Guerrera agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon arriving at the trailhead to Buttermilk Falls, Wilcox stopped the car. Dennis Guerrera and the defendant, who was still holding the baseball bat, retreated into the woods with the victim. Several minutes later, the defendant and Dennis Guerrera emerged from the woods without the victim. Getting back into the car, the defendant told Wilcox that he and Dennis Guerrera had used the baseball bat to hit the victim several times and that \"blood was going everywhere....\" The victim began twitching, and the defendant and Dennis Guerrera resumed beating the victim with the baseball bat until the victim stopped moving completely. Wilcox observed that both Dennis Guerrera and the defendant had blood on their hands and clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the morning of February 23, 2011, the victim's body was discovered by a hiker in Buttermilk Falls. A state medical examiner concluded that the victim's death had been caused by blunt traumatic head injury. On February 24, 2011, the police arrested the defendant, Dennis Guerrera, Sarah Boilard, Michael Boilard, and\n   Wilcox for their participation in the various crimes perpetrated against the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant told the police, and later testified consistently with these initial statements, that he had tried to stop Dennis Guerrera from beating the victim at the Boilards' apartment. The defendant claimed that he had helped the victim clean his wounds and assisted him out of the apartment. According to the defendant, he and the victim entered Wilcox's car only because Wilcox threatened them with a shotgun. Once they reached Buttermilk Falls, the defendant alleged that he had stayed in the car with Wilcox while Dennis Guerrera took the victim and the aluminum baseball bat into the woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dennis Guerrera pleaded guilty to assault in the first degree and murder. Following ten days of evidence and one week of deliberations, the jury found the defendant guilty of assault in the first degree as an accessory, conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, and tampering with physical evidence. The jury found the defendant not guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree and conspiracy to commit murder. The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to the charges of murder, felony murder, kidnapping in the first degree, and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the first degree. The court sentenced the defendant to thirty-four years of incarceration and ten years of special parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the four charges on which the jury could not reach a verdict. This motion was granted as to the conspiracy to commit kidnapping charge, but denied as to the three remaining charges. These appeals, as well as the state's cross appeal, followed. Additional facts relevant to each claim will be set forth accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DEFENDANT'S APPEAL IN AC 37171\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant claims that the court erred by concluding that the state had no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligation with respect to unreviewed telephone recordings preserved by the department when the court had found that the department had been acting as the investigative arm of the State's Attorney's Office in preserving the recorded calls. The defendant asks us to direct the state to disclose the recordings to the defense or to review the 1300 recordings ourselves and disclose any exculpatory information. We disagree with the defendant's claim and deny the relief sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additional facts are necessary to resolve this claim. In its memorandum of decision issued on October 10, 2013, the court found the following relevant facts. The department records all inmate telephone calls and any noncontact visits with inmates by members of the public. An inspector from the State's Attorney's Office requested that the department preserve and monitor the telephone calls of Michael Boilard, Sarah Boilard, and Wilcox on approximately March 1, 2011. The State's Attorney's Office had also asked the department to monitor the calls of the defendant and Dennis Guerrera. Donald Lavery, the department telephone monitor assigned to review these calls, testified that he monitored approximately 10 percent of the 1300 recorded calls by using criteria developed by the department that helped identify the calls that were most likely to contain relevant information. When Lavery determined that a specific call that he reviewed related to the criminal case, he took notes and forwarded the information to the State's Attorney's Office. At that point, the office would determine whether it wanted to obtain a copy of the call from the department through the service of\n   a subpoena or by executing a search warrant. Prior to his trial, the defendant caused a subpoena to be served on the department to produce copies of the recorded conversations. The state responded with a motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In granting the state's motion, the court concluded that in this exceptional case, the department had acted as an arm of the state in the investigation of the crimes at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, \"[t]he evidence does establish that some calls ... do involve relevant matters.... These calls are appropriately the subject of the defendant's subpoena.\" The court determined, however, that because the defendant offered no evidence that the unreviewed recordings contained relevant material and seemed to rely solely on \"blind hope that some of them may contain relevant material,\" the subpoena amounted to a \"classic fishing expedition.\" The court ordered the department to provide the defendant with copies of any recorded calls that had been reviewed and that concerned the pending case and the defendant's criminal charges, and any calls for which the department had provided the state with notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the state possessed constructive knowledge of any material the department had preserved, regardless of whether the material actually had been reviewed by the department or the state, because the department had been acting as an investigative arm of the state. The state's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligation, the defendant claims, extended to any exculpatory evidence produced by its investigation, including the recordings. Our review of this issue is plenary. \"Whether the [defendant] was deprived of his due process rights due to a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation is a question of\n   law, to which we grant plenary review.... The conclusions reached by the [trial] court in its decision ... are matters of law, subject to plenary review.... Thus, [w]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct ... and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record....\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

This argument is not responsive to the requirements of the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   analysis. Simply because the state and the department might be deemed to have constructive knowledge of the contents of the recordings\n   does not necessarily indicate that the recordings in fact contained evidence \"favorable to the defense,\" as required by the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant is correct in his argument that the prosecutor is deemed to have constructive knowledge of exculpatory information within his or her files.

He argues that the court's decision to exclude the hearsay statement of Dennis Guerrera was an evidentiary error-or, in the alternative, a constitutional error\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -because the statement was inconsistent with other hearsay statements made by Dennis Guerrera that had been introduced into evidence and its exclusion impeded the defendant's ability to present a defense. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additional facts assist us in our resolution of this claim. During the defendant's trial, the state's witnesses testified as to hearsay statements supposedly made by Dennis Guerrera that arguably implicated the defendant in the assault and murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to this testimony, the defendant sought to introduce a recorded\n   conversation between Dennis Guerrera and Ball. This conversation occurred in prison, after Dennis Guerrera had been convicted and sentenced. The defense proffered-without playing the recording-that it contained a statement made by Dennis Guerrera in which he said, \"I did it, and I copped out, and because I did it, I didn't go to trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state objected to the proposed evidence as hearsay. The court concluded that the statement did not fall within either of the hearsay exceptions cited by the defendant; it was neither a statement against penal interest nor an inconsistent statement. The court explained that \"for someone to say, 'I committed murder,' is not inconsistent with somebody else [doing] it, too....\" At the conclusion of the trial, the defense renewed its argument in a motion for a new trial, which the court subsequently denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We first address the defendant's evidentiary claim. Our standard of review as to this issue is well settled. A trial court's determination as to whether statements are inconsistent is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. \"The admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement ... is a matter within the ... discretion of the trial court.... [T]he trial court's decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done....

The defendant invites us to infer that the statement, \"I did it,\" undermined Dennis Guerrera's other statements of, \"we did it,\" that had been adduced at trial from various witnesses. The court acted within its discretion in rejecting that inference and finding that Dennis Guerrera's admission of responsibility did not foreclose the possibility that someone else, namely, the defendant, had participated in the criminal acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's argument, the court did not apply \"a legal standard that required diametrically opposed statements for inconsistency,\" in contravention of the principles of\n   <em>\n    State v.

This principle squarely applies to the present case.

Dennis Guerrera repeatedly used the pronoun \"we\" when relating to his friends how the crime happened. He used the pronoun \"I\" in the course of the conversation with Ball in explaining his personal decision to plead guilty. These differing contexts further support our conclusion that the statements are not necessarily inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant also argues, \"Dennis Guerrera had a strong incentive to implicate [the defendant] by stating, 'we did it,' to keep [the defendant] from reporting the events,\" and he well may have \"had every reason to be truthful to [Ball] and not to omit mention of [the defendant's] alleged role.\" The reliability of Dennis Guerrera's statement is not at issue, however; rather, the statement's inconsistency with Dennis Guerrera's previous statements concerned the court.

Our Supreme Court has concluded that \"the primary objective of a sequestration order ... is undermined, not only when a prospective witness hears the testimony of a prior witness firsthand, but also through the disingenuous strategy of effectively\n   transmitting a prior witness' testimony to a prospective witness via a third party.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%201\">\n    3 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On November 5, 2013, the second day of evidence at the defendant's trial, the state requested that the court issue a sequestration order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-36 for both parties. The defense consented, and the court issued an order that \"any prospective witness not be present in the courtroom during the testimony of any other witness.\" On November 7, 2013, defense counsel informed the court that Ball had overheard three of the state's witnesses, April Wells, Amanda Wells, and Katlynn Guerrera, discussing the trial with two individuals who had been observing the trial, \"Tina\" and \"Portia.\" Ball claimed to have overheard Tina and Portia tell the witnesses that Sarah Boilard had testified that she and the defendant had dated, and that Wilcox had testified that he observed the defendant with the baseball bat. Defense counsel asked the court to preclude the testimony of April Wells, Amanda Wells and Katlynn Guerrera as a result of the alleged sequestration violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The state notified the court that it had spoken with Tina and Portia. Both denied having the conversation with the witnesses. Moreover, an inspector for the state had spoken to the three witnesses to ensure that they had not spoken to anyone about what occurred in the courtroom. The court did not determine whether the sequestration order had been violated, and it resolved the issue by informing defense counsel that he could cross-examine the three witnesses about the alleged conversation. The defendant rejected this offer, noting that it was unlikely the witnesses would admit to having conversed with Tina and Portia. The defendant moved for a mistrial, but the court responded that defense counsel had not \"presented to me ... any other evidence that, quote, unquote, a lot more has happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   All you've said to me is, those two instances and very limited conversations. And you want me to speculate that a lot more has happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that although the order facially may have been limited to preventing witnesses from being present in the courtroom, the order was intended to prevent witnesses from learning about the testimony of other witnesses. Thus, the defendant claims, the court erred in interpreting its sequestration order. In reaching its decision, the court considered the representations of the state and defense counsel. It acknowledged that \"there's a factual dispute here as to whether in fact anything was said.\" In its discretion, the court concluded that cross-examination would be an appropriate remedy, given that the alleged violations were narrow in scope, the alleged violators denied that the discussion had occurred at all, and the defense had not indicated, beyond asking the court to infer other, greater violations had occurred, that any more serious violations had taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Cross-examination may be an appropriate mechanism by which to remedy the potential unfairness resulting from the violation of a sequestration order.

The court had the discretion to weigh the information before it in fashioning an appropriate remedy.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that, although the state now argues that the two conspiracies were charged in separate informations, it previously had represented at a hearing in the trial court that the operative facts implicated by each information \"were all the same.\" The state explained, \"[i]t's the same victim, same sequence of events that happened.\" Moreover, the state argued that it had filed separate informations solely because the events started in one jurisdiction and concluded in another. That these charges were brought\n   in separate, simultaneously issued informations on the basis of asserted jurisdictional requirements undermines the state's position on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The court found that, in the circumstances of this case, there was a single, continuous agreement. This finding is not clearly erroneous. The first information stated that the assault conspiracy involved the defendant, Dennis Guerrera, Michael Boilard, and Sarah Boilard, while the second information alleged that the kidnapping conspiracy was an agreement between the defendant, Dennis Guerrera, and Wilcox. The court found that the state's evidence at trial showed that the defendant, Dennis Guerrera, and the Boilards conspired to assault the victim because they believed he had stolen from Michael Boilard. Then, \"in furtherance of that conspiracy, the defendant and [Dennis Guerrera] lured [the victim]\" to the Boilards' apartment, assaulted him, and then contacted Wilcox to get his help transporting the victim to Buttermilk Falls. According to the trial court, then, Wilcox was added to a conspiracy already in motion, and there was no new, distinct conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The state contends that Wilcox did not know about the assault conspiracy, which had been completed by the time he agreed to help the defendant and Dennis Guerrera. This argument, while supported by the record, simply suggests that this particular conspiracy-an agreement to exact revenge on the victim-was one in which Wilcox was a late addition. Our case law contains no requirement that every member of a conspiracy be present and involved in each step of the overall criminal transaction; indeed, the participants of a conspiracy need not even know one another. For example, in a \"hub-and-spokes\" association or conspiracy, \"a single central figure, the 'hub,' maintains separate relationships with two or more confederates, the 'spokes,' who, although they all engage with the hub in common criminal activities in furtherance of a common\n   purpose, deal only with the hub, but not with each other.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court applied accepted principles of law. We agree with the court that the state's argument is \"merely an effort to segment into pieces one unbroken agreement\" to assault the victim.

In\n   <em>\n    Hope,\n   </em>\n   the evidence of an agreement between the parties was substantial: the victim's wife testified that the defendant had not wanted the coconspirator to kill the victim because he would \" 'screw it up' \"; id., at 572,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20A.2d%201000\">\n    577 A.2d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; whereas the defendant believed that he could \" 'kill [the victim] with just one blow' \"; id.; the coconspirator told the defendant of his plan to drug, strangle, or shoot the victim; on the night of the murder, the defendant picked up the coconspirator and waited with him at a cafe for hours before the coconspirator finally told him he planned to kill the victim and asked if the defendant could help by moving the body; the defendant told a third party that he and the coconspirator were going to the victim's home to kill him; the defendant drove the coconspirator to the victim's home; the victim's wife overheard the defendant and the coconspirator in the victim's bedroom beating the victim and firing a gun several times; the defendant helped hide the body and dispose of other incriminating evidence with the coconspirator. Id., at 573-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20A.2d%201000\">\n    577 A.2d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the evidence of an agreement presented by the state in the present matter is entirely circumstantial and not nearly as salient: witnesses testified that Dennis Guerrera and the defendant walked into the woods with the victim at Buttermilk Falls; and a witness claimed that Dennis Guerrera and the defendant had told him that they took turns beating the victim with a single baseball bat. It is plausible, then, that the jury in the present matter concluded that the state did not establish an agreement to commit murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The jury instructions as to the conspiracy to commit murder charge set forth the elements as follows: \"(1) the defendant specifically intended that conduct which constituted the crime of murder be performed; (2) the defendant, acting with that criminal intent, entered into an agreement with one or more persons to engage in\n   conduct constituting the crime of murder; and (3) there was an overt act in furtherance of the subject of the agreement by any one of those persons.\" In view of the pleadings, evidence, and these instructions, we determine that the ultimate fact of the defendant's intent to kill was not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   resolved by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   We may imagine numerous scenarios, on the basis of the evidence in the record, in which the jury could have found it not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant agreed with Dennis Guerrera to commit murder, while still reasonably finding that the defendant had the requisite intent to kill the victim. For instance, the jury could have found that the defendant had the intent to commit murder without necessarily having agreed with his brother\n   to do so. The defendant and Dennis Guerrera perhaps agreed to assault the victim at Buttermilk Falls, and at some point during the assault, the defendant individually developed an intent to kill the victim. To create an exhaustive list would require rampant speculation-a fact that, in itself, thwarts the defendant's argument that the jury\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   resolved the issue of intent in the defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The defendant argues that \"[t]wo people together beating a single person to death, both with an intent to kill, have committed a conspiracy, as a matter of law,\" or, have engaged in an \"ipso facto\" conspiracy. (Emphasis omitted.) In fact, he contends, he could not have had the intent to kill the victim and carried out the murder absent an agreement with Dennis Guerrera to do so. The evidence as to intent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, was far more extensive than the state's evidence of an\n   agreement. The jury certainly could have inferred the existence of an agreement on the basis of the testimony at trial, but \"it is not enough that the fact may have been determined in the former trial\"; the defendant must prove that the fact actually was decided. (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Aparo,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527640\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/384/#p388\">\n    223 Conn. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20A.2d%20401\">\n    614 A.2d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury may simply have decided that the state did not prove that the defendant entered into an agreement or mutual plan with Dennis Guerrera, regardless of whether he had the intent to commit murder. Therefore, the defendant's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the first degree kidnapping count because, in acquitting him of unlawful restraint, the jury necessarily determined that the defendant did not restrain the victim. The state is therefore collaterally estopped from retrying him on the kidnapping charge. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The defendant argues that the restraints alleged in the kidnapping charge and in the unlawful restraint charge are the same, single restraint; hence, the jury's finding of not guilty of an unlawful restraint collaterally estops the state from retrying the kidnapping charge, on the basis of the same unlawful restraint, in a new trial. In the first information, the state charged the defendant with \"unlawful restraint in the first degree ... on or about February 22, 2011, at approximately 10:30 p.m., in or around 56 Ingraham Place, Bristol ....\" The second information charged the defendant with kidnapping the victim \"between approximately 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., beginning at 56 Ingraham Place, Bristol ... and ending in the vicinity of Lane Hill Road, Terryville....\" The court found that the evidence presented at trial established that the unlawful restraints alleged in each of the informations did not\n   necessarily refer to a continuous restraint, but rather two separate criminal acts. This finding is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The second information's allegation of kidnapping in the first degree clearly is distinct from the unlawful restraint alleged in the first information. The kidnapping may have begun at the same general time and in the same general location as the alleged unlawful restraint, but the kidnapping is described as concluding in a location different from the unlawful restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   There is no indication from the informations that the first unlawful restraint necessarily transitioned into a full-fledged kidnapping, as the defendant contends, and the evidence adduced at trial supported the existence of two distinct criminal transactions. The evidence to support the unlawful restraint described in the first information was limited. The state's theory at trial was that the victim was incapacitated by the physical trauma he suffered from the assault; these serious injuries prevented the victim from leaving the Boilards' apartment. Testimony from various witnesses established that (1) the victim willingly went to the Boilards' apartment after receiving a telephone call from the defendant, and (2) a neighbor heard fighting and someone shouting, \"[d]ude, please stop,\" emanating from within the apartment after the victim entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   By contrast, the kidnapping charge finds stronger support in the record. Various witnesses testified that the defendant and the victim left the apartment together. The defendant was seen carrying an aluminum bat as he and the victim walked to Fast Freddies where Dennis Guerrera and Wilcox picked them up. Inside the car, the victim asked to be taken to a hospital, but the defendant insisted that the victim \"be quiet.\" Upon arriving at Buttermilk Falls, the defendant-who was still carrying the baseball bat-and Dennis Guerrera walked with the victim into the woods. The defendant\n   later allegedly told Michael Boilard that the victim \"begged for them to let him go.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The court described the evidence offered at trial to establish the kidnapping related restraint as \"substantial\" in contrast to the minimal evidence offered to prove the restraint within the apartment, \"hence the not guilty verdict on [that] charge of unlawful restraint.\" The court noted that \"[t]he contrasting evidence between the two counts reveals that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the two counts implicated two distinct criminal transactions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Viewing the entire record in this case; see\n   <em>\n    State v. Aparo,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527640\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/384/#p388\">\n    223 Conn. at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20A.2d%20401\">\n    614 A.2d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; in a practical and rational manner, it is clear that the defendant has not met his burden of proving that the only logical interpretation of the acquittal on the unlawful restraint charge is that the jury concluded that there was no unlawful restraint at any point on the day of the victim's murder. The defendant relies substantially on the language used in the informations to describe the locations of the two criminal acts, arguing that if no restraint occurred \"in or around\" the Boilards' apartment, then there is no plausible way for the kidnapping to have begun at the Boilards' apartment as alleged. The defendant also takes issue with the court's determination that \"[t]he very existence of two informations belies the defendant's claim that the state was alleging one restraint.\" Despite these arguments, the testimony presented at trial does not require an inference of one continuous restraint that began with the assault in the apartment, became a kidnapping, and ended at Buttermilk Falls. The jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant was charged with two distinct crimes that did not necessarily overlap. We conclude, then, that the state could assert two separate unlawful restraints. The\n   defendant's claim fails because the jury did not necessarily resolve the unlawful restraint element of the kidnapping charge in the defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The defendant finally claims that the state is collaterally estopped from trying him for felony murder because it is collaterally estopped from retrying him on the predicate felony of kidnapping in the first\n   degree. The jury was unable to reach a decision on the charge of felony murder. Because we concluded that the state may retry the predicate offense of kidnapping in the first degree, this argument necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Brady v.
