The court sentenced him to two consecutive life terms for murder and a concurrent ten year term for burglary. He noted an appeal, presenting five questions, which we have combined and rephrased as four:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Did the trial court err by denying his motion for a mistrial based upon the prosecutor's remark during opening statement that the jurors would hear the appellant \"testify\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   II. Did the trial court err by declining to give his requested jury instructions on the crime of burglary and by its answers to questions from the jury about that crime?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   III. Did the trial court err by admitting a recording of a telephone call that he made from the Baltimore County Detention Center?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   IV. Did the trial court err by denying his motion to dismiss the charges against him or to exclude the testimony of two State's witnesses as a sanction for alleged prosecutorial misconduct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Just after 2 a.m. on December 2, 2012, Walls killed Okemia Walls (\"Okemia\"), his estranged wife, and William Cunningham, her boyfriend. The charges against him were tried to a jury over five days in May 2014. The State's theory of prosecution was that the murders were willful, deliberate, and premeditated, and were committed in the course of a first degree burglary. Walls did not dispute his criminal agency, but took the position that he had killed the victims without premeditation or deliberation, and in hot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation, thereby mitigating the crimes to voluntary manslaughter. He disputed that he had the requisite intent to commit first degree burglary. We summarize the relevant evidence adduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Walls and Okemia had known each other for 23 years and had been married for 7 years. They had no children together, but each had adult children from prior relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the beginning of 2012, Walls and Okemia were living at 24 Venus Court, a two-story townhouse in the Northbrooke Township development in Parkville. Okemia's daughter, Meishon Moore, was the lessee of the townhouse and lived there as well. Venus Court is comprised of three groupings of townhouses configured in a U with a parking lot in the center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sometime in the spring or summer of 2012, Walls and Okemia separated. Walls moved in with his brother, Rick Walls (\"Rick\"), and Rick's wife, Angela Walls (\"Angela\"), in their home in Joppa, Harford County. According to Moore, Walls took all of his belongings with him, did not retain a key to 24 Venus Court, and did not have permission to be in the home thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cherod Hicks was living in an apartment at 1 Venus Court with his roommate, Whitney Franklin. Hicks and Franklin were friends with Walls and Okemia. Around 7 p.m. on December 1, 2012, Hicks called Walls and told him that a\n   friend had attended a gathering at 24 Venus Court that day and had observed Okemia with a male companion. Upon hearing this, Walls got pretty \" upset\" and said, \"This is why I wanted to be finished with her.\" He asked Hicks to come pick him up. Hicks agreed, but later changed his mind. He fell asleep and awoke around midnight. His cell phone showed 15 missed calls from Walls. He did not call him back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meanwhile, at 11 p.m., Okemia, Cunningham, Moore, and Moore's boyfriend left 24 Venus Court and went to a local bar. Around 1:15 a.m. (by now December 2, 2012), Okemia and Cunningham returned to 24 Venus Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moore and her boyfriend stayed at the bar until 1:30 a.m. They drove to pick up some food and then returned to 24 Venus Court. Moore, who was behind the wheel, pulled into the parking lot between the townhouses around 2 a.m. She saw Walls crossing the parking lot, walking toward her car. She opened her window and asked him what he was doing there. Walls was sweating and appeared angry. He replied that \"he had to get that nigga\" or that he had to \"kill that nigga.\" Moore closed her window and drove away in a panic. She pulled around the corner and parked. She called Okemia's cell phone, but there was no answer. She then called Cunningham's cell phone, but that call also went unanswered. She called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Deanna Hunter, who was living at 30 Solar Circle, one street over from Venus Court, heard loud voices\n   outside. She looked out her window and saw a man \"pinn[ing]\" a woman against an SUV and stabbing her with a knife. The woman fell to the pavement. Hunter heard the man say, \"I told you I was gonna get you\" as he was stabbing the woman. She called 911. While on the phone with the 911 operator, Hunter saw the perpetrator walk away. She went outside to render aid to the victim. She told the 911 operator that the woman was on her stomach, was bleeding profusely, and there was a \"knife broken off in her back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Meanwhile, Moore had driven back into the parking lot on Venus Court. She noticed that the front door of 24 Venus\n   Court was wide open. She jumped out of her car and ran toward her townhouse. Walls was sitting on the outdoor air conditioning unit for the neighboring townhome. He said, \"Mi, your mother is dead. I killed them both.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moore ran inside the house and found Cunningham lying on the floor in the master bedroom \"bleeding to death.\" She could not find her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moore's next door neighbor, Dawn Green, came outside. Green, who is a retired police detective, had been awakened by a loud thud, some faint screaming, and the sound of footsteps next door. She then heard someone knocking on the door of a nearby townhouse, later determined to be 30 Venus Court. She heard a female voice say, \"Who is it,\" and a male voice reply, \"Bubbles.\" (Walls's nickname is Bubbles.) The female voice asked, \"Well, what do you want?\" The male voice replied, \"I just killed M[ami],\" which was the nickname Walls used for Okemia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Green retrieved her gun and police badge, and told her husband to call 911. She ran next door and, finding the door open, went inside and called out for Okemia. No one answered. She went upstairs and found Cunningham lying on the bedroom floor bleeding from the upper torso. He was still alive but could not speak. She told him she would get help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Green ran back outside and saw Walls sitting on an air conditioning unit. She asked him where Okemia was and he replied, \"I killed her.\" Green displayed her gun and identified herself as a police officer. Walls took off running in the direction of Solar Circle. Green pursued him and yelled that she would shoot if he didn't stop. He exclaimed, \"It's me. I did it. I did it. Don't shoot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By then, Baltimore County Police Department (\"BCPD\") Officers Conrad Butler and Daniel Burns had arrived at Solar Circle. They found Okemia, partially clothed and lying face down on the pavement, with \"horrific injuries on her back.\" A \"tip of a piece of metal\" was sticking out of her spine. Officer Burns recognized it as the base of a knife blade that had broken off. A black knife handle was found in the grass by\n   her arm. The officers immediately observed Walls running toward them, hands in the air, with Green in pursuit. Walls was shouting, \"I did it. I did it.\" The officers yelled for Walls to get on the ground. He complied and they placed him under arrest. His hands were covered in \"wet, dripping blood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Walls began to cry. He told the officers that the woman on the ground was his wife. He said he had found her in bed with another man. Indicating with his head toward 24 Venus Court, he said he had \"left another one up there.\" Officer Butler entered 24 Venus Court and found Cunningham's body. Cunningham and Okemia were pronounced dead at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A BCPD crime technician photographed damage to the front door, doorframe, and casing at 24 Venus Court, as well as a muddy shoe print on the outside of the\n   door. She also photographed blood smears on the door of 30 Venus Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At trial, a video recording of an oral statement Walls gave to the police on December 2, 2012, was played for the jury. In the statement, Walls said he and Okemia had been reconciling and were planning to buy a house together. They had gone to the Siesta Motel on November 29, 2012, where they had sex. While they were there, Okemia received a call on her cell phone from a contact labeled \"my baby.\" Walls answered Okemia's cell phone, and a man was on the line. Walls became angry and accused Okemia of cheating on him. She denied that she and the other man were romantically involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to Walls, on December 1, 2012, he called Hicks and said he was going to come by his house (at 1 Venus Court) later that night to give Franklin some money to take to Okemia. Around 1:45 a.m. (on December 2, 2012), Walls hailed a \"hack\" cab in Joppa and was dropped off near an elementary school next to the Northbrooke Township development. From there, he walked toward 1 Venus Court. As he passed directly behind 24 Venus Court, he looked up at the second floor of the townhouse and saw Okemia and Cunningham through the window of the master bedroom. The room\n   was illuminated by a television set. Okemia was naked and \"hugging up\" against Cunningham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Walls recounted that he walked around to the front of the townhouses, where he encountered Moore. She drove up and asked him what he was doing there. He replied that he had come to see his wife. Moore said he should leave. She drove away. Walls walked up to 24 Venus Court, kicked in the door, grabbed a chef's knife he saw on the kitchen table, and went upstairs. When he entered the master bedroom, Cunningham saw him and \"came at him.\" He and Cunningham \"tussled\" on the bed and he began \"swinging the knife.\" He did not know how many times he stabbed Cunningham. Okemia ran out of the room, and Walls ran after her. When he caught up with her outside, he grabbed her by the shoulder. She \"got aggressive\" and he \"started swinging\" the knife at her. The knife eventually broke. He thought it might still be inside her. After Okemia fell to the ground, he called 911 on his cell phone. He walked back to Venus Court and knocked on the door to 30 Venus Court. He told the neighbor that he had killed Okemia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During his statement, Walls was distraught. He said the whole incident resulted from Okemia's \"playing games with [his] emotions\" and that he \"couldn't deal with it.\" Several times he asked the police if Okemia was dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 4, 2012, the police executed a search warrant at the home in Joppa where Walls had been living with his brother and sister-in-law. On the kitchen counter, they found a butcher block containing knives with black handles. The largest knife was missing. They photographed the butcher block and seized one of the other knives. The photographs and the knife were introduced into evidence at trial, as was the knife handle found near Okemia's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   During a jail visit with his sister, Walls admitted that he had taken a knife with him to 24 Venus Court on the night in question. A recording of this conversation was played for the jury. Subsequently, in a recorded jail phone call, Walls told his daughter that he was carrying a knife in the early morning\n   hours of December 2, 2012, in case he encountered any \"wild animals\" while walking to 1 Venus Court. A recording of that call also was played for the jury.\n   The autopsy reports document that Okemia was stabbed eighteen times and sustained seven cutting injuries on her back, chest, arms, hips, hands, and face. A knife blade measuring eight and three-eighths inches was embedded in her back on the right side. Cunningham was stabbed ten times and sustained seven cutting injuries to his back, shoulder, abdomen, arms, and hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In his case, Walls called eight witnesses. His sister-in-law, Angela, testified that he had moved in with her and her husband in July of 2012, but had continued to see Okemia regularly. Two BCPD police officers testified that they had responded to the scene of the crimes on December 2, 2012, and had heard Walls admit to killing Okemia and Cunningham. The officer who transported Walls to the police station that night testified that Walls \"began to cry and shake hysterically\" while in the police car. Yet another BCPD police officer testified that he had observed blood stains on the door to 30 Venus Court. A private investigator testified that he had confirmed that Okemia had registered at the Siesta Motel on November 29, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Opening Statement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In opening statement, the prosecutor gave the following description of Walls's pursuit of Okemia after she ran out of 24 Venus Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Okemia runs out of the apartment down the steps. This is 2:00 a.m. on December 2nd, early December of 2012. She\n   runs down the steps and she makes it to approximately this area, you'll hear testimony that's about 30 Solar Circle. This is the area where she ends up in front of 30 Solar Circle. She's running for her life. Ultimately, he catches her.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     You'll hear him testify that he just started swinging the knife.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Immediately after the prosecutor finished his opening, defense counsel asked to approach the bench and the following ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I'm very concerned about one thing that [the prosecutor] said, and I know he didn't do it intentionally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: It was a misspeak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It was a misspeak-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: I know it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: -but it was a really serious misspeak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: I know it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What he said was, \"You will hear him testify,\" in reference to [Walls]. I'm gonna have to ask for a mistrial based on that. That is a basic right [Walls] has not to testify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: I know. It was an inadvertent choice of words.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I know you didn't know-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I was referring to what he said in his statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE COURT: You were referring to his statement, and instead of saying, [\"]You will hear in the statement,[\"] you said, \"You will hear him testify.\" I'm denying the request for the mistrial.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I would be happy to grant a curative instruction.

What I will do if you'd like, and you can talk to [Walls] about this over lunch, I would before we start with testimony remind them of certain things and give a burden of proof instruction and no duty on Defense to put on any testimony in evidence and never any obligation for [Walls] to testify,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and I would highlight those instructions at the beginning of the case, and then we'll renew them at the end. So, if you would like me to do that, I'll be happy to do that.

She did not mention the prosecutor's misstatement or otherwise comment on whether Walls would testify. At the conclusion of her opening statement, the parties again approached the bench:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, the State's position is that a curative instruction will suffice if [Walls] plans to testify. We are mindful of the Court's time, we are loathed [sic] to waste the Court's time in terms of the time we've spent during the trial up to this moment. If the Defense can't say at this point in the proceedings whether or not [Walls is] going to testify-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE COURT: I mean, but the problem is and I believe it to have been just a misuse of a word-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   THE COURT: -as opposed to an intentional statement, and in context it's a statement that lawyers in the courtroom react to and I think is not even noticed by others, but it certainly was one that when it was said, you know, it caught my attention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, it was accidental and unintentional, however-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE COURT: I mean, first of all, [Walls] doesn't have to elect one way or the other at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I understand, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Secondly-well, anyhow, let me see.

At the close of all the evidence, at Walls's request, the court instructed the jurors that Walls \"ha[d] an absolute constitutional right not to testify. The fact that [he] did not testify must not be held against [him] and must not be considered by you in any way or even discussed by you in your deliberations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    (b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Walls contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for mistrial. Quoting\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184940\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/446/#p459\">\n    442 Md. 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184940\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/446/#p459\">\n    112 A.3d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), he argues that the prosecutor's remark in opening statement, that the jurors would hear him \"testify that he just started swinging the knife,\" was constitutionally impermissible because it was \"reasonably susceptible of an adverse inference by members of the jury that [his] failure to testify would be indicative of [his] guilt.\" Walls maintains that he had the right to decline a curative instruction, that such an instruction would have done more harm than good, and that the court's general instructions to the jurors about his constitutional right not to testify did not ameliorate the prosecutor's improper comment. He further argues that the evidence on the principal contested issue at trial-whether the murders were premeditated-was not so overwhelming as to render any error by the court in denying the mistrial motion harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State responds that the prosecutor's inadvertent \"single remark\" in opening statement did not mandate a mistrial. It maintains that\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable for a number of reasons, including that, here, the court offered to give a prompt curative instruction and had \"inoculated\" the jurors before the inadvertent comment by instructing them that Walls had an absolute right not to testify. Also, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Simpson,\n   </em>\n   Walls's criminal agency was not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Simpson,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals addressed for the first time the standard by which to assess whether a prosecutor's remark in opening statement violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Simpson was charged with multiple counts of arson and other crimes arising from three incidents at the home of his ex-girlfriend's family. In the first incident, the family's garage was set on fire and burned down. In the second incident, the roof of the family's house was set on fire. And in the third, one of the family's cars was doused in gasoline and set on fire while it was parked in their driveway. The third incident was captured on video and Simpson was arrested that same night. He gave an oral statement to the police, in which he admitted setting all three fires. He then handwrote a statement in which he again admitted to having set the fires. He said that he was \"crazy\" and \"need [ed] help.\" He wrote that the police should \"[p]ut [him] in the chair for lethal injection,\" and expressed shame about his actions. During his oral statement,\n   a police detective asked Simpson a series of questions and wrote down his responses.

Moreover, the cross-examination of members of the family was \"vigorous\" and, in the Court's view, effective.

If the answer to that question is \"yes,\" then we must determine the impact, if any, of Walls's decision to decline the court's proposed curative instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   There was no dispute here that the prosecutor misspoke when he used the word \"testify.\" This one-word slipup, inadvertently made, is unlike the intentional comments in\n   <em>\n    Smith I, Smith II\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Simpson.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith II,\n   </em>\n   the prosecutors' closing arguments openly invited the jurors to draw an inference against the defendant from his silence or his choice not to put on evidence. In that context, the prejudice to the defendant was great. Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Simpson,\n   </em>\n   the prosecutor repeatedly informed the jurors in opening statement that the defendant would \"tell\" them that he had committed the acts of arson, creating the strong impression that the defendant would testify and that his testimony would run counter to his defense of lack of criminal agency. The nature and number of these comments made them seriously prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In this case, the trial judge found that the prosecutor's one-word \"misspeak\" (made in the course of an opening statement covering four transcript pages), although glaring to the court and counsel as people schooled in the law, probably did not even register to the jurors.

With Walls's consent and agreement, the no \"adverse inference\" instruction was given to the venire panel before\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and to the seated jurors at the close of the evidence. He had a right under Maryland common law to veto the court's decision to give those instructions on the ground that they were harmful and not protective of his right not to testify, but he did not invoke it. He only vetoed the court's giving the no \"adverse inference\" instruction (in identical form) at the beginning of the evidence phase of the trial, when, as we have explained, it would have timely and effectively cured the minimal damage from the prosecutor's improper comment without highlighting the comment. In these circumstances, Walls's decision to decline the offered curative instruction was a tactic to box the court into granting a mistrial unnecessarily, not an invocation of his right under\n   <em>\n    Hardaway.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We do not agree with the State that Walls waived his right to challenge the court's denial of his mistrial motion by declining the curative instruction. He is entitled to argue on appeal that the proposed instruction would not have been curative and therefore a mistrial was required. However, if the proposed instruction would have been curative and not prejudicial, as we have concluded, Walls may not rest upon his right under\n   <em>\n    Hardaway,\n   </em>\n   which he did not invoke, to argue that the court abused its discretion in denying the mistrial motion when he rejected the proposed curative instruction as a strategy to force a mistrial. To hold otherwise would create a perverse incentive for defendants to refuse instructions that would otherwise cure prejudice flowing from an improper comment upon a defendant's right against self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Even if we were to conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying the mistrial motion, we nevertheless would hold that the court's error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As discussed, the improper comment was isolated and unintentional. It was made after the jurors already had been instructed that Walls had an \"absolute constitutional right not to testify.\" Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Simpson,\n   </em>\n   where criminal agency was disputed and the prosecutor's repeated references to what Simpson \"will tell\" the jurors about the crimes heightened the risk that the jurors would hold his silence at trial against him, here, it was undisputed that Walls was the person who killed Okemia and Cunningham. Only his state of mind at the time of the killings was in dispute. He relied upon his recorded statement to the police as evidence that he was in a highly emotional state immediately after the crimes, that he had become enraged upon seeing Okemia and Cunningham in an embrace, and that he went to the area of Venus Court to visit Franklin, not to confront Okemia. The recorded statement included his assertion that he picked up the knife when he entered the townhouse, which also supported his defense. Given that Walls's defense was consistent with his\n   recorded statement to the police, the risk that the jury might draw an adverse inference from his silence was not heightened.\n   Finally, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Simpson,\n   </em>\n   where the Court emphasized that the jurors only convicted the defendant on one of nine counts and that prosecution witnesses were subjected to vigorous cross-examination and were impeached at trial, here, the evidence at trial was largely undisputed. Walls did not contest that he knew that Okemia was with another man on December 1, 2012; that he kicked in the door of 24 Venus Court; that he went upstairs and stabbed Cunningham repeatedly; that he chased Okemia outside through Venus Court and onto Solar Circle; and that when he caught up with her, he stabbed her multiple times, stopping only when the knife handle broke off. The evidence showed that he twice admitted to taking the knife with him to 24 Venus Court. All of that evidence was consistent with the State's theory that Walls made the willful and premeditated decision to kill Cunningham and Okemia either prior to or after arriving at 24 Venus Court, and was inconsistent with Walls's position that he killed Cunningham and Okemia in hot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation. We are persuaded on these facts that the prosecutor's inadvertent misstatement in opening statement had no effect on the outcome of the trial and therefore was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury Instructions on First Degree Burglary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Before addressing Walls's two related contentions respecting the jury instructions on first degree burglary, as supplemented, we summarize the evidence relating to that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   On direct examination, Moore, the lessee of 24 Venus Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that Walls moved out around April 2012.

It further states that they pay $500 per month in rent and that the total rent for the townhouse was $771 per month. In Section II, which also was to be completed by the \"landlord or rental agent,\" the form identifies the occupants of 24 Venus Court as Moore, Okemia, and Walls.

He signed the form on May 20, 2012. The form was not signed by Okemia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   On redirect examination, Moore testified that she signed the DHR Form after Walls had moved out. She had been charging Okemia $500 per month in rent. Walls never paid rent. She reiterated that Walls was no longer living with her mother in\n   December 2012 and did not have her (Moore's) permission to be in the townhouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In the defense case, Angela testified that Walls and Okemia had separated numerous times over the seven years they had been married, but always had reconciled. The most recent separation was in July 2012. Since then, Walls had been staying with her and Rick. On the day Walls moved out of 24 Venus Court, he called Angela late at night. She went there to pick him up. He did not have any belongings with him. About three days later, Rick took him back to 24 Venus Court to collect his things. He brought a trash bag full of clothes and a Rubbermaid container with him. Since that time, he had stayed with them \"on and off.\" She explained that\n   sometimes he would be \"gone for a day, sometimes he would be gone for a couple days.\" According to Angela, when he was gone, he was with Okemia. She said that Walls and Okemia \"would get rooms at the Siesta Motel\" and \"[s]ometimes he would stay with her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   On cross-examination, Angela acknowledged having received a phone call from Walls on December 2, 2012, after he was arrested. During that call, Angela said to him, \"You haven't even lived [at 24 Venus Court] for five months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In his statement to the police, Walls said he and Okemia had met and had sex on November 29, 2012, at the Siesta Motel. He claimed that on the night of December 2, 2012, he was planning to spend the night at 1 Venus Court with Hicks and Franklin. He said that he often stayed there. Upon seeing Okemia and Cunningham through the window, he became enraged. He gained entry to 24 Venus Court by kicking in the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   At the close of all the evidence, counsel met with the trial judge in chambers to discuss jury instructions. Walls's lawyer asked the court to give two supplemental instructions on first degree burglary. The first was patterned on\n   <em>\n    Hobby v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057177\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/526/\">\n    436 Md. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057177\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/526/\">\n    83 A.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). It stated: \"You are instructed that, under the law, the temporary absence of a resident from the home does not mean the home is no longer his residence, or that the home is 'someone else's dwelling.' \" The second was taken from\n   <em>\n    Warfield v.

The fact that Meishon Moore did not have the legal right to allow Okemia Walls and Bryant Walls to sublet the premises from her does not mean that Bryant Walls did not have the right to be there. A person who has\n   a reasonable belief that he has a right to be at a location may legally be present if he has a reasonable belief that he is permitted to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The trial court declined to give either instruction. It gave Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (MPJI-Cr) 4:06, which it supplemented as emphasized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   The Defendant is charged with burglary in the first degree. Burglary in the first degree is the breaking and entry of someone else's dwelling with the intent to commit either murder or manslaughter or first degree assault. In order to convict the Defendant of burglary in the first degree, the State must prove\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   First, that there was a breaking; second, that there was an entry; third, that the breaking and entry was in someone else's dwelling; fourth, that the breaking\n   and entry was done with the intent to commit either murder, manslaughter or first-degree assault inside the dwelling; and fifth, that the Defendant was the person who broke and entered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Breaking means the creation or enlargement of an opening such as a breaking or opening of a window or pushing open a door; entry means any part of the Defendant's body was inside the house, and a dwelling is a structure where someone regularly sleeps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Now, in determining whether 24 Venus Court was someone else's dwelling, the State must prove that the Defendant had no right to enter that dwelling without the permission of one of the occupants.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   After the court instructed the jury, defense counsel noted an exception to the burglary instruction. Referencing the discussion in chambers, she argued that the instruction did not adequately explain that if Walls held a reasonable belief that he had permission to enter 24 Venus Court, that was a complete defense to burglary. Moreover, defense counsel argued, the court had not advised the jury that the State bore the burden of proving that Walls's entry into that dwelling was not licensed, legal, or privileged. Defense counsel emphasized\n   that 24 Venus Court was not the residence \"of a stranger,\" but was the place where Walls had lived, where the DHR Form appeared to give him license to live, and where his wife had continued to live. Defense counsel also noted an exception to the court's refusal to instruct the jury, based upon\n   <em>\n    Hobby,\n   </em>\n   that an occupant of a dwelling does not relinquish his or her possessory interest in the dwelling by temporarily leaving that residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The trial judge overruled the exceptions, explaining that she believed that the instructions as given adequately covered the applicable law. The jury began deliberating that afternoon. About two hours later, the court received a note from a juror asking, \"What is the legal definition of someone else's dwelling?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The court discussed the appropriate response to that question with counsel. Defense counsel reiterated her requests for the two supplemental instructions, arguing that they were the proper response to the jury note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Over defense counsel's objection, the court reinstructed and supplemented the burglary instruction as follows (supplemented portion in italics):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   In determining whether 24 Venus Court was someone else's dwelling, the State must prove that the Defendant had no right to enter the building without the permission of one of the occupants.\n   <em>\n    It is up to you to determine whether the Defendant had a reasonable belief that he had a right to enter that location without obtaining the permission of another occupant.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   While the jury remained in the courtroom, a juror asked the trial judge another question: \"On my first question of someone else's dwelling, you expanded on that definition and you used the word 'occupant.' How do you define occupant?\" The court advised the jurors that it could not answer that question \"on the fly,\" but would get back to them with a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel again asked the court to give the previously requested instructions, which did not use the term occupant and, as such, did not\n   require that an additional definition be provided. The court responded that that was not responsive to the discrete question posed, which asked for the definition of the term \"occupant.\" The court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   The question that they are asking-what I said is, \"It's up to you to determine whether he had a right to enter without obtaining the permission of another occupant.[\"] They want to know what an occupant is. An occupant is someone with a legal right to be present at a location, and I'm inclined to tell them exactly that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Defense counsel objected, arguing that the court's response could cause confusion because a person without a legal right to be present still could hold a reasonable belief that they possessed a right to enter and, if that were so, they could not be found to have entered \"the dwelling place of another.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The court disagreed. It supplemented its instruction to advise the jury that an occupant is \"someone who does have a legal right to be present in the dwelling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Maryland's statutory offense of burglary in the first degree is \"akin to common law burglary, without the element of 'in the nighttime.' \"\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v.

We reasoned that while the jury would have been free to reject Green's testimony, because the court declined to instruct them on the affirmative defense, the jury was \"never called upon to judge [Green's] credibility\" or to determine whether he entered McDougald's residence with an \" 'awareness that it was unwarranted.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035479\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/474/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035479\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/474/\">\n    at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1210101\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/119/547/\">\n    705 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Warfield,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035479\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/474/\">\n    315 Md. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035479\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/474/\">\n    554 A.2d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Herd,\n   </em>\n   the defendant, a licensed bailbondsman, was convicted of fourth degree burglary after a bench trial on an agreed statement of facts. While attempting to apprehend a fugitive who had failed to appear for trial, the defendant learned from someone at the fugitive's last known address that the fugitive was now staying at a different house in Baltimore City. The defendant and two other bailbondsmen went to that house and knocked on the door, but received no answer. Hearing sounds inside the home, they used an axe to break the lock off the front door and enter the house. We held that the trial court, sitting as the fact-finder, properly applied the burdens, concluding that, on the agreed statement of facts, the affirmative defense of a reasonable belief was generated; that the State had not disproved that the defendant held a subjective belief that the fugitive was present at the house, giving him license to enter to apprehend him; but that the State had met its burden of persuasion that that belief was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In the case at bar, Walls did not adduce any evidence to show that he actually believed he had the right to enter 24 Venus Court without the permission of Okemia or Moore. And, on the contrary, there was evidence that Walls had a subjective belief that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have a right to enter 24 Venus Court. He made his way into 24 Venus Court on the night in question by kicking down the door. He did not use a key, he did not knock, he did not ask\n   Moore, who he had just seen, to let him in, and he did not attempt to call Okemia to request that she let him in. In his statement to police, he gave the Joppa address as his residence and said nothing to suggest any belief that he had a right to enter 24 Venus Court that night. The evidence that Walls was listed as a tenant on the DHR Form and Angela's testimony that he may have stayed with Okemia at times during their separation was evidence that may have shown an objectively reasonable belief that he had the right to enter 24 Venus Court, but it was not sufficient to meet his burden of production to show an actual belief that he had the right to enter on December 2, 2012. Because Walls failed to generate a genuine jury question on the issue of whether he had an actual belief that he had the right to enter 24 Venus Court on the night in question, the court did not err by declining to give his requested jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Walls also contends the court erred by not instructing the jury, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Hobby,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057177\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/526/\">\n    436 Md. at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057177\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/526/\">\n    83 A.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that the fact that he had temporarily moved out of 24 Venus Court did not mean that he had relinquished his possessory interest in that dwelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The State responds that the instruction patterned on\n   <em>\n    Hobby\n   </em>\n   was not generated by the evidence and, as such, the court properly refused to give it.

While the house was unoccupied, the defendant entered the home and, without the owner's knowledge or permission, lived there for six months. The defendant was arrested and charged with various crimes including first degree burglary. He appealed from his conviction for that\n   crime (and others) and, as relevant here, argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him of burglary because the home was no longer a \" dwelling\" when he moved in. In rejecting that contention, the Court of Appeals held that a building becomes a \"dwelling\" when it is used for \" 'human habitation.' \" 436 Md. at 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057177\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/436/526/\">\n    83 A.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McKenzie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491325\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/120/\">\n    407 Md. at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491325\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/120/\">\n    962 A.2d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Rather, it concerned whether that absence deprived\n   <em>\n    the building\n   </em>\n   of its character as a dwelling. Here, there was no dispute that 24 Venus Court was a dwelling. It was occupied by Moore and Okemia at all relevant times.

At no time did she argue that the call was inadmissible without testimony establishing that the voice of the caller was Walls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   On the third day of trial, the State sought to introduce the recording into evidence during the testimony of Detective Wolf. At that time, the court asked defense counsel if she wished to \"preserve [her] objection for the record?\" She replied, \"Yes, your Honor, preserving my objections to [the] jail call ... as well as objections to not having the custodian of record as we requested and the nature of the certification and bringing it in through Detective Wolf.\" The court overruled her objections and admitted a recording of the jail call as a business record. The recording was then played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   We agree with the State that this issue is not preserved for review. The argument Walls advances on appeal-that the State failed to properly authenticate the recording of the jail call by presenting evidence that the voice of the caller was that of Walls-was neither raised nor decided below. Md. Rule 8-131(a). Walls's argument in the trial court was that the custodian of records needed to testify about the manner in which the calls were made and recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In any event, we agree with the State that the substance of the phone call itself, in which the caller describes the night of the murders in great detail and uses his nicknames for Okemia and Moore (Mami and Mimi) was strong circumstantial evidence that the caller was Walls and was sufficient to support its admission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

In his motion, Walls asserted that the prosecutor had sent letters to \"civilian witnesses in this matter\" advising them:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   You are listed as a witness for the State in the above murder case. As a result, a public defender (defense attorney for the above defendant, Bryant Walls) or a defense investigator may contact you.

They may not be clear about this fact when speaking with you, and may in fact imply that they are working for this office, the Office of the State's Attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   You may speak with the defendant's attorneys or the defendant's investigators if you wish.

If you decide to talk with them, you may be asked what you said during cross-examination at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   Please contact me if you have any questions about this information. Please also let me know if an investigator or attorney working for the defendant contacts you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Two witnesses who received these letters, Hicks and Hunter, were called by the State at trial. Angela, who as mentioned was called as a defense witness, also received a letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Walls argued during pretrial hearings that these letters discouraged witnesses from speaking to the defense by implying that defense counsel would lie to them and twist their words. He asked the court to sanction the State for misconduct by either dismissing the indictment or precluding the State from calling any witness to whom it had sent these letters. He argued, moreover, that he did not have to show any particularized prejudice because the \"chilling effect\" of the letters was self-evident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The court denied the motion for sanctions, ruling that the letters were not \"so over the line as to on its face constitute misconduct.\" The court concluded, moreover, that Walls had made \"no showing that there's any impact or any connection between this letter and what [the recipients of the letters] will say or not say.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   On appeal, Walls contends the court's ruling was in error and that we should remand for the trial court to \"determine whether the letter resulted in any prejudice to the defense.\" The State responds that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for sanctions because the letter did not direct witnesses that they could not or should not speak to the defense and, in fact, informed them that it was up to them. It argues, moreover, that Walls had an opportunity in the pre-trial hearing to present evidence that he was prejudiced and failed to do so, and that that was an independent basis supporting the court's denial of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   We perceive no abuse of discretion by the circuit court. The letters did not direct witnesses not to talk to the defense. The court did not err in finding that sending the letters, though \"ill-advised,\" did not rise to the level of sanctionable prosecutorial misconduct. Even if the letters had amounted to misconduct, we still would affirm the court's denial of relief on the basis that Walls failed to present any evidence that he had been prejudiced by the sending of the letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
