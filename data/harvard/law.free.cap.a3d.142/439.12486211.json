The issue in this case is whether\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   bars equitable subrogation in the different circumstances presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendants, Andrew Muldowney and Kalynn Tupa, appeal from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Amica Mutual Insurance Company. The trial court held that\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   did not bar the action. We agree, and conclude that an action in equitable subrogation was cognizable in the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2011, the plaintiff insurer commenced a subrogation action against the defendant tenants. The plaintiff claimed that it had indemnified the owner of the premises for property damage caused by the tenants and it sought to recover from them the amounts which it had paid on behalf of the insured owner, John Mihalec, to repair the damage. The action sounded in breach of contract and negligence. The defendants filed a motion to strike the complaint. The motion challenged the legal sufficiency of the complaint; specifically, it alleged that the plaintiff had failed to allege an express agreement between the landlord and tenant recognizing that an insurance company may have the ability to bring a subrogation action. In a September 13, 2011 memorandum of decision, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Taggart D. Adams,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, denied the defendants' motion to strike, reasoning that \"the lease executed by the defendants put them on notice that they would be liable for more than just the rent and security deposit under certain circumstances,\" and that the \"default rule,\" as expressed in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo,\n   </em>\n   did not bar the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The matter was referred to an attorney trial referee for fact finding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434(a)(4) and Practice Book \u00a7 19-2A. Following a trial, the referee issued a report dated January 24, 2014. The referee found as follows. On April 29, 2009, the defendants entered into a lease with Mihalec, the owner of residential premises at 7 Hervey Street in Greenwich. The defendants left the premises on December 21 or 22, 2009, and returned on January 5, 2010. During their\n   absence, a radiator burst, causing extensive water damage to the premises. Mihalec filed a claim with his property insurer, the plaintiff, which expended sums to repair the premises. The referee declined to consider the claims of breach of contract and negligence. Rather, the report concluded that the default rule expressed in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo v. Joseph,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360185\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/847/#p851\">\n    259 Conn. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , mandated that, in order for the plaintiff to have the ability to maintain an action in equitable subrogation, the lease agreement between the defendants and Mihalec must have contained a provision expressly authorizing subrogation. Because the lease agreement contained no such express subrogation provision, the plaintiff could not prevail on its claims against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Povodator, J.,\n   </em>\n   suo motu, moved to accept the referee's report. The plaintiff filed an objection. In an October 8, 2014 memorandum of decision, the court declined to accept the report. The court\n   noted that the function of an attorney trial referee is to find facts and that it is the responsibility of the Superior Court to draw legal conclusions from the facts found. The court concluded that the provisions of the lease were sufficient to avoid the default rule in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo,\n   </em>\n   and that the defendants lawfully could be liable for losses resulting from their negligence or breach of contract. The court remanded the case to the referee for further factual findings regarding liability and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The referee found the following relevant facts in a second report. The parties entered into a lease agreement for the premises, which contained provisions obligating the tenants to pay for heating fuel, to use the heating and cooling systems in a prudent manner, not to negligently or wilfully damage the premises, and to pay all damages arising from a broken promise under the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted previously, the defendants left the premises vacant for approximately two weeks in December, 2009,\n   and January, 2010. The defendants failed to provide for a sufficient amount of oil for the furnace to operate during their absence. During the defendant's absence from the premises, the furnace stopped functioning. For a period of time, there was no heat in the premises, and a radiator on the second floor froze. The radiator burst, causing extensive water damage to the lower floor of the premises. Mihalec filed a claim with the plaintiff, which expended sums to repair the premises. The referee recommended that judgment enter in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $61,302.70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court moved, suo motu, to accept the second report. Neither party filed an objection. In a February 5, 2015 memorandum of decision, the court adopted the procedural and factual summary contained in the first report and concluded that the findings in the second report as to breach of lease obligations and negligence led it to conclude that judgment should enter in favor of the plaintiff as against both defendants on all four counts of the complaint in the amount of $61,302.70. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendants challenge the court's October 8, 2014 decision denying the motion to accept the referee's first report, and its February 5, 2015 decision rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court rejected the referee's conclusion in the first report that the subrogation was not appropriate in the circumstances of this case; and the court accepted the referee's second report, which found the defendants liable. The substance of each of these claims is the same. The defendants argue that the default rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   precludes subrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our review of the court's legal conclusion, that an ability to pursue subrogation existed, is plenary. \"The trial court's legal conclusions are subject to plenary review.

In\n   <em>\n    DiLullo,\n   </em>\n   the tenant leased but one unit in a multiunit\n   building. Holding that the landlord and the tenant were not deemed to be coinsureds under the landlord's policy, the court also held that whether subrogation was appropriate was to be decided on a case-by-case analysis of the circumstances of each case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id., at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    DiLullo v. Joseph,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360185\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/847/#p851\">\n    259 Conn. at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which involved a tenant\n   who leased a single unit in a multitenant building, our Supreme Court stated that the strong public policy against economic waste \"convinces us that it would be inappropriate to create a default rule that allocates to the tenant the responsibility of maintaining sufficient insurance to cover a claim for subrogation by his landlord's insurer. Such a rule would create a strong incentive for every tenant to carry liability insurance in an amount necessary to compensate for the value, or perhaps even the replacement cost, of the entire building, irrespective of the portion of the building occupied by the tenant. That is precisely the same value or replacement cost insured by the landlord under his fire insurance policy. Thus, although the two forms of insurance would be different, the economic interest insured would be the same. This duplication of insurance would, in our view, constitute economic waste and, in a multiunit building, the waste would be compounded by the number of tenants.... We think that our law would be better served by having the default rule of law embody this policy against economic waste, and by leaving it to the specific agreement of the parties if they wish a different rule to apply to their, or their insurers', relationship.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins.

With respect to the consideration of economic waste, the court stated: \"Here, unlike\n   <em>\n    DiLullo,\n   </em>\n   the public policy against economic waste is not reasonably implicated. Rather, in this instance, the court was faced with a duplex residence, not a multitenant building. At most, the realization of a right of subrogation may cause the existence of two insurance policies on the same property, admittedly an overlap but not palpably wasteful as in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo.\n   </em>\n   \" Id., at 691-92,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%201065\">\n    881 A.2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the present case does not involve a\n   multitenant building as in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo,\n   </em>\n   but rather involved a detached single-family residence. Although there conceivably could be two policies implicated in the present case, one paid for by the landlord and one by the renter, excessive waste is demonstrably lacking. Accordingly, the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Warner\n   </em>\n   applies to the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The second consideration in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo,\n   </em>\n   the likely lack of expectation regarding a tenant's obligation to be subject to subrogation, is also not present. By contrast,\n   <em>\n    Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. v.

In that case, the insurer claimed that the tenant negligently caused a fire, resulting in damages. Our Supreme Court concluded that the second\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   consideration was met because \"the provisions of the lease obligating the tenant not to cause damage to the apartment and to be responsible for repairing any such [damage] ... do not rise to a level of creating an express agreement noticing and obligating the tenant to be responsible for the fire loss ... [and] that no other provision of the lease creates such an obligation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The court further reasoned that the lease did \"not remotely inform the [tenant] defendants that they would be liable to their landlord's insurer for any casualty fire damages to the landlord's building. It informs them neither of the need to insure only their apartment, nor of the need to obtain insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the value of the entire multiunit apartment building.\" (Footnote omitted.)

As noted, the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   lease stated: 'Landlord is not liable for loss, expense or damage to any person or property unless it is due to Landlord's negligence. Tenant must pay for damages suffered and money spent by Landlord relating to any claim arising from any act or neglect of Tenant. Tenant is responsible for all acts of Tenant's family, employees, guests and invitees.' Thus, by the terms of the lease it was plainly within the contemplation of the defendant that she would be liable for damages caused by her acts and those of her guests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The lease in the present case objectively created a stronger expectation of liability on the part of the tenant than that in\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   and surely stronger than that in\n   <em>\n    Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co.\n   </em>\n   The trial court concluded that the lease provisions between landlord and tenant \"were more than adequate to meet the requirements of the holding in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   ... to avoid the default rule.\" We agree that the notice provided to the defendants in the lease was sufficient to avoid the\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   default rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although the lease in the present case did not contain an express provision\n   regarding subrogation, it is clear\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the lease that the defendants were to be responsible for any damage they negligently caused to the premises. The lease provided in relevant part: \"[Section 4.] You agree ... to use all electric, cooling and other systems in the Dwelling in a prudent manner ... to not willfully or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair or remove any part of the Dwelling or permit anyone else to do so ... to provide and pay for personal liability insurance for your and our mutual benefit in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 for bodily injury and property damage in or about the Dwelling. You will provide us with proof of such insurance.... [Section 8.] You will not permit any activity in the Dwelling which creates an unusual risk of fire or other hazard. You will not allow the Dwelling to remain vacant for more than fourteen (14) consecutive days without notifying us in advance of the planned vacancy. During any such vacancy, you agree to maintain the temperature\n   in the dwelling at not less than 60 degrees. You shall not be absolved of any of your obligations under this Lease during any such vacancy.... [Section 13.] If you break any of your promises in this Lease ... you will pay us all lost rent and other damages or costs we may incur because of your broken promises....

They were required to obtain insurance and to hold the landlord harmless. The defendants had adequate notice that they could well be held liable for all costs resulting from damage to the premises negligently caused by their failure to maintain the heat properly during their vacancy. Accordingly, the court properly concluded that the policy against economic waste was not implicated in this situation involving a single family dwelling and that the lease provisions gave the defendants the reasonable expectation that they would be liable for the damages associated with their negligent maintenance of the heating system during their absence, such that the default rule in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   did\n   not apply and the landlord's insurer was not barred from pursuing a subrogation action against the defendants.

The court clearly stated in its order regarding the first report that subrogation was not precluded and the default rule in\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    did not apply. It referred the matter to the referee for findings regarding the merits of the plaintiff's claims. The second report found in favor of the plaintiff on those claims. The defendants, then, preserved their claim regarding the\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    default rule, at the earlier time in the proceeding. Their failure to express their position on\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    again, after the referee issued a report on the issues of negligence, breach of contract and damages, did not serve to waive their earlier position on\n    <em>\n     DiLullo.\n    </em>\n    The issue is preserved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that the defendants' failure specifically to assert their position after the court's ruling on the motion to accept the first report renders their claim on appeal as to that issue unreviewable. The plaintiff has not cited persuasive authority serving to preclude the defendants from obtaining appellate review in the absence of a formal objection to the interlocutory ruling. The defendant's position was presented and argued to the trial court, which then ruled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The defendants argue that, for additional reasons, the court erred in rejecting the conclusion of the attorney trial referee's first report that the default rule in\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    applied. First, they argue that the lease provisions were ambiguous and that the referee's findings in the first report regarding the intent of the parties should prevail. In the first report, the referee concluded that an express provision in the lease allowing for subrogation was necessary under\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    and, because the lease was ambiguous in that regard, it did not meet the\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    criteria for avoiding the default rule. The trial court rejected that contention and concluded that, although the lease did not \"contain the word 'subrogation', or any derivation thereof, there is a very express allocation of liability on the defendants.... The defendants had ample notice that under certain expressly spelled-out conditions, they would owe Mihalec money and whether Mihalec, or [the plaintiff], which reimbursed Mihalec's loss, pursued the defendants for that money is inconsequential. The court finds that the substance of the lease agreement-that liability for losses resulting from negligence or breach of the lease fell upon the tenants-was clear.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The court did not err in declining to accept the legal conclusion contained in the attorney trial referee's first report.

We do not agree. The court interpreted\n    <em>\n     DiLullo\n    </em>\n    and its progeny and, employing de novo review, reached the legal conclusion that the lease was sufficient to avoid the default rule.
