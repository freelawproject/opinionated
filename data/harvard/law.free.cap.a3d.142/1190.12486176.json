Bloch, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his action against the defendant attorneys, Andrew Ullman and Irving Perlmutter, on the ground that he failed to file a recognizance bond as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 52-185.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue on appeal, as succinctly stated by the defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is\n   whether a judgment of dismissal properly entered against the plaintiff on December 9, 2014, when he failed to comply with the November 24, 2014 order of the court,\n   <em>\n    Wilson, J.,\n   </em>\n   that he file a recognizance bond for costs in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 8-4\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 52-185 within two weeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record discloses the following facts. On August 14, 2014, the plaintiff filed an application, asking the court to waive the entry fee and service of process fee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was granted by the court,\n   <em>\n    A. Robinson, J.,\n   </em>\n   on August 18, 2014. On August 26, 2014, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about August 28, 2014, Perlmutter sent the plaintiff a letter via first class and certified mail, in which he stated: \"This will acknowledge receipt of your summons and complaint dated August 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Pursuant to Section 8-3(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Connecticut Superior Court Rules and Section 52-185 of the Connecticut General Statutes, you are required to furnish a bond for prosecution of your action. You have failed to do so and the summons contains no recognizance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 8-7\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   you are hereby requested to furnish a\n   recognizance signed by some financially responsible person as surety that you shall prosecute your action to effect and answer all damages if you do not make your plea good.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"You are required to either refuse this request or to file a satisfactory bond within a reasonable time after\n   receipt of this request in accordance with the provisions of Practice Book Section 8-7.\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff returned the summons and complaint to court on September 8, 2014. On October 7, 2014, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-30, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's action with an accompanying memorandum of law. In their memorandum of law, the defendants stated that the plaintiff's action was returnable to court on October 7, 2014, and that the summons was signed by an assistant clerk of the Superior Court, permitting issuance of process. The memorandum continued: \"On the summons form, in the space provided for statutory recognizance required by Section 52-185 et seq. of the Connecticut General Statutes, no one was recognized nor was there provided the necessary security for costs as required by [\u00a7] 52-185.... On August 28, 2014, in accordance with [Practice Book \u00a7] 8-7, the defendants requested that the plaintiff provide a recognizance for costs signed by some responsible person as provided by [\u00a7] 52-185.... By reason of the failure of the [plaintiff] to respond to the request that he furnish security for costs as required by statute and rule [of practice], the defendants have filed a motion to dismiss this action in accordance with the provisions of [Practice Book \u00a7] 8-5(a).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants acknowledged that Judge Robinson had approved the plaintiff's application to waive certain fees, but noted that the plaintiff had not requested a waiver of recognizance. The defendants argued that the court has no authority to waive the provisions of \u00a7 52-185, citing\n   <em>\n    Steinkamp v. Jacque,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1665092\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-supp/36/37/#p41\">\n    36 Conn.Supp. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=410%20A.2d%20489\">\n    410 A.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). Moreover, the defendants argued that the plaintiff's cause of action will require substantial discovery, at least a deposition of the plaintiff, and a recognizance of $250 might not be sufficient to cover taxable costs. The defendants, therefore, requested a more substantial recognizance for costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 20, 2014, the plaintiff filed what the Superior Court clerk's office coded as a letter, which stated: \"The summons I filed in [this case] was deficient in that it did not contain a recognizance bond. I wish that I had this pointed out and explained to me when I filed my summons and my complaint at the Court Clerk's Office on August 14, 2014. I am representing myself pro se and have limited Court experience in my background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"I now believe I understand enough about the process and procedure to remedy the situation. As I understand it, from the Court Clerk, this requirement can be complied with by paying a $250 fee to the Court clerk and by signing a refiled summons document in the appropriate way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"To comply with this, I have sold about one-half of my last remaining financial asset, i.e., 157 shares of Peoples' United Bank. The proceeds, I have been told, will be sent to me by mail to my P.O. Box no later than December 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"I hope that will be sufficient to remedy the problem. /s/ Robert M. Bloch\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 24, 2014, Judge Wilson issued a memorandum of decision on the defendants' motion to dismiss. After setting forth the law with regard to a motion to dismiss and \u00a7 52-185, the court stated that the plaintiff \"has not obtained a recognizance as required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 and 8-4. Although the Practice Book [provides] that 'the validity of the\n   writ and service shall not be affected unless the neglect is made a ground of a motion to dismiss'; Practice Book \u00a7 8-5(a) ; the defendants here have exercised their right to file such a motion, and have done so in a timely and proper manner claiming that the absence of the recognizance rendered service of process invalid. Where, as here, a proper motion to dismiss has been filed,\n   Practice Book \u00a7 8-5(b) provides that the court shall direct the plaintiff to file an appropriate recognizance within two weeks, and that if such recognizance is not thereafter timely filed, the plaintiff shall suffer dismissal....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Accordingly, the court hereby orders the plaintiff to file the statutorily required recognizance on or before December 8, 2014. The court further orders that if a proper recognizance is not filed by said date, then without further motion of the defendants or order of this court, this matter shall thereupon be dismissed due to insufficiency of process and the resulting lack of personal jurisdiction.\" In violation of the court order, the plaintiff failed to file the recognizance bond by December 8, 2014, and a judgment of dismissal was entered against the plaintiff on December 9, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the plaintiff has identified numerous purported reasons, including a snowstorm, attempting to excuse his failure to file the ordered recognizance; see footnote 2 of this opinion; the reasons he offers are not that he did not have the financial resources to file the recognizance, but that he was unable to comply timely with the court's order. The plaintiff argues that he should be excused from his failure to file the recognizance by December 8, 2014, because he sold his shares of stock on November 18, 2014, and received a check for the proceeds of the sale on December 1, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that the proceeds of the sale were necessary to post a recognizance not only in the present case, but also in another action he had pending. If, as the plaintiff\n   contends, the proceeds from the sale of his stock took longer to clear his account than he anticipated, the record does not disclose that he filed a motion for an extension of time in which to file the recognizance or a motion to set aside the judgment of dismissal when he had the money in hand. The second set of facts the plaintiff relies upon to excuse his failure to file the recognizance by December 8, 2014, in compliance with the court order, is that when he returned three complaints to the Superior Court on August 14 and 15, 2014, he \"was not at all asked about or told by the court clerk that civil bonds could be an issue or would at all be required.\" He also asserts that once he became aware of the need to file a recognizance, no one in the courthouse could explain to him what he was required to do or how to do it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff's brief, however, provides no legal analysis of our rules of practice and \u00a7 52-185. As an appellate court, we are not in a position to find facts. We are required to resolve claims on appeal pursuant to the law and facts found by the trial court. Our resolution of the plaintiff's appeal is controlled by our review of the procedural history of the present case and the relevant law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin with the standard of review and the relevant legal principles governing the plaintiff's claim that the court improperly dismissed his cause of action. \"A motion to dismiss ... properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court.... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the trial court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [decision to grant] ... the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Harnage v.

The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the action grounded on the plaintiff's failure to post a recognizance bond. See Practice Book \u00a7 8-5(a). In response to the defendants' motion to dismiss, the plaintiff voluntarily offered to correct his error by filing a recognizance bond. Following a hearing on the motion to dismiss, the court ordered the plaintiff to file a recognizance bond within two weeks, that is, by December 8, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also ordered that if the plaintiff failed to file a recognizance, a judgment of dismissal shall enter without further motion of the defendants or order of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff does not claim that the court failed to adhere to the statutory recognizance scheme in effect at the time or to the rules of practice.

Lee,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"127266\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/42/682/\">\n     42 Conn.App. 682\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 684 n. 3,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20346\">\n     680 A.2d 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996). A claim that an appeal is untimely is governed by Practice Book \u00a7 66-8 (motion to dismiss must be filed within ten days after filing of appeal).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    At the bottom of the form the plaintiff listed monthly income of $674, expenses of $828, and assets of $40,103, including real estate, stock, and $700 in his checking account. In response to the question asking how the applicant supports himself if he has zero total monthly income or expenses, the plaintiff stated: \"My brother and sister-in-law help me out a bit.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Presumably, the plaintiff's complaint sounds in legal malpractice, but that is not at all clear, as it is a wide-ranging, handwritten document. In their appellate brief, the defendants correctly point out that the complaint is in narrative form and otherwise fails to conform to Practice Book \u00a7 101 in that it is not a plain and concise statement of the material facts and does not consist of statements divided into consecutively numbered paragraphs, each stating a separate allegation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 8-3(a) provides: \"Except as provided below, if the plaintiff in any civil action is not an inhabitant of this state, or if it does not appear to the authority signing the process that the plaintiff is able to pay the costs of the action should judgment be rendered against the plaintiff, he or she shall, before such process is signed, enter into a recognizance to the adverse party with some substantial inhabitant of this state as surety, or some substantial inhabitant of this state shall enter into a recognizance to the adverse party, that the plaintiff shall prosecute the action to effect, and answer all damages in case the plaintiff does not make his plea good; and no such recognizance shall be discharged by any amendment or alteration of the process between the time of signing and of serving it. (See General Statutes [Rev. to 2013] \u00a7 52-185 and annotations.)\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 8-4(a) provides: \"Except as provided below, in all actions wherein costs may be taxed against the plaintiff, no mesne process shall be issued until the recognizance of a third party for costs has been taken, unless the authority signing the writ shall certify thereon that he or she has personal knowledge as to the financial responsibility of the plaintiff and deems it sufficient.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 8-7 provides: \"No order for a bond for prosecution will be made by the judicial authority unless it be shown that the adverse party has been requested in writing to furnish the same and has refused such request or has failed to file a satisfactory bond within a reasonable time after the request was made.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The plaintiff directs us to a copy of his Fidelity Investments account he included in the appendix of his brief. That document indicates that on December 2, 2014, a check in the amount of $975 was deposited in the account. Two checks were drawn on the account on December 4, 2014, one in the amount of $95 and another in the amount of $260. There is a handwritten notation next to the $260 entry stating: \"This was for the bond paid in a timely manner in a related case, Robert M. Bloch vs The Law Office of Neil Crane.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The court ordered the plaintiff to post a recognizance bond within two weeks approximately three months after the defendants requested by letter that he do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The defendants also claim that, because the plaintiff alleged that they withdrew as his counsel in June, 2010, and he did not serve process until August, 2014, the plaintiff's action is barred by the statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577. A claim that a cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations is properly alleged as a special defense and may be resolved by a motion for summary judgment, but generally not by a motion to dismiss.
