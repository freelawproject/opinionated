We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts, as set forth by the trial court in its oral memorandum of decision, and procedural history. \"When Elijah was born, [the respondent] was residing in a drug treatment facility for mothers and children. [The respondent] had\n   entered the facility shortly before Elijah was born, asserting that she had used crack cocaine during her pregnancy. [After Elijah was born, the petitioner] learned that [the respondent] had left the facility without permission and [had] used crack cocaine, thus subjecting herself and Elijah to discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The [petitioner] imposed a [ninety-six] hour administrative hold on Elijah [who\n   was approximately one month old] on January 22, 2013. On January 23, 2013, an [ex parte] order of temporary custody was sought by the [petitioner] and a neglect petition was filed. The order of temporary custody was granted by Judge Mack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"On February 1, 2013, [the respondent] appeared, was appointed counsel, and filed a written plea of nolo contendere, which was accepted, and Elijah was adjudicated neglected and committed to [the petitioner]....\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[The respondent was issued court-ordered specific steps for reunification, which] included in significant part that she cooperate and make progress in individual and parenting counseling, that she cooperate with substance abuse treatment, that she not use illegal drugs, that she obtain an adequate home and income, that she immediately advise [the department] of the status of her household especially with regard to the child's safety, and that she visit Elijah as often as permitted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 22, 2014, the petitioner filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Elijah's father and the respondent. With respect to the respondent the petition sought termination on the ground that Elijah had been adjudicated neglected or uncared for, and\n   the respondent had failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, she could assume a responsible position in his life. See General Statutes (Supp.2016) \u00a7 17a-112 (j)(3)(B)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A trial was conducted on the petition over the span of five days between May 28, and June 29, 2015. Both the petitioner and the respondent presented exhibits and called witnesses. The respondent testified on her own behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, thirty exhibits\n   were presented, and nine witnesses were called.\n   The court issued an oral decision on October 27, 2015, granting the petition to terminate the parental rights of the respondent and Elijah's father. With respect to the respondent, the court found that the petitioner had proven by clear and convincing evidence the ground for termination asserted in the petition. The court also found, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j)(1), that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify Elijah with the respondent and that the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having found that the ground for termination had been proven, the court considered the appropriate disposition of the child and made written findings regarding the best interest of the child pursuant to the criteria set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (k). On the basis of these findings, the court determined by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the parental rights of the respondent and the father was in the best interest of Elijah. Accordingly, the court terminated the parental rights of both parents, and appointed the petitioner as Elijah's statutory parent for the purpose of securing his adoption by his foster parents. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The respondent first claims that the court improperly failed to conduct a pretrial canvass of her in accordance with our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, she alleges that the supervisory rule announced in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   required the court to canvass her prior to the start of trial and\n   that the timing of the court's canvass after the trial had ended, but before the court issued its decision, automatically requires the judgment terminating her parental rights to be reversed and a new trial ordered. The petitioner responds that the supervisory rule announced\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   should not be applied retroactively, and, even if it is retroactive, any error in conducting the canvass is subject to harmless error analysis, and no harm occurred as a result of the untimely canvass in this case. We agree in part with the petitioner. Specifically, we conclude that the respondent has failed to establish that she was harmed by the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass being conducted after the close of evidence but prior to the court rendering its decision, and, thus, she is not entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our review of this claim. After trial, but prior to the trial court rendering its decision, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.,\n   </em>\n   which was released on August 18, 2015, less than two months after the completion of the respondent's trial, our Supreme Court held that, pursuant to the court's supervisory powers over the administration of justice, \"public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system would be enhanced by a rule requiring a brief canvass of all parents\n   <em>\n    immediately before a parental rights termination trial\n   </em>\n   so as to ensure that the parents understand the\n   trial process, their rights during the trial and the potential consequences.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., at 794,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In an attempt to comply with this new rule, the court requested the parties to return to court on August 31, 2015. The court informed the parties, including the respondent and her trial attorney, Ryan Ziolkowski, of our Supreme Court's recent holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   and canvassed her as follows: \"[O]ur Supreme Court recently issued a decision in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   The decision came out approximately two weeks ago, and in it, [the court] indicated that there was an advisement [it wishes] the trial court to provide prior to the commencement of all termination cases, and they applied it retroactively in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"So, despite the fact that this case had concluded in terms of evidence, I have ordered it brought back in for the purpose of giving [the respondent] the following advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"There is pending a termination of parental rights petition, and you should be aware that if granted, it would result in the end of your legal relationship with Elijah. You would have no legal rights, no authority, and no responsibility for Elijah. You would no longer have any right to make any decisions of any kind affecting your son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"You would not be entitled to any state or federal benefits or entitlements that are based upon you being Elijah's mother. Elijah would be eligible to be adopted. You would not be able to obtain Elijah's birth certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Unless and until the termination petition is granted, you remain Elijah's legal mother, responsible for his financial support and entitled to all of those benefits I just described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Now, you have an attorney and your attorney would always assist you with any defenses you may have had to the [petitioner's] allegations. As you are or should be aware, you did not have to prove anything at trial. That [the petitioner] has the burden of proving [the] case by clear and convincing evidence. And during that trial, you had legal rights, including the right to confront witnesses and to have your lawyer cross-examine those witnesses to determine the credibility of their testimony. You had a right to object to the admission of\n   any documents or exhibits including social studies or psychological reports. You had the right to bring in your own witnesses and you did produce witnesses to assist you in challenging the allegations. You had the right to testify, and that is to tell your side of the story, present your case if you wanted to. You did not have to. You chose to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Now, I'm going to advise you as to an adverse inference even ... though it's moot in this case, meaning it would not happen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"If you had not testified, the court could have drawn an adverse inference against you; that is the court could decide you did not testify because you felt your testimony would not be helpful to you or would be harmful to you. That would require notice to be [given to] you in advance that the court was considering or being asked to take an adverse inference and give you an opportunity to testify. As I said, it's a non-issue, but I have to advise you of it. It's a non-issue in this case because the [petitioner] didn't ask for an adverse inference and you did in fact testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"So that-and as I told you, the entire burden of proof in the case was on the [petitioner].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Now, have you understood your rights and your responsibilities as to the termination petition?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: I believe I have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Court: Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: It's-there are things that I'm not sure about because I'm not in the court as often as some of you all are-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The Court: Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[The Respondent]:-but-go ahead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The Court: What-of what I just told you, was there anything-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: Uh-huh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The Court: -that you wish clarified or repeated?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: Not at this time, Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The Court: Okay.

Have you had enough time to talk to [your attorney]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: I-I don't believe so. I had a very brief meeting with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. Well, if you don't mind waiting, then we'll give you time to talk to him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The court took a brief recess, during which the respondent spoke with Ziolkowski. After the recess, the parties again appeared in front of the court. The following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The Court: So ... had I given you [the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ] advisement immediately prior to the start of trial-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: Uh-huh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"The Court: -is there something that [you and your attorney] ... would have done differently prior to June 29 [the start of trial]? Have you talked to your lawyer about that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"The Court: Okay, [Attorney Ziolkowski] was there any evidence that wasn't presented because [the respondent] didn't understand her rights, or was there anything that she is thinking could have or should have been done differently?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"[Attorney Ziolkowski]: I personally don't believe so. We went forward to trial in a manner which I felt appropriate. There were certain witnesses we had. There were certain witnesses we didn't have based upon my opinion as to whether or not they would be helpful or had relevant information to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"She has several witnesses whom I would consider to be more character witnesses rather than professional service providers that she feels should have been or could be called as a result of her advisement this morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The Court: What about the advisement this morning? Would it have made those witnesses relevant? What was it that [the respondent] did not know that she's learned today that would call for reopening the evidence to allow somebody to come in?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[Attorney Ziolkowski]: I can't speak to that, Your Honor. I don't-I don't know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: This is someone you personally know that could speak on my behalf....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The Court: I mean, it wasn't like you were sitting there and all of a sudden a light bulb went on [during the advisement] and you said, oh, my goodness, I just-I've just learned that I'm not-if my parental rights are terminated, I can't get my child's birth certificate as a result of which-now that changes something. I have somebody I wanted to testify.... [I]s there anything in that advisement that you were unaware of prior to the trial commencing?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: There was.... I wasn't always able to-to get ahold of [my attorney].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. But that's-was there anything in today's advisement-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"The Respondent: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The Court:-that changed your mind?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[The Respondent]: No, Your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The respondent did not object to the timeliness of the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass. She also did not request a new trial or that evidence be reopened for the purpose of entering additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As this court recently summarized, \"[o]ur Supreme Court exercised its supervisory powers in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   to announce a new rule that, although not constitutionally required, it concluded was necessary to protect the perceived fairness of the judicial system with regard to termination of parental rights proceedings. In setting forth the parameters of its newly crafted canvass requirement, our Supreme Court stated: '[B]y exercising our supervisory authority in the present case, we are promoting public confidence in the process by ensuring that all parents involved in parental termination proceedings fully understand their right to participate and the consequences of the proceeding. We conclude, therefore, that it is proper to exercise our supervisory power in the present case and require that, in all termination proceedings, the trial court must canvass the respondent\n   <em>\n    prior to the start of the trial.\n   </em>\n   The canvass need not be lengthy as long as the court is convinced that the respondent fully understands his or her rights. In the canvass, the respondent should be advised of: (1) the nature of the termination of parental rights proceeding and the legal effect thereof if a judgment is entered terminating parental rights; (2) the respondent's right to defend against the accusations; (3) the respondent's right to confront and cross-examine witnesses; (4) the respondent's right to object to the admission of exhibits; (5) the respondent's right to present evidence opposing the allegations; (6) the respondent's right to representation by counsel; (7) the respondent's right to testify on his or her own behalf; and (8) if the\n   respondent does not intend to testify, he or she should also be advised that if requested by the petitioner, or the court is so inclined, the court may take an adverse inference from his or her failure to testify, and explain the significance of that inference. Finally, the respondent should be advised that if he or she does not present any witnesses on his or her behalf, object to exhibits, or cross-examine witnesses, the court will decide the matter based upon the evidence presented during trial. The court should then inquire whether the respondent understands his or her rights and whether there are any questions. This canvass will ensure that the respondent is fully aware of his or her rights at the commencement of the trial. It will neither materially delay the termination proceeding nor unduly burden the state.' ...\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. at 794-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, the court gave the respondent an opportunity to consult with her attorney after the canvass. There was no request for any additional consultation time or a continuance. The respondent did not voice any objection to the trial court regarding the timing of the canvass or its content. The respondent did not move for a mistrial, nor did she ask the court to reopen the evidence. Rather, her attorney specifically stated that even if the respondent had been canvassed prior to the start of trial, he would have done nothing differently during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There are two main differences between\n   <em>\n    In re Leilah W.\n   </em>\n   and the present case. First, in the present case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    In re Leilah W.,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   was not released until after the close of evidence. Thus, the trial court did not commit error by forgetting to conduct the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass. Rather, once the supervisory rule was announced, the court did everything in its power to comply with it, canvassing the respondent approximately two weeks later. The court's actions did not \"[threaten] the integrity of the trial\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485392\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/1000/#p60\">\n    id., at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485392\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/1000/#p60\">\n    141 A.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; but, rather, sought to effectuate the purpose underlying the supervisory rule-\"promoting public confidence in the process by ensuring that all parents involved in parental termination proceedings fully understand their right to participate and the consequences of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. at 794-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, in the present case, there was a prolonged colloquy between the court and the respondent following the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass. In\n   <em>\n    In re Leilah W.,\n   </em>\n   the respondent merely stated that he had no questions in response to the canvass.\n   <em>\n    In re Leilah W.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485392\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/1000/#p60\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485392\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/1000/#p60\">\n    166 Conn.App. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485392\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/1000/#p60\">\n    141 A.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her brief on appeal, the respondent in this case does not take fault with the substance of the canvass, nor does she contend that she did not understand the canvass. In her reply brief, however, she contends that the colloquy that occurred between herself, the court, and Ziolkowski after the canvass shows that she did not understand it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Contrary to the respondent's contention, this colloquy shows that the court made every effort to explain the purpose of the canvass to her, including her right to participate and the consequences of the proceeding. The respondent may have been confused as to the purpose of the canvass at first. The court, however, explained that the purpose of the canvass was not to question her attorney's strategic decision to call or not call certain witnesses, or to complain that her attorney did not contact her enough. The purpose of the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass in this case was to ascertain whether, upon being canvassed, the respondent would have conducted the trial differently because, prior to being canvassed, she did not know her rights or the consequences of the proceedings. After the court gave this explanation, the respondent stated that she now understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Even if the respondent remained confused about the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass, she has failed to explain on appeal how she was harmed by the timing of the canvass. She does not allege that if she had understood the canvass, she would have requested a new trial or the evidence reopened, nor has she explained what additional evidence she would have presented that would have made a difference in the outcome of the trial. She also does not allege that if\n   the court had conducted the canvass prior to the start of trial, she would not have testified. Indeed, the court did canvass her, at least partially, on this topic before she testified. Rather, the respondent argues only that the timing of the\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass after the end of trial, but prior to the court deciding the case, amounts to structural error, and, thus, if the canvass is not conducted prior to the start of trial, a new trial always is required. This contention, however, expressly was rejected by this court in\n   <em>\n    In re Leilah W.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On the basis of our review of the trial court's\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   canvass and the ensuing colloquy between the court and the respondent, we conclude that the court reasonably could have concluded that the respondent fully understood the trial process, the rights she had during the trial, and the potential consequences of the termination of her parental rights. Additionally, the respondent has failed to establish that she was harmed by the timing of the canvass. Accordingly, we reject the respondent's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The respondent's remaining claims challenge the merits of the court's judgment terminating her parental rights. Specifically, she claims that the court improperly determined, in the adjudicatory phase, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify her with Elijah and, in the dispositional phase, that termination of her parental rights was in Elijah's best interest. We are not persuaded by either of the respondent's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Prior to reviewing each of the respondent's claims, we set forth the well established legal framework for deciding termination of parental rights petitions. \"[A] hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the trial court must determine whether one or more of the\n   ... grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 [ (j)(3) ] exists by clear and convincing evidence.... If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, then it proceeds to the dispositional phase. During the dispositional phase, the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests of the child.\" (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davonta V.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957853\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/483/#p487\">\n    285 Conn. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=940%20A.2d%20733\">\n    940 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Concerning the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings, the respondent claims that the court improperly found, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify Elijah with her.

On appeal, the respondent challenges the court's finding that she was unable or unwilling to benefit from the department's reunification efforts in two sentences in her appellate brief: \"[The] respondent challenges the finding that [the department] made reasonable efforts to reunify\n   her with her children.

The respondent does not offer any legal support or analysis for her contention that the court's finding that she was unable or unwilling to benefit from the department's reunification efforts is dependent on the court's finding that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify her with Elijah.

In particular, she sets forth three arguments. First, she argues that the department did not make reasonable efforts to reunify her with Elijah. Specifically, she alleges that although she agrees with the court's finding that visits with her caused Elijah distress, his distress was not caused by her but by the\n   environment of the visitation room at the department's facility in which visits took place, and, thus, the department should have provided an alternative environment for their visits. Second, she argues that the court placed too much weight on the wishes of Elijah, who was two years old at the time of trial. Third, she argues that the court's finding that she had not been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with Elijah was clearly erroneous because Elijah's foster family did not prepare him for visits with her, and they did not have recent photographs of her in their home. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Prior to setting forth the facts underlying the respondent's claim, we emphasize that \"[a]lthough [\u00a7 17a-112 (k) ] mandated that the trial court make written findings ... \u00a7 17a-112 contain[s] nothing to indicate that any\n   such finding was a prerequisite to the termination of parental rights.

In its oral memorandum of decision addressing the dispositional phase, the court stated that it \"[had] considered the seven statutory factors [pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (k) ] and made its finding in writing on the Judicial Branch approved form.\" On the Judicial Branch approved form, the court\n   found that (1) \"[the respondent was] offered timely services, including visitation, substance abuse evaluation, and treatment\"; (2) \"[r]easonable efforts were made by [the department]\"; (3) \"[s]pecific steps were issued by the [c]ourt [to the respondent] ... [and the] degree of compliance by [the respondent] is reviewed in the adjudicatory discussion\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) \"[Elijah]\n   knows [the respondent] and has demonstrated affection toward her, but most visits with [the respondent] are a cause of anxiety and distress for Elijah [and he] is closely bonded to his relative foster parents\"; (5) \"Elijah [at the time of trial was] two years old\"; (6) \"[the respondent] has visited with Elijah faithfully, without improving their relationship [and the respondent] has not\n   addressed her mental health needs in a consistent, productive manner\"; (7) \"[n]o ... prevention [to the respondent's maintenance of a meaningful relationship with Elijah] was made.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Although the court did not make any subordinate factual findings regarding what reasonable efforts the department made, on the basis of our review of the record, the court reasonably could have found that the department provided the respondent with referrals to outpatient mental health services, case management, supervised visitation, integrative parenting services, outpatient substance abuse evaluation and random drug testing, referrals and information regarding rent subsidies and public housing programs, and transportation assistance. Additionally, as part of supervised visitation, the department provided the respondent with the opportunity to take Elijah to get a haircut, to play with him at the park, and to attend his doctor's appointments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Visitations at the park ceased after Elijah fell from a piece of playground equipment. Additionally, the department was unwilling to allow at-home visitations. According to Heidi Reinan, a permanency social worker for the department, the department's decision not to allow at-home visitations was influenced heavily by the respondent's continued relationship with Elijah's father. Although the respondent's court-ordered specific steps did not require her to end all contact with Elijah's father, the department and the court had told the respondent on several occasions to end completely all contact with the father because of the threat he posed to her sobriety. The respondent, however, lied to the department regarding whether Elijah's father lived at the respondent's residence for a period of time and that she remained in contact with him. Thus, the department was unwilling to bring Elijah to the respondent's residence on the ground that it could not trust\n   the respondent to keep the father away from both herself and Elijah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition to the services provided by the department, the respondent was afforded weekly telephone calls to the foster family's home so that she could speak with\n   Elijah. A journal also was utilized to convey information between the foster family and the respondent concerning Elijah. The foster family even permitted the respondent to attend Christmas at the foster family's home with Elijah. The foster family, however, did not prepare Elijah in advance for his visits with the respondent to avoid him becoming anxious about the visits, and they did not have any recent photographs of the respondent in their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   After stating that it had considered the seven factors listed in \u00a7 17a-112 (k), the court's oral memorandum of decision further found, in determining Elijah's best interest, that \"Elijah has been becoming increasingly distressed by his exposure to [the respondent]. He is in ... foster care [with relatives]. He is stable there. He is doing well. They are willing to adopt, and Elijah has been placed with them for almost his entire life. He considers his foster mother and his foster father as his psychological parents. He calls his foster mother auntie. He calls his foster father dad. And in terms that have been explained explicitly to [the respondent] to be inappropriate, [she] corrects him every time and says he is not your father, he is your uncle, just causing distress to the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"When the child is visiting with [the respondent], he is routinely asking to return to his foster parents. He looks to them for comfort, for solace. He finds permanency in their home. He finds stability in their home. He is thriving in their home. He does not want to have anything to do with [the respondent]. His best interest\n   as advocated for by his attorney and [guardian ad litem] are termination of parental rights and adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"The court [thus found] by clear and convincing evidence that the department [had] established [termination of parental rights] to be in Elijah's best interest. Therefore, given the totality of the circumstances and the finding of the court as to the adjudicatory issues and the best interest of Elijah, the court [ordered] that the parental rights of [the respondent] to [her] son Elijah G.R. are hereby terminated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Before addressing the respondent's arguments regarding the court's best interest of the child determination, we begin with our standard of review and guiding legal principles. \"During the dispositional phase, the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests of the child.... The best interest determination also must be supported by clear and convincing evidence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that a trial court's factual findings are accorded great deference. Accordingly, an appellate tribunal will not disturb a trial court's finding that termination of parental rights is in a child's best interest unless that finding is clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...

Concerning the court's finding that the department had made reasonable reunification efforts under \u00a7 17a-112 (k)(2), the evidence in the\n   record does not support the respondent's contention that the department did not make reasonable efforts because she and Elijah were confined to a small, windowless room at the department's facility during visitation. Rather, the court reasonably could have found that the department, at least initially, provided diverse environments for visitation: a park, a barber shop, the doctor's office. Subsequent limitations on the nature of the visitations were, in part, reasonable responses to the respondent's actions. For example, although the record is somewhat unclear, the court reasonably could have inferred that the department prohibited additional visitations at the park after Elijah fell from a piece of playground equipment when\n   the respondent was not adequately supervising him. Additionally, the court reasonably could have found that the department's unwillingness to allow at-home visitation was justified by the respondent's continued contact, which she lied about, with Elijah's father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Furthermore, unlike the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings, in which the petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the department made reasonable reunification efforts;\n   <em>\n    In re Oreoluwa O.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485134\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/674/#p532\">\n    321 Conn. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485134\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/674/#p532\">\n    139 A.3d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; in the dispositional phase of the proceedings, whether the department made reasonable reunification efforts is just one of the many factors that the court must consider, and it does not have to be proven by clear and convincing evidence. See\n   <em>\n    In re Nioshka A. N.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%20627\">\n    161 Conn.App. at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20619\">\n    128 A.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the petitioner is not required to prove each of the seven factors by clear and convincing evidence\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Thus, to the extent that the department should have provided alternative visitation environments, this was only one factor out of many that the court weighed in determining the best interest of Elijah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Concerning the court's reliance on the wishes of Elijah, the respondent misapprehends the court's findings. Although the trial court may consider the wishes of the minor child concerning with whom he or she would prefer to live, the court did not do so in this case. Elijah never testified regarding with whom he wished to live, and the court did not make any findings concerning his wishes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The court, however, did rely heavily on Elijah's emotional ties to his foster parents and his lack of emotional ties to the respondent. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (k)(4). In particular, the court relied on evidence showing that Elijah had thrived with the foster family and viewed his foster parents as his psychological parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Additionally, the court relied upon testimony from the foster mother and the department's employees, who testified that Elijah became distressed around the respondent. Although the respondent offers an alternative, plausible explanation for Elijah's distress-that the environment of the visitation room at the department's facility, and not the respondent, distressed him-we will not second guess the court's finding that Elijah had limited emotional ties to the respondent because the court reasonably could have inferred that Elijah's distress was caused by the respondent. See\n   <em>\n    In re Davonta V.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957853\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/483/#p487\">\n    285 Conn. at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=940%20A.2d%20733\">\n    940 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Thus, contrary to the respondent's contention that the court improperly relied upon Elijah's wishes, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (k)(4), the court, in determining Elijah's best interest, properly relied upon evidence showing his strong emotional ties to his foster family and his lack of an emotional tie to the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Concerning the respondent's final argument, the court's finding that the respondent had not been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with Elijah by the unreasonable acts or conduct of any person is supported by the record. Although the foster family arguably may have done more to prepare Elijah for visits with the respondent and may have initiated more personal contact with the respondent, the record reflects that the foster family did not create an impediment to the respondent maintaining a relationship with Elijah. Rather, the record establishes that the foster family made efforts to facilitate communication between the respondent and Elijah-weekly telephone calls, conveying information about Elijah via a journal, and allowing the respondent to attend Christmas at the foster family's home. Additionally, assuming that the\n   foster family's actions did, to some extent, impede the respondent's ability to maintain a relationship with Elijah, the court was entitled to weigh the significance of this impediment in relation to the other factors that it considered, and we will defer to the weight that the trial court afforded each factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Even if we were persuaded by the respondent's arguments, the court's determination that termination of the respondent's parental rights was in Elijah's best interest is supported by the remaining factors set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (k), by Elijah's need for stability and permanency, and by the court's determination that the respondent had failed to reach a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to satisfy the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In addition to finding that Elijah had strong emotional ties to his foster family under \u00a7 17a-112 (k)(4), the court emphasized Elijah's need for stability and permanency, which weighed in favor of finding that termination of the respondent's parental rights was in Elijah's best interest. Furthermore, the court found, under \u00a7 17a-112 (k)(3), that the respondent had failed to comply sufficiently with the court-issued specific steps. The court particularly noted her lack of compliance with the court-ordered counseling, her disengagement with the department's parenting counselors, and her continued relationship with Elijah's father. This finding is not challenged on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This court previously has held that a trial court's determination that termination of parental rights is in the minor child's best interest is not clearly erroneous if \"by clear and convincing evidence ... the [petitioner has] shown that the respondent ... failed to reach a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to satisfy the statute, coupled with the need for permanency in the [child's life]....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Jermaine S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002737\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/86/819/#p836\">\n    86 Conn.App. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=863%20A.2d%20720\">\n    863 A.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5707658,5708971,5708927\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/938/\">\n    273 Conn. 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=875%20A.2d%2043\">\n    875 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The trial court in this case found both that the respondent had failed to reach a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to satisfy the statute and that Elijah found stability and permanence with his foster family. On the basis of these findings, the court's determination that termination of parental rights was in Elijah's best interest is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, it is unclear what weight the court afforded each of the seven factors listed in \u00a7 17a-112 (k). The court, however, determined that the seven statutory factors weighed in favor of termination of the respondent's parental rights. On the basis of the court's oral memorandum of decision, it may be inferred that it weighed heavily Elijah's need for stability and permanency, as well his emotional attachment to his foster parents, with whom he has lived for almost his entire life. Although the trial court's oral memorandum of decision\n   was not a model of clarity or specificity, it considered the seven statutory factors in relation to Elijah's best interest. We will not reweigh these factors, but, rather, we defer to the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the trial court, after weighing the appropriate factors, did not improperly conclude by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the respondent's parental rights was in the best interest of Elijah.

The court also told her that it was the petitioner's burden to prove its claims by clear and convincing evidence and that she was not required to prove anything. The court questioned the respondent regarding whether she had sufficient time to consult with her attorney about her decision to testify. The respondent stated that she was satisfied with her attorney's advice and that she voluntarily had determined to testify. She further agreed that she was aware of the benefits and burden of testifying. The court, however, did not question the respondent specifically about whether she was aware that it could draw an adverse inference against her if she did not testify.
