Taxpayer makes that claim on a number of alternative bases contending that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \u2022 gain from a sale of the partnership interest is \"nonbusiness income\" under Section 401(3)2.(a)(1)(D) of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 (Code),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   not \"business income\" under Section 401(3)2.(a)(1)(A) of the Code;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 the gain must be excluded from its apportionable tax base under the doctrines of multiformity or unrelated assets;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 the gross proceeds from the sale of the partnership interest should be sourced to New York, the state in which it is headquartered, for purposes of calculating the sales factor of its corporate net income tax apportionment fraction, rather than Pennsylvania, where the property from which the sale is derived is located;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 under the tax benefit rule, it is entitled to exclude from business income the gain from the sale because it had previously taken a deduction for which it received no benefit; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 under\n   <em>\n    Nextel Communications of Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v.

During the tax year beginning July 1, 2006, and ending June 30, 2007 (Fiscal Year 2006), Taxpayer was wholly owned by Riverbank Properties, Inc. (Riverbank), and Riverbank was wholly owned by RB Asset, Inc. (RB Asset). Accordingly, during Fiscal Year 2006, Taxpayer was indirectly wholly owned by RB Asset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the beginning of Fiscal Year 2006, Taxpayer was the sole general partner and owned 87.36% of the limited partnership interest of Eastview Associates LP (Partnership). The Partnership was formed as a New Jersey general partnership in 1984, and in 1989, it converted into a New Jersey limited partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Partnership owned an apartment complex in Philadelphia known as Alden Park Apartments (Apartment Complex). Prior to 1995, the Partnership borrowed $40 million from National Westminster Bank USA (National Westminster). In connection with the loan, National Westminster obtained a mortgage securing the loan (the mortgage and loan hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Secured Loan\"). In January 1995, National Westminster merged with and into National Westminster Bank NJ, which subsequently changed its name to NatWest Bank National Association (NatWest). In March 1995, NatWest sold the Secured Loan to Hampton Ponds, a subsidiary of River Bank America. In May 1998, River Bank\n   America completed a reorganization into RB Assets under which RB Assets assumed all River Bank America's assets and liabilities, including River Bank America's interest in the Secured Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the Partnership defaulted on the Secured Loan, Taxpayer acquired its general and limited partnership interest in the Partnership as a result of restructuring to give its lender control of the Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Partnership, Taxpayer's only business activity was operating and controlling the Partnership's operations, including those of the Apartment Complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beginning in 1989 and continuing through Fiscal Year 2006, the Partnership incurred and reported a taxable loss from operations which was passed through pro-rata to Taxpayer. Taxpayer filed federal income tax returns for each tax year from 1989 through Fiscal Year 2006 and reported its share of the Partnership's operational losses. Likewise, Taxpayer filed Pennsylvania corporate tax reports for each tax year from 1989 through Fiscal Year 2006 and reported 100% of its share of the Partnership's operational losses as business income. Taxpayer did not file an income tax return in any state other than Pennsylvania and never apportioned any of its Pennsylvania taxable income or loss for any tax year. Taxpayer was unable to use its share of the Partnership's losses to reduce Pennsylvania taxable income during the tax years prior to Fiscal Year 2006 as neither Taxpayer nor the Partnership generated any Pennsylvania taxable income during those years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Taxpayer's assets during Fiscal Year 2006 consisted of its general and limited partnership interests in the Partnership and certain intercompany receivables owed to it by the Partnership. That year, pursuant to an Assignment, Assumption and Substitution Agreement (Agreement) dated June 27, 2007, Taxpayer sold a 45% limited partnership interest in the Partnership to PCK Capital, Inc. (Buyer). In exchange for the transferred partnership interest, Buyer transferred $5,000 cash to Taxpayer and assumed $29.9 million of the Partnership's nonrecourse liabilities attributable to the transferred partnership interest. Taxpayer retained a 42.36% limited partnership interest and a 1% general partnership interest in the Partnership and continued to operate and control the Partnership and the Apartment Complex as before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In March 2008, Taxpayer filed its 2006 Pennsylvania corporate tax report and 2006 Proforma federal return.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2006 Proforma federal return reflected a federal taxable income of $24.5 million, which includes a $29.9 million gain on the sale of the transferred partnership interest and a $5.4 million loss on its share of the Partnership's operational losses for Fiscal Year 2006. Taxpayer claimed the $29.9 million gain was nonbusiness income and reported an overall taxable loss for Pennsylvania corporate net income tax (CNIT) purposes on the 2006 Pennsylvania corporate tax report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department of Revenue (Department)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   issued a notice of assessment dated October 13, 2009, disallowing Taxpayer's classification of the gain as nonbusiness income and imposing an assessed CNIT in the amount of $2,243,291 for Fiscal Year 2006, plus interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Taxpayer filed an appeal with the Board of Appeals challenging the Department's classification of the gain as business income, asserting that the sale of the partnership interest was nonbusiness income and should not be sourced to Pennsylvania. Specifically, Taxpayer argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The Taxpayer, who is a Delaware Taxpayer, had non-business income from the sale of a partnership interest that was not sourced to Penn [sic]. The capital gain from the sale of the partnership interest is not business income as the income was not income arising from transactions &amp; activity in the regular trade or business nor is it income from tangible or intangible property since the management and disposition of the [P]roperty were not integral to the Taxpayer's trade or business. The capital gain should not be allocated to Pennsylvania. The Taxpayer is not in the business of buying or selling their [sic] partnership interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Board of Appeals Petition at 2.) After a hearing, the Board of Appeals denied Taxpayer's request for classifying the sale of the partnership as nonbusiness income, denied its request to source the sale outside of Pennsylvania and sustained the Department's assessment in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taxpayer appealed to the Board, requesting again nonbusiness income treatment for the gain from the partnership interest sale and the ability to source the sale outside of Pennsylvania and seeking to strike the Department's assessment. The Board denied Taxpayer's request, finding that Taxpayer's interests in the Partnership subjected Taxpayer to CNIT because the Partnership does business in Pennsylvania and the partnership sales gain constituted business income:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Because such income was derived from a transaction in the regular course of [Taxpayer's] business, investing in real estate partnerships and receiving income from them.\n   <em>\n    Welded Tube Co.,\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <sup>\n    6\n   </sup>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   The partnership sales gain constituted business income for [Taxpayer] under the functional test because the acquisition and disposition of the investment partnerships constituted an integral part of [Taxpayer's] regular trade or business, investment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(3) 2.(a)(1)(A).

With regard to Taxpayer's request for exclusion of the partnership\n   sales gains from a sales fraction numerator, the Board reasoned that the request is denied because the gains were apportionable business income and \"sales\" included in the sales apportionment factor are all gross receipts not allocated under the Code other than dividends, government obligation interest and securities sales proceeds. The Board also found that the Partnership assets in which Taxpayer held a direct interest were located in Pennsylvania, and the sale of such assets makes Taxpayer's sales gains Pennsylvania receipts correctly included in a sales numerator. Finally, the Board found there to be no evidence that the sale of the Partnership interest was \"produced by a greater proportion of activity in New York based on costs of performance given the circumstances of this case,\" thereby denying Taxpayer's request to attribute the partnership sales proceeds to New York. (Board's December 15, 2010 decision at 11.)

Taxpayer asserts that it does not meet the functional test because the sale of the Partnership interest was a liquidation of a separate and distinct aspect of its business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Glatfelter II\n   </em>\n   addressed the issue of whether income gained from liquidation of a business constituted an exception to the income being deemed business income and determined that it did not. The taxpayer in that case argued, similarly to Taxpayer in this case, that the sale constituted a partial liquidation of a unique aspect of the taxpayer's business and, thus, was nonbusiness income. The taxpayer relied on\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe\n   </em>\n   and argued that the Supreme Court had \"carv[ed] out an exception from business income for gains derived from the liquidation of a segment of a taxpayer's business\" and had \"arrived at its holding in\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe\n   </em>\n   without finding it necessary to parse the statutory language of the definition of business income.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232755,7310763\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/61/993/\">\n    61 A.3d at 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1994, before the 2001 amendment to the statutory definition of \"business income,\" the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Whether the disposition of the timberland was also an integral part of Appellant's regular business operations, pursuant to this Court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe,\n   </em>\n   is not a matter that we need reach because only the acquisition\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   the management\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   the disposition of the property at issue need be an integral part of the taxpayer's regular business operations under the plain text of the current statute. Accordingly, pursuant to the unambiguous statutory definition, Appellant's gain from the sale of its Delaware timberland constitutes business income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Contrary to Appellant's assertion ... this Court did indeed parse, to the extent necessary, the statutory definition of business income in\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe.\n   </em>\n   As discussed above, the statutory definition applicable in\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe\n   </em>\n   was the pre-2001 version, requiring that \"the acquisition, management,\n   <em>\n    and disposition\n   </em>\n   of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business.\" ... We concluded that the property at issue in\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe\n   </em>\n   was not\n   disposed of as an integral part of the taxpayer's regular trade or business, and having resolved the matter on this basis, there was no need for us to address the acquisition or management of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe,\n   </em>\n   which was decided in 1994, our analysis and our holding were properly grounded in the statutory definition of business income that was in effect at that time, prior to the 2001 amendments.

Rather, we decided\n   <em>\n    Laurel Pipe\n   </em>\n   based upon the prior definition of business income in effect at the time, and we decide the case now before us based upon the revised definition currently in effect.

Moreover, RB Assets, Taxpayer's indirect parent, strategically acquired the lender's rights to the Secured Loan in order for Taxpayer to operate and control on its behalf the Partnership and Apartment Complex.

Taxpayer did not pay any federal income tax on the taxable gain from the sale for the 45% limited Partnership interest because it had federal net operating loss carryovers to offset the gain. Federal net loss carryovers can be used for 20 years after they are incurred and have no limit on the amount that can be deducted.

In\n   <em>\n    Marshall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7313353\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/41/67/#p93\">\n    41 A.3d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a companion case to\n   <em>\n    Wirth,\n   </em>\n   quoting from\n   <em>\n    John Hancock Financial Services v.

Second, there must be a\n   <em>\n    later recovery on the loss.\n   </em>\n   Third, there must be a\n   <em>\n    nexus between the loss and the recovery.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Marshall,\n   </em>\n   we stated that the tax benefit rule cannot be used in a way that abrogates provisions of the IRC and/or the Regulations, or where application of the rule would result in a deduction expressly prohibited by the IRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under the first prong of that test, Taxpayer has the burden to establish that it has attempted to take the deduction from which it received a tax benefit in a prior year. As our Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Wirth:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Dobson\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, as well as Section 111 [of the IRC], all require that the attempted exclusion of realized gain be related to a deduction without tax consequence from a prior year. [Taxpayers] have not pointed to any jurisprudence, regulation, or Department policy that states otherwise. Through all of their protestations regarding the mandatory application of the exclusionary arm of the tax benefit rule, [taxpayers] never address this salient point, nor, more importantly, when they attempted to take the required prior deduction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931960,4253302\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/822/\">\n    95 A.3d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the Stipulation states that Taxpayer attempted to take a tax deduction in a prior year without tax consequences; nor have any tax returns been filed for the prior years. For this reason alone, because Taxpayer has failed to meet its burden, the tax benefit rule cannot be used in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to the second and third prong of the test-requiring that there must be a later recovery on the loss as well as a nexus between the loss and the recovery-these prongs are intertwined. We agree with the Commonwealth that Taxpayer does not meet these two prongs because the deductions it seeks to recoup are operating expenses that cannot be deducted under the tax benefit rule because its losses are in no way related to the capital gain from the sale of the Partnership interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Commonwealth also contends that the application of the tax benefit rule does not apply to this case because to do so would be in conflict with the United States Department of Treasury Regulations (Treasury Regulations) Section 1.111-1(a) that disallows depreciation as an expense under the tax benefit rule. The regulation provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The rule of exclusion so prescribed by statute applies equally with respect to all other losses, expenditures and accruals made the basis of deductions from gross income for prior taxable years ... but not including deductions with respect to\n   <strong>\n    depreciation,\n   </strong>\n   depletion, amortization, or amortizable bond premiums.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.111-1\">\n    26 CFR \u00a7 1.111-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In response, Taxpayer first argues that the Commonwealth's assumption that the losses it seeks to exclude were for depreciation is erroneous because the losses were created by the deduction of a number of expenses incurred in the operation of a rental property, including advertising, insurance, interest, wages and salaries and real estate taxes. Depreciation accounted for only a portion of the deductions that created the losses at issue. Unfortunately, Taxpayer does not give us a breakdown of those expenses and neither the Stipulation nor the tax returns set forth how the losses were incurred. We do note, though, that the gain on the federal tax return was characterized as a capital gain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   More substantively, while acknowledging that it does permit depreciation from being excluded from income under the tax benefit rule, Taxpayer contends that Section 1.111-1(a) of the Treasury Regulations goes beyond the language of Section 111 of the IRC as a result of a 1984 amendment to IRC Section 111(a) that removed any reference to debts, prior taxes and delinquency as the only type of items that were subject to the tax benefit rule. IRC Section 111(a) was broadened to address\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   recovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Gross income does not include amounts attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any amount deducted in any prior taxable year to the extent such amount did not reduce the amount of tax imposed by this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20111\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As a result, Taxpayer claims that given the amendment, there are now no limitations on the type of deductions that can be excluded from income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   However, as far as we can discern, this regulation has not been challenged and, after the amendment in\n   <em>\n    American Mutual Life Company v.

If we had found that the tax benefit rule was applicable, we would have ordered a hearing to take evidence on what portion of the deduction was attributable to depreciation; but that is not necessary for the reason set forth, as well as the fact that it is in conflict with the Code provisions regarding the CNIT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In this case, only tax year 2006 is at issue and Section 401(3)4.

Taxpayer's contention that the tax benefit rule should apply because it would otherwise forego the deductions above the $2 million limitation in effect would remove all caps on the net loss carryover, a direct contravention of the above-cited provisions\n   of the Code.

Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 1, because it favors smaller taxpayers in positive net loss carryover positions over similarly-situated larger taxpayers, and imposes disparate tax burdens on taxpayers based solely on the amount of income earned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Commonwealth acknowledges that this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Nextel\n   </em>\n   that the Pennsylvania net loss carryover deduction violates the Uniformity Clause. However it asserts that the decision was limited in application to the Commonwealth, the taxpayer in\n   <em>\n    Nextel\n   </em>\n   and the 2007 tax year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commonwealth further contends that unlike the taxpayer in\n   <em>\n    Nextel,\n   </em>\n   the Taxpayer here did not establish that the net operating loss deduction was unconstitutional as applied to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Indeed, we held in\n   <em>\n    Nextel\n   </em>\n   that based on Section 401(3)4. (c)(1)(A)(II) of the Code, the net loss carryover deduction provision that allows a net loss deduction that is the greater of the flat percentage of net losses or of a flat capped amount violates the Uniformity Clause. We also, as the Commonwealth states, limited the aforementioned holding to the parties in\n   <em>\n    Nextel\n   </em>\n   and the 2007 tax year. However, that does not preclude us from performing the same analysis as we did in\n   <em>\n    Nextel\n   </em>\n   in determining whether the net loss carryover\n   deduction, insofar as it applies to Taxpayer, also violates the Uniformity Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Uniformity Clause states: \"All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax....\" Pa. Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 1. Additionally:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   [a]lthough the Uniformity Clause does not require absolute equality and perfect uniformity in taxation, the legislature cannot treat similarly-situated taxpayers differently. Where the validity of a tax classification is challenged, \"the test is whether the classification is based upon some legitimate distinction between the classes that provides a non-arbitrary and 'reasonable and just' basis for the difference in treatment.\" In other words, \"[w]hen there exists no legitimate distinction between the classes, and, thus, the tax scheme imposes substantially unequal tax burdens upon persons otherwise similarly situated, the tax is unconstitutional.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Nextel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6765179\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/1/6765179/\">\n    129 A.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For Fiscal Year 2006, Section 401(3)4.(c)(1)(A)(I) of the Code limited the amount of the net loss carryover deduction to the lesser of $2 million or the actual amount of the net loss carryovers available for carryover to the tax year. Based on the parties' stipulated facts, in its 2006 Pennsylvania report, Taxpayer reported $43,706,696 of accumulated net loss carryovers. The losses were generated by the unused operational losses passed through to it from the Partnership in the tax years prior to Fiscal Year 2006. Of the $43,706,696 accumulated net loss carryovers, pursuant to Section 401(3)4.(c)(2), $38,969,295 were available for carryover to Fiscal Year 2006. However, per Section 401(3)4.(c)(1)(A)(I) of the Code, Taxpayer was limited to a $2 million deduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The stipulated facts show that the net loss carryover provision creates classes of taxpayers based on their taxable income. For Fiscal Year 2006, the net loss carryover provision can and likely did allow some taxpayers to reduce their taxable income to $0 and not have to pay any CNIT. However, that provision can also prevent other taxpayers, as in this case, from reducing their taxable income to $0 and cause these taxpayers to pay CNIT. For Fiscal Year 2006, where both classes of taxpayers entered the 2006 tax year in a positive net operating loss carryover position, the only distinguishing factor between the two classes of taxpayers is the amount of taxable income that year. Those with $2 million or less in taxable income for Fiscal Year 2006 could offset up to 100% of the taxable income as the statute allows a $2 million deduction. However, taxpayers with more than $2 million in income for Fiscal Year 2006 could only offset $2 million and pay CNIT on the remaining income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In holding the cap on the net loss carryover unconstitutional, we reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   To the extent the General Assembly exercises its power to tax property, it cannot set a valuation threshold that, in effect, exempts some property owners from the tax entirely.... Here, the General Assembly has elected to tax property-i.e., corporate net income. It has also allowed taxpayers to deduct from their taxable income carryover net losses from prior years. By capping that deduction at the greater of $3 million or 12.5% of taxable income, however, the General Assembly has favored taxpayers whose property (i.e., taxable income) is valued at $3 million or less. To the extent these taxpayers are in a positive net loss carryover position, they pay no corporate net income tax-i.e., they have no tax burden. A similarly-situated taxpayer with more than $3 million\n   in taxable income, however, cannot avoid paying tax under the [net loss carryover] deduction provision. The distinction is based solely on asset value, which is, under\n   <em>\n    Cope's Estate,\n   </em>\n   \"unjust, arbitrary, and illegal.\" Moreover, the fact that the [net loss carryover] deduction provision enabled 98.8% of taxpayers in a positive net loss carryover position to avoid paying any tax in 2007, leaving 1.2% of similarly-situated taxpayers to pay some tax, \"illustrates the injustice and inequality that must result from such special legislation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Nextel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6765179\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/1/6765179/\">\n    129 A.3d at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and footnote omitted).
