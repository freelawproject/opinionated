E., was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a)(2) and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2001)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). The victim, his daughter, was between six and nine years old at the time of the assaults. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twenty-five years incarceration followed by twenty years of special parole. On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the use of constancy of accusation evidence and that the constancy of accusation doctrine, particularly in child sexual abuse cases, should be abandoned or modified because of increased public awareness regarding the reasons why children delay in reporting sexual abuse. The defendant further claims that the testimony of multiple constancy witnesses is unnecessary and prejudicial, and that other ways exist of ensuring fairness to the victim. The state responds that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the use of constancy evidence and that the defendant has failed to offer any cogent rationale for modifying or abandoning the doctrine. We conclude that the trial court's jury instruction was proper but that the constancy of accusation doctrine should be modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The victim was born in March, 1996. In 2001, after her parents separated, the victim was living with her mother and two brothers in the town of Plainfield, and the defendant was living with his parents in the town of Brooklyn. From the time she was six years old, the victim and her brothers visited the defendant every other weekend. During each visit, the defendant sexually assaulted the victim at least once for the next three years. The assaults usually occurred in the bedroom or during bath time, when the defendant and the victim were alone. On one occasion, when the victim's\n   younger brother awoke from a nap in the children's bedroom and asked why the defendant was lying on top of the victim, the defendant responded, \"[t]his is our thing.\" The visits and the assaults ceased when the victim was nine years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim did not remember the assaults as painful and did not tell her mother, her grandparents or her pediatrician about them because she did not know they were wrong. She simply thought the defendant was doing \"what fathers and daughters did.\" Although she repeatedly asked the defendant to stop, he continued the abuse. The victim's only complaint to her mother about the visits was the presence of cigarette smoke inside the house, which made her feel sick. Both of the victim's older stepsisters, M and D, also were sexually abused by the defendant when they were very young, but the victim was unaware of this when she was being abused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2007, after D told the victim that she had been sexually abused in the past, the victim confided in D that she had been sexually assaulted by the defendant over an extended period of time, and then started crying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   D responded that the victim should tell her mother or report the abuse to the police, but the victim did not do so. Two years later, in October, 2009, the victim also told a former boyfriend, S, during a telephone conversation that she had been sexually abused by the defendant multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October, 2009, after the victim finally told her mother, she reported the abuse to the police. The report was triggered by an incident involving the victim and the defendant at a restaurant. The victim had arranged\n   to meet the defendant at the restaurant, even though she was not permitted to contact him at that time and had\n   not obtained her mother's permission or informed her about the arrangement. Upon initially meeting and hugging the defendant, the victim noticed the defendant had an erection. This caused her to have flashbacks regarding her past abuse by the defendant and prompted her to tell the police. She also told the police she had had a brief sexual relationship with her then boyfriend, B, a few months earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The state arrested the defendant and charged him with two counts of sexual assault in the first degree and one count of risk of injury to a child. The defendant elected to be tried by a jury. In a pretrial motion in limine, the defendant requested, among other things, that the trial court (1) give a limiting instruction regarding any properly admitted constancy of accusation evidence, (2) exclude all constancy evidence, including any direct or indirect reference thereto, until after the victim testified, (3) preclude constancy evidence derived from reports after the victim's official complaint to the police or the Department of Children and Families, (4) limit \" 'corroborative' \" evidence to the fact and timing of the victim's complaint, when, where, and to whom the complaint was made, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator, and (5) exclude cumulative constancy evidence to the extent its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect and the jury was likely to treat the evidence as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt. The defendant also urged the trial court to instruct the jury that any delay by a victim in reporting a complaint of sexual abuse to a friend or relative affects the weight to be given such evidence and should be considered by the jury. The defendant argued in part that, although the constancy of accusation doctrine has a long history in Connecticut, its continued relevance requires reconsideration because its\n   underlying rationale has been increasingly questioned in recent years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following a hearing, during which counsel for both parties failed to engage in any substantive argument,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court granted the motion in limine insofar as it sought to limit constancy evidence to statements made prior to the victim's official report of abuse and to preclude such evidence considered potentially redundant or cumulative. The court emphasized that it would not exclude any evidence at that time but that defense counsel could object if he believed the assistant state's attorney (prosecutor) was not exercising reasonable restraint. Thereafter, in its preliminary instructions to the jury, the trial court included a general instruction that certain evidence admitted at trial was to be considered only for a limited purpose and that the court would identify this evidence at the time of its admission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, defense counsel did not object when the victim testified that she had never told anyone about the abuse until several years later. When the prosecutor called\n   S as the first constancy witness, however, defense counsel objected to his testimony on hearsay grounds. After the court overruled the objection, S testified that the victim told him during a telephone conversation in 2009 that the defendant had molested her \"multiple times\" when she was five or six years old.\n   He also testified that, two days later, he urged the victim in another telephone conversation to tell her mother about the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   D, the second constancy witness, testified without objection that the victim told her she had been sexually abused by the defendant over a long period of time, and then started crying. The victim's mother also testified without objection that the victim did not tell her about the abuse until 2009 or 2010, even though the mother had explained \"good touch-bad touch\" to the victim when the victim was younger and that no healthcare provider had noted the presence of injuries during regular pediatric checkups from 2001 to 2004 that might have been caused by sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Erica Kesselman, a physician who examined the victim in December, 2009, after the victim reported the abuse to the police, testified that, although she observed injuries to the victim that could have been caused by the victim's consensual sexual relationship with B during the summer of 2009, the injuries also were consistent with the victim's reported history of sexual abuse and with medical findings concerning girls who have been forcibly penetrated before reaching puberty. Kesselman further testified that the fact that the victim had been sexually active for a brief time prior to reporting the abuse to the police did not affect her conclusions because the victim's injuries were more common in abuse cases than in cases in which there has been consensual intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Theresa Montelli then testified for the state as an expert witness regarding the characteristics of sexually abused children. She explained that there is often a delay in reporting abuse due to factors such as the family relationship between the child and the abuser, the abuser's telling the child to keep the abuse a secret, the child's loyalty to the abuser, the child's difficulty\n   in talking about the abuse, threats or coercion by the abuser, and the child's feelings of fear, shame and self-blame. Montelli also testified that children sometimes fail to realize that what is happening to them is wrong, and they only become aware of this at some later time, such as in a health class at school. She added that disclosure by many children may involve a process in which they begin by revealing to a friend only a little about what happened and gradually provide more detailed information during an investigation or therapy as their comfort level and sense of safety increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the close of the evidence, the trial court gave the parties its proposed jury instructions and requested that counsel review them in preparation for the next day's charging conference. Before the conference, however, defense counsel also submitted his own request to charge, which included a proposed instruction on constancy testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the trial\n   court rejected counsel's proposed instruction during an in-chambers\n   charging conference, counsel requested that the court use Connecticut's standard criminal jury instruction\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because of differences\n   in \"semantics, language [and] placing of the paragraphs\" that rendered the standard instruction purportedly less prejudicial than the trial court's proposed instruction. Counsel specifically argued that there were \"subtle\" differences between language in the trial court's instruction and language in the standard instruction pertaining to what was to be corroborated by the constancy testimony. He explained his concern that such testimony might be construed by the jury as corroborating the substance of the victim's complaint to the witnesses rather than the fact that the victim had complained, and that the court's proposed instruction did not make this distinction clear. He conceded that the standard instruction and the court's proposed instruction were \"pretty much the same,\" but, \"looking at the gestalt of these two instructions, it's the subject[ive] feeling of ... defense counsel that,\n   because of the placement of [the] language ... [the standard instruction is] a little bit less prejudicial....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court responded that any \"nuance\" to which counsel had referred was \"so subtle that [the court was] not inclined in the gestalt of the case overall to believe that it's going to be determinative.\" The court thus declined to revisit its earlier decision and rejected counsel's request to use the standard criminal jury instruction. Shortly thereafter, when defense counsel noted for the record that he had made a general objection to the constancy charge, the trial court summarized: \"As to the constancy of accusation charge, which we've just discussed briefly, we discussed it in greater length in chambers, [and] I determined that I would use the language I had originally drafted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The prosecutor did not refer to the constancy testimony during his closing argument. Defense counsel, however, challenged the victim's credibility on the ground that she had not reported the abuse to anyone during the three years when the abuse allegedly was occurring and because she had shown no outward manifestations of physical abuse during that time. Counsel specifically noted that S \"wasn't here to testify as to whether or not it happened [because] he couldn't say, just that sometime in October of [2009], while they were dating, she supposedly made this disclosure to him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The prosecutor argued in rebuttal that the victim's testimony, if credited, was sufficient to prove that the defendant was guilty and thus need not be corroborated. He then argued: \"However, I would submit\n   that the state did corroborate her testimony. You heard from [S], who's known her since he was seven [years old]. [She] told [him] in 2009, 'my father raped me multiple times.' That was his testimony. Also, [D]. She's known [the victim] for ten years, [and] considers her her sister.\n   What ... did [the victim] say to [D]? 'My dad raped me.' And I cried-or she then cried and then ... told [D] it happened often and for a long time. Think about how those two statements are consistent with each other and with what [the victim] told you.\" The prosecutor also referred to the fact that the victim's mother, D, S, and Kesselman all testified that the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court then excused the jury, and defense counsel objected to several portions of the prosecutor's closing argument, including his contention during rebuttal argument that the victim's testimony was corroborated by the constancy evidence. The trial court responded that defense counsel's observation was \"correct\" and that it would clarify in its jury instructions how the constancy evidence should be used. The court specifically stated that its \"plan [was] to let the jury know that the import of [the constancy] testimony [was] that [the victim] made these statements. It [did] not mean that the statements [were] necessarily true. They [were] simply statements made, and ... the jury [could] consider those in its calculation of all the credibility issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court subsequently gave the following instruction to the jury: \"I mentioned to you in my opening remarks that sometimes evidence is admitted for a limited purpose. And I have admitted some evidence in this case with that limitation, and you must consider that evidence only as it relates to the limits for which it was allowed and not consider such testimony and evidence in finding any other facts as to any other issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"First in that category is what we call constancy of accusation evidence. You will recall that the state offered evidence of out-of-court statements which [the victim] made to other persons that the defendant sexually assaulted her. Specifically, you may recall that [S] and [D] testified as to the statements that she made to each of them regarding the defendant sexually assaulting her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Ordinarily, as you may know, statements that are made out of court are not admissible. Under our law, this type of testimony is an exception only permitted in cases alleging a sexual assault and only admitted for the limited purpose of corroborating what the complaining witness, [the victim], has testified to in court with respect only to the fact and timing of her complaint, the time and place of the alleged sexual assaults, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"First of all, you may determine that the testimony of these witnesses was not itself credible. If you find their testimony credible as to what [the victim] told them, however, you may only thereupon find that these statements corroborate or support her own testimony. In other words, they are a factor in your determination as to what weight and credibility you will give to [the victim's] testimony as it pertains to the charges of sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"If you find that she has been inconsistent, you may consider the degree of inconsistency,\n   and you may also consider the reasons which you find for this inconsistency as you evaluate her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The victim's] delay in reporting the alleged incidents is also something you may consider in assessing her credibility. You may discuss that delay, as well as any reasons which you may find for such delay in evaluating her testimony given in court. You may not deem this evidence of out-of-court statements by the [victim]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   that [the defendant] perpetrated a sexual assault against her as proof of the truth of what those out-of-court statements asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"In determining whether or not these out-of-court statements corroborate [the victim's] testimony in court, you should consider all of the circumstances under which they were made and to whom, and ... whether the statements made to those persons were or were not consistent with [the victim's] testimony here in court.\" Defense counsel did not object to this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Prior to sentencing, the defendant moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. In his motion, the defendant claimed, among other things, that \"the jury was at least confused by the [court's constancy] instruction.... [T]he instruction was reasonably understood by the jury to mean that the constancy evidence in fact corroborated the [victim's] testimony, and the jury could not reasonably distinguish between the corroboration language in the charge to the jury and the instruction that that constancy evidence could not be used as substantive evidence that the defendant [sexually assaulted] the [victim].\" At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel likewise argued that the trial court's use of the word \"corroboration\" in its instruction had sent the wrong message to the jury, as had the prosecutor's use of the word \"corroboration\" during closing argument. Counsel contended that the purpose of constancy testimony is to corroborate that \"the complaining witness has made a complaint and the timing of that complaint, and very little more than that,\" but that the commonly understood meaning of the word \"corroborate\" is to confirm the substance of what someone else has said, which is how the word was used in the jury charge and in the prosecutor's closing argument. The prosecutor responded that \"the court and the state acted within the established limits of the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court denied the motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. With respect to the jury instruction, the court first observed that Connecticut precedent requires that constancy evidence be limited to the details necessary to associate the victim's complaint with the pending charge, including the time and place of the attack and the identity of the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    State v. Troupe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200303\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/284/#p304\">\n    237 Conn. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). The court then concluded that S's testimony that the victim told him the defendant had sexually assaulted her multiple times when she was five or six years old and D's testimony that the victim told her the defendant had sexually assaulted her did not run afoul of our precedent and that the jury charge concerning this evidence was proper. With respect to the prosecutor's closing argument, the trial court disagreed that the prosecutor's references to the corroborating evidence constituted prosecutorial impropriety because they \"were sparse and were a marshaling of the evidence that was before the jury,\" and the standard for prosecutorial behavior requires more egregious conduct than the prosecutor's conduct in this case. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury and that this court should abandon or modify the constancy of accusation doctrine, especially\n   in child sexual abuse cases. We consider each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the correct use of constancy of accusation evidence, which is admitted under\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   only to prove that a complaint was made, not to prove that the complaint was true. The defendant specifically claims that the jury instructions were improper in light of the preexisting susceptibility of jurors to disregard the subtle distinction between constancy evidence and substantive proof, the court's use of dense legal language from an appellate decision, and\n   the trial court's failure to define the word \"corroborate.\" The state responds that it is not reasonably probable that the trial court's instructions misled the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the state that the court's instructions accurately portrayed the law and did not mislead the jury.\n   \"Our review of [a jury instruction] claim requires that we examine the [trial] court's entire charge to determine whether it is reasonably [probable] that the jury could have been misled.... While a request to charge that is relevant to the\n   issues in a case and that accurately states the applicable law must be honored, a [trial] court need not tailor its charge to the precise letter of such a request.... If a requested charge is in substance given, the [trial] court's failure to give a charge in exact conformance with the words of the request will not constitute a ground for reversal.... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper.... Additionally, we have noted that [a]n [impropriety] in instructions in a criminal case is reversible ... when it is shown that it is reasonably possible for [improprieties] of constitutional dimension or reasonably probable for nonconstitutional [improprieties] that the jury [was] misled.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In all other respects, our current rules remain in effect. Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim's testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported. In determining whether to permit such testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Any testimony by the witness about details of the assault shall be limited to those details necessary to associate the victim's allegations with the pending charge. The testimony of the witness is admissible only to corroborate the victim's testimony and not for substantive purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 6-11(c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, in turn, are the basis for standard criminal jury instruction 7.2-1; see footnote 6 of this opinion; which the defense urged the trial court\n   to give to the jury following the court's rejection of its original request to charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the present case, even considering the state's improper suggestion during rebuttal argument that the constancy of accusation evidence supported the substance\n   of the victim's claim, we conclude it is not reasonably probable that the trial court's limiting instruction on constancy evidence misled the jury. The court closely followed the language of\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   and the Connecticut Code of Evidence when instructing that the victim's out-of-court statements to S and D that the defendant had sexually assaulted her were admissible only \"for the limited purpose of corroborating what the [victim] ... has testified to in court with respect only to the fact and timing of her complaint, the time and place of the alleged sexual assaults, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator.\" The court also instructed that the testimony of the constancy witnesses, if found credible by the jury, could be used to \"corroborate or support [the victim's] own testimony. In other words, they are a factor in your determination as to what weight and credibility you will give to [the victim's] testimony as it pertains to the charges of sexual assault.\" The court subsequently added that \"[the victim's] delay in reporting the alleged incidents is also something you may consider in assessing her credibility. You may discuss that delay, as well as any reason which you may find for such delay in evaluating her testimony given in court. You may not deem this evidence of out-of-court statements by the [victim] that [the defendant] perpetrated a sexual assault against her as proof of the truth of what those out-of-court statements asserted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is clear from these instructions that the jury was permitted to use the constancy testimony\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to corroborate the fact and timing of the victim's out-of-court statements to the two constancy witnesses, as well as any other information necessary to associate the victim's\n   out-of-court statements with the pending charge. The instructions also made clear that, although the jury was permitted to consider the constancy evidence in evaluating the weight and credibility of the victim's testimony, including the reasons for her delay in reporting the abuse to the police, the evidence could not be used as proof of the substance or truthfulness of the statements themselves. \"The jury is presumed, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, to have followed the court's instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Parris,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523906\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/283/#p294\">\n    219 Conn. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20A.2d%20943\">\n    592 A.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly instructed the jury regarding the limited purpose for which the constancy evidence could be considered, thus minimizing the risk of undue prejudice to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We reject the defendant's contentions that the jury instructions failed to distinguish between constancy evidence and substantive proof, incorporated too much \"dense legal language\" and failed to convey the meaning of the word \"corroborate.\" Even if we presume that juries are susceptible to confusion regarding how to use constancy evidence, the defendant has not identified any legal language in the trial court's instruction that was not contained in the instruction defense counsel suggested in his own request to charge or in the standard criminal jury instruction he subsequently asked the court to adopt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, with respect to the distinction between constancy evidence and substantive proof, we reiterate that the trial court expressly cautioned the jury to use the constancy testimony \"for the limited purpose of corroborating what the [victim] ... has testified to in court with respect only to the fact and timing of her complaint, the time and place of the alleged sexual assaults, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator.\" Shortly thereafter, the court added: \"You may not deem this evidence of out-of-court statements by the [victim] that [the\n   defendant] perpetrated a sexual assault against her as proof of\n   the truth of what those out-of-court statements asserted.\" In our view, this instruction was sufficient to distinguish between constancy evidence and substantive proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the defendant's argument that the instruction contained too much \"dense legal language\" is directly contradicted by defense counsel's admission following the charging conference that there were only \"subtle\" differences between the court's proposed instruction and the standard criminal jury instruction. Counsel further conceded at trial that the two instructions were \"pretty much the same\" and that, \"looking at the gestalt of these two instructions,\n   <em>\n    it's the subject[ive] feeling of\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    defense counsel\n   </em>\n   that, because of the placement of [the] language ... [the standard criminal jury instruction is]\n   <em>\n    a little bit less prejudicial\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the precise \"legal\" language identified by the defendant as particularly confusing is nearly identical to corresponding language in defense counsel's requested charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the trial\n   court's charge did not differ substantively from the defendant's requested charge. Finally, the defendant's contention that New Jersey's model instruction on fresh complaint evidence does a \"much better job\" of explaining the limited purpose of constancy evidence in terms jurors can readily understand is irrelevant. See generally\n   <em>\n    State v. Hill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1367146\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/121/150/\">\n    121 N.J. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1367146\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/121/150/\">\n    578 A.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Although we agree with the defendant that New Jersey's model instruction is more detailed than the trial\n   court's instruction in the present case; see Criminal Model Jury Charges-New Jersey Courts: Fresh Complaint (revised February 5, 2007), available at http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/criminal/charges/non2c011.pdf (last visited August 1, 2016); the defense did not ask the court to adopt the New Jersey instruction, and, even if it had, the trial court's instruction properly explained the manner in which the jury could use the constancy evidence under existing Connecticut law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, neither the Connecticut standard criminal jury instruction nor our precedent suggests or requires that trial courts define the word \"corroborate\" in an instruction\n   on constancy of accusation evidence, and defense counsel never suggested to the court at any point in the proceedings that the word should be defined. The court used the word in the same way it is used in the standard criminal jury instruction, the Connecticut Code of Evidence and, even more significantly, in the defendant's requested instruction. See footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court's instruction in the present case did not mislead the jury or cause the defendant undue prejudice. We suggest, however, that, to ensure clarity in future cases in which constancy evidence is admitted, \u00a7 6-11(c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence and the standard criminal jury instruction on constancy of accusation evidence should be modified to conform more closely to the language used in New Jersey's model instruction on fresh complaint evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The New Jersey instruction explains that evidence of a sexual assault victim's complaint to other persons is admissible only for the purpose of negating any inference that, because there was a delay in reporting the offense, the offense did not occur, and, therefore, such evidence may be used only in considering whether the complaint was made, and not to corroborate the substance of the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendant next claims that the constancy of accusation doctrine is no longer relevant in Connecticut due to changed societal views regarding sexual assault and its effect on victims, and, as a consequence, the doctrine\n   should be abandoned or modified, especially in child sexual abuse cases. He specifically contends that, in the current climate of increased public awareness and understanding of child sexual abuse, the \"piling on\" of multiple constancy witnesses is unnecessary and overly prejudicial to defendants, and that there are other ways of ensuring fairness to the victim and introducing probative evidence. In the alternative, the defendant suggests that, if the doctrine is not abandoned, it should be limited to a victim's first complaint or to the testimony of the complainant. The state responds that there are no cogent reasons to abandon or modify the doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is certainly possible that, because of increased public awareness of the reasons for delayed reporting, many jurors may no longer harbor biases against victims who do not make timely reports that they have been sexually abused. We nonetheless agree with the state that there is no well developed body of scientific research suggesting that these long-standing biases have been entirely eliminated. We thus conclude that the constancy of accusation doctrine should continue to be employed in Connecticut to counter implicit juror bias against victims, including children, who delay in reporting sexual abuse, but in a modified form intended to address the potential prejudice to defendants caused by the testimony of multiple constancy witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We begin with a brief review of the history and purpose of the constancy of accusation doctrine in Connecticut.

We observed that, \"[b]ecause\n   juries were\n   allowed-sometimes even instructed-to draw negative inferences from the woman's failure to complain after an assault ... the doctrine of fresh complaint evolved as a means of counterbalancing these negative inferences. Used in this way, the fresh complaint doctrine allowed the prosecutor to introduce, during the case-in-chief, evidence that the victim had complained soon after the [sexual assault]. Its use thereby forestalled the inference that the victim's silence was inconsistent with her present formal complaint of [assault].... In other words, evidence admitted under this doctrine effectively served as anticipatory rebuttal, in that the doctrine often permitted the prosecutor to bolster the credibility of the victim before her credibility had first been attacked....

As the court noted in\n   <em>\n    King,\n   </em>\n   the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule allows only for the admission of statements made during or shortly after the commission of the assault, and prior consistent statements are allowed only to rebut charges of recent fabrication.

Connecticut's \"tender years\" hearsay exception is also of limited application, as it pertains only to certain statements made by victims under thirteen years of age regarding physical abuse by a person who has authority or apparent authority over the child, such as a parent, or regarding sexual abuse. Conn.Code Evid. \u00a7 8-10 (effective January 1, 2011), in 72 Conn. L.J., No. 2, pp. 237C through 238C (July 13, 2010).

Thereafter, if defense counsel challenges the victim's credibility by inquiring, for example, on cross-examination as to any out-of-court complaints or delayed reporting, the state will be permitted to call constancy of accusation witnesses subject to the limitations established in\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   as modified in this opinion. If defense counsel does not challenge the victim's credibility in any fashion on these points, the trial court shall not permit the state to introduce constancy testimony but, rather, shall instruct the jury that there are many reasons why sexual assault victims may delay in officially reporting the offense, and, to the extent the victim delayed in reporting the offense, the delay should not be considered by the jury in evaluating the victim's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We believe this modification of our present doctrine achieves a proper balance between the interests of the state and the defendant. The state will retain the ability to introduce testimony by the victim regarding out-of-court complaints to other persons and the victim's reasons for the delayed reporting. In addition, the state will be free to introduce expert testimony regarding the traumatic effect of sexual assaults on victims generally and why sexual assault victims often fail to promptly report the offense. The state also will benefit from the trial court's instruction that the jury is not allowed to consider a delay by the victim in reporting the offense. Defendants will likewise benefit because they no longer will be required to defend against testimony by constancy witnesses unless they choose to challenge the victim's testimony regarding any out-of-court complaints or delayed reporting. In such cases, we believe that trial courts, in the exercise of their discretion, will be able to properly balance the probative value of the constancy testimony against its prejudicial effect.

These modifications, like the rule articulated in\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   will apply to both adult and child victims of sexual assault. In keeping with our precedent, however, they will apply only prospectively to cases in which the evidentiary portion of the trial has not commenced as of the date of the release of this decision. Finally, because our decision is based solely on policy considerations; see id.; there is no reason to order a new trial when the testimony at issue, as in the present case, has been properly admitted under our former articulation of\n   the doctrine.

Thereafter, defense counsel did not object to the trial court's instruction directly after it was given. Rather, the defense waited until two months later at the sentencing hearing in a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, in which the defendant argued that \"the jury was at least confused by the instruction.\" At that time, the defendant contended that the instruction reasonably could be understood as allowing the jury to use the constancy evidence to corroborate the substance of the victim's testimony. He also contended that the court's use of the word \"corroboration\" in its instruction was unclear and sent the wrong message to the jury. Thus, although the defendant's argument in support of his posttrial motion was more specific than defense counsel's previous objection to the trial court's proposed instruction following the charging conference, defense counsel's prior argument sufficiently preserved the defendant's jury instruction claim on appeal because that claim makes exactly the same underlying point, namely, that the instruction did not clearly convey to the jury that the constancy of accusation evidence could not be used to corroborate the truth or substance of the victim's complaint.

Under such generally applicable evidentiary rules, the timing of a complaint (e.g., whether it was made promptly after the incident or, rather, at a later date) and the circumstances under which it was made (e.g., whether it was volunteered spontaneously or, instead, was made only in response to the inquiry of another person) are not necessarily determinative of the admissibility of evidence of the complaint.

I do not agree, however, with part II of the majority opinion, in which the majority sets forth its modification of the constancy of accusation doctrine. Under the majority's rule, although a victim is allowed to testify in a sexual assault case on direct examination that he or she told third parties-the constancy witnesses-about such an assault prior to officially reporting the assault, the testimony of the constancy witnesses, corroborating the victim's testimony that the victim made a complaint to them prior to the official report of the assault, would be admissible under the constancy of accusation doctrine only if the defendant impeaches the victim on the basis of any delay in reporting. This court's last major modification of the doctrine was in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because there is no evidence that the modification that this court made to the doctrine in\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   has proven insufficient to protect defendants, I disagree that the doctrine needs further modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Preliminarily, I note my agreement with the majority and \"the\n   <em>\n    overwhelming majority of other jurisdictions\n   </em>\n   that the generally applicable rules of evidence are insufficient to remedy potential juror bias against victims who delay in reporting a sexual assault.\" (Emphasis added.) Given that starting point, it is significant that the majority concludes, correctly, I believe, that the trial court in the present case properly instructed the jury on the use of constancy of accusation evidence because those instructions \"accurately portrayed the law and did not mislead the jury\" or \"cause the defendant undue prejudice.\" Finally, I agree with the majority's identification of the competing interests of victims and defendants, interests that this court balanced appropriately when it modified the constancy of accusation doctrine in\n   <em>\n    State v.

That is, victims of sexual assault have an interest in the remedy provided by the constancy of accusation doctrine, which allows for the introduction of evidence for the limited purpose of offsetting the unwarranted negative inference drawn by jurors from a victim's delay in reporting the assault to authorities. As the majority observes, defendants have an interest in being protected against the \"potential prejudice ... caused by the testimony of\n   <em>\n    multiple\n   </em>\n   constancy witnesses.\" (Emphasis added.)

At the time, Connecticut's constancy of accusation doctrine allowed the repetition of the details of the complaint by the constancy witnesses, which was the aspect of the Connecticut rule that was out of line with the majority of jurisdictions.

Id., at 303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A more reasonable accommodation of the interests of victims and defendants, the court reasoned, was to restrict constancy evidence to the fact and timing of the victim's complaint, with only the details necessary to associate the victim's complaint\n   with the pending charge. Id., at 304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With the modification of the doctrine in\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   the court brought Connecticut in line with the majority of jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   By contrast, in today's decision, the majority does not mention stare decisis or offer any explanation as to why the constancy rule, as modified by\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   \" 'needs modification to serve justice better.' \" Id., at 303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the majority's rule now sets Connecticut apart from the majority of jurisdictions, which-as observed by this court in\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   -recognize the continued need for constancy of accusation testimony. Id., at 299,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, at the time that\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   was decided, the only state that did not allow the prosecution to introduce evidence of a sexual assault victim's complaint in its case-in-chief was California.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The majority has uncovered only\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   states that have reexamined their rules on the admission of constancy of accusation testimony since\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   and of those two jurisdictions, only one state has abandoned the doctrine.

Accordingly, all but two jurisdictions-California and Vermont-continue to rely on some form of the doctrine to counteract unwarranted biases against victims of sexual assault. Thus, not only does the majority fail to offer any explanation for its decision to modify the constancy of accusation doctrine, but in doing so, the majority goes against the clear weight of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The present case illustrates that the trial courts, in the proper exercise of their discretion, are in the best position to balance the competing interests of victims and defendants. The majority specifically recognizes that the trial court properly applied\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   and that\n   the defendant suffered no prejudice from the introduction of constancy testimony. Had the majority followed the logic of its own analysis, it would have left\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   unchanged and the constancy of accusation doctrine intact. Instead, the majority makes the classic error of attempting to fix something that is not broken. The result is a rule that fails to recognize and accord proper deference to the role performed by trial courts pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Troupe,\n   </em>\n   a role that they were performing properly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is the trial judge, who presides over a case as it unfolds, who is in the best position to exercise discretion in order to balance the interests implicated by the introduction of evidence. In recognition of the importance of that role, this court stated in\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   that \"[i]n determining whether to permit [constancy of accusation] testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice\n   to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Troupe,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200303\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/284/#p304\">\n    237 Conn. at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than recognizing that the task of weighing the probative value of the testimony of constancy witnesses against its prejudicial impact is a function within the particular expertise of the trial courts, the majority takes that discretion from the courts and hands it over to defendants. By reassigning the discretion of the trial courts to the group most ill-suited to balance the relative interests-defendants-the majority also upsets the careful balance that had been achieved by\n   <em>\n    Troupe.\n   </em>\n   In doing so, the majority rushes headlong into one of the dangers recognized by\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   -allowing defendants, rather than the trial court, to control whether sexual assault victims should have to \"suffer whenever members of the jury [hold] prejudices that [victims] who do not complain have not really been [sexually assaulted].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20917\">\n    677 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By taking the discretion away from the neutral trial court, and giving exclusive control over the admissibility of the testimony of the constancy witnesses to the person who\n   most benefits from the unwarranted societal prejudices against sexual assault victims, and who is guaranteed to make choices that capitalize on those societal prejudices, the majority fails to achieve its stated purpose of balancing the interests of victims and defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I also observe that the majority's rule is not even remotely connected to the claimed purpose of addressing \"potential prejudice to defendants caused by the testimony of multiple constancy witnesses.\" Instead, the majority's rule yields an all or nothing result. It precludes the introduction of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   testimony from constancy witnesses whenever the defendant states that he or she will not rely expressly on the delay in reporting to impeach the credibility of the victim. If the defendant elects to rely on the delay, however, the trial court may exercise its discretion to allow\n   <em>\n    multiple\n   </em>\n   constancy of accusation witnesses. If the majority had wished to actually address the defendant's claimed prejudice, a much more logical choice would have been to adopt the first complaint doctrine, as the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has done. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. King,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2823323\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/217/#p242\">\n    445 Mass. at 242-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20N.E.2d%201175\">\n    834 N.E.2d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That doctrine allows constancy testimony, but limits the testimony to the first prior complaint of the victim. I am not advocating that this court adopt the first complaint doctrine. As I have stated in this concurring opinion, I believe that the trial courts have been applying\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   in a manner that achieves the proper and fair balance between the interests of victims and defendants. I merely observe that if the majority's aim is to address defendants' claimed prejudice due to constancy evidence from multiple witnesses, the first complaint doctrine would address that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, because I do not agree that\n   <em>\n    Troupe\n   </em>\n   should be modified, but agree with the result in the present case, I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
