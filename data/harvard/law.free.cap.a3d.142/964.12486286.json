COVEY.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mikeisha Gant (Gant) appeals from the Lancaster County Common Pleas Court's (trial court) July 8, 2014 order declaring that Gant is a medically-compromised adult in need of protective services under the Adult Protective Services Act (Act or Act 70)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and granting the Department of Public Welfare's (DPW)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petition for Special Relief (Petition). The issues for this Court's review are: (1) whether the trial court erred in finding that Gant is an adult in need of protective services under the Act; (2) whether the trial court erred by restricting Gant's eligibility for DPW's Medical Assistance benefits; (3) whether Gant was afforded sufficient notice that DPW would seek to enjoin interference with Gant's ability to consent to protective services; and, (4) whether DPW and the trial court deprived Gant of her due process rights. Upon review, we affirm in part, reverse in part and vacate in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gant, who was 28 years of age at the time of the hearings, suffers from advanced-stage sickle cell anemia which causes her consistent, severe pain. She is bed-ridden and catheterized, and is fed every two hours through a feeding tube. She must also be moved every two hours in order to avoid pressure wounds (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   bedsores ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gant takes a significant amount of medication, including pain medications. Since 2011, she has participated in DPW's Consolidated Waiver Program (Waiver Program),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which permits Medical Assistance recipients to receive nursing home-type care and services in their homes. Within the Waiver Program are two service models: the Agency-Directed Model and the Consumer-Directed Model. Under the Agency-Directed Model, independent home healthcare service providers employ persons responsible for the recipient's care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the Consumer-Directed Model, a DPW service coordinator (SC) assists the recipient in developing an individual support plan under which the recipient employs care workers which, oftentimes,\n   are family members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Gant's Individual Support Plan revised in July 2013, her primary care was provided under a Consumer-Directed Model by her mother Abadella Gant (Mother), and occasionally by Gant's father Michael Gant (Father) who is also her power-of-attorney (POA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gant was transported to Lancaster Regional Medical Center's (LRMC) emergency room in critical condition due to a severe, pervasive infection caused by feeding tube leakage, and approximately 11 pressure wounds on her stomach, chest, back and head sufficiently deep to reach her bones. While there, she became unresponsive, stopped breathing and had to be intubated. LRMC staff also discovered that Gant was malnourished and dehydrated. On October 24, 2013, Gant coded and had to be resuscitated. She was unable to receive and/or communicate information or consent to treatment. Due to LRMC's inability to keep an intravenous line in place for delivery of necessary antibiotics, LRMC staff recommended that Gant be transferred to Hershey Medical Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother purportedly refused to permit the transfer. Based upon Gant's condition and Mother's refusal, LRMC requested that DPW's Under-60 Protective Services Unit\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   conduct an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 24, 2013, DPW sought an emergency order from the trial court's Orphan's Court Division (Orphan's Court) at Docket No. 2377 of 2013, seeking DPW agent Denise Getgen's (Getgen)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   appointment as Gant's emergency guardian \"in order to insure placement and admission to Hershey Medical Center and to consent to all necessary medical interventions on [Gant's] behalf....\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 18a. DPW's Petition for Adjudication of Incapacity and for the Appointment of a Plenary Guardian of the Person and of the Estate (Guardianship Petition) reflected:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. [DPW's] [U]nder[-]60 [P]rotective [S]ervice [U]nit[ ] received a report of need on or around October 24, 2013 requesting an investigation of the care and services provided to [Gant] at the time of her admission to [LRMC]. Despite receiving waiver services through [DPW,] [Gant]\n   <strong>\n    was in deplorable physical condition.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4. Upon admission, it was observed [Gant] had multiple stage 4 skin wounds, had a\n   <strong>\n    severe infection\n   </strong>\n   of the blood, was\n   <strong>\n    severely dehydrated\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    malnourished\n   </strong>\n   and had a leaking feeding tube in her abdomen....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Despite there being no cost due to insurance coverage, [Gant]'s mother and caregiver would not permit physician[-]ordered nursing visits in the home. [Gant] requires a skilled level of care and is unable to perform any activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6. [Gant] has repeatedly been hospitalized in February 2011, September 2012, and November 2012, at Lancaster General Hospital for infection and dehydration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7. [Gant] suffers from severe sickle cell anemia, seizure disorder, contractures, multiple decubitus ulcers, chronic and extreme physical pain that is currently being managed with narcotic medications and receives nutrition through a feeding tube.... [Getgen] will testify concerning [Gant]'s medical conditions and lack of capacity at this time.\n   <strong>\n    [Gant] is unable to communicate or process information at this time.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   9. ... [O]n October 24, 2013, the family was informed [LRMC was] unable to deliver pain medication through veins due to the severity of her sickle cell anemia. In fact, pain medication had to be administrated through [Gant]'s bones.\n   <strong>\n    All professionals involved in this matter ... believe [Gant] must be transported, on an emergency basis, to Hershey Medical Center,\n   </strong>\n   [which is] better able to care for [Gant]'s extensive needs and pain management. [Gant]'s caregivers and\n   <strong>\n    parents refuse to permit this to occur\n   </strong>\n   [,] indicating no one understands the situation. [Gant]'s mother offered that all that needed to be done was to flush pain medications into the feeding tube, which is not an option. [Gant]'s pain is excruciating, her wounds are significant and\n   <strong>\n    she will potentially die\n   </strong>\n   [ ]\n   <strong>\n    if the appropriate treatment is not emergently administered.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   10. [DPW] believes that [Gant] is\n   <strong>\n    at risk and will suffer irreparable harm\n   </strong>\n   as a result of her stage 4 ulcers, severe infection and no intravenous access. Any one of these issues\n   <strong>\n    could lead to her death.\n   </strong>\n   [Gant] needs immediate placement in a medical center equipped to deal with her significant medical issues in order to sustain her life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   11. [Getgen], as agent for [DPW] [O]ver[-]60 [P]rotective [S]ervices [U]nit, shall be appointed temporary emergency guardian of [Gant]'s person and estate in order to insure placement and or admission to Hershey Medical Center and to consent to all necessary medical interventions on behalf of [Gant] who is only 28 years of age. At the time of a permanent hearing, a guardianship agency will in all likelihood need to be appointed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   WHEREFORE[, DPW] respectfully requests this Court to direct a citation to [Gant], as to why she should not be adjudicated an incapacitated person and an emergency and plenary guardian of her person and estate be appointed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   R.R. at 17a-19a (emphasis added). Appended to the Guardianship Petition were photographs of Gant and her wounds, and copies of Gant's Lancaster General Hospital records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 17a, 20a-28a. Based upon her investigation, Getgen verified that the statements contained in the Guardianship Petition were true and correct to the best of her knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 29a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By October 26, 2013 order, the Orphan's Court appointed Linda Timberlake, Esquire as Gant's counsel, scheduled an emergency hearing for later that day and a permanent hearing for October 28, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 11a. An emergency hearing was held\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, by October 26, 2013 order, Getgen was appointed Gant's temporary emergency guardian.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 44a. Gant was transferred to Hershey Medical Center that day. The Guardianship Petition was filed with the Orphan's Court on October 29, 2013. On November 1, 2013, the Orphan's Court issued a Preliminary Decree scheduling the Guardianship Petition hearing for December 4, 2013, which was later continued and, ultimately, cancelled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 9a-10a, 13a-15a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 8, 2013, Gant was transferred from Hershey Medical Center to Select Specialty Hospital in Harrisburg for rehabilitation. On November 21, 2013, Robert Howse, M.D. evaluated Gant's capacity. He concluded that, with the exception of Mother's and Father's difficulty maintaining relationships with doctors or institutions sufficient to provide Gant stable and reliable access to medically-necessary opioids and the withdrawal that occurs as a result, Gant is completely capable of making her own choices regarding her care and has not been the victim of physical abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By December 11, 2013 letter, DPW terminated Gant's Waiver Program services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 119a. Also on December 11, 2013, DPW filed the subject Petition seeking an order \"permitting [DPW] to continue to direct [Gant's] health care pending a hearing,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   because \"[w]ithout the involvement of the [trial c]ourt, under the [Act's] emergency intervention procedures, [Gant] will return home and not have the skilled care she needs and this time she may not survive.\" R.R. at 8a. By December 13, 2013 order, the trial court authorized Getgen \"to consent to medical treatment and selection of treatment and care providers for [Gant], to insure she receives proper medical treatment, pending further [o]rder of th[e] Court.\" R.R. at 45a. On January 31, 2014, the trial court scheduled a hearing\n   on the Petition and appointed Patricia L. Dunlevy Williams (Dunlevy Williams), Esquire as Gant's counsel. Due to her significant improvement, Gant was released from Select Specialty Hospital in February 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A hearing was held on February 27, 2014, at which Getgen, Bayada Home Care nurse Montsho Garman (Garman), and DPW's Office of Long-Term Living director Virginia Rogers (Rogers) testified for DPW. Getgen reported that she observed Gant in critical condition at LRMC, was \"pretty hands-on\" regarding her medical care, and had significant interaction with Gant's medical care providers at LRMC, Hershey Medical Center and Select Specialty Hospital. R.R. at 65a. She explained that the LRMC doctors presented her with two options when they could not gain intravenous access-do nothing and provide Gant hospice care, or treat her infection aggressively at Hershey Medical Center. Since she understood that Hershey Medical Center was Gant's best option, she authorized the transfer. Getgen described:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Gant] was not receiving adequate care and services ... to make sure her nutrition was maintained, make sure that she did not develop or minimize the risk of developing pressure wounds or open sores, have things like medication ... delivered properly, those kinds of things. I know that there were issues with all of that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R.R. at 65a. Getgen declared that she discussed her decision-making with Gant when Gant was able to communicate, but when Gant declined certain treatment that physicians deemed necessary, Getgen nevertheless authorized it. She explained that DPW sought \"involuntary intervention because the refusals and the care and services that were not being provided really did put [Gant] at risk of death, serious physical injury, or serious bodily injury.\" R.R. at 72a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Getgen stated that when Gant was returned home in February 2014, her physical condition no longer constituted an emergency; however, due to her previous condition and her significant medications, DPW explored re-entering her in the Waiver Program under the Agency-Directed Model to ensure that she continued to receive proper care. Specifically, she described that DPW outfitted Gant with a special pressure-relief mattress and other durable medical equipment, retained Bayada to provide additional nursing services including repositioning, and wound and feeding tube care, and recommended social services intervention to ensure that Gant's medications were obtained, stored and delivered properly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Getgen clarified that despite taking narcotic pain medications, Gant's pain is constant, and to avoid it becoming more severe, Gant is medicated prior to wound care, repositioning and therapy. Getgen reported that Gant's parents resisted the additional nursing services and medication dispensing devices, and consistently failed to answer inquiries regarding Gant's care plan. She stated that, on February 26, 2014, Getgen, the Gants, Rogers, Garman, DPW Support Coordination staff and Gant's treating physician Peter A. Hurtubise, D.O.'s (Dr. Hurtubise) nurse practitioner Polly Sue Gockley (Gockley), met to discuss Gant's care plan and the possibility of reinstating her to the Waiver Program under the Agency-Directed Model. Getgen expressed that although no consensus was reached, she was able to observe that with the DPW-ordered home nurse aides and physician support, Gant's condition had not deteriorated, and that she was\n   \"very much the same as she was at Select Specialty [Hospital].\" R.R. at 68a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Getgen acknowledged that Gant was not currently in an emergency situation, and that private in-home service agencies could effectively provide Gant's care. However, she testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I continue to be concerned that she is not getting turned and repositioned adequately to ensure that she doesn't develop pressure sores, and we go backwards and the pressure sores deteriorate again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   I continue to be concerned about the level of medication she's getting, and ensuring that she's getting the right medicine at the right time....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I do get concerned when we don't get responses in terms of, how is it going in the house? Or we get a response that's not accurate.... If we can't get a good collaboration or cooperation, if we can't get people in-house consistently, if we can't get meds being given in the manner that they're directed ... to be given, those are big concerns still.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   R.R. at 68a-69a. Thus, she asserted that DPW's oversight is necessary to be sure that Gant's care plan is consistently implemented. She acknowledged that DPW's oversight would be unnecessary if it was satisfied that Gant's care plan was met without resistance and that her condition did not decline. She related that the Agency-Directed Model protects Gant in that the home health agencies would notify DPW of abuse and/or signs of neglect. Getgen agreed that DPW could be satisfied if Gant presented a care plan approved by the trial court; however, Gant has never taken that step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Garman testified that she cared for Gant three times weekly for approximately four weeks prior to the hearing, under a care plan prepared by Dr. Hurtubise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   She described that Mother often interrupted her interactions with Gant and answered for her, particularly in refusing treatment and repositioning. She described explaining Gant's need for repositioning not only to prevent sores but to prevent breathing problems, and then documenting the refusals. Garman articulated that Mother was defensive when she attempted to determine if Mother was familiar with a particular procedure necessary for Gant's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Regarding Gant's medications, Garman stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Medications have been an issue in this home. There have been two times-I introduced something called a Mediplanner. It allows you to, me as the nurse, to come in one time during one of my visits during the week and pre-fill the med box for morning, noon, evening, and nighttime with all of the meds, so that [Mother] would be able to administer the medications at specific times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   There have been two occasions where the Mediplanner was incorrect when I came back. One day I came back and all of the morning and noon across the board from Sunday to Saturday were just completely missing. And then all the evening pills from evening to bedtime were present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   And with the amount of narcotics and the fact she's on Dilantin for seizures, gabapentin for pain, these types of medications can't really be missed, so I was alarmed. And when I tried to speak to [Mother] about it, she actually ignored me during that particular visit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The next time I visited, there was another occasion where I noticed that the Oxycontin -there were three Oxycontin in two of the slots in the evening, and she's only supposed to take two. The Dilantin was-the bottle had changed 200mg tablets were previously ordered and now there were 100mg tablets in the home. She's supposed to get 400mg, so that changes the number of tablets that are going to be in [the] Mediplanner. [Mother] told me that she moved those around.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   So I think that there's a cognitive problem with her understanding the patient's basic medication regimen. And that's a safety issue that I had to report to Dr. Hurtubise.... It has nothing to do with [Gant] personally. Anytime there [are] discrepancies in the Mediplanner when I come, I have to report that to the physician.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   R.R. at 76a. She described that since her goal is for the family to be independent, she repeatedly attempted to teach Mother how to use the Mediplanner, but was met with verbal abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Garman reported that Mother's repeated speaking for Gant was a \"red flag\" that abuse may be occurring. R.R. at 77a. She acknowledged that although Gant is not currently in an emergency situation, based upon her observations, it would be unsafe for Gant to remain in her home with Mother as her primary caregiver. Garman recalled that, on approximately three occasions, Mother called and told her not to come and, on other occasions, Mother made her wait for extended periods of time before affording her access to Gant. She also referenced an incident on February 26th in which Mother pulled her into the bathroom, locked the door and asked her not to testify at the February 27th hearing. Garman declared that neither she nor Bayada are willing to continue serving Gant under such conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rogers testified that although she did not meet Gant until February 26th, she was familiar with Gant's Individual Support Plan, which a DPW SC was assisting the Gants to execute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 2b-25b. She related that she was also familiar with the SC's notes, which reflected that there had been difficulties with the Gant family's cooperation, and that Mother questioned why the SC had to visit so often since \"her daughter is terminally ill and ... her health is not going to get better and it is a waste of [their] time for SC to bother them all of the time.\" R.R. at 82a. Rogers recalled that Gant was not interested in having people she did not know provide her services, but stated that it would be agreeable, if she got to know the people involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 83a. Based upon her interactions with the family, Rogers opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   I believe that [Gant] is a very vulnerable person. She is essentially in her room 24 hours a day with no access to open the door to anybody else. Her parents are there, so I think that there is the possibility that she may not have the opportunity sometimes to make her own decisions. So I think that that is one reason why she is not a good candidate for self-direction [as required by the Consumer-Directed Model].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   R.R. at 82a. After Rogers' testimony, the trial court continued the February 27, 2014 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Petition hearing was scheduled to resume on March 21, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at\n   47a. However, rather than conducting a hearing that day, off-the-record settlement discussions occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 49a. After the parties failed to reach an agreement, Father filed a Petition for Hearing Final Portion of Hearing on April 11, 2014. Therein, Father also asked the trial court to permit Dunlevy Williams to withdraw in lieu of private counsel Eric Schelin Rothermel's appearance. Additionally, Father requested the trial court to vacate Getgen's authority based upon the evidence presented at the February 27, 2014 hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 48a-52a. By April 24, 2014 order, the trial court scheduled the hearing to continue on June 16, 2014 and approved Gant's counsel change, but did not vacate Getgen's authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 53a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On June 16, 2014, Gant, her parents and Dr. Hurtubise testified on Gant's behalf. Gant related over the telephone that because her blood cells are sickle-shaped, they do not flow properly and the resulting lack of oxygen makes her feel weak and causes her excruciating pain. She recalled that she has experienced symptoms and been hospitalized regularly since she was two years old. She described that she has been bed-ridden for five or six years, she takes numerous medications through her feeding tube every two hours, she is on oxygen, she is catheterized and uses a feeding tube and, as a result, her parents must help her brush her teeth and bathe, etc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   She explained that she must lie on her side because she experiences more pain when on her back. Gant stated that her mother feeds her, dispenses her medications, and cares for her wounds on days the nurses are not scheduled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Gant stated that, before her October 2013 hospitalization, Dr. Stuart Hartman (Dr. Hartman) visited her monthly, Dr. Hurtubise visited her every two or three months, and a nurse visited regularly to check her vital signs and care for her wounds. Gant recalled that in the days leading up to her October 2013 LRMC admission, her feeding tube began leaking uncontrollably which caused her skin to soften and tear and the feeding tube to dislodge. She described that she could not eat, she lost weight and her medications could not be regulated. She does not recall her treatment at LRMC, but recalls being intubated when she arrived at Hershey Medical Center, and the staff drilling a hole into her knee to administer antibiotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Gant recounted an incident at Select Specialty Hospital when she was experiencing back pain and Getgen informed her that she was to undergo a CAT scan. She asked Getgen to delay the test because she was in such pain that her legs were contracting. She reported that Getgen nevertheless authorized the test, and when the staff pushed her contracted legs to flatten them out, she was screaming in pain and crying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also recalled Getgen reducing her family's visiting hours, but bargaining that if she sat in a chair, her visiting hours would be restored and/or the Waiver Program issues would be dropped. She recollected Getgen telling her that she did not want to be Gant's guardian, and she only visited Gant once since she returned home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Gant described that since her February 2014 return home, she receives nursing\n   care three times per week, and Dr. Hurtubise visits her. She expressed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I want to be able to make decisions for me on my own. I don't need a guardian. I'm 29 years old. I don't need anybody to make decisions for me, medically or anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   And on top of that, I want to be able to have whoever I want to hire. I feel like it should be my choice who I want to come in, and I want my [M]other to be my care giver. And I don't understand why it has to be that way because we've done nothing wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   R.R. at 95a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Dr. Hurtubise testified that he has been Gant's doctor since February 2013. He explained that while Dr. Hartman managed Gant's pain, he cares for her other medical issues. He described that he visits Gant at home approximately every three to six months as needed, and that his nurse practitioner Gockley visits weekly to assist with her wound care. Dr. Hurtubise articulated that Gant's medical condition and her thin body place her at an extremely high risk for bedsores which, even under the best circumstances, would be inevitable for her. He also expressed that Gant's condition and resulting lower extremity contractures make moving her extremely painful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Dr. Hurtubise recounted from his two to three home visits before Gant's October 2013 hospitalization that although Gant's bed needed to be updated, her \"care seemed to be very reasonable considering her limitations from her parents.\" R.R. at 98a. He recalled Mother being physically and emotionally attentive to Gant, and diligent with respect to Gant's hygiene and wound care. He asserted that Gant's parents never refused his care advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dr. Hurtubise explained that he now manages Gant's medications and has seen Gant on five occasions since her release, and Gockley visits her every one to two weeks. He described that they oversee her wound care and are working on optimizing her nutrition. He observed Mother reposition Gant, and is aware that Mother provides her medications, maintains her nutrition and contacts him if she has questions. He concluded based upon his observations that Mother \"is doing an excellent job.\" R.R. at 100a. He specifically testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   I can't imagine anyone rendering any better care, whether it be a trained nurse or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   We work really hard with [Mother] to help educate her as to what things she needs to be aware of. She's been very receptive and actually very intelligent and picks these suggestions up very quickly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   So I personally think that the care has been very, very good. And [Gant] ... has clearly stated that she feels that she's done a good job. I believe that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   R.R. at 100a-101a. However, Dr. Hurtubise described that the differences of opinion between Getgen and Mother regarding Gant's care has created \"a very toxic environment for [Mother] who is, I think, truly interested in [Gant's] best interest but felt that there was often an accusatory or a damning kind of tone to the[ir] interactions.\" R.R. at 100a. He also disagreed with Garman's concerns regarding Mother's care for Gant. In particular, despite not being aware of claims that Gant's medications have been mismanaged, he clarified that since Gant's pain levels may not be constant, medication delivery may not be consistent. He also stated that since Garman is no longer assigned to Gant's case, he has not received any negative reports from Bayada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dr. Hurtubise related that although Gant has lived far longer than most sickle\n   cell patients, he suspects that she will succumb to her condition within the next 10 years, probably due to a massive stroke or heart attack related to her blood clotting. When asked whether there is anything other than Gant's general medical condition which places her at imminent risk of death or bodily injury, Dr. Hurtubise responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Sure, related to her medications.... [Gant] is on a very complex cocktail of medicines which carry high risk and certainly, again, I think [Mother's] done an incredibly good job of making sure she gets the medications at an appropriate time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   However, it's still-these are still dangerous medicines, and they can change things ... in a very short period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   R.R. at 101a. Dr. Hurtubise's questioning continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. And since your time of overseeing that, have there been any specific concerns that you've seen with respect to medications?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A. You know, I think with just the sheer amount of pain medicines that she requires, it's always a concern for me because these are-they have a tremendously high street value and the risk would be of somebody breaking into the house and trying to steal them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   However, the Gants have been very diligent with maintaining oversight and awareness of where the medicines are at any given time. We did request at one point with the home health agency and with the POA that a lockbox be given to the patient. Even that wouldn't necessarily deter a theft. You know, it might prevent somebody else from getting into the medicines who doesn't have access.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   I can say they've done a great job with the medication that I do not have any concerns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   R.R. at 101a-102a. He informed the trial court that he would like to re-hospitalize Gant for insertion of a subclavian line or port for pain management in order to reduce the amount of high-level medicines Gant must control at home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Dr. Hurtubise pronounced that since Gant is cognitively able to make decisions regarding her care, \"whatever [she] decides for herself is what we should stick with.... She's very comfortable in her home environment as expressed several times[;] she feels that the care that's rendered by her family is the best care that she could get.\" R.R. at 102a. Regarding repositioning, he stated that Gant's pain will dictate its risk versus benefit and that, as long as Gant is of sound mind, she can refuse to be moved even if it is not in her best interests. Dr. Hurtubise related that the services that his office, Bayada and Mother are providing are proper for Gant's health and welfare. He described that Gant's condition is stabilized, and that \"she's as good as she's going to be for a while.... [I]t will only be a matter of time before she does run into trouble again.\" R.R. at 109a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Mother testified that Gant enrolled in DPW's Waiver Program approximately 2 \u00bd years before the hearing, under which she and Charlotte Toney were approved as Gant's paid caregivers. She described that, under the Waiver Program, SC Monica Lugo would visit two or three times annually to ensure that Gant was being cared for properly. She stated that she feeds and cleans Gant, repositions her three or four times daily and dispenses her medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mother recounted that Gant's feeding tube has leaked since 2010, but got worse in the fall of 2013. She explained that when gauze packing did not work, Gant was no longer effectively being fed, hydrated or medicated, thus resulting in her\n   October 2013 hospitalization. She stated that while they awaited the arrival of a new feeding tube part, Gant's condition worsened.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   She recalled that when Gant became abnormally dehydrated, she called an ambulance. Mother specifically disputed that Gant had 11 sores when she was admitted to LRMC, since the staff counted the holes drilled into her bones for peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) lines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that in the days leading up to the DPW report, LRMC staff had the same feeding tube difficulties, whereby liquids escaped and pooled around Gant's legs causing additional pressure wounds. Although she acknowledged that LRMC experienced difficulties inserting a PICC line, she did not believe that Gant was transferred to Hershey Medical Center for that reason, but rather on Getgen's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Mother declared that, although there have been several people involved with Gant's care since she was released from the hospital in February 2014, she still provides the same care she always has. She related feeling uncomfortable when Garman came to care for Gant, since it did not appear that Garman knew how to provide wound care until Gockley showed her, and because she seemed to be investigating rather than providing medical care. Mother stated that Garman was rough with Gant and, when she asked Garman to take her time, Garman responded that she had only 45 minutes for each patient. She related that Gant eventually asked that Garman be replaced. Mother explained that after the February 26th meeting, she invited Garman into the bathroom to be sure there were no hard feelings about her being replaced. She also disputed that Garman raised medication issues with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mother described that when she met Getgen at LRMC on October 24, 2013, Getgen discussed services necessary to help Gant at home. Other than Getgen's order to move Gant to Hershey Medical Center, she had little interaction with Getgen. Mother stated that Getgen never visited Gant after she returned home, but Mother and Rogers attended the February 26th meeting to discuss Gant's care plan. She testified that although she was present when Gant made her medical service decisions, she did not interfere with those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Father testified that he and Mother were Gant's primary caregivers since birth, and they continued to care for her under the Waiver Program until a guardian was appointed. He recalled that once Gant qualified for the Waiver Program, SCs would visit and assess Gant every six months. Otherwise, his interactions on Gant's behalf were as her POA. He claimed that he has never interfered with Gant's ability to obtain care and, in fact, returned every one of Getgen's calls to be sure he knew what her next move would be. He described that when Getgen asserted they did not return telephone calls was at the time when Gant was in the hospital, and the time when no one answered the door for Garman was because she was at the wrong address. He also recalled Garman's demeanor changing after Gant complained that Garman was rough with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Getgen testified for DPW in rebuttal that Gant's testimony notwithstanding, she did not order Gant to undergo the painful\n   CAT scan, but explained to Gant why the physician ordered it. She also explained that she did not reduce the family's visiting hours, but rather Hershey Medical Center imposed the restrictions due to the family's abuse thereof. Getgen described the family's treatment of her as aggressive, threatening, difficult and accusatory, and that such behavior upset Gant who then also became aggressive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   She explained that although her sickle cell patients are often hospitalized and have pressure wounds, she has never witnessed the type of deterioration Gant displayed in October 2013. Getgen related that she was particularly concerned when Mother told her she did not reposition Gant when it was too painful for her. Getgen witnessed Mother refuse medical treatment on Gant's behalf, and there is history of similar behavior in DPW's records as far back as May 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.R.R. at 26b-34b. Getgen related:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Under protective service law, we offer a care plan to mitigate or eliminate risk and so part of that would be to look at what care is provided and to try to develop a plan that would adequately meet their needs. If ... you're unable under the waiver to ensure someone's health and welfare, we can terminate the waiver. So that's one option.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   R.R. at 132a. Based upon her investigations and observations, Getgen attributed Gant's lack of success in the Waiver Program to Mother's inability to meet Gant's needs. Getgen concluded that even if Gant is reinstated to the Waiver Program under the Agency-Directed Model, Mother should not be Gant's paid caregiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In light of the foregoing evidence, on July 8, 2014, the trial court granted DPW's Petition, \"find[ing] that [ ] Gant is a medically[-]compromised adult in need of protective services as defined under the [Act],\" and granted the following relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (1) [ ] Gant's autonomy with respect to medical treatment shall be preserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (2) [Medical Assistance] services shall be available for [Gant] as long as she is eligible for those services, except for Consumer-Directed Services through the Commonwealth's Home and Community-Based Services Programs.

The Petition did not allege that Gant was in imminent risk of serious injury or death while she was indefinitely hospitalized, but rather\n   <strong>\n    speculated\n   </strong>\n   that if and when she returned home without skilled care, she\n   <strong>\n    may\n   </strong>\n   face such risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6 17 and Getgen's testimony at R.R. at 68a-69a.

Thus, when the trial court issued its December 13, 2013 order pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act, there was not clear and convincing evidence that without protective services Gant was \"at imminent risk of\n   death, serious injury or serious bodily injury.\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 10210.307(a)(1). Accordingly, we hold that Gant was not an adult in need of protective services on December 13, 2013, when the trial court authorized Getgen to make Gant's medical decisions pending a hearing on the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     July 8, 2014 Protective Services Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Thereafter, at the hearings, DPW acknowledged that it had withdrawn the Guardianship Petition because Gant regained her capacity during her hospitalization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the fact that Gant regained her capacity does not alter the possibility that Gant may be an adult in need of protective services. Although Section 102(1) of the Act expressly requires that adults who are incapacitated and are at imminent risk \"must\n   <strong>\n    have access to services\n   </strong>\n   necessary to protect their health, safety and welfare[,]\" there is no requirement in the Act that incapacity precede protective services. 35 P.S. \u00a7 10210.102(1) (emphasis added). Further, neither the definitions of \"adult,\" \"adult in need of protective services,\" and \"protective services,\" nor applicable Sections 102(2) (relating to legislative purpose and choice), 304 (relating to provision of services), 307 (relating to involuntary intervention), 308 (relating to rights of protective services clients) of the Act require that the adult be incapacitated. In fact, Section 304(b) of the Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 10210.304(b), specifies that protective services shall be provided only with the adult's consent, unless otherwise ordered by a court or provided under Section 307 of the Act. Therefore, it is clear that the General Assembly intended for protective services to be available even to capable persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   DPW bore the burden of proving with clear and convincing evidence that, without protective services, Gant was \"at imminent risk of death, serious injury or serious bodily injury.\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 10210.307(a)(1). DPW witnesses confirmed that Waiver Services were terminated on or about December 20, 2013, and that Gant's condition had not deteriorated since her return home. We acknowledge that at that time and during the pendency of the hearings, her care was being closely overseen by Getgen, Bayada nurse's aides, nurses and her physician and, therefore, the care she was receiving did not place her at any greater risk than her terminal condition itself. We also recognize that Gant's \"goals are for comfort care, punctuated with all the acute care necessary to return to living at home, but not enough to be more functional if it costs more pain or work.\" R.R. at 33a. Gant has further made it clear that she would choose Mother's care over that provided by anyone else, even though that decision may have led to her October 2013 hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   However, in addition to Section 102 of the Act, in Section 401(a) of the Public Welfare Code, which was intended to guide DPW's actions, the General Assembly declared that its intent is \"to promote the self-sufficiency of all the people of the Commonwealth.\" 62 P.S. \u00a7 401(a).

We are not convinced that Mother interferes with Gant's care, but rather expresses differences of opinion. With the exception of Mother's choice not to have Gant transferred to Hershey Medical Center in October 2013, the circumstances of which are not clear here, there is nothing in this record proving that Gant's choice of her Mother's care is harmful, or not in Gant's best interests. Mother's interactions with Gant's care providers appear to have been to reinforce Gant's wishes, and to be sure that Gant's needs were handled with the same care Mother would provide. Moreover, several months before Gant's October 2013 hospitalization for infection and severe pressure wounds, Mother and Father had requested pads for her bed to prevent such wounds and make Gant more comfortable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.R.R. at 29b. DPW did not provide a special mattress for that purpose until February 2014. Thus, even with DPW's oversight, Gant's physical condition will continue to decline. Accordingly, DPW has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that,\n   <strong>\n    without protective services,\n   </strong>\n   Gant was \"at imminent risk of death, serious injury or serious bodily injury.\" 35 P.S. \u00a7 10210.307(a)(1).

This is clearly her right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Further, in its July 2014 order, the trial court stated: \"The Court further finds that protective services are necessary to protect and maintain [Gant's] fragile health, safety and welfare.\" R.R. at 55a. However, \"\n   <strong>\n    [p]rotective services\n   </strong>\n   [ ]\" are defined in Section 103 of the Act as \"[t]hose activities, resources and supports provided to adults under this [A]ct\n   <strong>\n    to detect, prevent, reduce or eliminate abuse, neglect, exploitation and abandonment.\n   </strong>\n   \" 35 P.S. \u00a7 10210.103 (emphasis added).

Excluding reference to purported settlement negotiations and looking only at the Petition and the certified record, we must conclude that DPW intended the Petition to obtain and Gant understood that DPW was seeking \"an [o]rder permitting [DPW] to continue to direct [Gant's] health care pending a hearing [,]\" and nothing more. R.R. at 8a. Placing the amendment on the record during the June 2014 hearing\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   Gant had testified hardly afforded Gant sufficient notice to prepare a proper defense.

Gant Br. at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   In order to determine whether the basic elements have been met, \"[the] courts examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first asks whether there is a life, liberty, or property interest that the state has interfered with; and the second examines\n   <strong>\n    whether the procedures attendant to that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Turner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303667,4281046\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/754/\">\n    80 A.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, because there is no question that Gant's life and liberty are at issue, this Court need only determine whether the procedures afforded her were sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In its Petition, DPW requested \"an [o]rder permitting [DPW] to continue to direct [Gant's] health care pending a hearing\" to determine whether she was an adult in need of protective services. R.R. at 8a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Based upon the history, as reflected in the incorporated October 2013 emergency guardianship petition and order, the trial court determined that, pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act, DPW's guardianship should continue until it could hear evidence. It is unclear why it took the trial court until January 31, 2014 to schedule the protective services hearing, or why after the March 2014 settlement negotiations were unsuccessful the trial court scheduled the rest of the hearing some three months later, and then only after Father moved the Court to do so.
