For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2000, the Township's supervisors granted approval of a final plan (Subdivision Plan) for Developer's Whitethorn Subdivision Phase II (Subdivision), a development composed of 22 single-family residential lots located in the Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Subdivision Plan provided for construction of a street through the Subdivision that ended in a cul-de-sac. The Township did not require Developer to enter into a developer's agreement or post security before it approved the Subdivision Plan and Developer did not post any bond or other security for the construction of improvements. After the Subdivision Plan was approved and recorded, Developer began constructing the street set forth in the plan, Shaw Court, and completed construction of Shaw Court in the fall of 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 15, 2001, after completion of the construction of Shaw Court, the Township and Developer entered into a Developer's Agreement for Public/Site Improvements (Developer's Agreement). The Developer's Agreement provided that \"Developer covenants, promises and agrees to build, construct and install all public and private improvements in accordance with the approval plan and any and all specifications of Salem Township, on or before the 31st day of December, 2001\" and that Developer agreed that those improvements would be constructed in accordance with the Township's ordinances. (Developer's Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 14, 24, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 40-41, 46, 49.) The Developer's Agreement provided that \"[i]n lieu of the completion of all public and private improvements,\" Developer was required to post financial security such as a performance bond or letter of credit sufficient to cover 110% of the costs of completion of the improvements and that the Township could seize the security if Developer failed to complete construction of the improvements by December 31, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, R.R. at 38, 41-43.) Again, however, Developer posted no bond or security. The Developer's Agreement further provided that \"Developer shall offer for dedication, all proposed public streets,\" and that the Township \"shall not accept a request for dedication prior to the completion of ninety percent (90%) of the development.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, R.R. at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because the Township's subdivision and land development ordinance (SALDO) in effect at the time of the approval of the Subdivision Plan was held invalid\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   in August 2000, the Westmoreland County SALDO applied to land development in the Township. (Westmoreland County SALDO \u00a7 109, Supplemental Reproduced Record (Supp. R.R.) at 331-332.) The Westmoreland County SALDO provided that \"[a]ll proposed public streets ... shall be constructed as prescribed in the Standard Specifications for street construction for the municipality in which the development is located,\" and that \"[t]he governing body of the local municipality shall have sole jurisdiction over all matters concerning street construction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 409, Supp. R.R. at 353.) The Township's street ordinance, Township Ordinance 101, required that all newly constructed Township streets, including streets intended for public dedication, must have a two-inch subbase, a four-inch base, a two-inch binder and a one-inch wearing course composed of certain specified materials and required that these layers be compacted. (Township Ordinance 101 \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, Supp. R.R. at 382-383.) Shaw Court did not comply with all of the requirements of Township Ordinance 101, and the Township was aware in 2002 that Shaw Court had not been constructed in compliance with Ordinance 101. In addition, the Westmoreland County SALDO required that cul-de-sacs have a minimum paved diameter of 80 feet and Developer's final approved plan showed the cul-de-sac as having an 80-foot paved diameter. (Westmoreland County SALDO \u00a7 407, Supp. R.R. at 353; Trial Transcript (N.T.) at 111, Supp. R.R. at 111.) The diameter of the paved Shaw Court cul-de-sac is approximately 60 feet\n   and did not comply with the approved plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shaw Court deteriorated and developed ruts, cracks, potholes and areas of water ponding on the roadway. Developer has requested that the Township accept Shaw Court as a public street, and the Township has refused to accept it. As of 2014, four of the 22 lots in the Subdivision remained unsold. In October 2014, the Township repaired a portion of Shaw Court at the request of the homeowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 19, 2010, the Township filed this action against Developer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Township's original complaint sought equitable relief compelling Developer to post a bond and fix the defects in Shaw Court. Developer filed preliminary objections on a number of grounds, including objections that the Township had no cause of action in equity. On July 30, 2010, the trial court entered an order sustaining the preliminary objections to the Township's equity claims. Following this order, the Township filed an amended complaint asserting breach of the Developer's Agreement and failure to comply with Township Ordinance 101 and the Westmoreland County SALDO, seeking $193,165 in damages for the cost of fixing the defects in Shaw Court. Developer filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that the Township's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, which was denied by the trial court on August 2, 2012. In 2013, the case was stayed due to Developer's bankruptcy proceeding. On May 14, 2014, the bankruptcy court entered an order granting the Township relief from the automatic stay with respect to this action. On October 22 and 23, 2014, the trial court held a two-day nonjury trial of the Township's claims against Developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 3, 2015, the trial court issued an opinion and order finding in the Township's favor and against Developer and awarding the Township $25,558.45 in damages. The trial court found that Shaw Court was not properly installed and held that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations on the ground that Developer did not breach the Developer's Agreement until it made statements in December 2009 that it would not repair Shaw Court. (Trial Court Opinion at 4-5.) The trial court also found that the Township's evidence of the cost of repair of Shaw Court and reconstruction of its cul-de-sac was speculative and inadequately supported. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The trial court therefore awarded as damages only the amounts that it found that Developer conceded were required for the repairs and reconstruction, $8,265.95 to resurface the deteriorated portions of the Shaw Court roadway and $17,322.50 to fix the cul-de-sac. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both parties filed motions for post-trial relief, Developer challenging the trial court's statute of limitations ruling and the Township challenging both the preliminary objections ruling that it could not proceed in equity and the trial court's damages award. On July 13, 2015, the trial court issued an order denying the post-trial motions and entering judgment in accordance its March 3, 2015 opinion and order. Both Developer and the Township timely appealed and the appeals were consolidated by this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its appeal, Developer argues that the trial court's finding that the statute of limitations began to run in 2009 is unsupported by any evidence and that the Township's action is barred because the statute of limitations began to run by 2002. Developer is correct that the Township's cause of action accrued by 2002. Developer breached its obligations under the Developer's Agreement, Township Ordinance 101, and the Westmoreland County SALDO on December 31, 2001 when it did not complete construction of Shaw Court in accordance with those ordinances and the approved plan for the Subdivision by that date. The Township knew that Shaw Court was not properly constructed in 2002, more than seven years before it brought this action in 2010. Although the Developer's Agreement provided that the Township could not accept dedication of Shaw Court as a public street until 90% of the Subdivision development was complete and more than 10% of the lots remained unsold, that did not prevent the Township from bringing suit for the failure to properly complete the construction.\n   <em>\n    Pocono Township v. Hall,\n   </em>\n   127 Pa.Cmwlth. 116,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1391614\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/127/116/#p56\">\n    561 A.2d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56-58 (1989) (township could enforce road bonds even though developers had not yet offered roads for public dedication).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This action would therefore be time-barred if it is subject to a statute of limitations. If the Township's claim is for breach of the Developer's Agreement, the statute of limitations would be the four-year limitation for actions for breach of a written contract and actions to enforce obligations or liabilities based on a writing, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5525(8). If the Township's claim is viewed as a statutory cause of action under the Municipalities Planning Code (MPC)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to enforce Township Ordinance 101 and the Westmoreland County SALDO, as the Township contends, rather than a claim under the Developer's Agreement, a six-year statute of limitations applies to actions not subject to another limitation period. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5527(b). At the latest, the limitation period would have expired by 2008, two years before the Township filed this action in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court's conclusion that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until December 2009 fails for two reasons. First, there was no evidence supporting the trial court's determination that any event occurred in December 2009 that affected the accrual of the Township's cause of action. On October 21, 2014, the trial court granted a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   filed by Developer to exclude evidence of statements by Developer at the December 2009 meeting on the grounds that those statements were made in settlement negotiations. Second, even if such evidence were before the trial court, it would not change the fact that the cause of action accrued in 2002. Statements made seven years later could not estop Developer from asserting a statute of limitations that would have already run against that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Township argues, however, that the statute of limitations cannot bar its action under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    um tempus occurrit regi\n   </em>\n   (time does not run against the king). We agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    um tempus\n   </em>\n   doctrine, statutes of limitations do not apply to actions brought by the state and its agencies, unless the statute of limitation expressly provides that it limits the government's right to sue.\n   <em>\n    County of Beaver v.

This Court concluded that the requirements of the\n   <em>\n    um tempus\n   </em>\n   doctrine were satisfied because the action involved \"the quintessentially governmental purpose\" of \"protect[ing] the public rights of people who choose to purchase lots and live in a municipality ... of proper access to and from homes within a development.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1391614\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/127/116/#p56\">\n    561 A.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case is fundamentally no different from\n   <em>\n    Pocono Township.\n   </em>\n   While the enforcement there was against the developers' security rather than against the developers directly, that fact is not significant because the Township's\n   statutory rights under the MPC are not limited to recovery against posted security.

We therefore affirm the trial court's ruling that the action is not time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Township, in its cross-appeal, seeks reversal of the trial court's ruling that it could not seek equitable relief. The Township argues that it had a right to proceed in equity because the Westmoreland County SALDO and Section 511 of the MPC provide for equitable relief. The only equity claim that the Township sought to assert, however, was a claim for specific performance to require Developer to fix the defects in Shaw Court or post a bond to cover that work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Neither the Westmoreland County SALDO nor Section 511 of the MPC authorizes an equity action to compel specific performance or the posting of a bond. Rather, they provide that where improvements have not been properly constructed, the municipality has \"the power to\n   <em>\n    enforce any corporate bond, or other security\n   </em>\n   by appropriate legal and equitable remedies\" and, where there is not a sufficient bond or security, \"institute appropriate legal or equitable action to\n   <em>\n    recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements.\n   </em>\n   \" Westmoreland County SALDO \u00a7 508 (Supp. R.R. at 362) (emphasis added); 53 P.S. \u00a7 10511 (emphasis added). Thus, Section 508 of the Westmoreland County SALDO and Section 511 of the MPC authorize only enforcement of an existing bond or other security and actions to recover the cost of completion of the improvements, not actions for specific performance or to require posting of security. Moreover, neither the Westmoreland County SALDO nor the MPC grants an absolute right to invoke equity jurisdiction. Both of these provisions grant the municipality only the right to pursue \"\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   legal and equitable remedies\" and \"\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   legal or equitable action.\" Westmoreland County SALDO \u00a7 508 (Supp. R.R. at 362) (emphasis added); 53 P.S. \u00a7 10511 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Township's equity claims were therefore subject to the ordinary requirements of equity jurisdiction.

The Township's damages evidence consisted of the testimony of one witness, Township Engineer Regola, as to his estimates of both the work needed to repair the deteriorated areas of Shaw Court and provide an 80-foot diameter cul-de-sac and the costs of that work. The Township did not introduce evidence of any bids for the repairs or relocation work for Shaw Court or of costs incurred for the repairs or relocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While it was undisputed that Shaw Court was not constructed in compliance with Ordinance 101, there was conflicting evidence as to both the nature of the noncompliance and the type of repair needed. Regola testified that there was no base installed (N.T. at 97, Supp. R.R. at 97), but there was other evidence that a base was installed but that the material or the thickness of the layers differed from Ordinance 101 requirements, and that the primary\n   defect was lack of compaction. (N.T. at 29-30, 60, 70-71, 81-82, 223, 230, Supp. R.R. at 29-30, 60, 70-71, 81-82, 223, 230.) The amount of repair needed on the deteriorated portions of Shaw Court was also in dispute. Although Regola testified that the entire roadway in the deteriorated areas must be excavated to a depth of one-and-one-half feet and replaced, he admitted that he had not done the tests to determine this and that his opinion on the amount of excavation was \"an estimate on my part without knowing.\" (N.T. at 115-16, 120-21, 128-30, Supp. R.R. at 115-116, 120-21, 128-130.) The Township's engineers who had originally examined Shaw Court proposed adding an extra asphalt wearing course layer as a method of repairing the roadway. (Plaintiff's Ex. 28, R.R. at 61; N.T. at 62-64, Supp. R.R. at 62-64.) The trial court awarded as damages for the roadway repairs the cost, at the estimated rate claimed by the Township, of installing such an additional wearing course on the deteriorated portions of Shaw Court. (Trial Court Opinion at 5; Developer's Written Closing Argument, Supp. R.R. at 291, 298.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to the cost of expanding the cul-de-sac, the bulk of the Township's claim consisted of costs other than paving the cul-de-sac, such as utility relocation and excavation. (Defendant's Ex. E; N.T. at 141-43, 158-59, Supp. R.R. at 141-143, 158-159.) Regola admitted that \"there hasn't been enough field work done to actually complete any kind on construction plans at this point,\" that \"[t]he utilities haven't been located,\" that he did not know what class of excavation would be involved or what the grade of the area was, and that he based the costs that he used on calls he made to unidentified contractors for general ballpark estimates. (N.T. at 145, 154-56, 164-67, Supp. R.R. at 145, 154-156, 164-167.) The trial court awarded as damages for the correction of the cul-de-sac the cost, at an estimated rate claimed by the Township, of fully paving the portion of the enlarged cul-de-sac proposed by the Township that was not already paved. (Trial Court Opinion at 5; Developer's Written Closing Argument, Supp. R.R. at 292, 298.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Township also asserts that the trial court capriciously disregarded the testimony of its damages witness Regola. This argument likewise fails. The trial court is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony presented at trial and this Court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Southwest Regional Tax Bureau v.

The fact that no other witness testified on an issue or contradicted a particular witness's testimony, however, does not require a trier of fact to accept it as credible or sufficient; if the witness's testimony is challenged by cross-examination or argument, it is controverted and the fact-finder's rejection of that witness's testimony does not constitute a capricious disregard of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Carroll v.
