W.Y. (\"W\") was a juvenile (he's now over 18) who pled involved to his most recent set of charges and\n   was adjudicated delinquent. Using a form order edited by hand, the Circuit Court for Prince George's County ordered W placed in a facility in Pennsylvania; he contends on appeal that the process and findings underlying the placement decision failed to comply with FL \u00a7 5-607. In the time since the court entered its order, W completed the out-of-state program, and we agree with both parties that the case is moot. Nevertheless, there are no reported Maryland appellate opinions to guide the juvenile courts in their application of this statute, and because the issues are important and likely to evade review, we find this an appropriate case to exercise our discretion to address the merits of W's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   W has a long history with the juvenile justice system. He was first adjudicated delinquent on March 13, 2012, also by the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, after pleading involved to a count of robbery. While wearing a black ski mask and wielding what the victim believed to be a handgun (later found to be a BB gun), W demanded the victim's book bag and laptop. The victim recognized W from prior encounters, and even called W by name during the robbery. When police officers stopped him shortly after the incident, W admitted to the robbery and consented to a search of his home, during which the victim's property was recovered. The court, sitting as a juvenile court, committed W to the Department of Juvenile Services (\"DJS\") and recommended a Level B placement, which in Prince George's County meant a staff-secured, non-community residential facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DJS placed W at the Victor Cullen Center\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Sabillasville, Frederick County,\n   Maryland, where he remained from May 2, 2012 until he was successfully discharged on October 17, 2012. Upon discharge, the juvenile court rescinded the commitment order and placed W on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   W was arrested again in the early hours of May 26, 2014. Police found W sitting on the steps of a townhome in Landover, Maryland, and approached him because he matched the description of the suspect in a nearby robbery. As they neared, W stood up, drew a .38 caliber handgun (containing three live rounds) from the waistband of his pants, threw the gun to the ground, and began to walk away. When questioned by the officers, W said the weapon\n   was his, but \"[he] wasn't going to do anything with it\" and further stated that he had no knowledge of or involvement in the robbery. He was indicted as an adult, but his case was waived to the juvenile court. W again admitted to his actions, and again pled involved, this time to possession of a regulated firearm by a person under age 21. The court also found W in violation of his probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court held a hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on October 20, 2014 to review W's detention status; W was present with his attorney. The judge told W's attorney to \"let [W] know he may not be going home.\" W then interjected: \"And I'm getting a lot better, out of the prison.\" The court turned its attention to the attorneys to schedule a hearing for the following month, then adjourned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At an adjudicatory hearing on November 18, 2014, the court accepted W's plea of involved, and asked him to explain his actions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Young man, why did you do this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [W]: It was an honest mistake, Your Honor. I really shouldn't have done this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. So, why did you do this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [W]: There is no explanation for why I did it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. So, why did you do it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [W]: I just-I made an honest mistake. I tell you the reason why I did it would be an excuse ... and there is no excuse for that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: So, why did you do it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [W]: I was being a bonehead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Pardon me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [W]: I was being a knucklehead, thinking that I could get away with things I can't get away with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Well, so why did you do it? You already had a robbery with a deadly weapon charge.... Now you [have] possession of a gun. Another one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [THE STATE]: There was not a gun in the prior-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [W]: I understand, Sir. I understand what I done. I apologize for-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: No, I am just asking why did you do it. Because you are going to-you went to a placement, didn't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [W]: Yes, Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: How can I release you back into the community?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: No, let me stop you. I just asked-because if you don't change your lifestyle in what you are doing, you will end up dead out here.... Or you going to end up killing somebody.... [L]ast time I asked you the same thing, why you walking around with a ski mask in the middle of the summer ... with a deadly weapon. I am just saying-you got to change. Would I give you a break and put you back in the community-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [W]: If I could say one thing on my behalf is that this charge and that I went to [detention] and understand that I could have faced even wors[e] charges and time for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I['m] really mature, and my age and I know that it's time to stop playing\n   games and do something with my life or\n   I'm going to throw it away. And I really don't-I'm not ready for my life-I got dreams and goals and things that I need to do. And with the support from my family that-I can't keep doing this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judge then scheduled a December hearing with counsel and ordered W's detention in the interim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   W's disposition hearing-the purpose of which was to determine W's level of placement,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether he should remain in a level B facility or move to level A-took place on December 11, 2014. After an inaudible bench conversation, the State and W's attorney agreed that W should maintain his level B placement, while DJS requested a level A commitment. The judge questioned W about the incident, again emphasizing the similarities between his two arrests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: I am asking him a question because when is he going to learn his lesson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [W]: I mean I can't make you believe me but-I honestly feel like that the lesson I learned when I was up in [detention] facing that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Wait, whoa, whoa, wait, how long were you gone the other time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [W]: Eight months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: And you didn't learn you lesson then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [W]: I did. I just-I am telling you-I made a mistake, I-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: No, no, no. It is not a mistake when you ... put a gun in your hand. That's not a mistake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [W]: It wasn't a mistake, it was more of a defense. But I should have went about it differently than what I did. And I can't really take it back now, I mean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: So, what am I supposed to do with-the mistakes that you keep making?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [W]: I accept any consequences, Sir. (Inaudible) on behalf of the mistakes that I know that (Inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: You have any-the problem is you are putting yourself in harm's way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [W]: Exactly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: I am not asking for a response. I am just-this is ridiculous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [W]: I am ashamed of myself, too, Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: Madam Clerk, the Court will in fact commit [W] to Level A. I agree, you got to stop this, young man. You are going to wind up getting yourself killed out here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   And since he has already been at Victor [Cullen Center] he is not going back to Victor [Cullen Center].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [THE STATE]: Your Honor, can we have a review [hearing] for placement, it is just today-I am sorry, I just realized that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: No problem. You got [January 13, 2015].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After the hearing, the court issued a written Disposition Order, dated December 11, 2015, which ordered that W \"be and hereby is placed in\n   <strong>\n    Level A\n   </strong>\n   ....\" The Order consisted of a template that stated the three classification levels for placement facilities-level A, B, and C-into which the judge inserted an additional limitation (which we have italicized):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A-Secured Facility-\n   <em>\n    [W] is not be placed at Victor Cullen because he was placed there in 2012.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * *Equivalent facilities for the juvenile are not available in the State of Maryland; and institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the juvenile and will not produce undue hardship.* *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the follow-up hearing on January 13, 2015, in a broken and mostly inaudible transcript, the court confirmed that DJS had not yet placed W, and the case was continued until January 20, 2015. On January 16, W filed a Motion to Modify Court Order and Request for a Hearing pursuant to Md. Rule 11-116, asking the court to strike the language italicized above from the Disposition Order. In this sixteen-page Motion, W asked the court to place him at the Victor Cullen Center, disputed the findings in the juvenile judge's Disposition Order,\n   and asked to be heard regarding his placement. We will discuss the facts and arguments set forth in this Motion in greater detail in the Discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At the January 20 hearing, counsel for W obtained a continuance to provide the juvenile judge an opportunity to review the January 16 motion. After agreeing on a hearing date, counsel for the State initiated another broken and inaudible-yet seemingly important-conversation regarding W's placement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [THE STATE]: Your Honor, may I ask a quick question. It is about, [W] is likely to be placed at Mid-Atlantic prior to that, would he need to appear for [the next] hearing or if he can-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE COURT: If he is placed, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [THE STATE]: So, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   THE COURT: Counsel, would you approach?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (Whereupon, a Bench Conference [begins].)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE COURT: Well, frankly I (Inaudible) placement. Anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   MS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   : (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT: I know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   MS.: (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT: Yes. I will probably rule on it some time this week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   MS.: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   THE COURT: Yes. And that (Inaudible) do whatever they want to do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [THE STATE]: (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [THE STATE]: (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   MS.: (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: No, (Inaudible). Somebody, it looked like it was filed late Friday, yes. Okay. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   MS.: (Inaudible)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   THE COURT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (Whereupon, the Bench Conference was concluded.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   THE COURT: I am going to have it sent to Chambers today, [counsel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [COUNSEL FOR W]: Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (Whereupon, the hearing was concluded.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At the conclusion of this January 20 hearing: (1) W had yet to be placed; (2) the juvenile judge had not reviewed W's Motion, nor addressed the requested hearing; (3) the parties agreed to return on February 2, 2015; and (4) the State indicated that W would be placed prior to the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On January 28, 2015, W was placed by DJS at the Mid-Atlantic Youth Service's Secure Male Program (\"MAYS\") in Pittston Township, Pennsylvania. Two days later, the juvenile judge ruled on W's Motion to Modify Court Order and Request for a Hearing. When W filed the Motion on January 16, he had included a proposed order; the judge used the proposed order as a template, but modified it by crossing out portions shown below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Having reviewed Respondent's Motion to Modify Court Order and Request For A Hearing and that Motion having merit, Respondent's Motion is hereby GRANTED. The following language shall be stricken from this Court's [Disposition Order]: \"Respondent not to be placed in Victor Cullen.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The court signed the area indicated by the gray circle and at the bottom of the page, then dated the order January 30, 2015; it was entered on the docket on February 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As directed, the parties reconvened on February 2. By this point, W was in Pennsylvania, but his counsel was present. After the State disclosed that W had been placed at MAYS, the court reset the case for October 15, 2015 for a permanency hearing. W filed a timely notice of appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, on October 7, 2015, the court rescinded the December 11, 2014 commitment\n   order and placed W on probation, with conditions, and ordered him released on electronic monitoring.\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   W does not dispute the finding of delinquency. Instead, he challenges his out-of-state placement, and specifically whether the disposition proceedings complied with FL \u00a7 5-607 and afforded him due process before the court placed him out of state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    First,\n   </em>\n   W argues that he was denied due process because the court failed to notify him or his parents that it was contemplating an out-of-state placement, and thus denied him and his parents a meaningful opportunity to be heard on whether the contemplated placement was in his best interest or would pose an undue hardship on his family.\n   <em>\n    Second,\n   </em>\n   W claims that the juvenile court ignored the requirements of FL \u00a7 5-607 when it did not hear evidence or consider any facts before concluding that there was no equivalent facility in Maryland, that the MAYS placement was in his best interest, and that sending him to MAYS would not cause any undue hardship for his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In reviewing the circuit court's decision in a juvenile delinquency matter, \"[w]e review any conclusions of law\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   but apply the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Elrich S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695397\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/15/#p30\">\n    416 Md. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695397\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/15/#p30\">\n    5 A.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

This Appeal Is Moot.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Initially, though, we have to confront the ongoing justiciability of the case in light of the fact that the order from which W appeals is no longer in force. The State filed its brief in this Court on October 13, 2015, six days after the circuit court rescinded the commitment order, and argues that this development mooted W's appeal. W acknowledges that the appeal is moot, but urges us to \"address the merits of the issues raised because they are unresolved issues of important public concern on which guidance would be helpful,\" and because the error he asserts \"is not merely capable of repetition; it has been repeated in numerous cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Courts decide live disputes, and we normally should decline to address the merits of a moot case.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd v.

And that is the case here: the juvenile court's partial denial of W's motion to modify that Order was effectively granted at the time of rescission, so there is no relief for us to grant him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In rare instances, however, courts can decide to address the merits of a moot case when the issues concern matters of great importance, the public interest will be affected, or there is a likelihood that the wrongdoing will soon be repeated if not immediately resolved.\n   <em>\n    Lloyd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2206699\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/206/36/#p41\">\n    206 Md. at 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.2d%20379\">\n    111 A.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring a \"concurrence in sufficient weight of the[se] factors which together add up to the exception\").

Section 5-607 involves critical due process and liberty interests for juvenile defendants and their families. Although the language of FL \u00a7 5-607 seems straightforward, no Maryland appellate court has interpreted or applied it.

And nothing in the record prior to the December 11 hearing put W or his family on notice that W might be sent to another state-to the contrary, at his November 18, 2014 adjudication hearing, W signed an \"Admission (Plea) Under Rule 11-107\" agreement, which stated, \"I fully understand that the worst the Court can do to me is send me to a\n   State juvenile institution until I turn 21.\" Merely apprising the family of the hearing dates does not provide notice of the possibility that a juvenile faces an out-of-state placement, nor does it afford the juvenile or his family an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullane v.

The record in this case reflects that neither W nor his family was given an opportunity to address his exclusion from Victor Cullen or the appropriateness of the intended out-of-state placement because he was placed at MAYS before the scheduled hearing, and this lack of notice failed to comply with FL \u00a7 5-607.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   From there, the commitment decision itself suffers from a lack of evidence bearing on the issues one way or the other. The commitment hearing addressed only\n   W's delinquent act, and the commitment order consists of a form list that includes the statutory language for Type A, B, and C commitments and inserts only language designating Level A. The record contains nothing relating to the presence or absence of equivalent facilities, W's best interests, or the potential hardship to him or his family from an out-of-state placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We are not saying that an out-of-state placement in this case was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   improper, nor are we saying that Victor Cullen Center\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the best placement for W, nor are we saying that MAYS was an\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   appropriate placement-the record contains no facts or testimony to support any of these possible conclusions. Nor are we saying that courts cannot use form orders to streamline the process of documenting its decisions. We\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   saying, however, that a juvenile court must establish an affirmative factual record that supports the FL \u00a7 5-607 findings that justify an out-of-state placement for the particular juvenile,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the court's order, however generated, must reflect those findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL DISMISSED.

For example, Victor Cullen Center is the only state-operated hardware-secure facility for males. Males sent to hardware-secure facilities are usually repeat and/or violent offenders. There are at least five State-operated staff-secure facilities that house non-violent or non-chronic offenders. Secure facilities also feature addiction programs, behavioral programs, and group homes with schools on-site. Community detention encompasses many less restrictive community-based placements, including foster care, group homes, and independent living programs.
