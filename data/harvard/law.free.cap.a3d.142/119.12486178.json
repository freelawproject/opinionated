They assert the Third Class City Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not otherwise authorize the City to impose recycling fees because the City is organized and operates under a home rule charter. They claim the trial court erred in considering how other municipalities fund their recycling programs, and that the City disregarded permissible alternative options to fund its recycling program. Upon review, we find it necessary to vacate and remand for further analysis based on our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management of Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Protection,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891502\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/273/6891502/\">\n    107 A.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2015) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ), which was filed approximately one month after the trial court's decision here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The City is a third class city located in Berks County, operating under a home rule charter. The Reading Area Water Authority (RAWA) is a municipal authority created under the Municipality Authorities Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City delegated the responsibility for solid waste planning and plan implementation under Section 303(d) of Act 101, 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.303(d), to RAWA. Residents either reside in or maintain a place of business in the City and have paid recycling fees to the City or RAWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2014, Residents filed a class action complaint against the City and RAWA (collectively, City), challenging the City's assessment and collection of a service fee for curbside recycling. In one count, Residents sought a declaratory judgment that the City's ordinances, which authorized the curbside recycling fees, violated\n   Act 101 and the Solid Waste Management Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SWMA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response, City filed preliminary objections to the complaint, which included objections that Residents did not exhaust an exclusive and adequate statutory remedy and that class action status was not maintainable. Residents, in turn, filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the City from assessing and collecting curbside recycling fees. The parties agreed to defer all motions and pleadings until the trial court ruled on the count for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, the parties filed a joint stipulation of facts containing 120 facts, and briefs in support of their positions. In response to the trial court's request for supplemental data, the parties filed a supplemental stipulation of facts adding 68 additional facts. The facts, which are not in dispute, can be summarized as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1988, the General Assembly passed Act 101. Joint Stipulation, 9/3/14, at \u00b6 1. Section 1501 of Act 101, 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.1501, mandates municipalities with populations over 10,000, which includes the City, to establish and implement recycling programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. In 1991, while operating under the Third Class City Code, the City enacted Ordinance 21-1991 pursuant to Act 101, which imposed a curbside recycling fee on persons owning property within its borders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. In 1996, the City adopted a home rule charter pursuant to the Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Home Rule Law), and it continued collecting the recycling fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From 1991 through 2012, the City contracted with private haulers to collect curbside recycling. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 12. In 2012, the City began in-house collection of recyclables and delegated the responsibility to RAWA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City assessed a fee for the collection of recyclable materials from 1991 until November 2013. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 24. In November 2013, following this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Reading v. Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the City temporarily suspended the assessment and collection of curbside recycling fees. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2014, the City revised its ordinance relating to the collection of curbside waste, including recycling, by enacting Ordinances 20-2014 and 21-2014. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 86a-92a. Ordinance 20-2014 replaced the solid waste fee and recycling fee with a single \"curbside waste collection fee.\" Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 33. Ordinance 20-2014's definition of \"curbside waste\" includes recyclables.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. Ordinance 21-2014 set the amount of the new \"curbside waste collection fee\" of $303.10.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37. Imbedded in that fee is a service fee for recycling of $91.83.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. The ordinances apply to owners of residential properties with four or fewer units; they are not permitted to use a private hauler for curbside recycling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 29. In April 2014, the City resumed assessment and collection service fees for curbside recycling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To operate its curbside recycling collection program, the City budgeted $2,400,000 in 2014, $2,774,905 in 2013, and $2,614,616 in 2012. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. The City's budgeted expenditures for its recycling program include 1 part-time and 15 full-time employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. The City pays $1,022,033 a year in salaries, temporary wages, fringe benefits and pensions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City's funding for the recycling program comes from three main financial sources: the fee, which is the subject of this challenge; grants under Sections 902 and 904 of Act 101, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4000.902, 4000.904 ; and, the marketing and sale of recycled materials. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 36-40, 54-88, 94. The City currently collects approximately $2,300,000 in recycling fees and less than $100,000 from the marketing and sale of recyclable materials per year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   awarded the City grants under Sections 902 and 904 of Act 101. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 54, 58, 67, 73-83, 85-87. Section 902 grants can be used for limited purposes while Section 904 grants, also known as performance grants, may be used for any lawful purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Municipalities may apply for Section 902 grants periodically, but not on an annual basis. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 47. The City did not seek Section 902 grants from 2009 to 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. The City most recently received a Section 902 grant of $250,000 in January 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. Since Act 101 was passed, the City has received less than $2 million in Section 902 grants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Municipalities may apply for Section 904 grants annually.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 73-87. Section 904 performance grants are awarded based on the tonnage of recyclable materials collected in the municipality and actually marketed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. The City received Section 904 performance grants in the amount of $86,132 in materials collected and marketed in 2010, $96,168 for 2011, and $86,760 for 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 85-87. In previous years, the Section 904 grants were larger before DEP reduced the recyclable grants by 60% in 2011 in order to ensure the sustainability of the Recycling Fund.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84. The City does not have records indicating it received 904 grants prior to 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City never requested an exemption from Act 101's mandate to establish a recycling program. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 96. The City never filed an application to implement an alternative recycling program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97. At no time has the City complained, petitioned or otherwise notified DEP that it should be relieved of its Act 101 obligations because its recycling program costs are excessive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Volume-wise, the City averages approximately 12,000 tons of residential and commercial recyclable materials that are collected and marketed per year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 81-83, 85-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the supplemental stipulation, the parties provided statistics on comparable cities' recycling programs. The comparable cities included Bethlehem, Lancaster, York, Allentown, Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, which are a variety of three third class cities, two third class cities with home rule charters, and one second class A city with a home rule charter. Supplemental Stipulation,\n   11/6/14, at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13, 24, 35, 49, 58. Four cities surveyed largely depend on the assessment and collection of recycling fees to fund their recycling programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20, 30, 42, 53, 54, 64, 65. Although the City of Scranton collects a waste disposal collection fee, which excludes recyclables, the revenues generated are deposited in the city's general fund, which in turn funds the city's recycling program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 46, 47. Significantly, the Cities of Lancaster, Scranton and York realized no revenue from the marketing and sale of collected recyclables in 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 \u00b6 27, 38, 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 5, 2014, the trial court entered an order granting declaratory judgment in favor of the City. In the accompanying opinion, the trial court explained its decision was not controlled by\n   <em>\n    Iezzi\n   </em>\n   because: (1)\n   <em>\n    Iezzi\n   </em>\n   was voided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court; (2) the parties provided relevant stipulations of fact, which were not before the Court in\n   <em>\n    Iezzi;\n   </em>\n   (3) Act 101 does not explicitly permit or prohibit recycling fees, and relevant case law interpreting Act 101 only prohibits fees that cover\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   costs associated with the recycling program; and, (4) after\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   the General Assembly amended the Third Class City Code to specifically allow third class cities to assess and collect rates for the collection, removal and disposal of recyclable materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With regard to the central legal issue, whether the City's new \"curbside waste collection fee\" is inconsistent with, and therefore preempted by, Act 101, the trial court's entire discussion follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court finds that the City's recycling program is not solely supported by the recycling fee. In addition, without the fee, maintaining the recycling program would be impossible. Using the [\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Waste Industries Association v. Monroe County Municipal Waste Management Authority,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303140\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/546/\">\n    80 A.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2013) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ) ] analysis, because the City uses grants and recyclable sales to supplement the recycling fee, and because the Act 101 mandated recycling program couldn't survive without the fee, the fee itself supports Act 101's primary purpose of alleviating the growth of landfills and the subsidization of the costs with the sale of recyclables and state grants, comporting with both the spirit and the letter of Act 101.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/5/14, at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 15, 2014, the trial court amended its order so that it could be appealed in the event this Court considered the initial order interlocutory. Residents appealed to this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they filed a\n   concise statement of errors complained of on appeal with the trial court. In response, the trial court issued an order adopting its earlier-filed opinion. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Residents contend the City's ordinances, which provide for a curbside recycling fee, are preempted by Act 101. According to Residents, the City is not otherwise authorized by statute to assess and collect a recycling fee. Although the General Assembly amended the Third Class City Code thereby authorizing third class cities to impose recycling fees, the Code does not apply to the City because the City is organized and operates under a home rule charter. In addition, Residents claim the trial court erred by considering what other local governments do in determining whether the City can implement a curbside service fee to fund its recycling program. Finally, Residents maintain the City disregarded permissible alternative options to imposing a recycling fee under Act 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, Residents contend the City's new ordinances establishing a fee to fund its recycling program violates Act 101 and SWMA. In Act 101, the General Assembly designated the type of fees that can be collected and which entity is legally entitled to collect them. These fees are a $2 per ton recycling fee imposed on operators of municipal waste landfills or resource recovery facilities to be paid to the DEP and a host municipality benefit fee of $1 per ton to be paid to the operator of a municipal waste landfill or resource recovery facility. Sections 701 &amp; 1301 of Act 101, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4000.701, 4000.1301. A fee imposed on property owners for curbside recycling collection is not delineated under Act 101. A municipality can only impose a recycling fee if it is authorized. Under Act 101, municipalities are to use planning, grants and other incentives, as well as revenue realized from the marketing of recyclables, to fund the recycling programs, nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition, Residents claim the City's ordinances contravene this Court's prior authority, which have consistently held recycling fees are preempted because they conflict with Act 101.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waste Management,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891502\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/273/6891502/\">\n    107 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   286 ;\n   <em>\n    Monroe County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303140\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/546/\">\n    80 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 ;\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   78 A.3d at 1268 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    IESI PA Bethlehem Landfill Corp. v.

Most recently, this Court, in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891502\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/273/6891502/\">\n    107 A.3d at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reaffirmed that \"Act 101 does not contemplate local recycling fees to fund recycling programs, and it does not authorize such fees.\" Significantly, in\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   this Court struck down a similar service fee to cover the costs of the City's recycling program. 78 A.3d at 1268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Contrary to the City's assertions, there is no statutory or common law basis for permitting recycling fees that only\n   <em>\n    partially\n   </em>\n   fund a recycling program. To the extent the fee in\n   <em>\n    Iezzi\n   </em>\n   referred to a fee that covered \"all costs,\" the Court merely pointed to language contained in the City's former ordinance. Although the City's new ordinances changed the terminology, the ordinances contain the same language as before-\"a service fee to cover\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   costs associated with the collection and removal of all curbside waste.\" Section 496-208(2) of Ordinance 20-2014; R.R. at 87a. Residents raise the same facial challenge that was raised in\n   <em>\n    Iezzi.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the same result in\n   <em>\n    Iezzi\n   </em>\n   should apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The City responds that its curbside waste fee is not inconsistent with the provisions or purposes of Act 101. The General Assembly's intent in enacting Act 101's preemption provision was to avoid \"inconsistency of municipal regulations of municipal waste disposal and state regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Monroe County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303140\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/546/\">\n    80 A.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Funding of municipal recycling programs is done \"through planning, grant, and other incentives\" because Act 101 contains \"no mention of recycling revenue from other sources.\"\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   78 A.3d at 1265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The City concedes \"a municipality's imposition of a service charge which covered\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   costs of its recycling program [is] inconsistent with the comprehensive statewide recycling funding provisions in Act 101 and related statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Monroe County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303140\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/546/\">\n    80 A.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). However, the City attempts to assert an as-applied defense. Although language of the ordinance recommends a fee that covers all costs for curbside waste, in actuality, the recycling fee does not cover\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   costs of the City's recycling program. The City uses the recycling fee to supplement Act 101 grants and revenue from recyclable sales. In so doing, the City is acting consistent with the provisions and purposes of Act 101 because it encourages waste reduction and marketing of recyclables.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   78 A.3d at 1268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The City further maintains that Act 101's funding mechanisms, standing alone, are insufficient to cover operating costs. Indeed, the program costs greatly exceed the sum of available funds from the state and revenue realized from the marketing of recyclables, creating a gap of over $2 million. Although Act 101 is silent with regard to the imposition of fees for curbside recycling, a comprehensive reading of Act 101 demonstrates that the General Assembly did not intend to impede a municipality's ability to fill this gap through the imposition of a reasonable fee to support a mandatory curbside collection program. The General Assembly is well aware of the funding gap in Act 101. The General Assembly never intended to displace the authority of municipalities to enact the most obvious and equitable means of filling that gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Since the enactment of Act 101, the General Assembly amended both the Second\n   Class City Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Third Class City Code by specifically authorizing the implementation and collection of a recycling collection fee. The amendments to the Codes conclusively demonstrate that the General Assembly does not view curbside waste fees as inconsistent with the provisions of Act 101. Because the City's curbside waste fee is \"otherwise authorized by statute,\"\n   <em>\n    Monroe County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303140\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/546/\">\n    80 A.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and is not inconsistent with Act 101's provisions and purposes, it follows that Act 101 does not preempt it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition, the City urges the Court to reconcile any perceived inconsistency based on prior case law by allowing municipalities to charge recycling fees provided they do not cover\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   costs and they utilize grants, offsets and other incentives to fund the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   78 A.3d at 1257. Had the General Assembly wished to impose a significant limitation on municipalities' ability to offset what is essentially a huge, unfunded mandate, it would have done so explicitly in Act 101. It would be absurd to mandate municipalities to implement recycling programs but yet deny them the ability to adequately fund them. As the trial court aptly observed, if \"the City is not authorized to collect a recycling fee\" that \"would likely result in the elimination of the established recycling program.\" Trial Court Opinion at 9. Such an interpretation is contrary to Act 101's fundamental purpose of alleviating the rapidly diminishing disposal capacity for municipal waste.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 102(a) of Act 101, 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.102(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the City argues Residents have not shown any violation or inconsistency with Act 101 to justify express or conflict preemption. To the contrary, the ordinances, which fund the City's recycling program, further the fundamental purpose of Act 101 by encouraging development of waste reduction and recycling. The fee in this case is compatible with the goals and funding scheme expressed in Act 101 because, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Iezzi,\n   </em>\n   the current service charge fills the funding gap, but it does not cover \"all costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

As discussed above, Act 101 is silent with regard to curbside recycling fees. Although we have struck down various fees, we ultimately held \"Act 101 does not preempt other local fees which\n   <em>\n    are otherwise permitted by statute\n   </em>\n   and which\n   <em>\n    are not inconsistent with Act 101's provisions and purposes.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Monroe County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303140\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/80/546/\">\n    80 A.3d at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The General Assembly authorized second and third class cities to impose recycling fees in its amendments to the Second and Third Class City Codes.

Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Next, Residents argue the trial court erred by relying on fees imposed by other local governments to uphold the City's fee. Residents assert the implementation of recycling fees by other local governments has no bearing on the legality of the City's ordinances. The other local governments may come under different codes and charters. Moreover, it is unclear whether the fees imposed by other local governments would survive if challenged. They claim it should not be their burden to identify municipalities that do not charge a service fee to fund the operation of their recycling programs. Notwithstanding, Residents point out that the City of Scranton does not charge a service fee to fund its recycling program; but rather, it funds the program through its General Fund and DEP performance grants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In addition, Residents assert, if the City cannot fund its recycling program without the imposition of a service fee, the City\n   may opt out of the recycling program. Finally, they claim the inability of some local governments to implement their recycling program without charging a recycling fee is an issue for the General Assembly, not this Court. Until such time as the General Assembly amends Act 101, the City has no right to impose a recycling fee on its property or business owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The City responds that the trial court properly examined information from other municipalities as confirming the City's experience. None of the six cities examined accomplished a \"self-sustained\" recycling program. The experience of the other cities shows there is nothing unusual or inefficient about the City's case. Significantly, it illustrates how mandated municipalities would struggle to sustain their recycling programs without a user fee. As the trial court found, \"it is clear that funds, grants and marketing of recyclables alone, as suggested by [Residents] as the sole means permitted by Act 101 of paying for recycling, is infeasible.\" Trial Court Opinion at 9. As for Residents' claim that Scranton does not charge a service fee to fund its recycling program, the City explains Scranton assesses an annual waste disposal fee to cover the cost of its waste disposal services (including curbside recycling). The receipts from this fee are deposited in Scranton's General Fund, which is then used to pay all the costs of Scranton's curbside recycling collection. To argue that Scranton does not collect a fee to support its curbside recycling program is sophistry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Further, the City argues, if Residents' \"other alternatives,\" discussed below, were anything other than ephemeral, then at least one of these municipalities would have opted to take them, rather than enact a fee on its residents. None of the six cities listed have been able to accomplish a self-sustaining recycling program without the imposition of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, at the trial court's request, the parties submitted supplemental stipulations regarding Act 101 funding and how other similarly-situated municipalities fund their recycling programs. Contrary to Residents' assertions, the trial court did not rely on the fees imposed by other local governments to uphold the City's fee. Rather, the trial court determined the City's ordinances are not inconsistent with Act 101 and are authorized by the Third Class City Code. The trial court merely considered the collective experience of other municipalities in determining the availability of state funding and their ability to self-sustain recycling programs without imposing a curbside fee. In other cases before this Court, we did not have as much information regarding the availability of state funding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Waste Management; Iezzi.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion with regard to this information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, Residents maintain the City disregarded alternative options to fund the recycling program. When the General Assembly enacted Act 101, it devised a clear pathway for municipalities to fund their recycling programs, which did not include imposing a recycling fee under Act 101. Act 101 provides grant funding to pay for the costs of the recycling program. It also\n   enabled municipalities to operate their own resource recovery facilities or non-curbside recycling program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4000.1301, 4000.1501(h). They claim Act 101 allows a municipality to discontinue its program if the costs to operate the program are excessive. 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.1712.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Residents assert, although the City applied for some grants through Act 101, it did not exhaust all available opportunities to obtain grants. For instance, the City did not seek Section 902 grants from 2009 through 2011. It did not avail itself of the other funding alternatives, such as a resource recovery facility or non-curbside recycling. Instead, it chose to implement proscribed service fees, which constitute $2.3 million of its $2.4 million budget to operate the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The City defends that Residents' alternatives are more theoretical than real. According to the City, Residents offer nothing but speculation and conjecture regarding the existence of these \"alternatives\" and invites the City to negate them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With regard to Residents' claim the City did not seek Section 902 grants from 2009 through 2011, Section 902 grants may only be used to identify markets, develop a public education campaign, or purchase collection, processing and storage equipment. 25 Pa.Code \u00a7 272.331. Municipalities are specifically prohibited from using Section 902 grants to cover maintenance costs or direct salaries. 25 Pa.Code \u00a7 272.332. Further, municipalities cannot apply for Section 902 grants on an annual basis, and the grants themselves are limited to a maximum of $250,000. 44 Pa. Bulletin 2708 (May 3, 2014); Joint Stipulation at \u00b6 47. Because the City applied for Section 902 grant funds in 2008, the earliest it could have sought additional funds was 2010, and then not again until 2012, which it did. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 65, 66. Residents do not suggest how an extra $250,000 of limited use grant funds would help defray an annual structural operating deficit of over $2 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   With regard to Section 904 grants, the City explains they are performance grants awarded based on the total weight of recyclable materials that are collected within the municipality and which are actually marketed. 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.904(b) ; Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52. From 2000 to 2011, the average annual amount of performance grant awarded under Section 904 was $157,321, and the most the City received in a single year during that period was $203,502 in 2010. Joint Stipulation at \u00b6\u00b6 73-88. Since 2011, DEP reduced all award amounts to 60% of the original amount; as a result, the City received grant awards of $86,132 for 2010, $96,168 for 2011, and $86,760 for 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The City also rejects Residents' claim that the City could have, but did not, apply for permission to operate an alternative program to curbside recycling under Section 1501(h) of Act 101, 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.1501(h). Section 1501(h) is not an open invitation to municipalities to explore a variety of potential alternatives to the standard \"source-separation and collection program for recyclable materials.\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.1501(a).

According to the City, resource recovery facilities have nothing to do with recycling. In fact, Act 101 specifically excludes recycling. Section 103 of Act 101,\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.103. Therefore, \"Residents' assertion that '[t]he City could have opened [its] own resource recovery facility in order to generate revenues to fund the recycling program' or sold 'recyclable materials deposited at the facility' is a fallacy.

To the contrary, Section 1712(a) only provides an affirmative defense to certain types of enforcement actions brought by DEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Notwithstanding, Residents presented no evidence to the trial court that any of these \"alternatives\" remotely approach the generation of funds necessary to displace the City's curbside recycling fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

A mandated municipality can comply with its source separation and collection obligations through the use of a recycling facility, so long as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (1) Materials separated, collected, recovered or created by the recycling facility can be marketed as readily as materials collected through a curbside recycling program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (2) The mechanical separation technology used in the recycling facility has been demonstrated to be effective for the life of operations at the facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 4000.1501(h).

Specifically, Section 103 of Act 101 defines a \"resource recovery facility\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A processing facility that provides for the extraction and utilization of materials or energy from municipal waste that is generated offsite, including, but not limited to, a facility that mechanically extracts materials from municipal waste, a combustion facility that converts the organic fraction of municipal waste to usable energy, and any chemical and biological process that converts municipal waste into a fuel product.
