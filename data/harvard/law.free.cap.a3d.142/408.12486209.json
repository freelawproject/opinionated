Hayes, Jr., and Manchester/Hebron Avenue, LLC, appeal from the judgment of the trial court granting the motion to dismiss their action filed by the defendant, the town of Glastonbury. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' inverse condemnation action on the ground that they failed to meet the finality requirement for a claim of a regulatory taking of property without just compensation in violation of article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs\n   claim that the court improperly (1) failed to consider the prior application rule and its preclusive effect on future applications for a special permit, (2) failed to conclude that this court's decision\n   in\n   <em>\n    Hayes Family Ltd.

On June 27, 2005, the plaintiffs filed an application for a special permit to construct a CVS pharmacy located on 2.4 acres of land located at the corner of Hebron Avenue and Manchester Road in Glastonbury. The subject property is zoned for commercial development, but all uses require a special permit with design review approval. The property is abutted by an established single-family neighborhood in a rural residential zone. Following an extended public hearing, the town's Plan and Zoning Commission (commission) denied the application because of its scale and intensity in relation to the size and topography of the parcel, its impact on and lack of compatibility with the existing neighborhood, and the inadequacy of the proposed landscaping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs appealed from the commission's decision to the Superior Court, which dismissed their appeal on the ground that the decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Following this court's granting of the plaintiffs' petition for certification to appeal, they filed their appeal challenging the trial court's determination. This court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Hayes Family Ltd. Partnership v. Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063690\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/115/655/\">\n    115 Conn.App. at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%2061\">\n    974 A.2d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 1, 2009, the plaintiffs commenced the present action against the defendant, claiming that the denial of their application for a special permit \"preclude[d] any reasonable economical development of the site and constitute [d] a[n] [unconstitutional] taking without just compensation....\" The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the facts as pleaded were insufficient to establish the finality required for an unconstitutional taking claim. The court,\n   <em>\n    Aurigemma, J.,\n   </em>\n   concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the commission would not allow any reasonable alternative use of the property and dismissed the action. On appeal, this court concluded that the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing before deciding the motion to dismiss and, therefore, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Family Ltd.

The parties agreed that if the court concluded that the plaintiffs had established finality, the court would deny the motion to dismiss and then determine whether they had proved their claim of inverse condemnation. After several days of evidence,\n   the parties filed posttrial briefs for the court's consideration. On February 6, 2015, the court issued its memorandum of decision granting the defendant's motion to dismiss and rendering judgment of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its decision, the court recited the factual and procedural background of the case, the case law applicable to regulatory taking actions, the case law applicable to the finality requirement, and a summary of the testimony and exhibits presented to the court with respect to proposed alternatives for development at the site. The court, in a comprehensive and well reasoned decision, addressed the plaintiffs' claims as set forth during the trial and in their posttrial brief, and concluded that they \"failed to meet their burden to prove finality.\" In reaching that conclusion, the court stated: \"The rejection of the 13,000 square foot CVS prototype, without examining whether an alternative might pass muster, does not establish finality. Moreover, this court does not agree with the plaintiffs that a revised application for a different development with presumably a different impact might not be acceptable under the reasons for denial in the first application.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We conclude that the record supports the court's factual and legal bases for its conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the finality requirement for judicial review of an inverse condemnation claim. It would serve no useful purpose for this court to repeat the analysis contained in the trial court's decision. See\n   <em>\n    Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v.

We therefore adopt that decision as the proper statement of the relevant facts, issues, and applicable law. See\n   <em>\n    Hayes Family Ltd. Partnership v.

Those particular claims relate to the alleged preclusive effect of the prior application rule and this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hayes Family Ltd. Partnership v.

In considering a subsequent variance application where it has already denied a similar prior one,\n   [a] zoning board of appeals is generally precluded from reversing a prior decision unless there has been a material change of conditions, or other considerations have intervened affecting the merits, and no vested rights have arisen.... The board is disallowed from revisiting its prior determination that the requirements for a variance are not present because, if a reversal of that determination was allowed, there would be no finality to the proceeding [and] the result would be subject to change at the whim of members or due to the effect of influence exerted upon them, or other undesirable elements tending to uncertainty and impermanence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Finality of decision is just as desirable in the case of an exception [or permit] as in one involving a variance. Because of the nature of an exception [or permit], however, the power of a zoning board to review a prior decision denying the exception [or permit] is not limited, as it is when a variance is sought, to the two situations mentioned above. An additional situation arises when the owner requesting an exception [or permit] files a subsequent application altering the plan under which he previously sought the exception [or permit], in order to meet the reasons for which the board denied the prior one.... To justify a special exception [or permit] ... it must appear that the manner in which the owner proposes to use his property will satisfy the conditions imposed by the regulations. If, therefore, upon a second request for a special exception [or permit], there is a substantial change in the manner of use planned by the owner, the board is faced with an application materially different from the one previously denied. It may well be that the new plan, by reason of the changes made therein, will succeed, where the former failed, in satisfying the conditions enumerated in the regulations. Under such circumstances, the\n   board is not precluded from granting the second application merely because it has denied the first....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"A subsequent [permit] application made in order to bring a prior application into compliance with applicable regulations, no matter how minor the work involved may be, is clearly not minor in regard to its significance and effect.... The board may grant the exception [or permit] once it finds that all the requirements of the ordinance have been satisfied....\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grasso v.

Although the plaintiffs contended that they would not be accepted by the commission because\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   commercial development would result in an adverse impact to the neighborhood, it is sheer speculation to assume that a less intensive proposal than the one originally submitted would be denied by the commission. It is true that, under the prior application rule, the plaintiffs could not submit the same proposal for approval; however, changes made to bring a future application into compliance with the regulations may or may not be acceptable to the commission. \"[B]y refusing to engage the commission in the zoning approval process, [the applicant] eliminated the possibility that this matter could be resolved by local political choices and settlements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC v.

According to the plaintiffs, the preclusive effect is certain because of \"the Appellate Court's\n   <em>\n    finding\n   </em>\n   that a commercial development on the subject property would have an adverse impact on neighboring residences.\" (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs also claim that \"[t]he Appellate Court\n   <em>\n    found\n   </em>\n   that the proposed development would adversely impact the neighboring residences with regard to noise, traffic, and property values.\" (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs contend that \"[t]he Appellate Court's\n   <em>\n    findings\n   </em>\n   were not based upon any particular characteristics of [the] plaintiffs' proposal but, rather, were based upon it being a commercial development adjacent to residences. Such\n   <em>\n    findings\n   </em>\n   doom any alternative commercial development at the subject site because any commercial development will have an adverse impact on the neighboring residences under the Appellate Court's reasoning upholding the commission's denial.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs have mischaracterized the holding in that decision. This court reviewed the evidence in the record to determine if it was sufficient to support the commission's denial of a particular application for a special permit.

The record reflects that the proposed retaining wall was among the largest that the commission had ever reviewed and that it was atypical in that such steep slopes are generally found in connection with road construction projects, not residential neighborhoods. The evidence revealed that the removal of the excavated material from the site would require more than 5700 dump truck loads and more than 11,000 round trips, with a truck leaving the site every two minutes.

In order to establish a prima facie case, the proponent must submit evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to establish the fact or facts which it is adduced to prove.... [T]he evidence offered by the plaintiff is to be taken as true and interpreted in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], and every reasonable inference is to be drawn in [the plaintiff's] favor.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%201241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    In the present case, the Appellate Court acknowledged that \"the plaintiffs were required to establish the finality of the commission's determination to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court.... On the basis of the complaint and the affidavits submitted by both parties, the court determined that the plaintiffs could not prove finality because the plaintiffs only submitted one special permit application for a particularly intensive development.\" (Citations omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Hayes Family Ltd.

As previously noted, the Appellate Court found that in light of our motion practice, an evidentiary hearing was required on factual disputes.

The motion for judgment of dismissal, taking the plaintiffs' evidence as true, cannot really address the fundamental issue of the finality of the agency decision with only one application, i.e., if there are other uses for the property, and, more importantly, if any other application would be rejected. The finality issue is addressed in this decision notwithstanding the denial of the motion for judgment of dismissal. Of course, a plaintiff's initial success in establishing a prima facie case does not equate to success on the merits; the plaintiff's testimony can be rebutted. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Fisher v.

After a public hearing and discussion on December 4, 2006, the board denied the request by a vote of two to three. (Pls. exhs. 26-27.) The plaintiffs did not appeal from that decision, nor is that denial a basis for the present case.
