The County's decision denied the theater's application for real estate tax exemption on the basis that the theater was not an institution of \"purely public charity\" within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The theater contends that the trial court erred. It contends that, because the theater relieves the government of a burden, it satisfied the mandates of the Pennsylvania Constitution. It also argues that it fully satisfies the terms of the Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act (Charity Act), Act of November 26, 1997, P.L. 508,\n   <em>\n    as amended,\n   </em>\n   10 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 371 -385. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pocono Community Theater (Theater) was organized to preserve an historic movie theater in downtown East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. As a non-profit Section 501(c)(3) corporation, Theater is exempt from federal and state taxation. Its board of directors serves on a volunteer basis. It employs one person, a general manager. According to its by-laws, Theater's purpose is to \"provide independent and art films offering a unique cinematic experience that enlivens the human spirit and promote[s] learning; while promoting local visual artists on the stage and in exhibition.\" Reproduced Record (R.R. ----) at 75. Theater hosts a number of community programs and events, donating marketing and theater space for educational programs. These events include artist receptions, lectures, and programs for members, communication organizations, and students. Theater hosts approximately 100 events per year. Theater also screens first-run studio, independent, and art house films nearly every day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ticket sales and contributions constitute Theater's revenue. Contributions come in two forms: outright gifts and \"membership\" fees. Membership guarantees the member a one-year discount on movie tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July of 2013, Theater requested an exemption from real estate taxes as a purely public charity, but County denied the request. On April 2, 2014, Theater appealed to the trial court. A hearing was held on September 30, 2014. The trial court heard testimony from Raymond Scheetz, Theater's founder and president; Deborah Boyle, Theater's accountant; and Courtney Tolino, Theater's general manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scheetz testified about some of the events Theater had hosted or sponsored. These include monthly meetings of a Gay and Straight Alliance student group from the local high school; screening a documentary on bullying for local high school students; hosting a latchkey program where children were taught how to write and film screenplays; three symposia on Lyme disease ; multiple fundraising events for diabetes research; a program on behalf of the local hospital addressing depression; art exhibits; and film festivals for a local college. Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 9/30/14 at 6. Scheetz explained that Theater was an important part of East Stroudsburg's ten-year plan to improve\n   the city's downtown appeal with enhanced cultural opportunities. N.T. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When questioned whether Theater was in reality primarily engaged in the business of showing movies, Scheetz responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Well, I wouldn't call it the primary activity. If you go to the movies during the week, you may find nobody in the theater or maybe one or two people. It's a law by the film studios. You have to be open 365. It's not by our-if I had my druthers, I would have the movies only operate a couple days a week and not have it during the week because you are losing money, but the point is that our members that want to see these so-called programs pay memberships to keep the theater open. We cannot survive without our members, but they don't come during the week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   N.T. 25-26. Furthermore, Scheetz explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Ticket sales do not operate the theater. It's the members that keep the theater open for various reasons, and the membership has grown considerably and their interests because of all the programs we're doing including the performance on the stage, the plays, the book readings and so forth that we do. That's what really attracts more and more members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A lot of the members don't even come to the movies. They support the theater because they want the theater to be there. The studios take a major portion. If you have a large movie, the studios will take 65 percent at times, minimum 50 percent. So if you take the fees for the movies that you are paying out, plus all of the expenses of showing the movies, it's actually a lost cause. The members of the theater keep the theater open, not the ticket sales.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   N.T. 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Scheetz further testified that, even with the gifts and membership sales, Theater was not doing well financially and would not likely be able to pay property taxes in addition to its other expenses. Boyle, Theater's accountant, corroborated Scheetz's testimony. According to Boyle, Theater was barely making ends meet. To support Boyle's testimony, Theater submitted tax returns for fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. The tax returns relayed the following figures:\n  </p>\n  <table id=\"p-22\">\n   <tbody>\n    <tr>\n     <th>\n      <strong>\n       2010\n      </strong>\n     </th>\n     <th>\n      <strong>\n       2011\n      </strong>\n     </th>\n     <th>\n      <strong>\n       2012\n      </strong>\n     </th>\n     <th>\n      <strong>\n       2013\n      </strong>\n     </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Ticket Income\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $309,573\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $395,080\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $268,487\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $200,409\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Other Income\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $0\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $7,190\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $84,050\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $68,559\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Membership Sales\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $51,730\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $47,087\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $45,602\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $43,140\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Contributions\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $119,807\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $22,708\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $167,601\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $263,989\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Gross Income\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $481,110\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $472,065\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $565,740\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $576,097\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Expenses\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $431,905\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $500,072\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $488,107\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $474,933\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      <strong>\n       Net Income\n      </strong>\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $49,205\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      ($28,007)\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $77,633\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      $101,164\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Boyle acknowledged on cross-examination that ticket sales, as well as contributions, are necessary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Well, I mean-you know, let's get basic here.

Tolino clarified that any profit made from selling movie tickets is invested in Theater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 31, 2014, the trial court issued an opinion and order denying Theater's appeal from the County's decision. The trial court held that Theater failed to qualify as a \"purely public charity\" under the Pennsylvania Constitution because it did not relieve the government of a burden. The trial court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Although [Theater] has provided educational programs for high school students, [East Stroudsburg University] students, the Stroud Area Regional Police Department and the Pocono Medical Center, these programs are not a significant portion of [Theater's] efforts. Clearly, [Theater] focuses first on its movie theater business and secondly on the use of films and its theaters for general use by non-profit community groups. Supporting local non-profit groups is an honorable undertaking, but it is not relieving the government of its burden in a significant way. The government has no obligation to present entertainment, and it likewise has no obligation to support non-profit fundraising.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trial court opinion at 12. The trial court explained that because it held that Theater did not satisfy the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hospital Utilization Project v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792355\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/1/\">\n    507 Pa. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792355\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/1/\">\n    487 A.2d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), it did not have to consider the statutory test for a purely public charity set forth in the Charity Act. Nevertheless, it did so. First, the trial court determined that Theater did not meet its burden of showing its Articles of Incorporation contained a provision ensuring that, upon dissolution of the corporation, any leftover assets would be donated to another charitable cause as required by Section 5(c)(4) of the Charity Act, 10 P.S. \u00a7 375(c)(4). Second, the trial court found that Theater did not prove that it rendered gratuitously a substantial portion of its services, as required by Section 5(d)(1) of the Charity Act, 10 P.S. \u00a7 375(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Theater filed post-trial motions. Although the County did not respond, the trial court denied the motions. Theater's appeal to this Court followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Theater contends that the trial court erred by its narrow understanding of what kind of activity relieves the government of a burden. Theater argues that the trial court's narrow understanding conflicts with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's instruction on the types of activities that can relieve the government\n   of a burden for purposes of the \"purely public charity\" tax exemption in the Pennsylvania Constitution. Theater also argues that the trial court erred in concluding that Theater did not satisfy Section 5(c)(4) and (d)(1) of the Charity Act's tax exemption criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Pennsylvania Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to exempt from taxation \"[i]nstitutions of purely public charity.\" Pa. Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 2 (a)(v). However, our Constitution does not define that term. For this reason, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court established a five-prong test to determine whether an institution qualifies as a purely public charity in\n   <em>\n    Hospital Utilization Project,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792355\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/1/\">\n    487 A.2d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition to providing public gardens, Longwood Gardens features \"architectural displays, a water garden, fountains, an open air theater for the performing arts, managed meadow and forest lands, wetlands, wildlife habitats, walking trails, picnic areas, and a variety of education and research facilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559406,11711934\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/397/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559406,11711934\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/397/\">\n    at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, Longwood Gardens hosts hundreds of cultural events each year as well as a variety of workshops and lectures. Longwood Gardens offers both gardens and services to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A local school district challenged Longwood Gardens' tax exemption on the basis that Longwood Gardens did not relieve the government of an obligation. The Pennsylvania\n   Supreme Court disagreed. It wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The government has routinely assumed a responsibility for providing open space for public recreation and for conservation of natural landscapes and resources, as well as for providing cultural assets. The Commonwealth has, in fact, established a wide-ranging assortment of parks, recreation areas, and cultural facilities throughout the state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In short, the government has long provided support for public parks and recreation areas\n   <em>\n    as well as for cultural institutions,\n   </em>\n   including museums, libraries, etc. Longwood's public park and cultural facilities fall clearly within the scope of burdens that are routinely shouldered by government. Hence, this element of the\n   <em>\n    HUP\n   </em>\n   test was properly found to be met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559406,11711934\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/397/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559406,11711934\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/397/\">\n    at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Supreme Court upheld Longwood Gardens' tax exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   County argues that\n   <em>\n    Unionville-Chadds Ford\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because Longwood Gardens is unique in that it enjoys an international reputation and provides services well beyond the means of the locality where it is situated. Theater, on the other hand, provides laudable, but ultimately ordinary services. This is evidenced by the fact that other movie theaters can provide Theater's offerings should it cease operation. By contrast, were Longwood Gardens to close its doors, no other institution could carry on its mission or legacy. Because Longwood Gardens' impact on the community is so meaningful and significant, it relieves the government of some of its burden to provide educational and recreational opportunities. Theater's services pale in comparison to those provided by Longwood Gardens. We disagree with County's argument that\n   <em>\n    Unionville-Chadds Ford\n   </em>\n   was limited to institutions offering cultural and recreational opportunities on the scale of Longwood Gardens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It may be true, as the trial court found, that Theater does not provide a statutorily or constitutionally mandated governmental function. However, we agree with Theater that the trial court interpreted the fourth prong of the\n   <em>\n    HUP\n   </em>\n   test too narrowly. As does Longwood Gardens, Theater supports and advances causes that the government has chosen to support. For instance, the record shows that Theater permits performing arts groups and art exhibits to use its facility for free, activities for which the government has assumed responsibility. The General Assembly has established the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, which is a state agency whose mission is to \"foster the excellence, diversity, and vitality of the arts in Pennsylvania and to broaden the availability and appreciation of those arts throughout the state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Local government has also undertaken the responsibility to support the arts. East Stroudsburg has adopted a ten-year plan to expand support for the performing arts and to enhance the city's cultural appeal. The city had no obligation to do so. Theater's efforts to provide a venue for musical and theatrical performances, as well as community events and art programs, furthers the government's assumed responsibility to support the arts while advancing historic preservation. Screening films, whether first-run or \"art\" films, is a cultural activity, which is why museums of every type also screen films.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Unionville-Chadds Ford\n   </em>\n   is dispositive. Theater is the type of \"cultural facility\" targeted by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Unionville-Chadds Ford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559406,11711934\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/397/\">\n    714 A.2d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Theater provides benefits to causes that the government supports and advances even though it is not obligated to do so. Accordingly, we hold that Theater relieves the government of a burden for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    HUP\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 5 of the Charity Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After it concluded that Theater was not a \"purely public charity\" under the\n   <em>\n    HUP\n   </em>\n   test, the trial court then decided that Theater also did not qualify for an exemption under the Charity Act. It concluded that Theater did not prove that, upon dissolution, its assets would be donated to a charity or that it renders a substantial portion of its services gratuitously. Theater challenges both conclusions as inconsistent with the uncontradicted evidence. County responds that once the trial court determined that Theater did not qualify as a \"purely public charity\" under the\n   <em>\n    HUP\n   </em>\n   test, its analysis should have ended.\n   <em>\n    Mesivtah Eitz Chaim of Bobov, Inc. v.

However, it chose to do so. Accordingly, we will decide the merits of Theater's argument that the trial court erred in holding that Theater does not qualify for a tax exemption under Sections 5(c)(4) and (d)(1) of the Charity Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Section 5(c)(4) of the Charity Act requires that \"[t]he governing body of the institution of purely public charity [adopt] as part of its articles of incorporation or, if unincorporated, other governing legal documents a provision that expressly prohibits the use of any surplus funds for private inurement to any person in the event of a sale or dissolution of the institution of purely public charity.\" 10 P.S. \u00a7 375(c)(4). The trial court held that because Theater did not offer its articles of incorporation into evidence, Theater did not meet its burden under Section 5(c)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Theater counters that its documented exemption from federal income tax establishes that in the event of a dissolution Theater's assets will be transferred to another charity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To obtain an exemption from federal income tax under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), a charity must provide the federal government evidence that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   upon dissolution, [its] assets would, by reason of a provision in the organization's articles or by operation of law, be distributed for one or more exempt purposes, or to the Federal Government, or to a State or local government, for a public purpose, or would be distributed by a court to another organization to be used in such manner as in the judgment of the court will best accomplish the\n   general purposes for which the dissolved organization was organized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.501\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)-1(b)(4).

Section 5(d)(1) identifies various ways an institution can demonstrate compliance. The trial court considered only whether Theater complied with Section 5(d)(1)(i) and (ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Theater contends that the trial court erred in not considering whether Theater qualified under Section 5(d)(1)(v).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Section 5(d)(1)(v) states that an institution \"render[s] gratuitously a substantial portion of its services\" if \"[u]ncompensated goods or services ... in the aggregate are equal to at least 5% of the institution's costs of providing goods or services.\" 10 P.S. \u00a7 375(d)(1)(v). Theater argues that it easily meets this test because its expenses vastly exceed its income. County disagrees, contending that Theater operated at a loss in only one year from 2010 to 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Section 5(d) of the Charity Act defines \"uncompensated goods or services\" as \"[t]he full cost of all goods or services provided by the institution for which the institution has not received monetary compensation or\n   <em>\n    the difference between the full cost and any lesser fee received\n   </em>\n   for the goods or services, including the cost of the goods or services provided to individuals unable to pay.\" 10 P.S. \u00a7 375(d)(4)(i) (emphasis\n   added). Thus, in order to determine whether the value of uncompensated goods or services rises to the level of at least 5% of the institution's cost, we need to determine the difference between Theater's full cost of providing services and the total fees it has received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In 2010, Theater had a total of $309,573 in income from ticket sales and other sources. Its expenses for providing all of its services totaled $431,905.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The difference between Theater's income and expenses results in a deficit of $122,332. As such, the only way Theater was able to have net income at the end of the year was through contributions and membership sales, which are a type of charitable donation and not a fee. Because 5% of $431,905 is $21,595.25, Theater was uncompensated for more than 5% of its goods and services. We need not go through every year because the results are the same: more than 5% of Theater's expenses were uncompensated. For this reason, Theater rendered gratuitously a substantial portion of its services as required by Section 5(d)(1)(v) of the Charity Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, the trial court erred in holding that Theater did not satisfy Section 5(c)(4) and (d)(1) of the Charity Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The trial court erred in holding that Theater did not relieve the government of a burden as required by the\n   <em>\n    HUP\n   </em>\n   test. Furthermore, the trial court erred in concluding that Theater did not meet the definition of an institution of purely public charity under Section 5(c)(4) and (d)(1)(v) of the Charity Act.
