Additionally, the plaintiff cross appeals claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly granted the motion to strike counts two and three of the complaint alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and wrongful termination in violation of public policy, respectively. We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly determined that the commission provision violated public policy and constituted a violation of \u00a7 31-72. With regard to the plaintiff's cross appeal, we hold that count two of the plaintiff's complaint alleging breach of the implied covenant of good\n   faith and fair dealing should not have been stricken but that count three\n   alleging wrongful discharge was properly stricken. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history and facts are relevant to this appeal. The defendant is a security services company that provides various protection services to industrial and commercial clients. These services are marketed through employees hired as business development managers (managers) who solicit new business from prospective and existing customers. In August, 2005, the defendant offered the plaintiff an at-will position as a manager. The defendant's offer letter, which the plaintiff signed in September, 2005, provided that the plaintiff's compensation was a weekly base salary and commissions on contracts he procured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The offer letter referenced and mirrored the defendant's 2003 sales incentive plan, which was in effect at the time the plaintiff commenced his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant subsequently amended its sales incentive plan effective December 23, 2006, and revised the commission provision at issue. Section II, part C of the 2006 sales incentive plan regarding sales eligibility requirements provides that \"[\n   <em>\n    c]ommission is only paid once work has been performed and invoiced to the client.\n   </em>\n   Upon termination of services to the client all commissions cease, except that commission will be paid up through and including the final invoice.\n   <em>\n    Upon the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    manager's\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    termination of employment, all commissions cease, except that any commissionable amounts that have been invoiced\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    to the client\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    manager's\n   </em>\n   ] [\n   <em>\n    t]ermination\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    d]ate, as defined in\n   </em>\n   [s]ection\n   <em>\n    IV.D, will still be paid commission as part of final pay to the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    manager\n   </em>\n   ].\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From 2005 to 2008, the plaintiff worked as a manager, on behalf of the defendant, marketing new and supplemental security services to new and existing customers. Based on the applicable sales incentive plan, once the contract was executed and the sales eligibility requirements were satisfied, including invoicing to the client, the plaintiff was entitled to commission payments without having to perform any other work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 22, 2008, Thomas R. Fagan, the defendant's regional vice president for human resources, hand delivered a memorandum to the plaintiff terminating his employment. The memorandum explained that the defendant had conducted an investigation into improper business activities that had resulted in significant risk exposure to the defendant and, as a result of the investigation findings, the defendant was terminating the plaintiff's employment effective May 22, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 18, 2009, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the defendant violated \u00a7 31-72, breached his employment contract by violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and wrongfully discharged him in violation of public policy. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's reasons for his termination \"were false and a pretext for nonpayment of owed commissions.\" The defendant moved to strike count two, alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and count three, alleging wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.

See id., at 161-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=745%20A.2d%20178\">\n    745 A.2d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that even if plaintiff's termination\n   violated public policy embodied in statute, plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim would be precluded due to existence of statutory remedy under that statute) The trial court then rendered a partial judgment for the defendant on the two stricken counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before trial, the parties agreed that \"the plaintiff's claim hinges on whether or not the language in the defendant's sales incentive plan, which provides that the right to commissions ceases upon the plaintiff's termination of employment, is enforceable.\" Therefore, the trial court agreed to decide the enforceability question and, in order to facilitate the trial court's determination, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts dated March 1, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court determined that, because the plaintiff's right to commissions was not contingent upon his providing any further services to the defendant's customers, he had fully earned his commissions when his employment was terminated. Thus, the trial court found that since the provision in the sales incentive plan deprived him of those earned commissions, resulted in forfeiture of wages, and applied even to an employee who is terminated for no cause, the provision was unenforceable because it \"violate[d] two public policies: the first, which strongly favors the payment of wages, and the second, which disfavors forfeitures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 16, 2014, the parties stipulated to a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for unpaid commissions pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, but preserved their respective rights to appeal. The defendant appealed from the stipulated judgment and the plaintiff cross appealed. We now turn to the merits of those appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the commission provision was not void on public policy grounds and, therefore, the failure to pay the plaintiff's commissions was not a violation of \u00a7 31-72. We begin by setting out the applicable standard of review and relevant legal principles. \"Although it is well established that parties are free to contract for whatever terms on which they may agree ... it is equally well established that contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable.... [T]he question [of] whether a contract is against public policy is [a] question of law dependent on the circumstances of the particular case, over which an appellate court has unlimited review.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hanks v.
