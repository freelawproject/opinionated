Although Chief Justice Rogers was not present when the case was argued before the court, she has read the briefs and appendices, and listened to a recording of the oral argument prior to participating in this decision.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   McDONALD, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The dispositive issue in this certified appeal is whether a trial court's purportedly improper exclusion of a prospective juror for cause on the ground that he was \"not able to speak and understand the English language\" within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) constitutes per se reversible error. The defendant, Jeffrey P. Gould, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the trial court's judgment of conviction, in light of its conclusion that\n   the trial court's improper exclusion of a venireperson on this basis was not prejudicial. The defendant contends that, because the assessment of the English language skills and accents of nonnative speakers may reflect implicit or unconscious bias relating to ancestry or national origin, the improper exclusion of a prospective juror on the basis of such factors should be deemed commensurate with the improper exclusion of a prospective juror on the basis of a suspect classification, which is subject to automatic reversal. We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court's excusal of the prospective juror for cause under \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) was subject to reversal only upon a showing of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts. The defendant was brought to trial on a charge of sexual assault in the first degree. During voir dire, an issue arose regarding the English proficiency of venireperson E,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   whose juror application revealed a Hispanic surname and listed his ethnicity as Puerto Rican.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After E answered several preliminary questions, which revealed, among other things, that he had attended college before being employed as a machinist, the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Have you or anyone close to you ever been a victim of a crime?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[E]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And are you comfortable telling me a little bit about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[E]: Well, kind of-do you want to hear?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: If you're comfortable telling me, yeah, sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[E]: Oh well, one time we are stopped by the police and they confused me by another person, and they like put something on me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: A guy came and pulled something on you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[E]: Yes, kind of like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay, and what did he pull on you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[E]: I think it was-there was after him one person and because he cannot get to that person, so he get close to me and reached to my pocket without me knowing because I was sitting down. So, when the police came, that guy told me, hey this guy put something on you. That's it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Court: If I can just interrupt for a moment?

It's important that you understand everything, because I never know-we never know beforehand what's going to be the most important part of the trial. I mean it's all important, so it's important that you understand everything that's said. Do you feel like you'll be able to understand everything that's said in the courtroom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[E]: I think so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Court: Okay, you don't anticipate any problems understanding what people are saying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[E]: No, no, in fact I understand what's your point. I got a big accent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The Court: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[E]: That when I talk, I know sometimes they tell me-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The Court: No, no, I understand-I just want to-whenever anybody talks to me in an accent and it's not just Spanish, I often inquire whether they can understand English well enough to be a juror. So you're comfortable doing that and that's fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[E]: Yes, yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After a further exchange with the prosecutor, E clarified that he was charged with a drug crime in connection with the incident in which a \"guy put something on [him],\" explaining that \"the police say that they see me throwing something out of my body and they put charges on me.\" E acknowledged that he had failed to disclose the charges related to that incident on his juror questionnaire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defense counsel also questioned E about his ability to understand English:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Okay. I know the judge touched on this a little bit, but is English your first language or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[E]: No, Spanish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: But you understand everything I said?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[E]: Yes, of course.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After the voir dire of E concluded, the state challenged him for cause, claiming that \"a good number of [E's] answers were not actually responsive to the questions that were being asked.\" In addition, the state asserted that E had failed to provide a full accounting of his criminal record on his juror questionnaire, suggesting that he either did not understand the form or intentionally had failed to disclose his criminal history, the latter of which would independently warrant disqualification. Defense counsel objected, citing, inter alia, E's college background and E's assurances that he understands English fully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court responded: \"Here's the problem I have.... I don't think [E] can communicate with the other members of the jury. I had an extremely hard time understanding his answers. And while he may understand the language because he certainly said he did, I have real concerns about in a jury room whether he's going to be able to fully participate with the other members of the jury in their deliberations for a verdict because he's extremely difficult to understand. There were times-numerous times where I did not understand what [E] was saying, and I think it's related to English not being his first language. I mean I think he's-I've no reason to believe intellectually he's not capable, but I think the language barrier is a substantial one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defense counsel argued that he had understood everything E said, \"other than ... his mumbling,\" to which the trial judge responded, \"[w]hich was often.... That's part of my point.\" Thereafter, the court ruled that it would excuse E for cause based on its view that \"he has a significant language barrier that will prevent him from fully participating as a juror in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant's case proceeded to trial, and the jury found him guilty as charged. The court rendered judgment accordingly, from which the defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On appeal before the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly excused E for cause, and that the significant interests implicated required automatic reversal of the judgment of conviction. The Appellate Court, with one judge concurring, affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gould,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%20392\">\n    155 Conn.App. 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Describing the issue as one of first impression in Connecticut, the Appellate Court initially determined that the statutory mandate that \"[a] person shall be disqualified to serve as a juror if such person ... is not able to speak and understand the English language\"; General Statutes \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) ; requires, at a minimum, that a prospective juror \"have sufficient language skills to understand the proceedings and resolve the factual issues presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Gould,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court underscored that, in making such an assessment, \"trial courts must be cognizant of the need to avoid prejudices, conscious and unconscious, that are associated with assessing the English language skills of nonnative speakers.\" Id., at 403,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in excusing E because the record did not support its determination that E \"would not be able to communicate with other jurors.\" Id., at 403-404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Notwithstanding that determination, the Appellate Court held that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial because he had failed to demonstrate that he suffered any actual prejudice as a result of E's excusal. Id., at 409,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his concurring opinion, Judge Prescott acknowledged that he \"share [d] the majority's recognition of the value and importance of promoting jury service by all qualified citizens regardless of their race, gender, color, creed or national origin,\" but disagreed with its conclusion that the trial court's excusal of E was improper.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Judge Prescott asserted that the \"majority virtually ignore[d] or, at most, pa[id] lip service to, the long established, highly deferential standard of review regarding a trial court's determination regarding a juror's competence to serve.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Judge Prescott concluded that the trial court's determination that E lacked sufficient proficiency in English to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) was a factual finding that, based on the cold record, was not clearly erroneous. Id., at 416-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Judge Prescott concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the state's challenge of E for cause. Id., at 423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court's disqualification of E did not require reversal of the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gould,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20912\">\n    316 Conn. 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20174\">\n    112 A.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The defendant contends that the improper excusal of E on the basis of his accent as a nonnative English speaker-which, according to the defendant, is \"a personal, essentially immutable characteristic closely related to ancestry or national origin\"-is tantamount to the improper exclusion of a prospective juror on the basis of race, which is prohibited under\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/#p96\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/#p96\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/#p96\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), and its progeny. Accordingly, the defendant\n   contends that, like a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation, the improper excusal of a prospective juror for cause solely on the basis of his accent requires automatic reversal rather than the customary harmful error analysis applied to nonconstitutional claims relating to jury selection. In response, the state both contests the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analogy drawn by the defendant and seeks affirmance on the alternative ground set forth in Judge Prescott's concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Before turning to the merits, we make certain clarifications. First, at no point in the proceedings in this case has the defendant contended that the trial court's action violated the dictates of any provision of either the state constitution or the federal constitution. Rather, he has contended that this court should consider certain fundamental interests protected thereunder when determining whether the improper excusal of a prospective juror for lack of sufficient English proficiency requires automatic reversal. Second, we disagree that the record demonstrates that the trial court excused E solely because of his accent. We think it is fairer to say that, at a minimum, the trial court determined that E had a significant language barrier due to the combination of his accent, a tendency to mumble, and the imprecise nature of some of his responses. Indeed, before the Appellate Court, the defendant characterized the record as showing only that E \" 'had more difficulty in speaking than someone for whom English is a first language....' \"\n   <em>\n    State v. Gould,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%20392\">\n    155 Conn.App. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With those clarifications in mind, we conclude that, even if we assume, without deciding, that the trial court abused its discretion in excusing E, the defendant nevertheless was not entitled to a new trial in the absence of proof that this decision prejudiced his right to an impartial jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[A]n impartial\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   fairly chosen jury is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system.\" (Emphasis added;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The judicial authorities of this state assuredly do not condone the disparate treatment of persons who are nonnative English speakers.

By not addressing the substantive issue of the propriety of the trial court's ruling, however, the majority leaves undisturbed the Appellate Court's conclusion, predicated upon an incorrect standard of review, that the trial court's ruling was improper. Specifically, the Appellate Court reviewed the trial court's factual finding-that E was unable to speak and understand English sufficiently to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) -to determine whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to support it.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Appellate Court provided no authority to support its view that the applicable standard of review of a trial court's finding pursuant to \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) that a prospective juror lacked sufficient proficiency in the English language is whether that finding has sufficient \"support in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nor did the court provide any explanation as to why it\n   believed that a sufficiency of the evidence standard of review was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   I agree with Judge Prescott, who observed in his concurring opinion at the Appellate Court that \"a trial court's determination that a prospective juror is unable to speak and understand English well enough to satisfy the requirements of ... \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) constitutes a finding of fact that rests on the court's personal observations of the juror's conduct and speech during his or her voir dire examination, a finding we cannot disturb unless it is clearly erroneous.\" Id., at 409,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A trial court's determination regarding a prospective juror's proficiency in the English language requires the court to consider any information offered, including the statements\n   of the prospective juror, but most importantly requires the court to rely on its own observations, similar to the process by which a fact finder assesses the credibility of a witness. The present case illustrates this point. The trial court had the opportunity to hear the manner in which E spoke, observe his facial expressions and verbal responses to the statements of others, and note the time it took E to speak and to respond to others' statements-all factors that properly entered into the court's factual finding as to E's proficiency in the English language. These are precisely the types of observations that are quintessential to the function of the trial court as fact finder. Given the importance of the trial court's reliance on its own observations in making the determination, the court's finding must be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The stringent, applicable standard of review is controlling in this appeal. \"A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Henderson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20533\">\n    307 Conn. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20A.3d%20291\">\n    55 A.3d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). There was evidence in the record to support the court's finding that E's English proficiency did not meet the standards of \u00a7 51-217(a)(3). For instance, the court noted that E stated that he understood only \" 'most' \" of what the court had stated when addressing the prospective jurors, and that the court had found it \" 'extremely hard' \" to understand E's speech. (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v. Gould,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%20392\">\n    155 Conn.App. at 410, 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20968\">\n    109 A.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, in support of its challenge of E for cause, the state pointed to E's questionnaire, in which he had failed to disclose certain details of his criminal history, despite having disclosed those details during voir dire. The state also contended that E's answers to\n   questions during voir dire were often not responsive to the questions that had been asked. The transcript of the voir dire examination of E provides support for that contention, which the trial court was entitled to consider in arriving at its ruling. The following exchange, which prompted the trial court to first express concerns regarding E's proficiency in the English language, provides but one example:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Have you or anyone close to you ever been a victim of a crime?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"[E]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And are you comfortable telling me a little bit about that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[E]: Well, kind of-do you want to hear?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: If you're comfortable telling me, yeah, sure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"[E]: Oh well, one time we are stopped by the police and they confused me by another person, and they like put something on me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: A guy came and pulled something on you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[E]: Yes, kind of like that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay, and what did he pull on you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"[E]: I think it was-there was after him one person and because he cannot get to that person, so he get close to me and reached to my pocket without me knowing because I was sitting down. So, when the police came, that guy told me, hey this guy put something on you. That's it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Subsequently during voir dire, it became clear that E had been charged with a drug offense in connection\n   with the events to which he referred during this colloquy. In the above excerpt, however, E cites to this incident in response to the prosecutor's question as to whether he had ever been a\n   <em>\n    victim\n   </em>\n   of a crime. It is indisputable that the ability to understand the meaning of the word \"victim\" is important within the context of a criminal prosecution. The trial court, therefore, reasonably could have inferred, on the basis of E's failure to provide a responsive answer to the prosecutor's question, that there were questions regarding E's proficiency in the English language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Of course, the trial court did not have only this single piece of information before it-there were other instances during voir dire when E's answers were not responsive. Additionally, as I have stated, the trial court was entitled to rely on its own observations, as well as the discrepancy between E's juror questionnaire responses and his answers during voir dire. That is, the court properly was required to consider the totality of the information before it in arriving at its finding that E had not satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 51-217(a)(3). Accordingly, it simply cannot be said that there was no evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding, and the court was therefore acting within its broad discretion in granting the state's motion to exclude E for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 51-217(a)(3) provides: \"All jurors shall be electors, or citizens of the United States who are residents of this state having a permanent place of abode in this state and appear on the list compiled by the Jury Administrator under subsection (b) of section 51-222a, who have reached the age of eighteen.
