We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 24, 2010, Brian Donnelly, a patrol officer with the Yale Police Department, heard a police broadcast regarding a domestic dispute involving the defendant. Donnelly responded\n   by proceeding to Winchester Avenue, where he spotted a vehicle matching the broadcast description of the defendant's vehicle. Donnelly followed the vehicle, which in fact belonged to the defendant. After Officer Lester Blazejowski arrived in support, Donnelly stopped in front of the defendant's vehicle at the intersection of Ashmun and Grove Streets. Donnelly and Blazejowski exited their cruisers, approached the defendant's vehicle, and ordered the defendant to put his vehicle in park and to show his hands. The defendant refused to comply and, instead, reached toward the passenger side of the vehicle and then inside his pants. Donnelly thought the defendant was attempting to retrieve a weapon. He ordered the defendant to show his hands, but, instead, the defendant again reached over to the passenger side of the vehicle and then inside his pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Blazejowski opened the driver's side door and attempted to remove the defendant from his vehicle, but\n   he resisted. Donnelly also tried to remove the defendant from his vehicle, but the defendant resisted and continued to reach for the waistband of his pants and elsewhere in the vehicle. Donnelly finally was able to remove the defendant from the vehicle. While the officers were trying to handcuff the defendant, the defendant tried to kick Donnelly and attempted to stab him with a screwdriver. A struggle ensued during which the officers attempted to handcuff the defendant, who swung his hands, kicked his feet, and fought \"wildly.\" Donnelly\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   incurred scrapes and cuts that resulted in pain and \"swelling.\" At some point during the struggle, the defendant removed a bag of marijuana from his pants and put it in his mouth. After having been subdued with pepper spray, the defendant spit out the marijuana. Eventually, the defendant was handcuffed and formally arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a trial to a jury, the defendant was convicted of two counts of assault of public safety personnel, possession of a narcotic substance, possession of a controlled substance, and interfering with an officer. The defendant was sentenced on each of the assault convictions to ten years incarceration, execution suspended after seven years; the sentences were to run consecutively. The defendant's one year sentence on count seven, interfering with an officer, and five year sentence on count five, possession of a narcotic substance, were ordered to run concurrently with each other and with the assault sentences. The defendant's total effective sentence was, thus, twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after fourteen years and five years of probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant claims that his conviction of assault of Donnelly (count one) and interfering with Donnelly\n   count seven) violated the protection of the federal constitution against double jeopardy because, as charged by the state in the long form information, interfering with an officer is a lesser included offense of assault of an officer. We agree that the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   test is satisfied as to the elements of the crimes, but disagree with the conclusion that reversal is required in the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant concedes that his double jeopardy claim is unpreserved,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   thus he seeks review of that claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v.

The first count alleged, in pertinent part, that \"on May 24, 2010, at or around 7:23 p.m., at or near Ashmun Street, in ... New Haven, ... the defendant ... with the intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer from performing his duties, to wit: Officer Brian Donnelly, and while such peace officer was acting in the performance of his duties such person caused physical injury to such peace officer in violation of [\u00a7 53a-167c (a)(1) ].\" Count seven alleged, in pertinent part, that \"on May 24, 2010, at or around 7:23 p.m., at or near Ashmun Street, in ... New Haven, ... the defendant ... obstructed, resisted, hindered and endangered a peace officer, to wit: Officer Brian Donnelly, while in the performance of such peace officer's duties in violation of [\u00a7 53a-167a ].\" No bill of particulars was filed, and the issue was not raised or preserved in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The state concedes that, solely on the allegations of the information, the seventh count may be considered to be included within count one and, if viewed under\n   the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   analysis and under the assumption that both convictions were based on the same conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   convictions on both counts violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.

One line, which the defendant advocates that we follow, states that we are simply to apply the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   analysis to the crimes charged and not to examine the underlying evidence.

In\n   <em>\n    State v. Morales,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20Conn.%20App.%20143\">\n    164 Conn.App. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%20278\">\n    136 A.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), this court held that we are to examine the evidence when determining whether a defendant was convicted of separate offenses. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Urbanowski,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20377\">\n    163 Conn.App. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%20236\">\n    136 A.3d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), this court concluded, after examining the evidence, that the defendant had not met his burden to show that two convictions, which he claimed had violated double jeopardy, arose out of the same act or transaction, and he thus failed to meet his burden of showing that the jury actually convicted him twice for the same offense. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   implicitly overruled\n   <em>\n    Mincewicz,\n   </em>\n   and that\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Urbanowski\n   </em>\n   are binding authority for the proposition that where the information and bill of particulars, if any, do not separate a transaction into separate parts, the reviewing court has the obligation to determine whether the multiple convictions reasonably could have been predicated on different conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the present case, there were facts in evidence that the defendant resisted when Donnelly tried to remove him from the vehicle, and that the defendant tried to kick Donnelly and to stab him with a screwdriver when Donnelly and other officers tried to handcuff him outside the vehicle. There was evidence that, during the\n   struggle to handcuff the defendant, the defendant fought \"wildly\" and injured Donnelly. These acts reasonably could have formed the factual basis for the offense of assault of public safety personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There was also evidence of distinct and separate acts that reasonably could have formed the basis for the offense of interfering with an officer. The state urged in closing argument that the jury find the defendant guilty of the interfering with an officer charge by virtue of his attempting to swallow the drugs. There was evidence presented at trial that during the struggle to handcuff the defendant, the defendant removed a bag of marijuana from his pants and put it in his mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, the jury reasonably could have concluded, based on the evidence, that the two crimes did not stem from the same conduct. Thus, the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Blockburger,\n   </em>\n   that the offenses must have arisen from the same act, was not satisfied. The failure to meet the first prong is fatal to the defendant's double jeopardy claim because both conditions of\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   must be met in order for the convictions to amount to double jeopardy. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344689\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/640/#p652\">\n    299 Conn. at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20A.3d%20663\">\n    11 A.3d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the defendant has not met his burden of proving under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   that a constitutional violation exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court erred in denying his request for an instruction that interfering with an officer is a lesser included offense of assault of an officer. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 21, 2013, the court charged the jury late in the day and adjourned, indicating that the jury would begin deliberations the following day. The following morning, outside the presence of the jury, the court addressed certain concerns of counsel regarding the\n   charge. The court then asked, \"Anything else before we bring in the jury?\" For the first time, defense counsel raised the following issue: \"[The defendant] is making the request for a specific instruction to the jury before they retire to the jury deliberation room that interfering with an officer is a lesser included offense of assault on an officer, and he's looking for that specific instruction to the jury.\" The state objected on the ground that the jury charge had been completed and that the acts underlying the two offenses were separate and distinct. The court denied the request, stating: \"There is a way to complete the interfering without the assault on the officer, and there's facts presented in this case that could make those two separate crimes.... I think they're properly charged separately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"There is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense ... rather, the right to such an instruction is purely a matter of our common law....

A brief and undetailed colloquy followed. We cannot say, under the facts of this case, that the court was adequately informed of the factual or legal basis of the defendant's request. It was not at all clear precisely what was\n   requested. It is possible that the defendant was requesting an instruction to the effect that he could not be convicted of both the first and the seventh count, and it is also possible that he wanted the jury to be instructed that, in the event that the counts concerned different transactions, a lesser included offense instruction be given as to the first count. It appears that the court and the parties had in mind the first possibility, because the brief discussion centered on the proposition that the charges involved different conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his appellate brief, the defendant argues that the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Whistnant\n   </em>\n   was satisfied simply because he requested a lesser included offense charge. He contends that the state incorrectly argued that there was a separate factual basis for the charge of interfering with an officer, and that such a distinct basis was\n   not enumerated in the information. The point that the defendant argues on appeal, however, was never distinctly brought to the attention of the trial court.
