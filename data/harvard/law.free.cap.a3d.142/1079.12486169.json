The plaintiff, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it owed no duty to defend the named defendant, Mark Tully, under a homeowners insurance policy (policy), in a separate civil action filed on behalf of the defendant Child Doe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the trial court granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the ground that, because the policy excluded coverage for acts \"intended\" by the insured, Tully's actions fell outside the scope of the policy and, thus, the plaintiff had no duty to defend him under the presumption of intent established in\n   <em>\n    United Services Automobile Assn. v. Marburg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286238\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/46/99/#p104\">\n    46 Conn.App. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104-105,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20914\">\n    698 A.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff because evidence that Tully was intoxicated at the time of the incident created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his actions were intentional. Specifically, the defendants assert that evidence of voluntary intoxication may negate the intent presumed under\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   and thereby establish an insurer's duty to defend.\n   We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On July 2, 2012, Doe and two\n   other girls were in the shower area of Winding Trails Park in Farmington. At that time, Doe was fourteen years old and the two other girls were, respectively, thirteen and eight years old. Tully, who was fifty-six years old and \"under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\" approached the three girls and offered to buy them ice cream. After the girls refused, Tully grabbed Doe's breast, nearly removing her bathing suit top. Tully then fondled the buttocks of the eight year old girl in Doe's view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Doe, by and through her parent as next friend, subsequently filed a civil action against Tully alleging, inter alia, that he \"negligen[tly]\" sexually assaulted her while he was intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff had previously issued the policy, which provided that the plaintiff would defend Tully against claims resulting from an \"occurrence,\" which is defined in the policy as an \"accident,\" but not from claims resulting from his intentional actions. Tully claimed coverage under the policy, based on his intoxicated state, and requested that the plaintiff defend him in the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff denied coverage, however, on the ground that Doe's claim fell within the intentional act exclusion of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to this complaint, the plaintiff initiated the present action seeking a declaratory judgment with regard to its duty to defend Tully.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff moved\n   for summary judgment on the ground that the complaint in the underlying action alleged an intentional act, which fell within the policy's intentional act exclusion of coverage. In response, Tully submitted two affidavits, one from a physician and one from a psychologist, which opined that he was an alcoholic and so intoxicated on the day of the incident that he could not have formed the requisite intent to harm Doe, as well as his own affidavit attesting that he did-and still does-struggle with alcoholism. The defendants argued that this evidence raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Tully's actions were intentional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court rendered\n   summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, concluding that the plaintiff was entitled to rely on\n   <em>\n    Marburg,\n   </em>\n   which established a presumption of intent in cases involving the sexual assault of a minor. See\n   <em>\n    United Services Automobile Assn. v. Marburg,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286238\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/46/99/#p104\">\n    46 Conn.App. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20914\">\n    698 A.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court then stated, more generally, that \"voluntary intoxication does not establish a question of intent when defending against an exclusionary\n   clause of an insurance policy.\" These appeals followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the defendants reiterate their claim that evidence of Tully's voluntary intoxication raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his actions were intentional and, thus, fall within the intentional act exclusion of the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants first claim that the trial court improperly applied the presumption established in\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   because this court overruled that presumption in\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v. Barron,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457662\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/394/#p409\">\n    269 Conn. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%201165\">\n    848 A.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), which held that the standard for determining whether an insured's intent may be negated for the purposes of an intentional act exclusion is whether the insured was able to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct. Thus, the defendants claim that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Tully was able to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct as a result of his intoxication. Alternatively, should this court apply the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption, the defendants argue that this court should, as a policy\n   matter, allow evidence of voluntary intoxication to be used to negate that intent. Lastly, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly decided \"that an insured's intoxication can never,\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law,\n   </em>\n   negate the intent required to invoke the intentional acts exclusion.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly applied the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption and, thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Tully's acts fell within the intentional acts exclusion. The plaintiff also argues that\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   clarified the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption, rather than overruled it, given that the two cases are factually distinguishable. Finally, the plaintiff argues that this court should not allow evidence of Tully's voluntary intoxication to rebut the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption, as it would be against public policy to allow evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate intent for the purposes of an intentional exclusion act in an insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption of intentional conduct based on an insured's sexual misconduct with a minor remains good law after\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   ; (2) the trial court properly applied the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption in the present case; and (3) evidence of voluntary intoxication may not be used to negate intent in duty to defend cases in which the insured's intent is inferred from the underlying complaint\n   that alleges that the insured committed sexual misconduct with a minor. We, therefore, conclude that the plaintiff satisfied its burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists insofar as the complaint in the underlying civil action alleges intentional acts and, thus, the plaintiff has no duty to defend Tully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact. The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact.... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent.... When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue.... Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue.... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact ... are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book [\u00a7 17-45 ]....

In\n   <em>\n    Barron,\n   </em>\n   because there was no claim that the allegations gave rise to a presumption of intent as a matter of law, the insurer had an initially greater burden to demonstrate that there was no genuine issue of material fact on summary judgment than in cases, such as the present one, in which an insurer may rely on a presumption of intent to satisfy its burden on summary judgment. The insurer in\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   ultimately had to demonstrate that, despite the allegations within the complaint that the mother suffered from mental disease at the time of the incident, she nevertheless formed the requisite intent to commit the acts, that her acts were intentional, and that the allegations fell completely within the intentional acts exclusion of the policy. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   did not overrule the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption; rather,\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   clarified the standard for determining whether an insured sufficiently has negated intent in order to defeat summary judgment in favor of the insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Tully also argues in his brief that the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption should not apply in the present case because the underlying facts in that case are too dissimilar, insofar as\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   concerned allegations of sexual assault, including penetrative intercourse, on at least seventy-three occasions.

We disagree. In\n   <em>\n    Marburg,\n   </em>\n   our Appellate Court, in presuming intent to harm as a matter of law when an insured has engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor, did not consider any restrictions on the type or manner of sexual assault of a minor by an adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Id., at 104-106,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20914\">\n    698 A.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This was for good reason. As the Maryland Court of Appeals observed in rejecting an argument that the presumption is inapplicable in a case without a \" 'violent' \" sexual\n   assault, minor victims of sexual abuse are unable to consent as matter of law, and \"[c]hild sexual abuse is an affront to the dignity of the child-an invasion of the child's autonomy-because a child cannot appreciate or comprehend the full nature of the sexual acts.... While it is undoubtedly worse to couple sexual molestation of a child with physical injury, such a distinction differs in degree, not in kind.

Specifically, we seek to determine whether the allegations of Tully's sexual misconduct with a minor trigger the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption and, as a result, fall completely within the policy's intentional acts exclusion. The complaint in the underlying civil\n   action alleges that Tully, in an intoxicated state, grabbed Doe's breast and fondled the buttocks of an eight year old child. The complaint then characterizes these allegations as negligence. The complaint alleges that Doe's injuries \"were caused by [Tully's] negligence ... in that [he] was under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he committed these actions.\" The complaint further alleges that \"[a]s a result of [Tully's] negligence and carelessness, [Doe] has suffered bodily and emotional injuries, and has been severely and permanently injured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Construing the relevant pleadings \"broadly,\" \"realistically\" and \"reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means,\" but not \"contorted in such a way so as to strain the bounds of rational comprehension\";\n   <em>\n    Deming v.

That complaint, therefore, alleges presumptively intentional conduct on the part of Tully. First, the complaint alleges that Tully attempted to lure the minor girls by offering to buy them ice cream. The complaint then alleges that Tully grabbed Doe's breast, almost removing her bathing suit top, and fondled the buttocks of an eight year old girl.\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   aside, to read these allegations as anything other than sexual misconduct with a minor would be to \"strain the bounds of rational comprehension.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20A.2d%20623\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the defendants contend that the allegations arise from negligence, rather than deliberate sexual misconduct with a minor, we are not persuaded. \"[E]ven when an action is [pleaded] as an unintentional tort [such as negligence], the court examines the alleged activities in the complaint to determine whether the insured intended to commit both the acts and the injuries that resulted.

Nothing about the allegations in the underlying civil action involve a negligent act. That complaint does not, for example, allege that Tully was so intoxicated that he drunkenly fell down and accidentally touched Doe's breast. Rather, the complaint alleges that Tully \"proceeded to grab [Doe's] breast, almost completely removing her bathing suit in the process\" and \"then proceeded to fondle the buttocks of the [eight] year old girl....\" Because the complaint in the underlying civil action alleges deliberate sexual misconduct with a minor, we, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly allowed the plaintiff to rely on the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption of intent in satisfying its initial burden on summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption of intent is rebuttable, next we turn to the question of whether the defendants have adduced evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Tully's intent.

To rebut the\n   <em>\n    Marburg\n   </em>\n   presumption, the defendants claim that this court should consider evidence of voluntary intoxication, such as affidavits from physicians or Tully himself, to negate intent. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The plaintiff\n   argues in response that evidence of voluntary intoxication should not be considered to negate Tully's intent. We agree with the plaintiff, and conclude that evidence of voluntary intoxication may not be used to negate intent in situations, as here, in which the defendants seek insurance coverage for a claim arising out of Tully's sexual misconduct with a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This court has not considered previously whether evidence of voluntary intoxication may negate intent in the context of insurance claims arising from sexual misconduct with a minor.

For a variety of public policy considerations, we conclude the second approach is persuasive in the context of sexual misconduct with a minor, even without considering whether it extends to other acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first policy consideration for holding that voluntary intoxication should\n   not operate to negate intent is not to relieve the insured of responsibility, financial and otherwise, for his otherwise intentional actions. One federal court, applying Michigan state law, stated that, \"public policy demands that a voluntary departure of one's good judgment and rational decision-making abilities should not permit the insured to abrogate his financial responsibility to those he brutally injures.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

See\n   <em>\n    American Family Mutual Ins. Co. v.

For example, in Michigan, the state's legislators\n   had \"distinguishe[d] between a lack of mental capacity due to mental illness and that which results from acute voluntary alcohol or drug intoxication. In the latter situation, even though a criminal defendant's freedom and liberty [were] at stake, a defense of voluntary intoxication [could] not be tendered. To allow such a defense would create an intolerable precedent of self-immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v. Sherrill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570663\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/566/1286/#p1288\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570663\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/566/1286/#p1288\">\n    566 F.Supp. at 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then applied that distinction to the insurance context, holding that, \"where an insured voluntarily ingests alcohol or drugs he may not assert a defense to an exclusionary clause ... based on his lack of capacity to form the intent to act or harm, where that defense is based solely on the effects of the alcohol and/or drugs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570663\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/566/1286/#p1288\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We find these policy rationales that hold the insured responsible for his intentional actions to be consistent with existing Connecticut statutes and case law. Turning first to our own criminal statutes, we find support\n   in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That statute expressly provides that, \"[i]ntoxication shall not be a defense to a criminal charge ... if the actor, due to\n   <em>\n    self-induced intoxication,\n   </em>\n   is unaware ... such unawareness, disregard or failure to perceive shall be immaterial.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7. Further, the official comment following \u00a7 53a-7 states that, \"where the [criminal] offense is based on recklessness or criminal negligence, unawareness of the actor due to self-induced intoxication does not excuse him. For example, a defendant charged with criminally negligent homicide cannot argue that he was too intoxicated to be aware of the risks involved in his conduct and therefore should not be held liable for his unawareness.\" Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-7 (West 2012), commission comment. Thus, the statutory language expressly provides that voluntary intoxication does not excuse a defendant from liability for criminal negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find further legislative support for precluding evidence of voluntary intoxication from negating intent in the insurance context in situations involving the insured's sexual misconduct with a minor within General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the mental capacity affirmative\n   defense statute. Section 53a-13 expressly precludes voluntary intoxication as a lack of mental capacity defense. Because our legislature specifically precluded voluntary intoxication as a lack of mental capacity defense in the criminal context, we extend that statement of public policy to the insurance context, in which the insured's money, rather than his freedom, is at stake. See\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v.

Thus, we conclude that the second approach is consistent with our case law that allows evidence of mental disease or defect to negate intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Allstate\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ins.

We disagree. Comparing the situation at hand to an accident involving an intoxicated driver is akin to comparing apples and oranges. In such an accident, a driver voluntarily consumes alcohol, gets behind the wheel of a vehicle, and then accidentally injures another driver or pedestrian on the road. In that situation, an insurance company would have a duty to defend the intoxicated driver because the injury of the other person was unintentional, however foreseeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, however, Tully voluntarily consumed alcohol, went to a local park, attempted to lure children, grabbed one child's breast, and fondled the buttocks of another. The act of sexual molestation of minors was not unintentional or accidental. The situation at hand is more similar to a scenario in which a driver voluntarily consumes alcohol, gets behind the wheel of a car, sees a pedestrian in the road and then intentionally hits the person with his vehicle. In that situation, the driver's act of injuring the pedestrian was intentional, despite the driver's voluntary intoxication, which lowered his inhibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that evidence of voluntary intoxication may not negate intent in duty to defend cases in which the insured's intent is inferred from an underlying complaint that alleges the insured committed sexual misconduct with a minor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying this rule to the present case, the trial court properly granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment because the defendants failed, as a matter of law, to rebut the presumption\n   of intent based on Tully's sexual misconduct with a minor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual assault and the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victims or others through whom the victims' identities may be ascertained.

Involuntary intoxication is \"a very rare thing, and can never exist where the person intoxicated knows what he or she is drinking, and drinks the intoxicant voluntarily, and without being made to do so by force or coercion.\" 2 Criminal Practice Manual \u00a7 40:2 (West 2016). The complaint in the underlying civil action did not allege that Tully's intoxication was involuntary. Rather, it alleged that Tully \"approached [Doe] and her friends while he was in an intoxicated state,\" and that Tully \"was under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he committed these actions.\" On the basis of a reasonable reading of the allegations in a manner not to distort rational comprehension; see, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Deming v.

Although a policy interest in compensating victims exists, that interest must be balanced by the fact that insurance policyholders share a risk, as reflected by the cost of premiums. As the Ohio Supreme Court has aptly observed, \"requiring an insurer to indemnify an insured who has engaged in sexual abuse of a child subsidizes the episodes of child sexual abuse of which its victims complain, at the ultimate expense of other insureds to whom the added costs of indemnifying child molesters will be passed,\" and \"the average person purchasing homeowners insurance would cringe at the very suggestion that he was paying for such coverage ...
