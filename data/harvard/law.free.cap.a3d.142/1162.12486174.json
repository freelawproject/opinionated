Only the motion to dismiss is relevant to this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her memorandum of law in support of the motion to dismiss, the defendant argued that she was entitled to absolute immunity because she was acting in an administrative capacity and performing a quasi-judicial function when she reviewed and voted on the plaintiff's applications. Nonetheless, she recognized the case of\n   <em>\n    Towne Brooke Development, LLC v. Fox,\n   </em>\n   Superior Court, judicial district of Danbury, Docket No. CV-030347962-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%203090723\">\n    2004 WL 3090723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (November 26, 2004), in which the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Howard J.

The plaintiff argued that its intentional fraudulent misrepresentation claim was grounded on the defendant having falsely represented herself to be \"an honest, fair and unbiased member of the commission when she chose to participate in the proceedings on the [plaintiff's] applications.\" As to the second count, intentional tortious interference with business expectancy, the plaintiff claimed that by participating as a biased decision maker and gathering evidence outside the record, the defendant intentionally and tortiously interfered with the plaintiff's expectancy that the commission would provide a fair, neutral, and honest proceeding with respect to its applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following oral argument, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Wiese, J.,\n   </em>\n   issued a memorandum of decision on May 7, 2014, in which it granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, but declined to address the motion for summary judgment on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In rendering its decision, the court first determined that the commission is a quasi-judicial body because it is authorized to hear, consider, and decide applications for special permits or exceptions in the exercise of its discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

The court noted that our Supreme Court has held that zoning boards act in a quasi-judicial capacity when passing upon the issuance of a permit. See\n   <em>\n    Astarita v. Liquor Control Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"512330\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/165/185/#p189\">\n    165 Conn. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=332%20A.2d%20106\">\n    332 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). The court concluded\n   that the commission was acting\n   in a quasi-judicial capacity when it considered the plaintiff's applications and, therefore, its members were protected by the litigation privilege, a subset of absolute immunity. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Kelley v. Bonney,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 565-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=606%20A.2d%20693\">\n    606 A.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which noted that the litigation privilege attaches to relevant statements made in administrative proceedings that are quasi-judicial in nature, the court reasoned that the role of zoning commission members, when acting on permit applications, is similar to that of judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We disagree that the litigation privilege is applicable to the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint. As the plaintiff made clear in its memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss and on appeal, its claims are not predicated on what the defendant\n   <em>\n    stated\n   </em>\n   at the commission meeting, but on her bias and ex parte communication with Meade. Although the plaintiff referred to and quoted \u00a7 52-557n (c) in the trial court, the court did not consider the statute when it dismissed the plaintiff's cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff appealed, claiming that the court erred in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because: (1) \u00a7 52-557n (c) abrogated the common-law\n   doctrine of absolute immunity, and (2) the defendant's liability is grounded on her internal bias and ex parte communication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we agree that the court erred in dismissing the plaintiff's cause of action, we do not agree that the statute abrogated common-law absolute immunity. The defendant argues that she is entitled to absolute immunity because the commission is a quasi-judicial board; we disagree. Section 52-557n (c) provides members of municipal agencies with qualified immunity in that commission members may be liable for their intentional wrongful acts. Absolute immunity and the litigation privilege are not implicated by the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint. The court and the defendant have conflated the immunity provided to those who make statements before quasi-judicial boards and the immunity provided to members of municipal agencies for exercising their decision-making\n   responsibilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss ... is well settled. A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... When a ... court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.... The motion to dismiss ... admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone....
