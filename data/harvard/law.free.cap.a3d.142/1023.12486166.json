State System's counsel additionally asked if Requesters could provide search terms to assist in the matter. Requesters agreed to an additional extension but did not provide the State System with any search terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 20, 2015, State System's counsel, again, requested search terms to narrow the requests. Requesters responded that they were \"very reluctant to get involved in narrowing search terms. However, [Requesters] will be better able to respond if you can make a disclosure to us of what you have reviewed, and found subjected to the disclosure, so far.\" (R.R. at 165a.) The next day, State System requested another 30-day extension, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I have not been able to review much material to date and the IT department is attempting to free up space in a virtual location so that I will be able to: 1) load the date (alphabetically through Kutztown involved 12 gigabytes of data, however Lock Haven's data amount due to how it was collected was in excess of 14 gigabytes of data and overloaded the system's capacity) so that I do not overload the system; and 2) do a preliminary review to determine what items may or may not be relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (R.R. at 164a.) Because Requesters did not agree to the extension and because State System failed to provide the requested information on or before the 30th day, all requests were deemed denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.902(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 5, 2015, Requesters filed an appeal to the OOR stating grounds for disclosure. State System contacted Requesters seeking to mediate the matter before the OOR, and Requesters denied the mediation request. State System then\n   submitted a position statement claiming the requests were insufficiently specific under Section 703 of the RTKL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of its position, State System submitted three affidavits. The first was signed by Rodney Underkoffler, Microsoft Team Leader for the State System, attesting that the total amount of data for the requests exceeds 74 gigabytes and that he assisted State System's counsel in obtaining the necessary disk space to store the data. State System also submitted the affidavit of William Lane, Customer Support Specialist for the State System, attesting he assisted the Chancellor in obtaining more than 25 gigabytes of data for the requests, estimating that 25 gigabytes of data contains 1.87 million pages of information. An affidavit was also submitted by Dennis Carson, California University of Pennsylvania's manager of Enterprise Infrastructure, attesting he assisted California University's Open Records Officer in obtaining over 700 megabytes of data containing 2,366 emails plus attachments. State System also admitted initial data was reviewed regarding California University's President and that it sampled and reviewed 99 emails attributed to its Vice-President for Administration, determining 50 to be responsive and the remainder to be non-responsive or generally subject to redaction. Requesters did not provide a position statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On October 5, 2015, the OOR issued its final determination on all dockets concluding that all of the requests were sufficiently specific to permit disclosure under Section 703. The OOR reasoned that Item 2's failure to state a timeframe when requesting training documents regarding financial and budget reports did not render the item impermissibly broad because a proper reading limits it to those materials used at the time the request was made. The OOR additionally reasoned a failure to include a finite timeframe in Item 3 regarding feedback on budget and financial reports did not render the request impermissibly broad when weighed against the request's narrow subject matter and scope. The OOR then determined that the State System failed to demonstrate that any RTKL exemptions applied to the requests and ordered the documents to be produced in accordance with the OOR's \"interpretation\" of the request. State System filed a petition for reconsideration that was later denied by the OOR. The 12 Universities and the Chancellor then filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 5, 2015, Requesters submitted a RTKL request to Mansfield University and Bloomsburg University that was substantially the same as the requests made to the other 12 Universities and the Chancellor in May 2015. Both Mansfield University and Bloomsburg University invoked a statutory 30-day extension and then subsequently denied the requests contending they were insufficiently specific. Requesters timely appealed both denials to the OOR challenging the denials and stating grounds for disclosure. At the request of the Universities, the two matters were consolidated. On December 14, 2015, the OOR issued its final determination concluding the requests were sufficiently specific and that the two universities failed to demonstrate that any RTKL exemptions applied to the requests. Mansfield University and Bloomsburg University filed a petition for reconsideration, which was later denied by the OOR. Both universities then filed this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal, State System contends that the OOR erred when concluding all items\n   of Requesters' requests were sufficiently specific to satisfy Section 703 of the RTKL because they fail to sufficiently set forth the subject matter of the request and fail to supply a sufficiently narrow scope and timeframe. We have explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Under the RTKL, a requester submits a request that \"tells the agency what records he wants, and the agency responds by either giving the records or denying the request by providing specific reasons why the request has been denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Pa.

The request must \"identify or describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested.\" Section 703 of the RTKL. \"An open-ended request that gives an agency little guidance regarding what to look for may be so burdensome that it will be considered overly broad.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Cnty. v.

We further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The subject matter of the request must identify the \"transaction or activity\" of the agency for which the record is sought. The subject matter should provide a context to narrow the search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The scope of the request must identify \"a discrete group of documents, either by type ... or by recipient.\" ... A request for a broad category of documents, such as all records, may be sufficiently specific if confined to a particular recipient or recipients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The timeframe of the request should identify a finite period of time for which records are sought. The timeframe prong is, however, the most fluid of the three prongs, and whether or not the request's timeframe is narrow enough is generally dependent upon the specificity of the request's subject matter and scope. Thus, failure to identify a finite timeframe will not render an otherwise sufficiently specific request overbroad. Likewise, an extremely short timeframe will not rescue an otherwise overbroad request, except for in the most extraordinary circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859582\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/1121/6859582/#p1124\">\n    119 A.3d at 1124-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes and internal citations omitted). Applying this three-part test, we determined that a request that sought \"[a]ll of the emails of Acting Secretary of Education Carolyn Dumaresq as they pertain to the performance of her duties as Acting Secretary\" for approximately one year to have a finite time-period and sufficiently limited scope because it only pertained to emails to and from the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859582\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/1121/6859582/#p1124\">\n    119 A.3d at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, we held it was impermissibly broad because it failed to \"provide a context by which the Request can be narrowed; it is, by virtue of the Secretary's position, a request for emails about all of\n   the agency's activity over nearly a one year period. In other words, it is a fishing expedition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859582\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/119/1121/6859582/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   State System contends that Item 1 is broader than the request in\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n   </em>\n   because it seeks over five years of records and fails to discretely identify specific documents within a limited scope and subject matter. State System further contends that because it has to review a large volume of documents to determine whether an exemption applies, this should be considered as a factor weighing in favor of a determination that this item is overly broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Item 1 regarding correspondence involving budget and financial reports satisfies the three-part\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n   </em>\n   test because it seeks correspondence from specified officials at identified state universities-a clearly defined subject matter-limits its scope to those correspondences that include attachments of specified reports and provides a finite time-period from 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Department of Corrections v.

Because the OOR determined Item 2 only seeks those instructions given to \"new hires\" at the time the RTKL requests were made, State System additionally contends that the OOR erred as a matter of law when unilaterally narrowing it. We have explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Under [Sections 901, 903 and 1101 of the RTKL], the requestor tells the agency what records he wants, and the agency responds by either giving the records or denying the request by providing specific reasons why the request has been denied. The requestor can then take an appeal to the OOR where it is given to a hearing officer for a determination. Nowhere in this process has the General Assembly provided that the OOR can refashion the request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289306\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/995/515/#p516\">\n    995 A.2d at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the OOR cannot refashion a request, if from the context of the request the agency can reasonably discern that a request is for a specific time-period, the OOR can find the request sufficiently specific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Item 2 only seeks transitional and training documents used for \"new hires\" in the Office of Finance and Administration, and when read in its proper context, it provides a sufficiently specific subject matter and scope. State System's expansive reading is unpersuasive because \"the specificity of a request must be construed in the request's context, rather than envisioning everything the request might conceivably encompass.\"\n   <em>\n    Iverson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312155\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/50/281/#p283\">\n    50 A.3d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the context of the request indicates that it is attempting to seek information\n   regarding State System's recent finance and budget reports, we agree with the OOR that a proper reading of Item 2 limits it to those documents used for new hires at the time the RTKL requests were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   State System similarly contends that Item 3 involving instructions and feedback is impermissibly broad because it fails to supply a finite timeframe and because it seeks records for its \"current and past employees.\" Item 3 is sufficiently specific because it seeks written instructions provided to \"current and past employees\" specifying that these instructions pertain to \"the completion of or feedback on the completion of\" the specified budget and finance reports listed in Item 1, where it requests five years of reports. Because it is so limited, Item 3 provides a sufficiently narrow subject matter and scope that identifies a discrete group of documents by both type and recipient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because we determine Requesters' requests are sufficiently specific under Section 703 of the RTKL, we now turn to State System's contention that the OOR erred as a matter of law when concluding that it failed to meet its burden of proving exemptions when it did not have the opportunity to review the requested records to determine if any of the exemptions set forth in Section 708 of the RTKL apply. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708. State System contends that it was incapable of reasonably discerning whether any exemptions applied to this matter because it neither had the time nor resources to fully review the sizeable volume of records produced by Requesters' requests in the time-period it was given to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Just because a request is for a large number of records does not mean that an agency is excused from its obligation to produce the requested documents. Section 1308(1) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1308(1), prohibits a policy or regulation that places \"a limitation on the number of records which may be requested or made available for inspection or duplication.\" Correspondingly, just because a request is large does not mean that an agency should be foreclosed from carrying out its statutory duty to determine whether exemptions apply when it is incapable of reviewing the requested documents within the time-period it is given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In Section 708 of the RTKL, the General Assembly made a legislative determination that certain classes of records need not be made public.

The agency making such a claim has to provide the OOR with a valid estimate of the number of documents being requested, the length of time that people charged with reviewing the request require to conduct this review, and if the request involves documents in electronic format the agency must explain any difficulties it faces when attempting to deliver the documents in that format. Based on the above information, the OOR can then grant any additional time warranted so that the agency can reasonably discern whether any exemptions apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the OOR's final determinations are affirmed to the extent that they determined Requesters' requests are sufficiently specific under Section 703 of the RTKL, but are vacated and remanded for it to make determinations in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   AND NOW, this 6th day of July, 2016, it is hereby ordered that the final determinations of the Office of Open Records dated October 5, 2015, at Docket Nos.
