ABRAHAMSON, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\u00b6 1. This is an appeal of a judgment of the circuit court for Waukesha County, J. Mac Davis, Judge, granting summary judgment in favor of Jeffrey Brown, American Family Mutual Insurance Company, and Regent Insurance Company (collectively the defendants). The part of the judgment at issue here dismissed the consolidated actions of Hailey Marie-Joe Force, Mehgan Force, and Lauren Force, collectively the minor children of Billy Joe Force, the deceased, against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u00b6 2. The court of appeals certified the action to this court pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u00b6 3. The issue before the court is: Can minor children recover for the wrongful death of their father under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) (2011-12),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when the deceased leaves behind a spouse who was estranged from the deceased and who is precluded from recovering for the wrongful death?</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">\u00b6 4. Linda Force, the deceased's spouse in the instant case, is precluded from recovery for her husband's wrongful death because the circuit court dismissed her claim, concluding that she has no com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>pensable damages under the wrongful death statute; this dismissal of Linda Force's wrongful death claim was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">\u00b6 5. In the instant case, Linda Force did not receive any financial support from the deceased from the time of their separation in 1997 to the deceased's death in 2008. Their long separation with no communication for many years was evidence that there was no interaction or affection between the spouses. The circuit court concluded that the unique facts of the instant case demonstrate that the deceased's spouse had no claim for damages for her husband's wrongful death under the wrongful death statutes. The dismissal of Linda Force's wrongful death claim is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u00b6 6. The defendants argue that because the deceased's spouse is still living, she is a \"surviving spouse\" under the statutes; that her recovery for the wrongful death of her husband is zero; and that consequently the deceased's minor children do not have any set-aside from the surviving spouse's recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u00b6 7. The defendants rely on the statutory hierarchy of beneficiaries created by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The first class of beneficiaries is the surviving spouse, with a set-aside from his or her recovery for minor children \"in recognition of the duty and responsibility of a parent to support minor children.\" If there is a \"surviving spouse,\" other beneficiaries do not have a cause of action for wrongful death. If there is no \"surviving spouse,\" the cause of action passes to the next beneficiary in the statutory hierarchy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">\u00b6 8. We disagree with the defendants' interpretation of the statutes. We conclude that in order to avoid an absurd, unreasonable result contrary to the legislative purposes of the wrongful death statutes, Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(2), we construe the statutes under the unique facts of the instant case to allow the minor children to recover even though the deceased's spouse in the instant case is alive and does not (according to the circuit court) recover any damages for the deceased husband's wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\u00b6 9. Our result comports with the dual legislative purposes of the wrongful death statutes: (1) to impose liability on the wrongdoer; and (2) to protect relational interests, especially the interests of the deceased's minor dependent children.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">\u00b6 10. The statutory interpretation advocated by the defendants would contravene these fundamental purposes of the wrongful death statutes by barring any wrongful death claim by Linda Force and the minor children, along with all lower-tier beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">\u00b6 11. The defendants call for the unfair, unreasonable outcome that the Wisconsin legislature sought to avoid by enacting the first wrongful death statute in 1857: the wrongdoer would be immune from liability and no compensation would be recovered by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ceased's relatives who would have recovered had the deceased lived. The interpretation of \"surviving spouse\" should avoid such unreasonable, absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">\u00b6 12. We examine the meaning of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2), in the unique fact scenario presented in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The words \"surviving\" and \"spouse\" are commonly used words. The text of the wrongful death statute does not define who is or is not a \"surviving spouse.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u00b6 13. To interpret and apply the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in the wrongful death statutes, we examine the text of the wrongful death statutes using various interpretive aids. In interpreting words in a statutory text, we do more than focus on the dictionary definition of each word. Interpretive aids such as the legislative purpose, prior Wisconsin case law and case law from other jurisdictions, and statutory history help guide our interpretation of the phrase \"surviving spouse.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u00b6 14. The legislative purposes are clear: impose liability on the tortfeasor and allow recovery by the deceased's relatives who would have recovered had the deceased lived. Our case law demonstrates that courts interpret the wrongful death statutes to apply to the unique fact situation presented by a case in order to meet the legislative purposes, rather than apply a strict literal interpretation of the phrase \"surviving spouse.\" Sister state case law similarly recognizes that a lower-tier beneficiary can maintain a claim even if a higher-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tier beneficiary is alive, when the unique facts would otherwise contravene the purposes of the wrongful death statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\u00b6 15. The statutory history of the wrongful death statutes demonstrates that the legislature has explicitly protected the rights of minor children to recover for wrongful death and left interpretation of the term \"surviving spouse\" to the courts in unique and specific fact situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\u00b6 16. Upon examining the statutory text with these interpretive aids, we conclude that the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) does not always simply mean any living spouse of the deceased. The meaning of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" has been elucidated by scrutinizing unique fact situations to define \"surviving spouse\" in accord with the legislative purposes of the wrongful death statutes, rather than considering only the literal meaning of the phrase \"surviving spouse.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\u00b6 17. For the reasons set forth, we interpret the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in the present case as not including Linda Force, the deceased's estranged spouse who, as a result of the circuit court's dismissal of her wrongful death claim (which was not appealed), is barred from recovery under Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(2). If Linda Force is not a \"surviving spouse\" under the statute, the parties do not dispute that the minor children have a cognizable claim as lineal heirs. As lineal heirs of the deceased, the children would be first in line for any recovery for the wrongful death of their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\u00b6 18. We conclude that the circuit court erred in granting the defendants summary judgment against the minor children and erred in dismissing the minor children's causes of action against the defendants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>wrongful death. The minor children in the present case have a cause of action against the defendants for wrongful death as if Linda Force were not alive at the death of the deceased.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">\u00b6 19. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court against the children and in favor of the defendants and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\u00b6 20. To assist the reader, here is a table of contents to this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Introduction: \u00b6\u00b6 1-20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">I.The <em>facts and procedural history </em>are not in dispute: \u00b6\u00b6 21-26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">II.We <em>review </em>a grant of summary judgment independently of the circuit court, using the same methodology as the circuit court: \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">III.The statutory <em>text </em>provides some support for the defendant's interpretation, but in unique fact situations, the defendant's interpretation may not be a reasonable one: \u00b6\u00b6 32-55.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">IV The interpretation and application of the wrongful death statutes should be in accord with the explicit <em>legislative purposes: </em>(1) to render a wrongdoer liable when an injured party dies and (2) to compensate for the loss of a relational interest caused by the wrongful death, especially the interests of the minor children of the deceased: \u00b6\u00b6 56-68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>V The Wisconsin <em>case law </em>and case law from other states reveal that \"surviving spouse\" does not always simply mean any spouse who survives the deceased: \u00b6\u00b6 .69-110.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">VI. The <em>statutory history </em>of the wrongful death statutes demonstrates that the legislature has explicitly protected the rights of minor children to recover for wrongful death and left interpretation of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" to the courts in unique and specific fact situations: \u00b6\u00b6 111-125.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">Conclusion: \u00b6\u00b6 126-129.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\u00b6 21. The facts and procedural history of this case are undisputed for purposes of this appeal. Billy Joe Force, the deceased, was driving a motor vehicle for his employer. He died when his vehicle collided with a motor vehicle driven by Jeffrey Brown, the individual defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">\u00b6 22. The deceased's estranged spouse, Linda Force, and his three nonmarital minor children, Hailey, Mehgan, and Lauren,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> each sought compensation from Jeffrey Brown, the individual defendant; American Family, the insurer of Brown's vehicle; and Regent Insurance Company, the insurer of Billy Joe Force's employer. The allegation is that Brown's negligence caused Billy Joe Force's death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">\u00b6 23. Billy Joe Force and Linda Force were married in 1995 or 1996 and separated after six months of marriage. They never were legally separated or di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>vorced. They did not have any children together. Billy Joe Force had three children with two women who were not his wife. Linda Force has no legal obligation to support these three minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">\u00b6 24. At the time of the motor vehicle accident in 2008, Linda Force lived in New York; Billy Joe Force lived in Wisconsin. During the five years before his death in 2008, Linda Force had no contact with Billy Joe Force. Billy Joe Force never provided any pecuniary support to Linda Force from 1997 until his death in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\u00b6 25. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the defendants, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Linda Force, as a surviving, estranged spouse, had no compensable damages under the wrongful death statute and that none of the three children had a cause of action for wrongful death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\u00b6 26. The three minor children appealed the dismissal of their actions. Linda Force has not appealed the dismissal of her personal claim for damages for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\u00b6 27. We review a grant of summary judgment independently of the circuit court, using the same methodology as the circuit court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\u00b6 28. The material facts are undisputed in the present case and the resolution of the dispute between the three minor children and the defendants turns on a question of law, that is, the interpretation and application of the wrongful death statutes to these undisputed facts. The interpretation and application of a statute to undisputed facts are ordinarily questions of law that this court determines independently of the circuit court, although it benefits from the circuit court's analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We also benefit from the analysis of the court of appeals in its certification memorandum in the present case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\u00b6 29. To interpret and apply the phrase \"surviving spouse\" used in the wrongful death statute, we examine the text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">\u00b6 30. In examining the statutory text, however, we do more than focus on a dictionary definition of each word. Words are given meaning to avoid absurd, unreasonable, or implausible results and results that are clearly at odds with the legislature's purpose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We scrutinize the words in view of the purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We consider the meaning of words in the context in which they appear.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The definition of a word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>or phrase can vary in different circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Different fact scenarios may require different interpretations of the text, because words cannot anticipate every possible fact situation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \"[R]easonable minds can differ about a statute's application when the text is constant but the circumstances to which the text may apply are kaleidoscopic.\"<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">\u00b6 31. We also examine our case law interpreting the statute<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the statutory history of the statute to determine the meaning of words.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">\u00b6 32. This court has declared that there is no common-law action for wrongful death; the right to bring suit is purely statutory.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\u00b6 33. We turn first to the text of the wrongful death statutes, Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\u00b6 34. Wisconsin's wrongful death statute was first enacted in 1857.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The present statute retains the 1857 statutory framework:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u2022 The statute states the conditions under which a wrongdoer is liable for wrongful death. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.03.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u2022 The statute lists the persons who may bring a wrongful death action. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">\u2022 The statute enumerates the persons to whom the amount recovered belongs. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\u00b6 35. Sections 895.03 and 895.04 are viewed <em>in pari materia, </em>having been created together and relating to the same topic.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">\u00b6 36. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.03 states the conditions under which a wrongdoer is liable for wrongful death. It is straightforward, clear, and easy to read. It is largely unchanged since the creation of the wrongful death cause of action in 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u00b6 37. The legislature has declared in every iteration of the wrongful death statute since 1857, including Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.03, that \"in every such case\" in which a wrongdoer has caused death, the wrongdoer is \"liable to an action for damages\" as if death had not ensued. Thus, the legislature has proclaimed that a wrongdoer should be liable for a wrongful death when the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>party could have maintained an action and recovered damages from the defendant, had the injured party survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">\u00b6 38. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.03 states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, <em>then and in every such case the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages notwithstanding the death of the person injured; </em>provided, that such action shall be brought for a death caused in this state (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u00b6 39. No one disputes that the conditions set forth in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.03 that make a wrongdoer liable for wrongful death are met in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\u00b6 40. Wisconsin Stat. 895.04(1) lists the persons who may bring a wrongful death action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">(1) An action for wrongful death may be brought by the personal representative of the deceased person or by the person to whom the amount recovered belongs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\u00b6 41. In the present case, the wrongful death actions were brought by the personal representative and by persons claiming to be the persons to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>amount recovered for wrongful death belongs. No one disputes that the proper persons have brought the instant actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">\u00b6 42. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) enumerates the persons to whom the amount recovered for wrongful death belongs. Unlike Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(1), \u00a7 895.04(2) is a dense and difficult statute to read and understand. It has evolved to its present language by repeated legislative amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">\u00b6 43. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) creates a hierarchy of persons to whom the amount recovered belongs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The first class of beneficiaries is the \"surviving spouse,\" with a set-aside for minor children \"in recognition of the duty and responsibility of a parent to support minor children.\" The second class is lineal heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u00b6 44. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">(2) If the deceased leaves surviving a spouse or domestic partner under ch. 770 and minor children under 18 years of age with whose support the deceased was legally charged, the court before whom the action is pending, or if no action is pending, any court of record, in recognition of the duty and responsibility of a parent to support minor children, shall determine the amount, if any, to be set aside for the protection of such children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>after considering the age of such children, the amount involved, the capacity and integrity of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, and any other facts or information it may have or receive, and such amount may be impressed by creation of an appropriate lien in favor of such children or otherwise protected as circumstances may warrant, but such amount shall not be in excess of 50% of the net amount received after deduction of costs of collection.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If there are no such surviving minor children, the amount recovered shall belong and be paid to the spouse or domestic partner of the deceased; if no spouse or domestic partner survives, to the deceased's lineal heirs as determined by s. 852.01; if no lineal heirs survive, to the deceased's brothers and sisters.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If any such relative dies before judgment in the action, the relative next in order shall be entitled to recover for the wrongful death.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>surviving nonresident alien spouse or a nonresident alien domestic partner under ch. 770 and minor children shall be entitled to the benefits of this section.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In cases subject to s. 102.29 this subsection shall apply only to the surviving spouse's or surviving domestic partner's interest in the amount recovered. If the amount allocated to any child under this subsection is less than $10,000, s. 807.10 may be applied. Every settlement in wrongful death cases in which the deceased leaves minor children under 18 years of age shall be void unless approved by a court of record authorized to act hereunder (emphasis and footnotes added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">\u00b6 45. There is a difference between a wrongful death claim and a survival claim. A wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>claim, as we explain above, compensates the deceased's relatives for the damages they suffer as a result of the deceased's death.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> A survival claim compensates the estate of the deceased (or persons who paid expenses on behalf of the estate) for damages suffered by the deceased between the time of the injury and the time of death.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b6 46. The personal representative may bring both a wrongful death claim and a survival claim, but the beneficiaries receiving the damages recovered under the two claims may be different.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \"[T]he right to sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>under the wrongful death statute must be distinguished from the ownership of the recovery. Because the [wrongful death] action is granted by statute, ownership of the recovery is limited to the beneficiaries designated under the statute.\"<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\u00b6 47. In order to determine whether a beneficiary exists who may recover under a wrongful death claim, the court has frequently grappled with disputes regarding the interpretation of the wrongful death statute's hierarchical beneficiary structure <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The legislature did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>not anticipate numerous fact scenarios in its enactment of the wrongful death statute, and the courts have had to fill the gaps in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\u00b6 48. To determine the meaning of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in the unique fact scenario of the instant case, we must fill the gap in the statute. In enacting Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2), the legislature did not anticipate the fact scenario presented in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>case in which a long-time estranged spouse does not obtain a divorce, has no recoverable damages on the death of the deceased husband, and has no legal obligation to support nonmarital minor children of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">\u00b6 49. In referring to a \"surviving spouse\" and creating a hierarchical structure of beneficiaries in the wrongful death statute, the legislature envisioned an intact marriage with minor marital children whom both the deceased and the deceased's spouse were obliged to support. Indeed, \"[a] careful reading of the entire section [895.04(2)] makes it clear that the trial court in an attempt to protect the children must work from the amount recovered <em>by the spouse who is charged with the support of the minor </em>children.\"<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\u00b6 50. The defendants argue that the statutory-hierarchy of beneficiaries bars the minor children in the present case from asserting a claim for wrongful death because the deceased left a living spouse, and the surviving spouse, Linda Force, cannot claim any damages for wrongful death according to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\u00b6 51. The defendants rest their position on a literal interpretation of the phrase \"surviving spouse\":</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u2022 Linda Force is the spouse of the deceased;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">\u2022 she is still living;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">\u2022 as an estranged spouse she cannot, according to the circuit court's dismissal of her claim, recover any damages for pecuniary loss and loss of society and companionship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u2022 the minor children's share is limited under the statute to a set-aside from the surviving spouse's recovery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">\u2022 because Linda Force's recovery is zero, the minor children's set-aside is also zero.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u00b6 52. The defendants' reading of the statute is not without support in the text, but the defendants' interpretation is not necessarily a reasonable reading of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in unique fact situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u00b6 53. First, the statute does not define who is or is not a surviving spouse.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\u00b6 54. Second, the text of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) does not expressly state that minor children are barred from recovery when a surviving spouse fails to recover any damages. Rather, \u00a7 895.04(2) provides that minor children get a set-aside from the surviving spouse's recoveiy and recover as lineal heirs if no surviving spouse exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">\u00b6 55. A study of the text demonstrates that we are unable to discern the answer to our inquiry in the present case by a mere examination of the words of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) isolated from interpretive aids. We next look for assistance from the legislative pronouncement of the purposes of the wrongful death statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">\u00b6 56. The minor children's position that they should recover under the wrongful death statutes is supported by the legislative purposes advanced by Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">\u00b6 57. The legislature has declared in Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(2) that the purposes of the wrongful death statutes are (1) to hold wrongdoers liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>damages upon death of an injured person, and (2) to compensate relatives of the injured party for the losses caused by the wrongful act. A holding that the minor children cannot maintain a wrongful death claim in the instant case would contravene those fundamental purposes. The wrongdoers would escape liability and the minor children would not be compensated for their losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">\u00b6 58. The purposes of the wrongful death statutes have existed since the law's enactment in 1857. The wrongful death statute was enacted to correct a perceived injustice at common law providing no cause of action for wrongful death.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>\u00b6 59. As the Prosser &amp; Keeton treatise explains, the common-law rule had perverse \"intolerable\" consequences: \"The result was that it was cheaper for the defendant to kill the plaintiff than to injure him, and that the most grievous of all injuries left the bereaved family of the victim, who frequently were destitute, without a remedy.\"<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\">\u00b6 60. In 1846, Parliament passed Lord Campbell's Act, which sidestepped the common law and created a statutory right of action for surviving spouses, children, and parents, as well as other lineal descendants.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\u00b6 61. States too adopted laws recognizing a statutory right of action for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\u00b6 62. In Wisconsin, the wrongful death statute enacted in 1857 was an almost verbatim copy of the New York wrongful death statute,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> which itself was copied nearly word for word from Lord Campbell's Act.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\u00b6 63. A New York court explained that the New York statute extended the principle of liability to a wrongdoer who causes the death of another and gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the right to damages to representatives of the deceased.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">\u00b6 64. Wisconsin courts have echoed these general principles as the driving purposes behind the wrongful death statutes. First, \"[t]he injustices and hardships resulting from the common law principles in wrongful death cases caused the legislature to create statutory remedies and liability.\"<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u00b6 65. Second, \"[t]he purpose of the wrongful death statute is to compensate for the loss of the relational interest existing between the beneficiaries and the deceased.\"<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u00b6 66. In 1961 the legislature explicitly protected the interests of minor children of the deceased \"in recognition of the duty and responsibility of a parent to support minor children.\"<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">\u00b6 67. In contrast to these purposes, the defendants' interpretation of the wrongful death statutes liberates the alleged wrongdoer from all liability for the wrongful death in the instant case. According to the defendants, the liability of the wrongdoer for the deceased's death in the present case is zero and no relative of the deceased, including his minor children, recovers any amount. If we accept the defendants' reasoning, the wrongdoer in the instant case gets a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>windfall at the expense of the deceased's surviving dependent minor children.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\u00b6 68. The defendants' interpretation contravenes the legislative purposes and produces an unfair, unreasonable, or absurd result that the legislature could not have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u00b6 69. We turn to case law to assist us in interpreting the phrase \"surviving spouse\" within the context of the wrongful death statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\u00b6 70. In several cases, the court has employed a literal interpretation of the phrase \"surviving spouse,\" holding that a spouse living at the time of the wrongful death is a \"surviving spouse\" under the wrongful death statutes.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In other cases courts have not read the phrase literally.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> No prior case is directly on point, but we can derive principles from the case law that inform our resolution of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">\u00b6 71. We begin with <em>Cogger v. Trudell, </em>35 Wis. 2d 350, 353, 151 N.W.2d 146 (1967), a lead case governing to whom a recovered wrongful death award belongs when a living spouse may not be able to recover damages and children seek to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">\u00b6 72. In <em>Cogger, </em>Darla Trudell was killed in a car accident. She was the passenger; her husband, Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Trudell, was the driver. The two minor Trudell children sued their father, as well as the driver of the other car.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">\u00b6 73. The father, being one of the defendants in the wrongful death suit, could not bring a claim for wrongful death on his own behalf against himself. The children argued that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2), as amended in 1962,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> gave the children equal status with the surviving spouse, and thus, the fact that the father was alive did not bar their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\u00b6 74. The <em>Cogger </em>court held that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) created a \"series of priorities with regard to the ownership of a cause of action for wrongful death\" and that these priorities were not changed by the 1962 amendment, which added the provision allowing a court to determine an amount to be set aside for the minor children from the surviving spouse's recovery.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\u00b6 75. The <em>Cogger </em>court rejected the children's argument that the 1962 amendment creating a set-aside for minor children had put both the surviving spouse and the surviving children in the first priority class.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Rather, the court stated: \"A careful reading of the entire section makes it clear that the trial court. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>must work from the amount recovered by the spouse who is charged with the support of the minor children.\"<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">\u00b6 76. Looking to case law construing the pre-1962 wrongful death statutes, the court concluded that both before and after the 1962 amendment, \"[t]he beneficiaries and their preferred status are as follows: First,</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">the spouse; second, a child or children; third, the parents. Thus the nonexistence of the preferred beneficiary or beneficiaries is essential to a right of action by or in behalf of other beneficiaries.\"<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\u00b6 77. Even though one of the two children in <em>Cogger </em>was not the child of the surviving spouse, the <em>Cogger </em>court assumed that the surviving spouse had an obligation to support both children and interpreted the statute as specifically addressing minor children supported by the surviving spouse.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u00b6 78. <em>Cogger </em>has been invoked in several cases to bar a minor child's recovery when the surviving spouse who had the obligation to support the children was allegedly responsible in some way for the wrongful death. Perhaps the result of these cases may be explained by the fact that holding for the children who were supported by the surviving spouse could indirectly inure to the benefit of the surviving spouse who caused the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\u00b6 79. In <em>Hanson v. Valdivia, </em>51 Wis. 2d 466, 187 N.W.2d 151 (1971), the minor children of the surviving spouse and the deceased were barred from bringing suit for the deceased parent's wrongful death when the surviving parent allegedly caused the wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>\u00b6 80. The <em>Hanson </em>court relied on <em>Cogger, </em>stating that \"surviving children do not have a cause of action for the wrongful death of one of their parents when the [deceased] is survived by his or her spouse, and the fact that the surviving spouse was responsible for the death does not create a new cause of action in the children.\" <em>Hanson, </em>51 Wis. 2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">\u00b6 81. A second case, <em>Bowen v. American Family Insurance Co., </em>2012 WI App 29, 340 Wis. 2d 232, 811 N.W.2d 887, held that even when the surviving spouse expressly waives the wrongful death claim, the <em>Cogger </em>rule still applies and the child has no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">\u00b6 82. In <em>Bowen, </em>the deceased died while a passenger in a car driven by her spouse when the car collided with another car. An adult child of the deceased and the spouse argued that even if the <em>Cogger </em>rule applied, the court should look to the spouse's express disclaimer of his wrongful death claim to pass the claim on to the adult child.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\u00b6 83. The court of appeals declared that the living spouse was a \"surviving spouse,\" even though the spouse did not wish to pursue a claim and did not want to be a \"surviving spouse.\"<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\u00b6 84. The <em>Cogger </em>decision and its progeny are informative, but <em>Cogger </em>is not dispositive in the present case. The <em>Cogger </em>court did not consider the fact situation presented in the instant case, in which the deceased's spouse is not negligent in causing the death, has no obligation to support the deceased's minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>children, and (according to the circuit court) cannot recover damages for wrongful death under any circumstances.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\u00b6 85. A third case that adheres to <em>Cogger </em>and informs our decision in the present case is <em>Xiong ex rel. Edmondson v. Xiong, </em>2002 WI App 110, 255 Wis. 2d 693, 648 N.W.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u00b6 86. Mai Xiong died as a passenger in a car driven by Nhia Xiong. Mai Xiong and Nhia Xiong were the parents of minor and adult children. The Xiong children brought a wrongful death action against their father, Nhia Xiong. The circuit court dismissed the children's action because Nhia Xiong was responsible for Mai Xiong's death and, pursuant to <em>Cogger, </em>could not recover in a wrongful death claim. The Xiong children argued that the parents were not married, and thus, that their father was not a \"surviving spouse.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\u00b6 87. On appeal, the court of appeals observed that there was no evidence of any official marriage of the parents, in Laos, Thailand, or Wisconsin.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the court valued the unique facts over the literal interpretation of \"surviving spouse\" and determined that the word \"spouse\" in the wrongful death statute could include a \"putative spouse.\" The court of appeals assessed the unique facts surrounding the relationship between the parents and used its \"equity powers\" to recognize the relationship as sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>establish Nhia Xiong as the \"surviving spouse\" for the purposes of the wrongful death statute.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">\u00b6 88. The court of appeals in the <em>Xiong </em>case then applied <em>Cogger </em>and concluded that a surviving spouse existed and the children could not recover.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\u00b6 89. <em>Cogger </em>and its progeny at first blush seem to preclude the children's recovery in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\u00b6 90. On closer examination, however, <em>Cogger </em>and its progeny are, as we explained previously, factually distinguishable from the present case. They therefore are not dispositive. Linda Force did not contribute in any manner to the injury and death of the deceased. Rather, the circuit court concluded that she cannot recover because of her estrangement from the deceased. Because Linda Force has no support obligations to the deceased's minor children, she will not benefit if the children recover damages for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">\u00b6 91. Furthermore, <em>Xiong </em>buttresses the minor children's position in the instant case. <em>Xiong </em>teaches that courts interpret Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) in line with the unique fact situation and the purposes of the wrongful death statutes, rather than in line with formal compliance with laws governing the formation of a marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">\u00b6 92. In <em>Xiong, </em>the parties treated each other as husband and wife, and the court concluded that they should be treated as married under the wrongful death statutes even though no proof of a formal marriage at law existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">\u00b6 93. In the instant case, the parties were estranged for over a decade. Adhering to the teaching of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>Xiong </em>and examining the unique relationship of the parties in the present case dictate that the long-time estranged relationship not be treated as a marriage and that Linda Force not be considered a \"surviving spouse\" under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\u00b6 94. Additional support for the children's position comes from <em>Steinbarth v. Johannes, </em>144 Wis. 2d 159, 423 N.W.2d 540 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">\u00b6 95. <em>Steinbarth, </em>like <em>Xiong, </em>relied on the unique facts rather than the formality of the legal relationship. <em>Steinbarth </em>teaches that under unusual circumstances in which the purposes of the statutes would not be met, the phrase \"surviving spouse\" excludes a living spouse and the children may recover damages under the wrongful death statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\u00b6 96. In <em>Steinbarth, </em>the husband allegedly intentionally shot and killed his wife. The deceased wife's adult children (the husband's stepchildren) sued the husband for wrongful death. Using a literal interpretation of the statute rendering the husband a \"surviving spouse,\" the circuit court and court of appeals concluded that the adult children's wrongful death claim was barred under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) (1985-86).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The supreme court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\u00b6 97. The <em>Steinbarth </em>court was persuaded that statutes prohibiting an intentional killer from benefiting from the crime aided in interpreting the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in the wrongful death statute.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The <em>Steinbarth </em>court held \"that a spouse who 'feloniously and intentionally' kills his or her spouse <em>is not a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>surviving spouse for purposes of [the wrongful death statutes], </em>and is treated as having predeceased the decedent so that the cause of action may accrue to the next designated beneficiary.\"<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">\u00b6 98. The <em>Steinbarth </em>court noted that the unique facts of the case dictated the outcome. The court reasoned that an alternative holding would create an \"anomalous result\" that \"[t]he legislature could not have intended.\"<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">\u00b6 99. The <em>Steinbarth </em>court distinguished <em>Cogger. Cogger </em>involved a surviving spouse who negligently caused the wrongful death; no basis existed in <em>Cogger </em>for stopping a surviving spouse who unintentionally but negligently caused the spouse's death from seeking wrongful death benefits for the loss of the spouse from a more negligent wrongdoer.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u00b6 100. On the other hand, in <em>Steinbarth, </em>the \"surviving spouse,\" a felonious and intentional killer, could not \"under any conceivable circumstance seek recovery under the wrongful death statute for the loss of the decedent.\"<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Cogger </em>and its progeny, the surviving spouse in <em>Steinbarth </em>had no claim against a third-party wrongdoer or any ability to recover for wrongful death of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u00b6 101. The instant case does not align precisely with <em>Cogger, Hanson, Bowen, Xiong, </em>or <em>Steinbarth. </em>Nevertheless, these cases support the conclusion that under the unique facts of the instant case, the claim of the minor children should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u00b6 102. The case law demonstrates that the meaning of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" has been elucidated by scrutinizing unique fact situations to define \"surviving spouse\" in accord with the legislative purposes of the wrongful death statutes, rather than considering only the literal meaning of the phrase \"surviving spouse.\" Linda Force, like the spouse in <em>Steinbarth, </em>is barred from recovering for wrongful death under any circumstances, according to the circuit court. To hold against the children here would allow a wrongdoer to escape liability and deprive relatives of recovery for their loss, simply because of an unusual fact scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\u00b6 103. Courts in other jurisdictions that have wrongful death laws similar to Wisconsin's placing children in a secondary beneficiary class,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> when confronted with unique facts, have held that the secondary beneficiaries have a claim even when the primary beneficiary may exist. Courts have allowed ameliorating common-law principles to apply to fill in a legislature's unintended gaps in a wrongful death statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\u00b6 104. The case <em>Evans v. Atlantic Cement Co., </em>272 So. 2d 538, 541 (Fla. Ct. App. 1973), is a typical example of a court looking to the unique factual circumstances to fulfill the underlying purpose of the wrongful death statute. In <em>Evans, </em>the court held that a woman who lived with the deceased for nine-and-a-half years and had children with him, and for whom the decedent provided support, could maintain an action for wrongful death although she was not literally a \"surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>spouse\" of the deceased. The deceased was survived by a surviving spouse and another child from a different marriage who, under Florida law, could maintain a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">\u00b6 105. The court reasoned that it had to construe the statute in the context of the unique facts of the case in order to avoid a result contrary to the purposes of the wrongful death statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">[T]he preference given by statute to a spouse over a child presupposes the existence of a family, including a parent-child relationship, in the survivors. When the statutes are examined entire, the conclusion cannot be reasonably reached that these class priorities were intended by the legislature to be applied where the fundamental family relationships have been legally destroyed.... It is unreasonable to conclude the legislature intended that dependent children or other family members be left without support or remedy, in favor of strangers to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">[W]e believe the literal wording of the statute [is] applicable where fundamental family relationships still obtain. However, where . . . the family relationships have ruptured or divided... it is proper to allow the additional classes to intervene.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\u00b6 106. Other state courts have permitted secondary beneficiaries to recover damages when the deceased's spouse is still alive. They have done so on a variety of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\u00b6 107. For example, in <em>Foster v. Jeffers, </em>813 S.W.2d 449 (Tenn. App. 1991), the Tennessee court of appeals held that when a spouse still living after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>death of the deceased affirmatively waives his or her claim, the secondary beneficiaries (in that case, the deceased's nephews) can collect the proceeds from the wrongful death action.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The <em>Foster </em>court reasoned that a secondary beneficiary, who would otherwise be barred from a claim by the existence of a surviving spouse, must be able to pursue a claim \"to keep alive the decedent's cause of action\" and to achieve the statutory purpose of ending the regime in which \"it was more economical to kill someone than to merely inflict a nonfatal injury.\"<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Although Wisconsin courts have explicitly rejected this waiver approach to the wrongful death statute,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> <em>Foster </em>is instructive, standing for the proposition that sister states with hierarchical beneficiary structures permit secondary beneficiaries to collect even when primary beneficiaries are still alive, in order to fulfill the purposes of the statute in unusual or unique fact situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">\u00b6 108. Georgia courts have similarly held that in some circumstances, secondary beneficiaries can recover damages when the deceased's spouse is still alive. In <em>Brown v. Liberty Oil &amp; Refining Corp., </em>403 S.E.2d 806 (Ga. 1991), the Georgia Supreme Court held that although the deceased's spouse was still alive and prior interpretations of the statute had barred children's wrongful death claims when there was a surviving spouse,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> in the unique fact scenario of the case in which the surviving spouse abandoned the children and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>could not be located, \"the factual circumstances of this case demand the exercise of [equity] powers to preserve the rights of the minor children.\"<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The Georgia courts have subsequently applied this holding to other unusual fact scenarios to hold that secondary beneficiary children can recover damages for wrongful death even when the deceased's spouse is still alive.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">\u00b6 109. Although these cases are not dispositive of the instant case and do not present a unified theory, they are informative in teaching that state courts have recognized that secondary wrongful death beneficiaries can bring claims in unique fact scenarios in which barring such claims would undermine or contradict the wrongful death statutes' purposes of punishing wrongdoers and compensating the deceased's relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\u00b6 110. In sum, Wisconsin case law and case law from other jurisdictions supports the children's claim in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u00b6 111. Finally, we examine the statutory history. We have explored statutory history previously in our discussion of the text, the legislative purposes, and the case law. The statutory history shows that the legislature has repeatedly amended the classes of potential beneficiaries. It appears from the statutory history that when a court excluded a class from being a beneficiary, often the legislature would amend the wrongful death statute to include the class.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u00b6 112. For our purposes, amendments in 1961 and 1962 are key in the statutory history, because they directly addressed the right of minor children to recover for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">\u00b6 113. Before 1961, the statute made the spouse the primary beneficiary and the children secondary beneficiaries as lineal heirs of the deceased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\"><em>The amount recovered shall belong and be paid to the spouse of the deceased; if no spouse survives, to the deceased's lineal heirs as determined by section 237.01; </em>if no lineal heirs survive, to the deceased's brothers and sisters. If any such relative dies before judgment in the action, the relative next in order shall be entitled to recover for the wrongful death. A surviving nonresident alien wife and minor children shall be entitled to the benefits of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Wis. Stat. \u00a7 331.04(2) (1959-60).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">\u00b6 114. The 1961 amendment switched the order of the beneficiaries, placing the children as primary beneficiaries and the surviving spouse as a secondary beneficiary. If there were no minor children, the surviving spouse recovered. The legislature amended the statute in 1961 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">If the deceased leaves surviving a spouse, and minor children with whose support he was legally charged, said minor children shall be entitled to an amount as fixed by the circuit court.. . ; said benefits to be used for the support of such child or children during their minority, and after the youngest child reaches 21 years of age, the balance, if any, shall be divided equally among said children surviving. The remainder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>amount recovered or the amount recovered if there are no such surviving minor children shall belong and be paid to the spouse of the deceased ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Ch. 285, Laws of 1961 (enacted July 27, 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\u00b6 115. The bill drafting file does not reveal the backstory of this amendment, but the language makes clear that the legislature intended to favor minor children whom the deceased was legally charged to support over a surviving spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u00b6 116. A 1962 amendment reveals the legislature's second thoughts about the newly adopted 1961 hierarchy. The bill drafting file of the 1962 amendment also does not reveal the backstory of this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\u00b6 117. The 1962 amendment, adopted about six months after the 1961 amendment, returned the surviving spouse to primary beneficiary status but protected the minor children by creating a set-aside from the surviving spouse's recovery. This amendment supports the defendant's interpretation of the wrongful death statute that the children are not in the primary class of beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u00b6 118. The 1962 amendment reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">If the deceased leaves surviving a spouse, and minor children <em>under 18 years of age </em>with whose support he was legally charged, <em>the court before whom an action is pending, or if no action is pending, any court of record, in recognition of the duty and responsibility of a parent to support his minor children, shall determine the amount, if any, to be set aside for the protection of such children after considering the age of such children, the amount involved, the capacity and integrity of the surviving spouse, and any other facts or information it may have or receive, and such amount may be impressed by creation of an appropriate lien in favor of such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>children or otherwise protected as circumstances may warrant, but such amount shall not be in excess of 50per cent of the net amount received after deduction of costs of collection. </em>If there are no such surviving minor children, <em>the amount recovered </em>shall belong and be paid to the spouse of the deceased ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Ch. 649, Laws of 1961 (enacted Jan. 30, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u00b6 119. This 1962 amendment gave the courts discretion to consider how much the set-aside for the minor children would be, considering \"the age of such children, the amount involved, the capacity and integrity of the surviving spouse, and any other facts or information [they] may have or receive.\" The legislature made clear that the statute was enacted to protect the spouse but also to recognize \"the duty and responsibility of a parent to support his minor children.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u00b6 120. Other than the 1961 and 1962 amendments, in recent years the legislature has left the wrongful death statutes largely intact in the wake of cases depriving or granting the children recovery in unusual fact situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\u00b6 121. <em>Cogger </em>established that a surviving spouse, even one who was a wrongdoer in causing the deceased's death, remained a primary beneficiary despite cutting off the claims of the minor children.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> After <em>Cogger, </em>the legislature took no action to amend the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u00b6 122. <em>Steinbarth </em>established that a living spouse who intentionally kills the deceased cannot be a surviving spouse under the wrongful death statute, and the children can recover.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Again, the legislature took no action to amend the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\u00b6 123. According to the defendants, their position is supported by the legislature's failure to revise Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) after <em>Cogger </em>and other cases. These cases barred secondary beneficiaries from recovering under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">\u00b6 124. We are not persuaded that the legislative inaction supports the defendants. Legislative inaction is ordinarily weak evidence of legislative acquiescence in or countenance of a judicial or executive branch interpretation.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\u00b6 125. Rather, the statutory history, including the 1961 and 1962 amendments, teaches that the legislature has protected the interests of both the surviving spouse and the minor children and that the legislature has left interpretation of the phrase \"surviving spouse\" to the courts when unanticipated fact scenarios have emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u00b6 126. In the instant case, we must consider, as the statutory history instructs, the interests of both the surviving spouse and the children based on the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u00b6 127. For the reasons set forth, we interpret the phrase \"surviving spouse\" in the present case as not including Linda Force, the deceased's estranged spouse who, as a result of the circuit court's dismissal of her wrongful death claim (which was not appealed), is barred from recovery under Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.03 and 895.04(2). If Linda Force is not a \"surviving spouse\" under the statute, the parties do not dispute that the minor children have a cognizable claim as lineal heirs. As lineal heirs of the deceased, the children would be first in line for any recovery for the wrongful death of their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\u00b6 128. We conclude that the circuit court erred in granting the defendants summary judgment and erred in dismissing the minor children's causes of action against the defendants for wrongful death. The minor children in the present case have a cause of action against the defendants for wrongful death as if Linda Force were not alive at the death of the deceased.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\u00b6 129. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court against the children and in favor of the defendants and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\"><em>By the Court. </em>\u2014 The judgment and order of the circuit court are reversed and the cause is remanded to the circuit court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2011-12 version unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> <em>Steinbarth v.

The seminal case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>statutory interpretation in recent years is <em>State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for Dane County, </em>2004 WI 58, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">\u00b6 131. In <em>Kalal, </em>the court emphasized the importance of statutory text when it embraced the principle that a court's role is to determine what a statute means rather than determine what the legislature intended. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 44. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">It is ... a solemn obligation of the judiciary to faithfully give effect to the laws enacted by the legislature, and to do so requires a determination of statutory meaning. Judicial deference to the policy choices enacted into law by the legislature requires that statutory interpretation focus primarily on the language of the statute. We assume that the legislature's intent is expressed in the statutory language. Extrinsic evidence of legislative intent may become relevant to statutory interpretation in some circumstances, but is not the primary focus of inquiry. It is the enacted law, not the unenacted intent, that is binding on the public. Therefore, the purpose of statutory interpretation is to determine what the statute means so that it may be given its full, proper, and intended effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\u00b6 132. The court explained that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 45. \"Statutory language is given its common, ordinary, and accepted meaning, except that technical or specially-defined words or phrases are given their technical or special definitional meaning.\" <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Then the court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">Context is important to meaning. So, too, is the structure of the statute in which the operative language appears. Therefore, statutory language is interpreted in the context in which it is used; not in isolation but as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>part of a whole; in relation to the language of surrounding or closely-related statutes; <em>and reasonably, to avoid absurd or unreasonable results.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><em>Id., </em>\u00b6 46 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\u00b6 133. In my view, this case requires the court to confront head-on statutory language that, if applied literally, would produce an absurd or unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\u00b6 134. Historically, courts have tried to avoid absurd or unreasonable results. The year before <em>Kalal, </em>this court said in <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2003 WI 50, \u00b6 38, 261 Wis. 2d 458, 661 N.W.2d 832: \"The court should not search for ambiguity. It should enforce a clear statute.\" However, \"One of the few exceptions to this sound principle is that the court will seek to avoid a truly absurd or unreasonable result.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 39 (citing <em>State v. Burkman, </em>96 Wis. 2d 630, 642, 292 N.W.2d 641 (1980); <em>State v. Mendoza, </em>96 Wis. 2d 106, 115, 291 N.W.2d 478 (1980); <em>Kayden Indus., Inc. v.

There are innumerable cases in which Wisconsin courts have repeated or actually invoked this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\u00b6 136. In <em>Worachek v. Stephenson Town School District, </em>270 Wis. 116, 124, 70 N.W.2d 657 (1955), the court stated: \"This court has repeatedly held that a statute should not be construed so as to work an absurd result even when the language seems clear and unambiguous.\" <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Connell v.

Moreover, courts have \" 'some \"scope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or usual meaning of its words where acceptance of that meaning... would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute.\"'\" When a literal interpretation produces absurd or unreasonable results, or results that are clearly at odds with the legislature's intent, \"[o]ur task is to give some alternative meaning\" to the words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><em>Id. </em>(brackets in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\u00b6 140. In <em>Teschendorf v. State Farm Insurance Companies, </em>2006 WI 89, \u00b6 15, 293 Wis. 2d 123, 717 N.W.2d 258, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">[I]f the meaning of the statute appears to be plain but that meaning produces absurd results, we may also consult legislative history. The purpose in this situation is to verify that the legislature did not intend these unreasonable or unthinkable results. Because our purpose in these situations is grounded in open disbelief of what a statute appears to require, we are bound to limit our off-statute investigations to obvious aberrations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations and explanatory parentheticals omitted). The court went on, \"The reason to doubt a literal meaning of [the statute] is that it clashes with related statutes.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">\u00b6 141. In <em>Gasper v. Parbs, </em>2001 WI App 259, \u00b6 8, 249 Wis. 2d 106, 637 N.W.2d 399, the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">[T]he plain language of a statute should not be construed in a manner that leads to absurd or unreasonable results. <em>State v.

These principles were undoubtedly applied in <em>Steinbarth v.

LaPour, </em>123 Wis. 2d 366, 370, 366 N.W.2d 891 (1985)). <em>Steinbarth, </em>of course, interpreted the same statute now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\u00b6 143. Courts try to avoid absurd results, but courts are not eager to disregard the seemingly clear language of a statute. This reluctance is salutary because it reflects the deference and respect of the judiciary for the policy choices of other branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">\u00b6 144. For judges, there is plenty of solid ground between judicial activism and judicial paralysis. Our precedent provides guidance on when judges should act and when they should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">\u00b6 145. Absurd results are much more than undesirable results. Absurd results are aberrations that clash with the manifest purpose of a statute or related statutes (evidenced by statutory language) and cannot be explained as a rational exception to the statutory scheme. Absurd results are usually unexpected. They are different from harsh consequences because they are seldom the fault of an adversely affected party. Instead, they almost always result from circumstances beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the party's control. Absurd results produce hardship or unfairness that is quickly recognized and cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">\u00b6 146. This case satisfies these standards, as is documented in the majority opinion. We ought to act but also implore the legislature to rewrite the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\u00b6 147. For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Ao\">PATIENCE DRAKE ROGGENSACK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\u00b6 148. <em>{dissenting). </em>While the majority opinion reaches an appealing result as it permits the minor children of Billy Joe Force to maintain a claim for his wrongful death, I cannot join the opinion. In my view, the majority opinion's conclusion that the statutory term \"surviving spouse\" does not mean a spouse who has survived the death of her husband because she was estranged from her husband at his death is not based on statutory construction and will create considerable mischief in the future. Accordingly, I would affirm the circuit court, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">\u00b6 149. The underlying facts are not disputed or complicated. On November 12, 2008, Billy Joe Force died as a result of a motor vehicle accident. At the time of his death, Billy was married to Linda Force. However, Billy and Linda had been separated since 1996, and Billy had not provided any support to Linda since 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">\u00b6 150. Billy and Linda had no children of their marriage. However, at his death, Billy had three minor children, born of two women, neither of whom he had married. It is these three children who seek to maintain this wrongful death action against Jeffrey Brown, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>driver of the other vehicle in the accident; his insurer, American Family Mutual Insurance Company; and Regent Insurance Company, the insurer of Billy's employer, for whom Billy was driving at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">\u00b6 151. The circuit court granted summary judgment of dismissal, concluding that: (1) Linda survived Billy; (2) the children had no independent cause of action under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2); (3) Linda had no compensable damages; and (4) because Linda could not recover, no offset was available for the children. The court of appeals certified the issue of whether children have an independent claim for relief under \u00a7 895.04 when there is a surviving spouse, who has been estranged from the decedent for more than ten years and could not recover, thereby precluding any set aside for the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We accepted certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AFh\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\u00b6 152. We are asked to construe the term \"surviving spouse\" in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2). Statutory interpretation presents a question of law for our independent review; however, we benefit from the circuit court's discussion. <em>Spiegelberg v. State, </em>2006 WI 75, \u00b6 8, 291 Wis. 2d 601, 717 N.W.2d 641. When we construe a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>statute, we also consider our past interpretations of that statute. <em>Schill v. Wis. Rapids Sch. Dist., </em>2010 WI 86, \u00b6 49, 327 Wis. 2d 572, 786 N.W.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">B. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\u00b6 153. We are not writing on a clean slate as we interpret Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) in the case now before us. As the court of appeals correctly pointed out, our interpretation of <em>Cogger v. Trudell, </em>35 Wis. 2d 350, 151 N.W.2d 146 (1967), precludes recovery for children when there is a surviving spouse who cannot recover. Courts have followed <em>Cogger </em>with only one exception since 1967, <em>Steinbarth v. Johannes, </em>144 Wis. 2d 159, 423 N.W.2d 540 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\u00b6 154. In <em>Steinbarth, </em>the husband feloniously and intentionally killed his wife, whose death was the basis for the children's wrongful death claim. During our consideration of the children's claim, we reviewed Wis. Stat. \u00a7 852.01(2m) (1985-86), which precluded one who feloniously and intentionally killed a decedent from recovering as an heir of the decedent. <em>Id. </em>at 166. We noted that \u00a7 852.01(2m) (1985-86) treated the killer as having predeceased the decedent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that the husband in <em>Steinbarth </em>should be treated consistent with the statutory directive of \u00a7 852.01(2m) (1985-86).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to do so, we concluded that a husband who feloniously and intentionally killed his wife will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>treated for purposes of a wrongful death claim as though he had predeceased his wife. Accordingly, there would be no surviving spouse under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04 and the children could maintain an action for wrongful death. <em>Id. </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">\u00b6 155. In <em>Steinbarth, </em>we distinguished <em>Cogger </em>by noting that the spouse's death in <em>Cogger </em>was based on negligence and in <em>Steinbarth, </em>it was based on intent to kill. We also noted a specific legislative directive about the status of one who kills his spouse for purposes of claims made relative to the death of the spouse. Neither distinction is present here. Linda had nothing to do with Billy's death, and there is no statutory directive, other than the wrongful death statute, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04, that applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\u00b6 156. If I were writing for the majority, I would affirm the circuit court and fully describe how unfair the current statute is to children who have suffered significant damages due to the wrongful death of a parent, but who have no claim when the surviving spouse has no recovery. By the 1961 amendments to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2), the legislature made an attempt to independently protect children who suffered a loss because of the wrongful death of a parent, but more is needed today to finish what the legislature then began.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\u00b6 157. Instead of acknowledging that a claim for wrongful death is purely statutory and that at common law no such claim existed, <em>Bowen v. American Family Insurance Co., </em>2012 WI App 29, \u00b6 10, 340 Wis. 2d 232, 811 N.W.2d 887, the majority opinion pretends that it is construing Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) and creates a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It interprets the statutory phrase, \"surviving spouse,\" as not including Linda, Billy's spouse who survived him. The majority justifies the result it reaches by relating that Linda and Billy have been estranged for ten years and that Linda could not prove wrongful death damages on her own behalf.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">\u00b6 158. While the majority opinion's result is appealing, I cannot join the majority opinion's interpretation of the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) term \"surviving spouse.\" The methods employed to interpret \u00a7 895.04(2) comport with none of the legal principles that guide statutory interpretation. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for Dane Cnty., </em>2004 WI 58, \u00b6\u00b6 38-46, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110. Saying that \u00a7 895.04(2) means whatever the majority wants it to mean will cause confusion and repetitive litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\u00b6 159. For example, is an estrangement of five years sufficient time to cause a spouse who survives the decedent to no longer be a \"surviving spouse\" under the majority opinion's construction of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.04(2)? Is two years long enough, if there has been absolutely no communication between the spouses? Furthermore, how does the majority opinion line up with spousal intestate succession under Wis. Stat. ch. 852, which says nothing about a spouse's rights being limited due to the husband and wife being separated? <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 852.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u00b6 160. Claims of the type now before us under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) are commonly brought and commonly denied because of our decision in Cogger.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>would assist children who attempt to bring wrongful death claims in the future by pointing out the unfairness the current statute creates and asking the legislature to consider revising \u00a7 895.04(2), rather than creating a common law fix for the children in the present case and leaving all similarly situated children without a claim due to our interpretation of \u00a7 895.04(2) in <em>Cogger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\u00b6 161. While the majority opinion reaches an appealing result as it permits the minor children of Billy Joe Force to maintain a claim for his wrongful death, I cannot join the opinion. In my view, the majority opinion's conclusion that the statutory term \"surviving spouse\" does not mean a spouse who has survived the death of her husband because she was estranged from her husband at his death is not based on statutory construction and will create considerable mischief in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u00b6 162.

I join Justice Roggensack's dissent, but write separately to clarify that, had the majority been able to link the Force children's ability to recover with the language of the statute, and reconcile that text with our prior case law, <em>see, e.g., Cogger v. Trudell, </em>35 Wis. 2d 350, 353, 151 N.W.2d 146 (1967), I would have joined the majority. The majority was unable, however, to find a satisfactory, textual way to construe Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) so to allow the Force children to recover in a wrongful death action. As a result, I am compelled to join Justice Roggensack's dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">\u00b6 165. Justice Prosser concludes that the application of the statutory language produces an \"absurd\" result. <em>See </em>Justice Prosser's concurrence, \u00b6 133. An unpalatable result is not the same as an absurd result. We are to look to the text of the statute to determine whether relief is afforded to the litigants. \"In construing or interpreting a statute the court is not at liberty to disregard the plain, clear words of the statute.\" <em>State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for Dane Cnty., </em>2004 WI 58, \u00b6 46, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110 (citation omitted). It is not the role of the courts to \"save\" the legislative branch from the consequences of the laws it passes, or to create a remedy when the plain language of the statute does not afford relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u00b6 166. As a practical matter, the legislature cannot be expected to meaningfully reconsider legislation if the court usurps the role of the legislature in order to create a remedy where none otherwise exists. The long and complex history of the wrongful death statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>provides support for the notion that the legislature should consider revision to provide relief when it should be due. <em>See </em>majority op., \u00b6\u00b6 69-102 (discussing <em>Steinbarth v. Johannes, </em>144 Wis. 2d 159, 423 Wis. 2d 540 (1988); <em>Hanson v. Valdivia, </em>51 Wis. 2d 466, 187 N.W.2d 151 (1971); <em>Cogger, </em>35 Wis. 2d 350; <em>Bowen v. American Family Ins. Co., </em>2012 WI App 29, 340 Wis. 2d 232, 811 N.W.2d 887; <em>Xiong v. Xiong, </em>2002 WI App 110, 255 Wis. 2d 693, 648 N.W.2d 900). The majority's apparent difficulty in distinguishing these cases provides an apt illustration of the problem. The court should not avoid the plain language of a statute in order to prevent unpleasant results. In my view, legislative action is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">\u00b6 167.
