Bay, at Hart, in the county of Oceona, in the state of Michigan, on the 28th day of August, 1895; and that no children were born as the issue of such marriage; and he stated as the ground for divorce that the said Anna C. Bay had been wilfully absent from the plaintiff for more than eleven years last past and had wholly disregarded all marital duties; and praying for a divorce and other relief. The plaintiff filed an affidavit for publication of notice, in which it is alleged that the .residence and postoffice of said Anna C. Bay is Walkerville, Oceona county, Michigan, and for that reason service of summons and a copy of the petition cannot be made in this state, etc., and there was no service except by publication. On the 3d day of July, 1909, the court of common pleas granted the divorce as prayed, and further ordered, \u201cthat, by reason of the acts of aggression of the defendant, Anna C. Bay, and because of the transfer of the property interests to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>her by this plaintiff, and from the evidence herein, that the defendant be and she is excluded and forever barred from claiming or holding any estate or interest, either vested, inchoate, dower, or inheritance, or otherwise, in the real, personal, or mixed property of this plaintiff, now owned or held by him, or which he may hereafter acquire.\u201d The said Christian Bay died in Lorain county, Ohio, on or about November the 5th, 1910, leaving a will, by the terms of which all his property was disposed of to other parties than the plaintiff in error. On the 24th of December, 1910, Anna C. Bay filed, in the court of common pleas of Putnam county, Ohio, her petition to set aside the decree and judgment aforesaid, and for leave to answer and have the case tried upon the facts which she alleged in an answer in the original case, tendered therewith. In that petition, she avers that Christian Bay was not, and never had been, a <em>bona fide </em>resident of the state of Ohio, or of Putnam county, and that the petitioner had no notice or knowledge of any kind of the pendency of said petition for divorce, until after the death of said Christian Bay, to-wit, on or about December the 16th, 1910. She alleged, in her answer, and amendment thereto, that she had faithfully complied with all the terms and conditions of the marriage contract upon her part, and that the said Christian Bay had neglected and refused to comply therewith on his part, and had been guilty of extreme cruelty toward her, and that he abandoned her, in the spring of 1900, in a helpless condition, wholly unprovided for; that he was then possessed of about twenty thousand dollars in cash and land; that about June the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>7th, 1900, she had begun, in the court of common pleas of Wood county, Ohio, a suit for divorce and alimony; and by reason of false and fraudulent representations and inducements made to her by said Christian Bay, she had dismissed the said cause of action and no record was made thereof; that, as a part of the arrangement by which the said suit was dismissed by her, he entered into an agreement in writing with her to live separate and apart, and he was to pay her the sum of thirteen hundred dollars; and she averred that, relying upon the statements as to the amount of property possessed by him, and upon this written agreement, she dismissed her petition and returned to the state of Michigan; and shortly afterward the said Christian Bay came to her home, in Walkerville, Oceona county, Michigan, and desired to live and cohabit with her as his wife, and they did so live and cohabit together as husband and wife until about three years prior to the time of filing this answer. This answer was supported by two affidavits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">On the hearing of this petition, in the court of common pleas, the said Anna C. Bay, to maintain the issues on her part, introduced her petition, her answer and her amendment to her answer, and the affidavits aforesaid, and also introduced and read to the court the appearance docket and papers in the case, which appear as part of the record in this case, together with certain exhibits, which are attached to the bill of exceptions. And thereupon the counsel for the said defendants in error herein moved the court to dismiss the petition and answer of the said Anna C. Bay, on the ground that said court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the same. On consideration whereof, the court sustained the said motion and dismissed the petition of the plaintiff herein. The circuit court affirmed this ruling, and this proceeding is brought here to reverse the judgment of the said circuit court and court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-6\"><em>Mr. Benjamin F.

Weidman, 57 Ohio St., 101, we find the court reviewing the authorities prior thereto and the distinction is drawn between the case wherein a divorce is decreed when the court has full jurisdiction of both the parties and the subject-matter, and the case wherein the court does not acquire jurisdiction over the defendant by personal service, and in the latter class of cases fall the following: <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>10 Ohio, 28; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox, 20 </em>Ohio St., 439; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Waddle, </em>44 Ohio St., 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-9\">In line with the foregoing authorities we submit the following authorities, which may be considered advantageous for the reasoning which is contained within them and which we believe strengthens the reasoning which has been shown in the decisions above quoted. <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>6 N. P., 258; <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Wellington, 7 </em>W. L.

Avery, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-7\">It does not seem necessary to cite precedents in support of the proposition, \u201cthat a decree of divorce, when rendered by a court authorized to hear and determine such cases, is in this state, final and conclusive.\u201d The following cases have often been cited: <em>Bascom </em>v. <em>Bascom, 7 </em>Ohio (pt. 2), 125; <em>Laughery </em>v. <em>Laughery, </em>15 Ohio, 404; <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>6 Ohio St., 64; <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Parish, 9 </em>Ohio St., 534; <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Neil, </em>38 Ohio St., 558; <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>39 Ohio St., 377; <em>John </em>v. <em>John, </em>53 Ohio St., 656; <em>Casler </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>56 Ohio St., 761; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Mulligan, 82 </em>Ohio St., 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-8\">We believe the court has no more authority to modify the judgment determining the property matters, than to modify the decree of divorce. This is especially true in a case where the decree makes a final and permanent division of property. <em>Law </em>v. <em>Law, </em>64 Ohio St., 369; <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>43 Ohio St., 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-9\">In causes for divorce and alimony, whatever contradictions may exist in the decisions from the courts of the several states, they arise from the fact that some courts have attempted to treat these suits as in the nature of actions <em>in personam </em>instead of <em>in rem. </em>Consideration of those decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>will not aid us in arriving at a correct conclusion upon the questions here involved for those courts now find their law in a state of hopeless confusion. Our Ohio courts have always consistently held these cases to be proceedings <em>in rem </em>and so holding, our decisions have been logical and consistent. <em>Benner </em>v. <em>Benner, </em>63 Ohio St., 220; <em>McGill </em>v. <em>Deming, </em>44 Ohio St., 657.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-4\">While regarding the divorce and alimony proceedings as a cause <em>in rem, </em>our courts take jurisdiction of two things: 1. The status of the parties if both are before the court or of a party if only one is before the court \u2014 that is the marriage status. 2. The property of the parties or of a party before the court where the property is within the jurisdiction. The action is in no sense a personal action. Properly speaking, it has no parties for the court is acting only upon the <em>res.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-5\">The nature of these actions is best illustrated in suits to libel a vessel in admiralty proceedings, in the probating of wills, and in suits to establish status as in <em>habeas corpus. Scott </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>13 Mass., 162; <em>Lessee of Pillsbury </em>v. <em>Dugan\u2019s Admr., </em>9 Ohio, 117; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Steamboat, </em>2 Ohio St., 26; <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Spink, </em>3 Ohio St., 105; <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U. S., 714; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>26 C. C., 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">The court is judge of its right to take jurisdiction. <em>Lessee of Glover\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>Ruffin, </em>6 Ohio, 255; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra; Lessee of Pillsbury </em>v. <em>Dugan\u2019s Admr., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">The decree cannot be vacated for fraud. <em>Michael </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>84 Ohio St., 370.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>We think that the holdings of the circuit court in <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra, </em>and <em>Casto </em>v. <em>Casto, </em>30 C. C., 96, to the effect that Section 5355, Revised Statutes (P. &amp; A. Anno. G. C. \u00a7 11632), are not applicable to proceedings had under the chapter relating to divorce and alimony, are correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-6\">We contend that our courts have no jurisdiction to hear or determine an application to. reopen a divorce case at a subsequent term, and, coupled with that proposition, is the further fact that the plaintiff in the divorce proceeding had died before any proceeding was brought to reopen the divorce case. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>39 Ohio St., 393; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Waddle, </em>44 Ohio St., 449; <em>Coffman, Admr., </em>v. <em>Finney, Admr,, </em>65 Ohio St., 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-7\">We shall not attempt to reconcile the decisions of all the other states with Ohio in reference to divorce and alimony causes for the reason that some have treated such causes as actions <em>in personam </em>instead of actions <em>in rem. </em>The courts of Ohio have uniformly held such causes to be actions <em>in rem. </em>2 Bishop on Marriage, Divorce and Separation, Secs. 25, 37, 76; <em>Petersine </em>v. <em>Thomas, 28 </em>Ohio St., 595.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-8\">Davis, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWt\">The relief which the plaintiff sought, by her petition to set aside the decree by the court of common pleas, was not to be let in to defend against the divorce. The marriage relation had already been dissolved by the death of the husband. What she complains of is that she has not had her day in court to be heard upon the adjustment of property rights and the division of property as between her and her late husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>If this petition, and the answer to be filed in the original case and the amendment thereto, together with the affidavits in support thereof, are to be taken as true, the court was grossly imposed upon and she was fraudulently deprived of an opportunity to defend her rights upon the hearing of the divorce case. But it is conceded that the ruling in <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Parish, 9 </em>Ohio St., 534, which has been steadily adhered to, would preclude any reconsideration of the divorce issue, even if the husband were not now dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The question still remains, Can the defendant be at the same time thus fraudulently deprived of her property rights without remedy? We see nothing in the judgment or in the reasoning in <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Parish </em>which would justify its extension to this phase of the present case. That case was expressly limited in the opiliion as follows: \u201cWe therefore feel compelled, though reluctantly, to hold that sound public policy in this class of cases, forbids us from setting aside a decree of divorce <em>a vinculo, </em>though obtained by fraud and false testimony, on an original bill filed at a subsequent term.\u201d We think that it would be doing violence to the language of the court to hold that \u201csound public policy\u201d would protect the fruits of fraud and perjury beyond the mere severance of the marriage relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">An analysis of the cases will disclose the fact that this court has always clearly distinguished the reviewable nature of a judgment in a divorce proceeding respecting property interests, from the finality of the divorce; and that it has gone beyond this, in certain cases and in furtherance of justice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>to declare that the wife may maintain an action for alimony as \u201cwife\u201d although by reason of a previous dissolution by a decree of divorce the matrimonial relation no longer exists. See <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>McIntyre et al., </em>10 Ohio, 27; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>19 Ohio St., 502; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>20 Ohio St., 439; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Waddle, </em>44 Ohio St., 449; <em>McGill </em>v. <em>Deming, </em>44 Ohio St., 645; <em>Weidman </em>v. <em>Weidman, </em>57 Ohio St., 101; <em>Doerr </em>v. <em>Forsythe, Admx., </em>50 Ohio St., 726; <em>Coffman, Admr., et al., </em>v. <em>Finney, Admr., et al., </em>65 Ohio St., 61; <em>Hassaurek </em>v. <em>Markbreit, Admr., </em>68 Ohio St., 554. None of these cases is, in all its facts, like the one at bar; but through all of them there runs, clearly marked and broadly stated, the doctrine that the decree of divorce is immutable, whether obtained by fraud or not, yet that the judgment as to property rights is not conclusive unless both the parties had their day in court. In <em>Doerr </em>v. <em>Forsythe, Admx., supra, </em>this court said: \u201cThe decree of divorce granted in the state of Indiana, acted only on the marital relation between the parties, and did not affect, nor purport to affect the property rights of the wife, in the state of Ohio. * * * But if it were otherwise, as she had no opportunity to defend, all that can be claimed for that decree, is that it dissolved the marriage relation between the parties, and restored the husband to the status of an unmarried man. This the court could do; but, as it had no jurisdiction of the person of the wife, it was not competent to the Indiana court to affect such rights as she had acquired in the property of the husband under the laws of this state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>10 Ohio, 27; <em>McGill </em>v. <em>Deming, </em>44 Ohio St., 645.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In <em>Weidman </em>v. <em>Weidman, supra, </em>the court said: \u201cIn cases where there is no jurisdiction of the person of one of the parties, there can be no adjudication <em>in personam </em>of the question of alimony; and therefore in such cases, while the divorce may be valid, the question of alimony remains unadjudicated, and the wife may, under proper circumstances, maintain an action for alimony.\u201d And while we have this case in hand, we may as well make another quotation from it, which is pertinent to the present case, viz: \u201cAfter an absolute divorce in an action in which the court had jurisdiction of both parties, she is no longer \u2018the wife\u2019 and does not come within the provisions of the statute. Strictly speaking, the same, is true in cases in which the divorce was obtained by the husband in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, but as the wife has not had her day in court as to alimony, nor as to her equitable interest in his property, this court, by a liberal construction in her favor, has allowed her in such cases to maintain a separate action against her divorced husband for the recovery of alimony, which \u2022 is in its nature an equitable allowance out of his property.\u201d See further on this last proposition, <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>and <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Waddle, supra, </em>opinion by Follett, J., pp. 456-457. Similar reasoning is applied to the cases of <em>Coffman, Admr., </em>v. <em>Finney, Admr., supra, </em>in which both the parties to the divorce proceedings were dead, and <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra, </em>and <em>McGill </em>v. <em>Deming, supra, </em>in both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>which cases the property right involved was dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The record in the divorce case shows that the only service on the defendant was a constructive notice by publication. But the affidavit for publication, sworn to by the plaintiff, gives the place of residence and postoffice address and gives it correctly. There was therefore no authority to give notice by publication. Section 5693, Revised Statutes; P. &amp; A. Anno. G. C. \u00a7 11984. By the same section it is made the duty of the plaintiff to forthwith deposit in the postoffice, directed to the defendant, a summons and a copy of the petition. This does not appear to have been done; and since the defendant alleges in her petition to open up the judgment, and in her answer and the affidavits in support thereof, that she had neither notice nor knowledge of the pendency of the petition for divorce, until after the- death of her husband, she has a right to be heard upon all questions arising upon this alleged fraudulent judgment as to her rights in the property of Christian Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The judgments of the circuit and court of common pleas are <em>reversed </em>and the cause is <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-8\">Spear, Johnson and Donahue, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
