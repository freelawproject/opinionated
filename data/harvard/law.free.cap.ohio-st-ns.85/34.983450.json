In an action brought in this state to recover upon a judgment rendered in another state, the defendant having been there personally served with process and having there unavailingly challenged the jurisdiction of the court over his person upon the ground that he had been fraudulently decoyed into that state for the purpose of effecting personal service upon him, will not be permitted here to challenge the validity of such service.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b86-13\">2. Such judgment having been recovered upon a promissory note, the defendant will not be permitted here to plead against the plaintiff rights arising out of his relations to other makers of such note and depending upon facts which were existent when the original suit was brought, whether such relations and facts were there pleaded or not.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b86-15\">(No. 12682 \u2014</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AW\">Decided October 31, 1911.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-16\">Error to the Circuit Court of Darke county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-17\">The defendants in error brought suit in the court of common pleas of Darke county to recover of Albright the amount of a judgment alleged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>have been recovered by them against him and others in the circuit court of Hancock county, Indiana. In their, petition they alleged that said circuit court is a court of general jurisdiction created by the laws of Indiana; that said judgment was rendered after the issuance of summons in the action and the personal service thereof on Albright in the state of Indiana, and that the judgment remains unsuspended and wholly unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">In his answer Albright alleged that the judgment on which the plaintiffs counted had been recovered on a promissory note executed in Darke county by Albright &amp; Son, Thomas IT. New and himself, he being surety merely, and he further alleged the circumstances, under which he claimed it was executed, to show that he was fraudulently induced to execute it as surety and to show that he had equitable rights against other parties to the note. He also alleged circumstantially that when suit was brought upon the note in Hancock county he was by false representations decoyed from his home in Darke county, Ohio, into Wayne county, Indiana, where the summons from the circuit court of Hancock county was personally served on him; that without pleading to the merits of said action and expressly disclaiming all intention of appearing therein he filed his motion therein to quash the summons and set aside the return thereof because he had been so decoyed into the state of Indiana for the purpose of effecting such personal service, but that the court after hearing said motion overruled the same and rendered the judgment upon which this action was founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>To this answer the plaintiffs interposed a general demurrer which was overruled in the court of common pleas. The plaintiffs then filed a reply admitting that when Albright signed the note he was a resident of Ohio and denying all other allegations of the answer. A trial was had and the jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs. With their general verdict they returned special findings supporting the allegations of the answer respecting the relations of the parties to the note, all being facts existing at the time of the bringing of the suit in Hancock county, Indiana. On these special findings the common pleas court rendered judgment in favor of Albright notwithstanding the general verdict. On petition in error the circuit court reversed the judgment of the court of common pleas for error in overruling the demurrer to the answer and rendered judgment on the general verdict in favor of the original plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-6\"><em>Mr. Kirk Hoffman </em>and <em>Mr. D.

But, we answer, that there can be no <em>res adjudicata, </em>if that court was without jurisdiction of the person of the plaintiff in error. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>62 Ohio St., 67; <em>Hixson </em>v. <em>Ogg, </em>53 Ohio St., 361; <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Clannahan, </em>53 Ohio St., 403; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Stanbery, </em>13 Ohio, 421; <em>Snell </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>60 Ohio St., 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">In such cases, even where the court has acquired jurisdiction of the parties, ruling upon motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>interlocutory orders is not <em>res adjudicata. </em>In other words, as a general rule the doctrine of <em>res adjudicata </em>does not apply to interlocutory orders in the same case, and need not be adhered to. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>59 Kans., 357; <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Sergeant, </em>24 Kans., 574; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>24 Kans., 442; <em>Castle </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>113 Wis., 346; <em>Benz </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>3 Kans., 390; 3 Bates Pl. &amp; Pr., 2633; <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Ins.

Therefore, it could not be again tried by another tribunal between the same parties. 1 Van Fleet\u2019s Former Adjudications, 2; <em>Capwell </em>v. <em>Sipe, </em>51 Fed. Rep., 667, 59 Fed.

Art. 4, Sec. 1, U. S. Const.; U. S. Compiled Statutes, 1901, 677, Sec. 905; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Ferry Co., </em>119 U.

This decision made the service good, and Albright was in Hancock circuit court by virtue of the service itself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-7\">Shauck, J.</author>\n<p id=\"An\">The record does not permit the proposition that the judgment of the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of Hancock county was rendered against Albright without service of summons upon him. It distinctly appears that a summons was issued and a return of personal service thereof was made and this return was in accordance with the fact. Since the answer admits the personal service of summons in the action, the only proposition which the defendant in error can make in opposition to the jurisdiction of the court in Indiana is that in order to get opportunity for personal service his adversaries had decoyed him into that state by false representations and had thus abused the process of the court. The determination of that question was peculiarly for the court whose process was alleged to have been abused. He invoked its authority by a motion to quash the writ and set aside the return. Its decision was adverse to him and as he did not resort to a superior court of Indiana, or resorted unavailingly, for a reversal of its judgment he cannot be permitted to litigate that question again in this state. This conclusion is well sustained by the cases cited in the briefs and with respect to it the courts below appear to have been in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">But the judge of the court of common pleas was of the opinion that although in the circumstances appearing the defendant could not be permitted to again contest the jurisdiction of the Indiana court over his person the demurrer to his answer should be overruled to the end that he might assert in the courts of this state rights which he alleged against other parties to the note on which suit was brought in the court of Indiana, although they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>are not parties here. What rights he thought it permissible to assert here appear from the special findings of the jury in consideration of which he rendered judgment in favor of the defendant notwithstanding the general verdict against him. Respecting the special findings it is to be observed that they all relate to rights of Albright against persons who were parties to the suit in Indiana although not parties here; that they are rights arising out of the relations of parties to the note which was the foundation of the suit in the circuit court of Indiana, and that they concern facts which were existent when the suit was brought and passed to judgment in that state. Discriminating attention to these suggestions will readily exclude from controlling consideration here most of the legal propositions which are urged and the cases which are cited by counsel for the plaintiff in error. In view of the numerous decisions of the state and federal courts upon the subject of <em>res adjudicata </em>and the credit which the federal constitution requires to be given to the judgments of other states, original discussion of the subject is not needed and perhaps would not be interesting. In <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>6 Ohio, 43, in accordance with both earlier and' later decisions of this court, it was said as the basis of decision: \u201cThe rule is inflexible in this country. In an action upon the transcript of a judgment, in a sister state, nothing can be pleaded or proved, that could have been pleaded and proved in the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>action, whether it was so pleaded and proved or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The common pleas court erred in overruling the demurrer to the answer and in rendering judgment in favor of the original defendant notwithstanding the verdict against him, and the circuit court properly rendered judgment on the general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-8\">Spear, C.
