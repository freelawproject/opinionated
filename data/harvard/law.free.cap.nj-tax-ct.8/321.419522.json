The first activity, held taxable pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3(a), involved printing materials in New Jersey for out-of-state customers, putting them in envelopes, addressing them as requested by the customers, and mailing them at a U.S. Post Office in New Jersey for delivery to addresses outside New Jersey. The second activity, held taxable pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3(b)(5), involved purchasing of advertising materials by plaintiff instead of printing them and then handling same as in the case of the printed materials. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>completely satisfied with the determination of the Tax Court and therefore affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Richard M. Conley in his opinion, reported at 7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>23 (Tax Ct.1984). We add simply that although there can be no equitable estoppel against defendant under the facts of this case (see <em>Airwork Ser. Div., etc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>290, 478 <em>A.</em>2d 729 (1984)), we are in full agreement with Judge Conley\u2019s further determination (from which defendant has not cross-appealed) to vacate the previously imposed penalty and reduce interest to the minimum statutory rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
