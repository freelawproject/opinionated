Wall Tp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>265, 280, 491 A.2d 1247 (1985), Judge Rimm concluded that he did not have sufficient evidence to find a different valuation from the assessments under appeal. 7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 134. He noted that plaintiffs should have presented \u201cevidence to the court of the value of the buildings if substantially rehabilitated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>cost of rehabilitation to be deducted from such value in arriving at the fair market value of the properties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133. The Tax Court <em>may </em>determine an independent value, <em>Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 416, 495 A.2d 1308 (1985), but \u201c[t]his does not mean that the court must make an independent finding of value based only on evidence that is brought before it without regard to the presumptive validity of the assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. Only if the Tax Court finds that \u201can assessment [is] totally unrelated to true value or one derived from a patently arbitrary and capricious assessment methodology, does it become necessary for the court independently to determine true value.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
