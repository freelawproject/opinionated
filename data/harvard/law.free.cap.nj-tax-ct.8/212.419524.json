We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Judge Rimm dismissed these appeals because of the failure of plaintiffs to comply with the rules of the Tax Court and the pretrial order concerning the exchange of appraisals as well as for their being unprepared to proceed on a postponed trial date. Plaintiffs do not deny these derelictions. As a matter of fact, their brief concedes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">the Court warned plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of possible dismissal around February 28, 1984 and then dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaints five weeks later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Indeed, they also concede that \u201cthere had been some warning signals before February 28, 1984,\u201d but insist that \u201cthe point is that no intermediate steps between warning and termination were taken by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 only argument, expressed in two points, is that the sanction of dismissal was inappropriately harsh and that the court \u201ccould have and should have imposed a lesser sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The right of the Tax Court judge, in the exercise of sound discretion, to dismiss a tax appeal because of procedural infirmities is undeniable and is not denied. Our careful review of the whole record, including the affidavit of Robert Jacobs, president and general partner of plaintiffs (which acknowledges that his counsel had \u201cadvised me in very strong terms of Your Honor\u2019s desire to dispose of these matters either by trial or settlement\u201d), satisfies us not only that there was no mistaken exercise of this discretion in the sanction imposed but that dismissal was quite appropriate in all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
