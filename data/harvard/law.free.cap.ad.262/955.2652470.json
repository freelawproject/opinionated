All concur, except Harris, J., who dissents and votes for affirmance of the order on the ground that in using the words \u201c when a vacancy shall occur otherwise than by expiration of term,\u201d the Legislature meant that the vacancy which is to be filled by election as provided by section 7 of Oswego City Court Act [Laws of 1933, chap. 747] is a vacancy consisting of the unexpired portion of the term of four years. (The order directs the Oswego city clerk to file with the Oswego county board of elections a certificate certifying that the office of city judge of Oswego should be voted for at the November 4, 1941, general election in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.)
