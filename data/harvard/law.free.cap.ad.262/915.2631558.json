The controlling question is whether the notice of claim was verified in accordance with the statute (Highway Law, \u00a7 197). It was sworn to before a notary public but an affidavit of verification was not attached. The Special Term held the notice defective on the authority of <em>Ponsrok </em>v. <em>City of Yonkers </em>(254 N. Y. 91). Order affirmed, with costs. Crapser, Sehenek and Foster, JJ., concur; Hill, P. J., dissents in an opinion; Heffeman, J., dissents and votes to reverse the order and grant the application for the appointment of commissioners. It seems to me that the case upon which the majority relies <em>(Ponsrok </em>v. <em>City of Yonkers, supra), </em>is not in point. In that case it appears that the verification was not signed by the claimant at aE but by FenneE, a notary pubhe. There was no pretense that the claim in that case was sworn to. Here Levine did swear to the claim before a notary public. I think he complied with aE the requirements of the statute and that his claim must be treated as a verified one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
