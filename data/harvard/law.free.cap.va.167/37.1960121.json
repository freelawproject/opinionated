You charged them 40 cents an hour while eating lunch?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Q. When did 40 cents stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">A. After I went out to go to work, after that I didn\u2019t bother, I had been sitting back by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Q. The question of it is, you drew 40 cents an hour for time you went up to Mr. Whitezell\u2019s?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Q. You came back, when would you say that 40 cents an hour stopped?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">A. Well, just as soon as time for it to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">Q. What time was for it to stop, you see thing I am getting at?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">A. At 12:00 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">Q. What time did this accident occur?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-20\">A. Occurred at 12:00 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-21\">Q. Right at 12:00 o\u2019clock?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-22\">A. Yes, sir, right at 12:00 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-23\">The evidence makes it plain that Staats had received no compensation at all for the use of his Ford automobile on the morning of the day of the accident, but that he was paid $2 per hour for the use of his truck in removing the snow from the streets. The truck was driven at the time by one Dimsey. This was after the accident. It further shows that the claimant and Ellis went to claimant\u2019s home for lunch and after having lunch the accident occurred as has been described.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We are in agreement with the town in its asserted position that it was not its duty to put Staats\u2019 truck in condition for its operation; that the terms of hire were by the hour and that the employment began when the truck was in operative condition and on the streets and ready for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We refer to the following authorities as apposite and controlling in the case in judgment. <em>Drefus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 129 S. E. 336; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Binswanger &amp; Co., </em>130 Va. 545, 107 S. E. 649; <em>Kingery </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Ice &amp; Storage Co., </em>160 Va. 290, 168 S. E. 927; <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Corp. </em>v. <em>Absher, </em>153 Va. 332, 149 S. E. 541; <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Moseley Bros., </em>148 Va. 125, 138 S. E. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">It follows from what we have said that we affirm the action and findings of the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
