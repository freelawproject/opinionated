E. 317, 182 S. E. 547), the award then under review was reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings before the commission, to be had in accord with the mandate and the written opinion of the court. The case was heard on December 31, 1935, before Commissioner Nickels, who in a written opinion set forth his finding of fact, and his interpretation of the law, as stated in the opinion of this court. Plaintiff in error made no application to the full commission for a review, but filed his petition in this court for writ of error from that order. Section 61 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (Acts. 1918, chapter 400, section 61, as amended by Acts 1928, chapter 227) provides:' \u201cNo appeal shall be taken from the decision of one commissioner until a review of the case has been had before the full commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The motion to dismiss will have to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
