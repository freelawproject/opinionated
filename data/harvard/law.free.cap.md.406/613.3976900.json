The Circuit Court for Worcester County, entering summary judgment in this litigation against Pines Point Marina, A Condominium Council of Unit Owners, Inc. (\u201cPines Point Marina\u201d), determined that, under <em>Dual Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>383 Md. 151, 857 A.2d 1095 (2004), and <em>Stein v. Smith, </em>358 Md. 670, 751 A.2d 504 (2000), Pines Point Marina lacked standing to bring this suit because its corporate charter was forfeit at the time the action commenced. Thus, summary judgment in favor of defendants Jim Rehak d/b/a Rehak Floating Docks, M.V. of Ocean Pines Limited Partnership, and Topper Industries Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>was appropriate on the ground that the powers of the condominium council of unit owners, as a Maryland corporation, were inoperative, including the power to sue. According to the trial court, Pines Point Marina could not maintain the suit because it did not revive its corporate charter before the applicable three year statute of limitations ran on its claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Pines Point Marina appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. On our motion, we issued a writ of certiorari to the intermediate appellate court before it decided the appeal. For reasons to be explained, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The allegations of material fact are not in dispute. On 20 July 1999, Pines Point Marina incorporated under Maryland corporation law as a non-stock, non-close corporation. The condominium is located in Ocean Pines, Maryland, and consists primarily of four dwelling units, two commercial units, and approximately two hundred-eleven boat slips, most of which are owned as common elements by the participating co-owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Between 1999 and 2005, Pines Point Marina entered into contracts with M.V. Ocean Pines Limited Partnership (\u201cM.V. Ocean Pines\u201d), the developer of the marina, for the installation and acquisition of condominium unit boat slips. M.V. Ocean Pines employed Jim Rehak d/b/a Rehak Floating Docks (\u201cRehak\u201d) as a subcontractor to construct floating docks. M.V. Ocean Pines supervised the construction of the docks by Rehak. The flotation devices used for the floating docks were manufactured and supplied by Topper Industries Incorporated (\u201cTopper\u201d), a corporation engaged in that business. Topper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>supplied the floating docks directly to Rehak, pursuant to a contract between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">During September, October, and November 2003, the eastern coast of the United States experienced several strong storms, including Hurricane/Tropical Storm Isabel. As a result of these storms, Pines Point Marina \u201cbegan to notice [in October 2003] that many of the flotation devices for the floating docks in the Marina had come loose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">On 30 August 2006, Pines Point Marina filed a complaint in the Circuit Court against M.V. Ocean Pines, Rehak, Topper, and the North American Specialty Insurance Company alleging poor workmanship and defective construction of the marina. Discovery responses placed 4 October 2003 as the earliest date of discovery by the plaintiff of the alleged damages giving rise to the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The defendants sought summary judgment on the basis that, on 7 October 2005, the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation forfeited Pines Point Marina\u2019s corporate charter for failure to file required state tax returns. It was not until 4 December 2006 that Pines Point Marina revived its corporate status. The Circuit Court granted Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the ground that Pines Point Marina, as an entity incorporated under Maryland law, failed to bring suit, or amend the complaint, during the time when it was in good corporate standing and before the applicable statute of limitations ran on its claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The grant of summary judgment is proper if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(f). On appellate review of the grant of summary judgment, we review the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law under a non-deferential standard. <em>Messing v. Bank of Am., N. A., </em>373 Md. 672, 684, 821 A.2d 22, 28 (2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>(citations omitted). In considering the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, \u201cwe construe the facts properly before the court, and any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Jurgensen v. New Phoenix Atl. Condo. Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 114, 843 A.2d 865, 869 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">A. Condominium History &amp; Law in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Development of condominiums in Maryland dates back to the adoption of the first Horizontal Property Act in the State in the early 1960s. <em>See </em>Maryland Commission on Condominiums \u2014 Preliminary Report to the 1978 Session 1 (1978) [hereinafter Preliminary Report]. At first, development was slow. Preliminary Report at 1. By the end of the 1960s, however, the State experienced a condominium boom, with intensive development through conversion of existing dwelling units and new construction taking place in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties, Baltimore City and County, Annapolis, Columbia, and Ocean City. Preliminary Report at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">When the general economy slowed in the mid-1970s, an increasing number of condominium projects were handed over to the unit owners, which led to widespread abuse. Preliminary Report at 1. As the Commission Report noted, \u201c[economic difficulties, internal management problems, \u2018sweetheart\u2019 contracts, developer \u2018lowballing\u2019 and failure to complete amenities, and underfinancing brought many developments to the brink of failure or into bankruptcy.\u201d Preliminary Report at 1. The harsh slowdown in the economy forced out most marginal developers, and also \u201cexacerbated difficulties in solid, well-planned developments by slowing the pace of sales and creating cash-flow difficulties.\u201d Preliminary Report at 1. Further, in developments where condominiums were sold successfully, a parallel slowdown in resales was experienced. Preliminary Report at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The economic instability of the late 1960s and early 1970s, combined with the boom in condominium development, exposed a myriad of flaws in the first Horizontal Property Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Thus, the General Assembly decided in 1974 to replace it with the Maryland Condominium Act. Preliminary Report at 1. That Act put in place much of the language and structure of the current Maryland Condominium Act, Md.Code, Real Property \u00a7 \u00a7 11-101 to -143 (2003 &amp; Supp.2008), including the section at the core of the issue in the present case, Md.Code, Real Property \u00a7 11-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">B. Section 11-109</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Section 11-109(a) of the Real Property Article provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he affairs of the condominium shall be governed by a council of unit owners which, even if unincorporated, is constituted a legal entity for all purposes.\u201d Additionally, \u00a7 11\u2014109(d) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">[t]he council of unit owners may be either incorporated as a nonstock corporation or unincorporated and it is subject to those provisions of Title 5, Subtitle 2 of the Corporations and Associations Article which are not inconsistent with this title. The council of unit owners has, subject to any provision of this title, and except as provided in paragraph (22) of this subsection, the declaration, and bylaws, the following powers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">(1) To have perpetual existence, subject to the right of the unit owners to terminate the condominium regime as provided in' \u00a7 11-123 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">(4) To sue and be sued, complain and defend, or intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings in its own name on behalf of itself or two or more unit owners on matters affecting the condominium;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">(21) Generally, to exercise the powers set forth in this title and the declaration or bylaws and to do every other act not inconsistent with law, which may be appropriate to promote and attain the purposes set forth in this title, the declaration, or bylaws[.] ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Pines Point Marina contends that Real Property \u00a7 11-109, in essence, creates a \u201cdormant-entity\u201d status for incorporated condominium councils of unit owners. It acknowledges that, under Maryland general corporation law, once a corporation forfeits its corporate charter, the corporation as such ceases to have a legal existence and thus loses the ordinary legal privileges afforded under the law to a corporation, including the right to bring suit. <em>See Dual Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>383 Md. 151, 857 A.2d 1095 (2004); <em>Stein v. Smith, </em>358 Md. 670, 751 A.2d 504 (2000). A council of unit owners, however, is to be distinguished from any other entity incorporated under Maryland law, Pines Point posits, because councils of unit owners derive their fundamental legal existence and associated powers/rights not from the act of incorporating as such, but from \u00a7 11-109, which provides that a council of unit owners, whether incorporated or not, \u201cis constituted a legal entity for all purposes.\u201d Md.Code, Real Property \u00a7 11-109(a). Thus, Appellant argues that, even upon its loss of corporate status and unlike any other type of entity so situated, it became by default an unincorporated association under \u00a7 11-109 with the right to sue and be sued, apparently without further ado.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Topper, Rehak, and M.V. Ocean Pines take the position that the proper result in this case is governed by <em>Dual Inc., </em>383 Md. 151, 857 A.2d 1095, and <em>Stein v. Smith, </em>358 Md. 670, 751 A.2d 504. In <em>Dual Inc., </em>we held that a corporation, the charter for which became forfeit, was a legal non-entity; thus, \u201call powers granted to [the corporation] by law, including the power to sue or be sued, [are] extinguished generally as of and during the forfeiture period.\u201d <em>Dual Inc., </em>383 Md. at 163, 857 A.2d at 1101 (citing Md.Code, Corporations &amp; Associations \u00a7\u00a7 2-103(2), 3-503(d) (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.)). The corporation in <em>Dual Inc. </em>brought suit against Lockheed in 2001 during a period in which Dual\u2019s corporate charter was forfeit. <em>Dual Inc., </em>383 Md. at 166, 857 A.2d at 1103. Dual, with assistance of counsel, revived its charter and amended its complaint in 2002, modifying some of the previously pleaded counts and adding additional counts, and sought to relate the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>complaint back to the original complaint because the statute of limitations period otherwise would have expired before the filing of the amended complaint. <em>Dual Inc., </em>383 Md. at 157, 166, 857 A.2d at 1098, 1103. We held that, because the corporation lost its legal privilege to bring suit upon the forfeiture of its charter, the initial complaint filed in 2001 was a nullity, such that there was nothing to which the 2002 amended complaint could relate back and, therefore, the statute of limitations ran on the claim before the corporation revived its charter in 2002 and filed the amended complaint. <em>Dual Inc., </em>383 Md. at 166, 857 A.2d at 1103 (citations omitted). In <em>Stein, </em>we held that \u201cthe statute of limitations is not tolled by the filing of an action in the name of a corporation whose charter had been forfeited and never revived. . . .\u201d <em>Stein, </em>358 Md. at 671, 751 A.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Relying on <em>Dual Inc. </em>and <em>Stein, </em>Topper, Rehak, and M.V. Ocean Pines argue that Pines Point Marina\u2019s claim is barred in the present case because the council of unit owners, purporting to act as a corporation, filed the complaint in this litigation at a time when its corporate charter was forfeit and, because the complaint therefore was a nullity, suit was not brought properly within three years of when the council of unit owners knew or reasonably should have known of its claims against the defendants. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 5-101 (2006 Repl.Vol. <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008) (\u201cA civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.\u201d); Poffe<em>nberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 636, 431 A.2d 677, 680 (1981) (holding that the discovery rule is applicable generally in all actions and the \u201ccause of action accrues when the claimant in fact knew or reasonably should have known of the wrong\u201d). Appellees, in their briefs, assert that, \u00a7 11-109 notwithstanding, by having chosen to incorporate the council of unit owners, Pines Point Marina elected to be subject to the same regulations, conditions, and penalties imposed on any non-stock corporation under Maryland law. In rejecting the \u201cdormant-entity\u201d interpretation, Appellees interpret the \u201cor\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>in \u00a7 11-109(d)\u2019s \u201ceither incorporated as a nonstock corporation or unincorporated\u201d as a categorical elective choice that a council of unit owners may have only one legal existence\u2014 incorporated or unincorporated \u2014 with attendant consequences for failure to maintain properly either status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Appellees argue that because Pines Point Marina chose to incorporate, the council became subject to Maryland general corporation law such that, as interpreted and applied in <em>Dual Inc. </em>and <em>Stein, </em>the failure to maintain corporate status during the time leading up to and at which it filed the complaint means the action in the present case was a nullity and is now barred under Maryland\u2019s three year statute of limitations. Md.Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 5-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Appellee Topper highlights the opening sentence of \u00a7 11-109(d), which, cross-referencing the Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations Article of the Maryland Code, provides that the \u201ccouncil of unit owners may be either incorporated as a nonstock corporation or unincorporated and it is subject to those provisions of Title 5, Subtitle 2 of the Corporations and Associations Article which are not inconsistent with this title.\u201d Md. Code, Real Property \u00a7 11-109(d). Topper asserts that, under the applicable provisions of the Corporations &amp; Associations Article, Pines Point Marina, as a non-stock corporation, is subject to the same repercussions suffered by any corporation that fails to comply with statutory filing requirements, including losing the power to bring and maintain suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">C. Corporations and Associations Article</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Title 5, Subtitle 2 of the Corporations &amp; Associations Article deals specifically with nonstock corporations. Section 5-201 provides that the \u201cprovisions of the Maryland General Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ration Law apply to nonstock corporations unless: (1) [t]he context of the provisions clearly requires otherwise; or (2) [sjpecific provisions of this subtitle or other subtitles governing specific classes of corporations provide otherwise.\u201d Md. Code, Corporations &amp; Associations \u00a7 5-201 (2007 Repl.Vol. <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008). Section 5-208(a) provides, in part, that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this section, the dissolution or forfeiture of the charter of a nonstock corporation shall be effected as provided in Title 3 of this article.\u201d Md.Code, Corporations &amp; Associations \u00a7 5-208(a). Section 3-503 of Title 3 deals with \u201c[fjorfeiture of charter for nonpayment of taxes or failure to file report.\u201d Md.Code, Corporations &amp; Associations \u00a7 3-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Section 3-503 provides for three certifications of all Maryland corporations to be made each year by the State Comptroller, the Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, and the Department of Assessments and Taxation. These three entities, respectively, are responsible for certifying which Maryland corporations have failed to pay a tax, failed to pay an unemployment insurance contribution, or failed to file an annual report within the time due. Section 3-503 provides, once the lists are certified, as the penalty for non-compliance</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnL\">the Department [of Assessments and Taxation] shall issue a proclamation declaring that the charters of the corporations are repealed, annulled, and forfeited, and the powers conferred by law on the corporations are inoperative, null, and void as of the date of the proclamation, without proceedings of any kind either at law or in equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Md.Code, Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations \u00a7 3-503(d). Thus, as Topper\u2019s argument goes: (1) Real Property \u00a7 ll-109(d) invokes Title 5, Subtitle 2 of the Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations Article, (2) which, in \u00a7 5-208(a), in turn invokes \u00a7 3\u2014503(d)(3) which, when applied to the present case, mandates the forfeiture of Pines Point Marina\u2019s corporate status and therefore its ability to sue as a corporation. There are, however, a number of ambiguities and inconsistencies between the provisions of the Maryland Condominium Act and these provisions of the Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations Article that diminish the persuasive force of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Some of the ambiguities and inconsistencies that arise in interpreting the language of Real Property \u00a7 11-109 and the embedded, cross-referenced provisions of the Corporations &amp; Associations Article and militate against embracing Topper\u2019s argument are:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">(1) Section 11-109(a) provides that the council of unit owners \u201ceven if unincorporated, is constituted a legal entity for all purposes.\u201d Md.Code, Real Property \u00a7 ll-109(a). We are unable to find any indication whether the phrase \u201ceven if unincorporated\u201d is intended to apply only to councils of unit owners that never incorporated, or to apply as well to those that incorporated, but forfeited that status. Further, there is no indication of how \u201cis constituted a legal entity for all purposes\u201d is to operate with respect to \u00a7 3-503(d) of the Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations Article\u2019s entity forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">(2) Section 11 \u2014 109(d) provides that the council of unit owners \u201cmay be either incorporated as a nonstock corporation or unincorporated.\u201d There is no indication whether the \u201cmay be either\u201d language is intended to mandate a choice between mutually exclusive entities or merely reiterates \u00a7 ll-109(a)\u2019s premise that the council continues to exist whether incorporated or unincorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">(3) Section ll-109(d) provides that the council of unit owners \u201cis subject to those provisions of Title 5, Subtitle 2 of the Corporations and Associations Article which are not inconsistent with this title.\u201d Section 3-503(d) of the Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations Article, which is made applicable through \u00a7 5-208, provides that after the lists of non-complying corporations are certified, the Department is to forfeit the \u201ccharters of the corporations\u201d and, consequently, the powers conferred by law \u201con the corporations\u201d are null and void, including the ability to bring suit \u201cat law or in equity.\u201d This consequence seems at odds with Real Property \u00a7 11-109. In two different subsections, \u00a7 11-109 provides that the council of unit owners is constituted a legal entity whether incorporated or unincorporated.

Examination of Secondary Sources</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">1. Report &amp; Recommendation of the Real Property, Planning &amp; Zoning Section of the Maryland State Bar Association</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In 1973-74, the Condominium Revision Committee of the Real Property, Planning &amp; Zoning Section of the Maryland State Bar Association produced a recommendation that became the Maryland Condominium Act as adopted by the General Assembly in 1974. In an accompanying Report, the Committee included a \u201cCommittee Comments by Section\u201d addendum. The comment on the Committee\u2019s draft of the then \u00a7 11-109<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Section 11-109 clarifies and enlarges the powers of the Council of Unit Owners. The Council may be incorporated or unincorporated and the Council shall, in any event, \u201cbe a legal entity for all purposes\u201d thereby eliminating the question of whether or not the Council has standing to sue and be sued. Although previous versions of this Title are silent on the subject of the authority of the Council to incorporate, they did not prohibit incorporation, and Section 11-109 should not be construed to question or adversely characterize the validity of Councils of Unit Owners incorporated prior to the effective date of this Section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Condominium Revision Committee of the Real Property, Planning &amp; Zoning Section of the Maryland State Bar Association, Committee Report at 6 (1974). An analysis of the 1974 Act, written a few years later, similarly opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">In addition to permitting the Council to be incorporated as a membership (\u201cnonstock\u201d) corporation, this Section states that even if the Council is not incorporated, it is subject to certain statutes that regulate such corporations. These statutes will be meaningful only in unusual circumstances and then only to the extent that they are \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d the condominium law. Because the corporation statute regulating membership corporations, Section 5-201, et seq., of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, states that the general corporation law of Maryland applies to membership corporations, the Condominium law, in effect, makes all condominiums subject to the statutes that concern general business corporations, including large, publicly-held ones, unless such law is inconsistent with the Condominium Law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Whether this result is appropriate \u2014 or wise \u2014 remains to be seen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">Under the \u201cold\u201d Condominium Law only a Council that was incorporated was subject to the statutes regulating corporations. Because there has been no significant litigation or experience, it is still uncertain whether the application of these provisions to condominium affairs will cause any serious problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Robert B.

Uniform Condominium Act</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In August 1977, the National Conference of Commissioners on State Laws approved the Uniform Condominium Act (\u201cUCA\u201d). Stephen B. Cohen et al., <em>Condominium Law: A Comparison of the Uniform Act With the Illinois Act, </em>14 J. Marshall L.Rev. 387, 387 (1981). The Uniform Condominium Act was an attempt by the National Conference to bring state condominium laws up-to-date with the state of affairs spawned by the burgeoning development of condominiums throughout the country. In February 1978, the American Bar Association endorsed the Act, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">A major accomplishment of the UCA will be to relieve condominium development from outmoded constraints imposed by the common law of real property, and from unintended constraints imposed by inartful first generation condominium legislation. These constraints have, without logical basis, interfered with the flexibility needed by developers to phase their projects, and even interfere with the flexibility needed by unit owners to make desirable arrangements of project areas after expiration of developer control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Cohen et al., 14 J. Marshall L.Rev. at 387-88 (quoting National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, Uniform Law Memo 15 (Winter, 1977)).

The membership of the association at all times shall consist exclusively of all the unit owners or, following termination of the condominium, of all former unit owners entitled to distributions of proceeds under Section 2-118, or their heirs, successors, or assigns. The association shall be organized as a profit or nonprofit corporation [or as an unincorporated association.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Unif. Condo. Act \u00a7 3-101 (1977). The bracketed phrase was explained by the Commissioners in an accompanying comment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">The bracketed language preserves the flexibility existing under the vast majority of present condominium statutes to organize the association as a profit or non-profit corporation or as an unincorporated association. Although at least one state (Georgia) requires the organization of the association in corporate form, it is not desirable to mandate this result in a uniform act. If a state wishes to mandate incorporation, it should delete the bracketed language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Unif. Condo. Act \u00a7 3-101 cmt. 2 (1977). The thrust of \u00a7 3-101 of the Uniform Act seems to be that the unit owners\u2019 association is to be \u201corganized,\u201d or established, as one of the statutorily-appropriate entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Currently, eight states have adopted \u00a7 3-101 of the Uniform Condominium Act, including the bracketed language, in their state condominium acts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another twelve either have adopted \u00a7 3-101 without the bracketed language or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>mandated that the association be incorporated or organized as some similar entity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Twenty states and the District of Columbia, including Maryland, however, have chosen not to adopt the Uniform Act\u2019s dichotomous approach, instead providing in general language that councils of unit owners in condominium associations may function and possess certain powers as incorporated or unincorporated entities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>We find it somewhat instructive that the General Assembly did not follow the \u201cshall be organized\u201d or must-incorporate approaches of the Uniform Condominium Act and twenty states. The enactment of the Maryland Condominium Act in 1974 pre-dated by approximately three years approval of the Uniform Act by the National Conference, but there is some indication that the General Assembly nonetheless considered provisions of the Uniform Condominium Act thereafter. For instance, as enacted by the General Assembly in 1974, \u00a7 11-109(d)(2) of the Maryland Condominium Act stated that the council of unit owners shall have the power \u201c[t]o sue and be sued, complain and defend in any court....\u201d 1974 Md. Laws Ch. 641. That subsection remained unchanged until 1980, when the General Assembly changed the provision to state that the council of unit owners has the power \u201c[t]o sue and be sued, complain and defend, or intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings in its own name on behalf of itself or two or more unit owners on matters affecting the condominium----\u201d 1980 Md. Laws Ch. 681. Three years earlier, in 1977, the Uniform Condominium Act was approved, and its \u00a7 3-102(4) provided that the unit owners\u2019 association may \u201cinstitute, defend, or intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings in its own name on behalf of itself or 2 or more unit owners on matters affecting the condominium____\u201d Unif. Condo. Act \u00a7 3-102 (1977). Thus, it appears that the General Assembly patterned the current version of \u00a7 ll-109(d)(4) on the Uniform Act. <em>See Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of the Gables on Tuckerman Condo., </em>404 Md. 560, 580, 948 A.2d 11, 24 (2008) (\u201cIn 1981, as a result of the criticisms of multistory apartment building conversions, the Commission proposed extensive restructuring and modification of the Condominium Act, which \u2018drew from a number of sources including the Uniform Condominium Act,\u2019 in order to abate concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>regarding apartment-to-condominium conversions and operations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">That the General Assembly, however, has not adopted the \u201cshall be organized\u201d or must-incorporate approach of the Uniform Act is illuminating here because \u00a7 11-109 has been amended nineteen times since its original enactment in 1974. Twenty other states adopted one or the other of those two approaches, including Alabama, whose Legislature explained its adoption of the must-incorporate approach in 1990 in a commentary section to its statutory provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">The requirement that the association be incorporated is a significant departure from prior Alabama law which at section 36-8-9 provides that \u201cthe association may be incorporated or unincorporated.\u201d The drafters of the present act elected to change this practice and follow the example of several other states which require incorporation. There were three reasons for requiring incorporation. First, it is considered desirable to help insulate those unit owners serving as directors from personal liability for the acts of the association. Secondly, the committee determined that it was desirable to provide associations with access to the well-developed body of corporate law existing in the state of Alabama. Finally, incorporation facilitates the dealings between the association and third parties. This is especially important in the instance where the association is to hold title to the common property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Ala.Code \u00a7 35-8A-301 cmt. 2 (2008). That our General Assembly chose not to follow the Uniform Condominium Act\u2019s \u201cshall be organized\u201d language or the must-incorporate approach and the rationales of Alabama and other legislatures supporting such an approach, opting instead for the discretionary choice of incorporating (or not) a council of unit owners, militates against Appellees\u2019 contention that the \u201ceither incorporated as a nonstock corporation or unincorporated\u201d language of \u00a7 ll-109(d) provides for an absolute dichotomy between incorporated \u2014 and therefore subject entirely to Maryland general corporation law, including as interpreted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Dual Inc. </em>and <em>Stein </em>\u2014 and unincorporated councils of unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">3. Functions of Condominium Associations Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We consider also \u00a7 11-109\u2019s language in the context of the presumed general intent to provide for continuity of efficient and effective governance for condominium communities. The most central purpose of such communities, and the purpose no doubt recognized by the General Assembly in enacting Maryland\u2019s Condominium Act, is for the development <em>and governance </em>of communities in which generally unrelated persons share property and interests in such a way as to maximize the value to each. <em>See Anderson, </em>404 Md. at 574, 948 A.2d at 20 (\u201cThe term condominium may be defined generally as a system for providing separate ownership of individual units in multiple-unit developments. In addition to the interest acquired in a particular apartment, each unit owner also is a tenant in common in the underlying fee and in the spaces and building parts used in common by all the unit owners.\u201d (quoting <em>Ridgely Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Smyrnioudis, </em>343 Md. 357, 358-59, 681 A.2d 494, 495 (1996))). As outlined in Rohan and Reskin\u2019s Condominium Law treatise,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Common interest communities, including condominium projects, generally have property and interests shared by a group of unrelated persons. This circumstance demands some form of shared control or management so that shared interests are respected and the property is put to its best use and not left to deteriorate. The association is created to take on this vital task of governing the project for the benefit of all unit owners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">All unit owners in the project comprise the association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">The association\u2019s goals are to protect the property, provide for security and other services, enhance the desirability of living in the project, and maintain the harmony of the project for the economic and personal well-being of the unit owners. With this in mind, the association may be viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>as a microcosmie parallel to a public government. The association is, in essence, a private government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">Private associations often supply various public goods and services, such as garbage disposal, recreational areas, and security services, which are traditionally operated by public government. Associations may be more efficient than government in furnishing these goods and services to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">In order for an association to be effective, individual autonomy must be sacrificed to the association to the extent it is inconsistent with the needs of the project. For these reasons, the condominium statute or condominium instruments, or both, grant certain powers to the association. These powers, which are often exercised through the board, may include the power to levy and collect assessments, employ personnel, obtain insurance, own units, have access to units, dedicate common elements to a public body, grant easements and adopt rules and regulations covering the details of operation and use of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">Unit owners often engage in certain acts that violate the order and design of a condominium project. An association may encounter unit owners who remodel their balconies without permission, play excessively loud music or keep prohibited pets. The condominium instruments, including the bylaws and rules and regulations of the board, usually address these matters. The possibility of infractions by unit owners requires that enforcement provisions be set forth in the condominium instruments. The board must act as the project\u2019s police and judge. The unit owners may also seek to enforce the provisions of the condominium instruments against the association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Patrick J. Rohan &amp; Melvin A. Reskin, Real Estate Transactions: Condominium Law and Practice \u00a7 1.06 (2008) (citations omitted). As Rohan and Reskin aptly note, the condominium association (the council of unit owners) serves as the organizing and governing body at the heart of condominium communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ties. The council is the governing authority charged with ensuring that the community and the individual owners within that community conform to the plans and goals of the condominium instruments and other applicable authority. One of the means that must be available in order for the council of unit owners to exercise its authority, therefore, is the right to sue and be sued on behalf of itself (or two or more unit owners) on matters affecting the condominium. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Real Property \u00a7 11-109(a) (\u201cThe affairs of the condominium shall be governed by a council of unit owners____\u201d). Thus, in light of the general intent of providing for continuity of efficient and effective governance in condominium communities, we are inclined to interpret \u00a7 11-109 as providing for a \u201cdormant-entity\u201d status for ostensibly incorporated councils of unit owners; under this interpretation, we read \u00a7 11-109\u2019s language, stating that a council of unit owners \u201ceven if unincorporated, is constituted a legal entity for all purposes\u201d having the power \u201c[t]o sue and be sued ... in its own name on behalf of itself or two or more unit owners on matters affecting the condominium\u201d, as contemplating that if an incorporated council of unit owners forfeits its corporate charter, it defaults to the status of an unincorporated association, with the right to sue and be sued intact, as provided in \u00a7 11-109(d)(4). Md.Code, Real Property \u00a7 11-109(a), (d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; <em>see also Anderson, </em>404 Md. at 577 n. 14, 948 A.2d at 22 n. 14 (\u201cThe Maryland Condominium Act \u2018not only provides the legislative framework for establishing a condominium regime, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the authority by which a condominium development can maintain and sustain its existence\u2019 and \u2018the scope and duties of condominium development and ownership in Maryland.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Greenbriar Condo., Phase I Council of Unit Owners, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>387 Md. 683, 716-17, 878 A.2d 528, 549 (2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">An issue left looming in this case regards the applicable statute of limitations and Pines Point Marina\u2019s ability to amend its complaint to reflect that it should (and could) have brought the action as an unincorporated association. According to the holding in this case, if an incorporated council of unit owners forfeits its corporate charter, it becomes, by default, an unincorporated association with the power to sue and be sued under Real Property \u00a7 11-109. The underlying cause of action nonetheless remains subject to any applicable statute of limitations, in this case Maryland\u2019s general three year statute of limitations. Md.Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 5-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Pines Point Marina filed its original complaint on 30 August 2006, presumably within three years of learning on or about 4 October 2003 of the loosening of the floating docks. The council, however, filed the complaint under the name \u201cPines Point Marina, A Condominium Council of Unit Owners, Inc.\u201d At all times in the litigation in the Circuit Court, Pines Point Marina pursued the matter as \u201cPines Point Marina, A Condominium Council of Unit Owners, Inc.\u201d, including in an amended complaint filed on 26 October 2007. Also according to the record, there is no indication that the council of unit owners sought, within three years of 4 October 2003, to amend the complaint to sue as an unincorporated association. For that matter, Pines Point Marina did not seek to amend the complaint at any time to sue as an unincorporated association.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Thus, whether Pines Point Marina\u2019s claim may be maintained, it seems, depends on whether it yet may amend its complaint to sue as an unincorporated association, and whether such amendment may be recognized as relating back to the original complaint filed on 30 August 2006. Maryland Rule 2-341 provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">(a) Without Leave of Court. A party may file an amendment to a pleading without leave of court by the date set forth in a scheduling order or, if there is no scheduling order, no later than 30 days before a scheduled trial date. Within 15 days after service of an amendment, any other party to the action may file a motion to strike setting forth reasons why the court should not allow the amendment. If an amendment introduces new facts or varies- the case in a material respect, an adverse party who wishes to contest new facts or allegations shall file a new or additional answer to the amendment within the time remaining to answer the original pleading or within 15 days after service of the amendment, whichever is later. If no new or additional answer is filed within the time allowed, the answer previously filed shall be treated as the answer to the amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">(b) With Leave of Court. A party may file an amendment to a pleading after the dates set forth in section (a) of this Rule only with leave of court. If the amendment introduces new facts or varies the case in a material respect, the new facts or allegations shall be treated as having been denied by the adverse party. The court shall not grant a continuance or mistrial unless the ends of justice so require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">(c) Scope. An amendment may seek to (1) change the nature of the action or defense, (2) set forth a better statement of facts concerning any matter already raised in a pleading, (3) set forth transactions or events that have occurred since the filing of the pleading sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>amended, (4) correct misnomer of a party, (5) correct misjoinder or nonjoinder of a party so long as one of the original plaintiffs and one of the original defendants remain as parties to the action, (6) add a party or parties, (7) make any other appropriate change. Amendments shall be freely allowed when justice so permits. Errors or defects in a pleading not corrected by an amendment shall be disregarded unless they affect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au6\">It appears from the current record that, at the time Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment were granted, Pines Point Marina would not have needed leave of court to amend its complaint. The initial Scheduling Order entered in this case by the Circuit Court stated that \u201c[a]ll motions, including Motions in Limine, and all amendments to pleadings must be filed FORTY FIVE (45) DAYS prior to the Trial Date.\u201d (emphasis in original). The first scheduled trial date was 24 September 2007, which would have required any amended complaint to be filed, under Md. Rule 1-203, no later than 10 August 2007. The trial date was rescheduled to 22 January 2008, which then would have required an amended complaint to be filed by 7 December 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On 26 October 2007, Pines Point Marina filed an amended complaint to add a negligence claim against Rehak and eliminate North American Specialty Insurance Company as a defendant. During the 29 October 2007 summary judgment motions hearing, the Circuit Court acknowledged Pines Point Marina\u2019s right to file the amended complaint as within the prescribed time limitations of the Scheduling Order and the Rules. At the conclusion of the 29 October hearing, however, the Circuit Court stated that it was granting Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the ground that Pines Point Marina was barred from bringing the action by the applicable statute of limitations because, as a corporation, it failed to revive its corporate standing before the limitation period ran on or about 4 October 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Accepting, for present purposes, the material facts as alleged or revealed through discovery, the applicable stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ute of limitations expired on Pines Point Marina\u2019s claims on or about 4 October 2006. Therefore, an amendment to the complaint subsequent to that date seeking to sue as an unincorporated association would have to relate back, under Maryland case law, to the original complaint filed on 30 August 2006 in order to be viable on its face.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is well-settled under Maryland law that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9G\">institution of a suit arrests the running of the statute of limitations, and the general rule is that, where the period of limitations has not elapsed before the suit was brought, a mere amendment of the declaration, <em>when the cause of action remains the same, </em>will not warrant the filing of a plea of limitations, even though the statutory period has intervened between the time when the cause of action accrued and the date of making the amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>State ex rel.

Amendment to sue as an unincorporated association and the potential for that to relate back to the original complaint was not addressed in the trial court at the time summary judgment was entered in favor of Appellees.

See Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 58-3127 (West 2008) (does not provide for possible entities for unit owners\u2019 association but does provide for right to bring cause of action on behalf of two or more owners on matters affecting common areas); Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 89-9-1 to -37 (West 2008) (does not specify entities); Vt.

Providing for continuity in efficient and effective governance is important because it is vital for the unincorporated council of unit owners to retain its ability to sue in the cases such as the present one where it might prove too costly for as little as 2 individual unit owners to assume, in their individual capacities, litigation bills for matters affecting common areas. Further, the individual unit owners, as the only other persons with arguable standing to bring suit, nevertheless might be found to lack standing to bring suit on matters affecting only common areas. <em>See Kerusa Co. LLC v. W10Z/515 Real Estate Ltd. P'ship, 50 </em>A.D.3d 503, 858 N.Y.S.2d 109, 110 (2008) (\"Plaintiff has standing to seek relief for damage and defects to its own units only and not for injury to the common elements of the subject building ....\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">. Pinos Point Marina points to the fact that, in both its original and amended complaints, it alternatively pleaded that it sued \"on behalf of [the] unit owners\u201d of the condominium. It attached as an exhibit a list of all persons owning units and undivided percentage interests in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>common elements. This notwithstanding, the caption of the case emphasized the name and address of the corporation as the plaintiff and the suit clearly was mounted by the corporation, even in its representative capacity for the unit and boat slip owners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">. With specific regard to the 26 October 2007 amended complaint, it appears that the amended complaint was a nullity because of the circumstances under which it was filed. In the original complaint, Pines Point Marina held itself out as bringing suit as a corporation in good standing. At the time, its corporate charter was forfeit. In the 26 October 2007 amended complaint, Pines Point Marina reasserted its position as a corporation in good standing, after its charter was revived, but also after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. These occurrences are indistinguishable factually from this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Dual Inc., </em>383 Md. 151, 857 A.2d 1095, and <em>Stein, </em>358 Md. 670, 751 A.2d 504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">. \"The determination to allow amendments to pleadings or to grant leave to amend pleadings is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Schmerling v.
