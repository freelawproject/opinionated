We agree with petitioner that the court erred by permitting the challenged cross-examination. Moreover, we reject the State\u2019s contention that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In May 2006, petitioner was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County, for the 2004 murder of 22-year-old Tyshika Askins. Petitioner knew Ms. Askins through his girlfriend, Lisa Pinder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State\u2019s theory of the case was that petitioner went to Ms. Askins\u2019s apartment sometime during the night of June 6 or early morning hours of June 7, 2004, and killed her during a quarrel about the whereabouts of Ms. Pinder. The State offered considerable evidence in support of that theory. Petitioner, in turn, testified that he was elsewhere when Ms. Askins was killed and had nothing to do with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Teresa Warner Slacum was Ms. Askins\u2019s neighbor. Around 1 p.m. on June 7, 2004, she saw Alonza Dennis, the father of Ms. Askins\u2019s baby, in the hallway of the apartment building. He was \u201chollering, oh no, oh no.\u201d Ms. Slacum entered Ms. Askins\u2019s apartment and discovered the body of Ms. Askins on the bedroom floor with a pillow over her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The police and a forensic investigator responded to the scene. Forensic evidence disclosed that Ms. Askins died about 4:00 a.m. on June 7. The bedroom showed signs of a struggle; an orange juice container, but no drinking glass, was on the kitchen counter; and the cap of the container was on the floor. Latent fingerprints were lifted from the orange juice container.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Danielle Gaines, a longtime friend of Ms. Askins, testified that Ms. Askins was a neat person who would not be inclined to drink orange juice from the container, or let anyone else do so. Ms. Gaines also testified in the State\u2019s rebuttal case that she knew Ms. Askins\u2019s boyfriend, who is not petitioner. Further, she had no knowledge that Ms. Askins ever had a romantic relationship with petitioner. Ms. Gaines last saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Ms. Askins at the latter\u2019s apartment on the evening of June 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Ms. Askins testified that she sustained injuries to her head, neck, and torso, and the cause of death was \u201cstrangulation and blunt force injuries.\u201d There was evidence that she had fought her aggressor. There was no evidence of recent sexual relations or the consumption of drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Police focused their investigation on petitioner once they learned his fingerprints had been left on the orange juice container in Ms. Askins\u2019s apartment, and Ms. Pinder was a friend of Ms. Askins. Petitioner agreed to go to the police station to discuss the case. There, Detective Chris Flynn read petitioner his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Petitioner agreed to be interviewed. He told the detective he believed Ms. Askins was a friend of Ms. Pinder, and he knew generally where Ms. Askins lived but had never gone to her apartment. He then made a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Following that, Detective Flynn presented petitioner with a search warrant to obtain buccal skin cell and hair samples, for DNA testing. Petitioner initially refused and demanded to speak with an attorney. Petitioner spoke with an attorney, then agreed to a buccal swab. Petitioner\u2019s DNA matched DNA found under Ms. Askins\u2019s fingernails and on her T-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Petitioner\u2019s father testified as a State\u2019s witness that petitioner came to live with him around the middle of June 2004. He explained that petitioner called him on June 7, 2004, (the day of the murder) and asked to stay with him at his home in New Jersey for awhile, because petitioner was having problems with his girlfriend. According to petitioner\u2019s father, petitioner arrived at his home with a car full of clothing on June 14, 2004 and stayed until Labor Day. Petitioner\u2019s father denied telling police that petitioner had said he wanted to stay until \u201cthings settled down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Petitioner testified in his defense. He suspected in April 2004 that Ms. Pinder was having an affair. He learned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>identity of her paramour from Ms. Askins, whom he met during the winter of 2003 at a party given by Ms. Pinder. Petitioner testified that he and Ms. Askins began a romantic relationship in April 2004, and they engaged in sexual intercourse at her apartment on several occasions during April and May of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Petitioner acknowledged that he was with Ms. Askins in her apartment between 9:40 and 10:00 p.m. on June 6, 2004. At that time, they engaged in oral sex but not intercourse, and he touched Ms. Askins\u2019s neck, breasts, stomach, and back during the encounter. Afterwards, petitioner asked for a glass of juice. Ms. Askins retrieved the orange juice container from the refrigerator, and he poured himself a glass. Petitioner took the glass with him when he left the apartment because he was in a hurry to see the first game of the NBA finals. He went to a friend\u2019s house and stayed there until 7:30 the following morning. Petitioner testified that Ms. Askins left the apartment when he did, and he saw her walk in the direction of her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Petitioner denied telephoning his father or driving to his father\u2019s home in New Jersey on June 7. He testified that he went to his father\u2019s home either on June 14 or June 20 to give Ms. Pinder \u201csome space.\u201d He returned home after \u201cfive months\u201d because he missed his children and wanted to work things out with Ms. Pinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Petitioner acknowledged near the end of his direct examination that he did not reveal in his statement to police that he had been in Ms. Askins\u2019s apartment on the evening of June 6. He further acknowledged that he had not told the police about having an affair with Ms. Askins. He explained that he did not want to reveal the affair because he did not want Ms. Pinder to learn about it. Defense counsel then asked: \u201cHad you revealed the affair to anyone at this point?\u201d Petitioner replied: \u201cJust my father.\u201d Petitioner concluded his direct testimony by denying that he killed Ms. Askins or had any reason to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>At the outset of cross-examination, the prosecutor, over objection of defense counsel, probed whether and when petitioner had discussed his testimony with defense counsel. The transcript discloses the following exchange between the two, interrupted midway through by a bench conference at which the propriety of the cross-examination was discussed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">[Prosecutor]: You and your attorney have talked about your testimony here previously, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">[Petitioner]: Only for a brief moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">[Prosecutor]: Only for a brief moment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">[Petitioner]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">[Prosecutor]: Did your attorney go over with you what you were going to testify to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">[The Court]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">[Petitioner]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">[Prosecutor]: He never went over it with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">[Petitioner]: No, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">[Prosecutor]: Never went over what areas he might be asking you questions about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-15\">[Petitioner]: Repeat it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-16\">[Prosecutor]: Your attorney never went over with you the areas that he was going to question you about, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adq\">[Petitioner]: No, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-17\">[Prosecutor]: Never. So you never talked to him about any of these details until today, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-18\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-19\">[The Court]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-20\">At that time, defense counsel asked to approach the bench and the following exchange occurred among counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcD\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I think one question generally is appropriate, the more we get into this you\u2019re getting into privileged communications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-21\">[The Court]: Well, her second question was a legitimate followup. He says he never talked to you about that so it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>would be a logical question to ask was this the first time you ever revealed it to your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">[Defense Counsel]: So I\u2019m going to get to be a witness then to say whether he did or didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">[Prosecutor]: You\u2019re the one who put him on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avv\">[Defense Counsel]: Do I get to be called as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoH\">[Prosecutor]: Now you\u2019re going to impeach your own client with your own testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">[Defense Counsel]: No, but the further we go down the road, Your Honor, the more likely\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">[The Court]: You\u2019re not planning on going much\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACV\">[Prosecutor]: This is all I want to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">[Defense Counsel]: More than likely I\u2019m going to be a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">[Prosecutor]: I really don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">[The Court]: Step back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Cross-examination resumed with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. Let me ask you again. So basically today is the first time that you\u2019ve gone into detail or said much about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-14\">[The Court]: It\u2019s noted and overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">[Prosecutor]: \u2014 what you\u2019ve testified to today, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWJ\">[Petitioner]: You mean have I went into detail with my attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-16\">[Prosecutor]: Yes. You just said you only talked to him briefly so today would be the first time you\u2019ve really gone into detail about what happened, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-17\">[Petitioner]: We talked about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-18\">[Prosecutor]: The question was you said you\u2019d only talked to him briefly about what you just said here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWPf\">[Petitioner]: You said did we went (sic) over the testimony, we only went over it briefly last night, like ten minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXQ\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. So this would be the first time you\u2019ve really given him the full story was here today; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">[The Court]: I sustain that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">With that, the prosecutor turned to other lines of cross-examination, including why petitioner had told the police that he did not know where Ms. Askins lived. Petitioner responded that he believed the police were lying to him, so he decided to lie to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The jury convicted petitioner of first-degree murder and first-degree assault. At sentencing, the court merged the assault conviction into the murder conviction and imposed a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and raised a number of claims of error. Only two of those claims concern us here: (1) whether the trial court erred in permitting the State to inquire about privileged communications between petitioner and his counsel; and (2) whether the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the interrogating detective that petitioner had invoked his rights to counsel and to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">With regard to the first claim of error, a panel of the intermediate appellate court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning petitioner\u2019s communications with his attorney did not invade the attorney-client privilege and, even if they did, the cross-examination was at worst harmless error. The panel compared the cross-examination in the present case with the cross-examination of the defendant in <em>Haley v. State, </em>398 Md. 106, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007), in which we held that the cross-examination invaded the attorney-client privilege. The panel evidently treated as preserved for appellate review only the questions to which defense counsel promptly objected. The panel concluded that those questions \u201csimply do not rise to the level of those in <em>Haley\u201d </em>The panel further observed that, \u201cunlike in <em>Haley, </em>the credibility of the witnesses was not the \u2018central issue\u2019 in the case.\u201d The panel decided that, \u201c[e]ven if we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that the preserved questions improperly implicated the attorney-client privilege, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>we would fail to find prejudice; thus, any error would be harmless.\u201d (Internal citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">As for the second claim \u2014 that the trial court erred by allowing the detective to testify that petitioner invoked his right to counsel and to silence \u2014 the panel held that petitioner had \u201cwaived his objection by testifying as to the subject matter without objection, and any error in the initial admission [of the evidence] was rendered harmless.\u201d The panel affirmed the judgment in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Petitioner filed both a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of certiorari and a petition prepared by counsel. The latter petition pres\u00e9nted two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">I. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding no error where the prosecutor was permitted, in the presence of the jury, to question the accused concerning the content and timing of his communications with his attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">II. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding no error in the admission of evidence that Petitioner had invoked his rights to counsel and to remain silent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The State filed a conditional cross-petition asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">Did [petitioner] waive his claim concerning cross-examination as to communications with his attorney by not objecting to each question at trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">We denied the <em>pro se </em>petition and issued a writ of certiorari to address the above three questions. <em>Blanks v. State, </em>404 Md. 658, 948 A.2d 70 (2008). We shall hold that the first of petitioner\u2019s two questions is preserved for our review, and the trial court committed reversible error in permitting the prosecutor to intrude upon matters protected by the attorney-client privilege. Because petitioner is entitled to a new trial as the result of that holding, we do not address the second question he presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We first address the State\u2019s assertion that petitioner has not preserved his challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>examination about the timing and content of his communications with his attorney. The State\u2019s argument has two prongs: first, petitioner put the issue in play by explaining on direct examination why he told \u201cjust his father\u201d that he had an affair with the murder victim and did not reveal the affair to the police; and, second, petitioner did not object when the prosecutor began to question him concerning when and what he had discussed with counsel. Neither prong of the State\u2019s argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">First, petitioner did not open the subject of privileged communications simply by testifying on direct examination that he told \u201cjust his father,\u201d and not the police, about the affair with Ms. Askins. Second, defense counsel, though not objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s first question concerning whether petitioner had talked with his counsel before trial, did object to the next question, \u201cDid your attorney go over with you what you were going to testify to?\u201d The court overruled that objection, and the prosecutor twice repeated what was, essentially, the same question, without objection from counsel. Upon twice receiving the same answer from petitioner, the prosecutor asked: \u201cSo you never talked to him about any of these details until today, right?\u201d Defense counsel promptly objected to that question, and the bench conference followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At the bench, defense counsel made quite clear to the court his belief that the cross-examination breached the attorney-client privilege and was therefore objectionable. The court permitted the examination to resume, evidently assured by the prosecutor that the questioning would not go much further. The prosecutor resumed her questioning by asking: \u201cOkay. Let me ask you again. So basically today is the first time that you\u2019ve gone into detail or said much about \u2014 .\u201d Counsel again objected, and the court responded: \u201cIt\u2019s noted and overruled.\u201d Several other questions of the same ilk followed, without objection, until the prosecutor asked: \u201cOkay. So this would be the first time you\u2019ve really given him the full story was here today; is that right?\u201d Defense counsel again objected, and the court sustained the objection, ending the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The purpose of Maryland\u2019s preservation rule, Maryland Rule 8-131(a), is \u201c\u2018(a) to require counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings, and (b) to prevent the trial of cases in a piecemeal fashion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 216-17, 946 A.2d 456, 461 (2008) (quoting <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>384 Md. 484, 505, 864 A.2d 1006, 1018 (2004)). Petitioner satisfied that purpose. He objected to the first question that approached the timing and content of petitioner\u2019s communications with counsel, explained at the bench his concern that the questions invaded the attorney-client privilege, and re-objected when the court permitted the inquiry to resume. Under those circumstances, no further objection was necessary. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 514-15, 601 A.2d 1093, 1094 (1992) (finding the merits of a claim preserved for review on the basis of a single objection to the line of inquiry because counsel\u2019s \u201cobjection went not only to what was said but also to what was obviously to come,\u201d and the court, by overruling the objection, demonstrated that he was permitting the prosecutor to continue along the same line).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The merits of petitioner\u2019s claim are preserved for our consideration. We shall examine the claim by considering the entirety of the State\u2019s inquiry into petitioner\u2019s communications with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The attorney-client privilege is \u201c \u2018the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newman v. State, </em>384 Md. 285, 300-01, 863 A.2d 321, 330 (2004) (quoting <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 682, 66 L.Ed.2d 584, 591 (1981)); <em>see also Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 131-35, 345 A.2d 830, 836-38 (1975) (discussing the development of the rule from its inception in England during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603)). The privilege \u201cis a rule of evidence that forever bars disclosure, without the consent of the client, of all communications that pass in confidence between the client and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>attorney during the course of professional employment or as an incident of professional intercourse between them.\u201d <em>State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 519-20, 398 A.2d 421, 423 (1979). The privilege has been codified in Maryland law. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (providing that \u201c[a] person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The privilege protects \u201cconfidential communications, but not the underlying factual information.\u201d <em>See Haley, </em>398 Md. at 125 n. 10, 919 A.2d at 1211 n. 10. The privilege is recognized as \u201c \u2018an accommodation of competing public interests\u2019 \u201d favoring \u201c \u2018protection from unauthorized disclosure of communications between an attorney and his client over the general testimonial duty and compulsion in the interest of truth and justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 919 A.2d at 1211 (quoting <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 133, 345 A.2d at 837). The privilege, \u201c \u2018basic to a relation of trust and confidence,\u2019 \u201d is not itself grounded in the Constitution; nevertheless, it is \u201c \u2018essentially interrelated with the specific constitutional guaranties of the individual\u2019s right to counsel and immunity from self-incrimination.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.; see also Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 210, 905 A.2d 315, 330 (2006) (concluding that an attorney\u2019s violation of the attorney-client privilege \u201cestablished a violation of [the client\u2019s] right to effective representation under the Sixth Amendment\u201d standard for determining effective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The privilege protects, not merely the contents of communications between a client and counsel, but the fact that communications did or did not take place. <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 152, 345 A.2d at 847. The privilege also protects the timing of such communications. <em>Haley, </em>398 Md. at 125, 919 A.2d at 1210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The privilege is held by the client and in certain circumstances it can be waived. <em>See Smith, 394 </em>Md. at 205-06, 905 A.2d at 327-28; <em>see, e.g., State v. Fair, </em>354 N.C. 131, 557 S.E.2d 500, 525-26 (2001); <em>State v. Baker, </em>302 Mont. 408, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>15 P.3d 379, 383 (2000). It is settled, however, that a defendant\u2019s testifying on his or her own behalf does not waive the privilege, <em>Haley, </em>398 Md. at 128, 919 A.2d at 1212, and a defendant\u2019s merely answering a question on cross-examination that he told his lawyer \u201call about it\u201d does not waive the privilege. <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 147-148, 345 A.2d at 844-845. Petitioner\u2019s unobjected-to response to the prosecutor\u2019s first question on the subject of communications with counsel did not amount to a substantive waiver of the privilege, and the State does not seriously contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We recently analyzed the rule on attorney-client privilege and its application in <em>Haley. </em>Haley was charged with carjacking one Leroy Singer. Mr. Singer testified that he had never met Haley before the incident and identified Haley as the person who had put a knife to his throat and taken his car. 398 Md. at 114-16, 919 A.2d at 1204-06. Haley, in turn, testified that he and Mr. Singer had an ongoing relationship, and Mr. Singer had given him permission to drive his car. Haley sought to establish the existence of that relationship by describing in his direct testimony the outside of Mr. Singer\u2019s house, items inside the house, and the appearance of his dog. To support that testimony, defense counsel asked the court to allow the jury to view either the interior of Mr. Singer\u2019s home or pictures or a videotape of its interior. Counsel explained to the court that he did not make the request sooner because he had just received information from Haley the night before and acted on the information as quickly as possible. <em>Id. </em>at 117-120, 919 A.2d at 1206-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The prosecutor sought to exploit counsel\u2019s disclosure of the recent communication between Haley and defense counsel. Over defense objection, the court permitted the prosecutor to cross-examine Haley about whether and when he discussed with defense counsel his testimony concerning knowledge of Singer\u2019s house. <em>Id. </em>at 122-24, 919 A.2d at 1209-11. We considered Haley\u2019s challenge to the cross-examination against the backdrop of <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. 122, 345 A.2d 830, and other authorities. 398 Md. at 127-28, 919 A.2d at 1212. We held that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s repeated questions as to when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>and what petitioner told his attorney went beyond the scope of proper cross-examination and invaded the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130-31, 919 A.2d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Haley is in material respect identical to the present case and controls our disposition of it. In this case, as in Haley, the prosecutor sought to expose when and what petitioner had discussed with his attorney about his relationship with the murder victim, Ms. Askins. As in Haley, the prosecutor invaded the attorney-client privilege by posing those questions, regardless of the answers petitioner gave. The court therefore erred in permitting the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The State mounts no argument that the cross-examination did not invade the attorney client privilege. The State argues instead that reversal is not warranted because \u201cthe questions [at issue in the present case] were not as direct and prejudicial as those at issue in <em>Haley.\u201d </em>We agree that the questions in the present case were not as pointed as those in <em>Haley; </em>nevertheless, the questions invaded petitioner\u2019s attorney-client privilege. Moreover, insofar as the State suggests that prejudice to the petitioner is a component of the privilege analysis, the State is incorrect. We suspect that the error stems from a misreading of <em>Haley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Our discussion of prejudice in <em>Haley </em>cannot be taken out of context. That discussion followed our conclusion that Haley\u2019s attorney-client privilege was invaded by the prosecutor\u2019s questioning. 398 Md. at 128, 919 A.2d at 1212-13. The discussion arose as we explained why the State\u2019s reliance upon the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Carson, </em>559 Pa. 460, 741 A.2d 686 (1999), was unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Carson involved the defendant\u2019s allegation that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel because counsel did not object when the prosecutor cross-examined him about his pre-trial communications with counsel. 398 Md. at 130, 919 A.2d at 1213. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court was inclined to believe that the defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege was not violated because the prosecutor had not probed the substance of the communications with counsel. That court none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>theless concluded that the defendant was not prejudiced by disclosure of the communications and, consequently, was unable to establish that counsel was ineffective by not objecting to the cross-examination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We stated our disagreement in <em>Haley </em>with the <em>Carson </em>court\u2019s inclination that the attorney-client privilege protects only the content, and not necessarily the timing, of a communication with counsel. We also noted that, unlike in <em>Carson, </em>Haley\u2019s defense counsel had objected to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning. And we noted that Haley, unlike the defendant Carson, was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s invasion of the privilege. In that regard, we noted that credibility was \u201ca central issue\u201d in Haley\u2019s case and the prosecutor\u2019s questioning on the timing of Haley\u2019s disclosure to his counsel undermined his credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31, 919 A.2d 1200, 919 A.2d at 1214. What cannot be overlooked is that the \u201cprejudice\u201d the <em>Carson </em>court was addressing, and to which we responded in <em>Haley, </em>related to the prejudice that any defendant must establish in order to prevail upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 697 (1984). By no means did we hold in <em>Haley </em>that a defendant must establish both error and prejudice when challenging on direct appeal a trial court\u2019s allowing cross-examination that invades the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\"><em>Haley, </em>then, should not be read as dictating that whether a defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege has been violated turns on the extent to which the violation causes prejudice to the defendant at his trial. Rather, the error rests in the violation of the privilege itself. The defendant does not have the burden to establish that the error influenced the verdict; rather, the State, as the \u201cbeneficiary of such error,\u201d must \u201cdemonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the verdict \u2014 and is thus truly \u2018harmless\u2019tJ\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 658, 350 A.2d 665, 677 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The State argues that any error attendant to the violation of petitioner\u2019s privilege is harmless. The standard for harmless error we announced in <em>Dorsey, </em>and have followed ever since, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">[WJhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678; <em>see, e.g., Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 164, 950 A.2d 125, 134 (2008) (applying the <em>Dorsey </em>standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The State has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Certainly, the State presented a strong case against petitioner, including in particular the DNA and fingerprint evidence. Moreover, the State offered evidence countering petitioner\u2019s testimony that he and Ms. Askins had been involved in an affair. The strength of the State\u2019s case, however, made it all the more important to the defense that the jury believe petitioner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Petitioner\u2019s defense was that the father of Ms. Askins\u2019s child had committed the murder. To support that defense and explain the forensic evidence against him, petitioner testified about the affair with Ms. Askins. That testimony provided a reason for his being at the victim\u2019s apartment hours before her murder, and for the presence of his DNA on her body and his fingerprints on the orange juice container. Key to the success of that defense was the credibility of petitioner\u2019s testimony about the affair itself, as well as his testimony concerning why he told only his father of the affair and did not reveal it, or his connection to the victim\u2019s apartment, to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination implied that petitioner had not revealed this crucial information to his lawyer, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>had the obvious purpose of undermining petitioner\u2019s credibility. In the words of petitioner, \u201cthe entire thrust of the cross-examination was that petitioner\u2019s testimony should be disbelieved because if it had been true, it would have been disclosed to counsel.\u201d The prosecutor then exploited the seeming lack of credibility of petitioner\u2019s defense by attacking it as the \u201cI\u2019m her lover defense,\u201d disbelieved even by his lawyer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The State has every right to challenge a criminal defendant\u2019s credibility through vigorous cross-examination. The State has no right, however, to effect that goal through improper means. In this case, the State undermined petitioner\u2019s credibility by the improper means of invading his attorney-client privilege. The court\u2019s error in allowing such cross-examination was not harmless. Consequently, petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED WITH DIRECTION TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR DORCHESTER COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY DORCHESTER COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">MURPHY, J., Concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\">.

I write separately, however, to offer a suggestion that would reduce the chances that a conviction will be reversed on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>examination of the defendant violated the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In <em>Forbes v. State, </em>175 Md.App. <em>630, </em>931 A.2d 528 (2007), the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthe prosecutor should not have been permitted to ask appellant, in effect, whether, during a confidential communication with his lawyer, appellant (1) confessed that he had committed the robbery, and (2) asked his lawyer to call a defense witness who was prepared to present false testimony.\u201d 175 Md.App. at 636, 931 A.2d at 532. Recognizing that the attorney-client privilege does not operate to exclude everything the criminal defendant says to his or her lawyer, the <em>Forbes </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">We therefore hold that <em>Harrison [v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 345 A.2d 830 (1975)] prohibits the prosecutor from cross-examining the defendant about anything that the defendant did\u2014 or did not \u2014 say to his or her lawyer, unless and until (1) the prosecutor has expressly requested the trial judge\u2019s permission to do so, and (2) after inquiring into \u201call the surrounding facts and circumstances,\u201d the trial judge has expressly identified \u201cthe permissible and the prohibited areas of inquiry.\u201d We also hold that, in a jury trial, both the request and inquiry must take place out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJc\">175 Md.App. at 639, 931 A.2d at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">I would require that this procedure be followed in every criminal case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
