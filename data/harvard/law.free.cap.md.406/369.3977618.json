He now argues that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court erroneously failed to conduct a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>trial waiver inquiry required by Md. Rule 4-246(b). The Court of Special Appeals rejected this argument. For the reasons that follow, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Petitioner was arrested by Howard County police officers about 3:00 p.m. on July 24, 2005. Later that day he was served with a District Court STATEMENT OF CHARGES that formally charged him with two violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act and eight violations of \u00a7 8-601 of the Criminal Law Article. A defendant charged with any of these offenses has a right to be tried in the District Court, as well as a right to be tried in the circuit court. The District Court set Petitioner\u2019s bail at $5,000, and scheduled Petitioner\u2019s trial for October 14, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the District Court received a DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL filed on Petitioner\u2019s behalf by his trial counsel. Petitioner\u2019s circuit court trial was originally scheduled for November 29, 2005, but was rescheduled to January 24, 2006 at the request of Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel filed several pretrial motions, including what he described as \u201cmore properly characterized as a motion to dismiss, based on an unlawful arrest.\u201d That motion was heard and denied on January 10, 2006. On January 24, 2006, the following transpired in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqA\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, we are proceeding by way of a not guilty agreed statement of facts as to Count 7 which is possession of a forged document. Your Honor, the State and the Defense will be recommending a flat time served disposition of this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Your Honor ... that\u2019s our understanding of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: And, Your Honor, just so it is clear to Mr. Walker, by proceeding on a not guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>statement of facts as him and I have discussed, he is essentially preserving his automatic right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">[THE COURT]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Certain motions that have been made previously in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">[THE COURT]: Right, I saw the record, there was a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKn\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: A Motion to Dismiss that was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">[THE COURT]: Yeah, right. But that fully \u2014 preserved it for appellate purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">[THE COURT]: Right.

Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ain\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. And you understand that when proceeding on a not guilty statement of facts you are proceeding as if you in fact went to trial and you were convicted of the crime charged? In this case, that crime is possession of a forged or privileged document. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-15\">[WALKER]: Privileged document, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-16\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: And do you understand that the difference between proceeding on a guilty plea and a not guilty statement of facts is that in this situation you are, as I informed the Court, and your understanding is that you are preserving your automatic right to appeal. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-17\">[WALKER]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-18\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. Can you please state your full name for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>[WALKER]: Kevin Dwight Walker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay.

Are you presently under the influence of drugs or alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-16\">[WALKER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-17\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. Have you received a written copy of the charges in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-18\">[WALKER]: And that would be this what I got\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap_\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay, we refer to it as the charging documents, statement of charges in this case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUy\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-19\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: \u2014 as this case originated in District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-20\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-21\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Have you had an adequate opportunity to discuss the charges with me as your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-22\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay.

Have you had an adequate opportunity to discuss essentially the plea agreement that we have just detailed to [the judge] here today with me? Have you had an adequate opportunity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlE\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. Has anyone made any promises to you other than what has been now placed on the .record to get you to enter or proceed in this manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A21\">[WALKER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. Do you understand that the maximum penalty for this offense is three years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. Now, do you understand that when you proceed in this way you are giving up or waiving your right to trial?

Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-17\">[THE COURT]: All right, and, Mr. Walker, you understand also that you are waiving any right to have a jury trial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>this matter, as well as a court trial? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">[WALKER]: I do now. I didn\u2019t at first. I didn\u2019t know it was a waiver. I knew it was an appealable right, you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">[THE COURT]: Yes, you have the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">[WALKER]: \u2014 saving the appeal.

One time you got a hung jury and the other time, I think \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t recall everything. But you fully understand about jury trials and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKf\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">[THE COURT]: \u2014 all that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">[WALKER]: Yeah, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">[THE COURT]: By proceeding as you are doing here today, you are waiving your right to have a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1A\">[WALKER]: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The Circuit Court then determined that it was \u201csatisfied the Defendant has made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision\u201d to waive his right to a trial and to proceed on a not guilty statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">Petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but did not present any argument on whatever issue he intended to preserve for appellate review by proceeding on a not guilty agreed statement of facts. Petitioner argued only that the circuit court erred in failing to conduct an examination, on the record, as to whether Petitioner\u2019s waiver of a jury trial was made knowingly and voluntarily, in compliance with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-246(b). In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cthe trial\u2019s court\u2019s personal knowledge of Walker\u2019s prior jury trial experience, combined with Walker\u2019s affirmation that he fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>understood about jury trials, and defense counsel\u2019s reference to pre-hearing discussions with Walker were sufficient for the court to conclude that Walker had some knowledge of the jury trial right and had knowingly waived it.\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>No. 2512, Sept. Term 2005, 175 Md.App. 788 (2007), slip opinion p. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In his petition for writ of certiorari, Petitioner presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">Where absolutely no information about the nature of a jury trial was given to Petitioner on the record, did the Court of Special Appeals err in ruling that the waiver was nevertheless valid because of the trial judge\u2019s assertion of his personal knowledge of Petitioner\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system, Petitioner\u2019s affirmative response to the trial judge\u2019s assertion, \u201cyou fully understand about jury trials and all that,\u201d and defense counsel\u2019s reference to off-the-record discussions with Petitioner?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to determine whether the waiver was made knowingly under Maryland Rule 4-246(b). <em>Walker v. State, </em>402 Md. 37, 935 A.2d 406 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Petitioner argues that his waiver of a jury trial was not made knowingly because the trial judge provided no information on the record in open court about the nature of a jury trial. According to Petitioner, the plain language of Rule 4-246(b) requires an examination regarding waiver of a jury trial on the record in open court, and precludes any presumption that a defendant who is represented by counsel was informed of his constitutional rights. He also argues that the Circuit Court\u2019s reliance on off-the-record matters including his alleged trial experience and pre-hearing discussions with his counsel were in error and that it is not sufficient that he simply responded affirmatively to the trial judge\u2019s assertion that he \u201cfully understand^] about jury trials and [all that].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The State counters that, considering the totality of the circumstances, the Circuit Court was correct in its finding that Petitioner had made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial. According to the State, the Circuit Court was entitled to consider that (1) Petitioner was specifically asked if he understood that he was waiving his right to a jury trial, (2) the circuit court had personal knowledge of Petitioner\u2019s jury trial experience, and (8) Petitioner stated on the record that he discussed his case with his attorney. Additionally, the State asserts that Petitioner\u2019s representation by counsel raises the presumption that he has been informed of his constitutional rights, including his right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"Acx\">On January 24, 2005, Maryland Rule 4-246(b) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adi\">A defendant may waive the right to a trial by jury at any time before the commencement of trial. The court may not accept the waiver until it determines, after an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Maryland Rule 4-246(a)-(b) was amended on December 4, 2007, to take effect on January 1, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The revised rule now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>In the circuit court, a defendant having a right to trial by jury shall be tried by a jury unless the right is waived pursuant to section (b) of this Rule. The State does not have the right to elect a trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(b) <em>Procedure for acceptance of waiver. </em>A defendant may waive the right to a trial by jury at any time before the commencement of trial. The court may not accept the waiver until, after an examination of the defendant on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, the court determines and announces on the record that the waiver is made knowingly an d voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement of the Rule was based on a 1982 revision to Rule 735, the precursor of Rule <em>A-246, </em>which had previously required that a defendant have \u201cfull knowledge of his right to a jury trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The revised version of the Rule deleted the \u201cfull knowledge\u201d requirement, replacing it with a requirement that the waiver be made \u201cknowingly and voluntarily,\u201d so that a circuit court judge \u201cneed not recite any fixed incantation,\u201d but the court is ultimately responsible for determining that the defendant had \u201csome knowledge of the jury trial right before being allowed to waive it.\u201d <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 317-18, 893 A.2d 1018, 1034 (2006), <em>State v. Hall, </em>321 Md. 178, 182-83, 582 A.2d 507, 509 (1990); <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 133-34, 522 A.2d 950, 955 (1987). To waive the constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury the \u201ctrial judge must be satisfied that there has been an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 418-19 n. 41, 924 A.2d 1072, 1089 n. 41 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1064, 169 L.Ed.2d 813 (2008); <em>Powell v. State, </em>394 Md. 632, 639, 907 A.2d 242, 247 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1283, 167 L.Ed.2d 103 (2007); <em>Smith v. State, </em>375 Md. 365, 379, 825 A.2d 1055, 1064 (2003). <em>See also Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Because only the defendant can validly waive his or her right to trial by jury, the defendant must directly respond to the waiver inquiry. <em>Hall, </em>321 Md. at 182, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>582 A.2d at 509; <em>Martinez, </em>309 Md. at 133, 522 A.2d at 954. Moreover, in determining whether the defendant made the waiver knowingly, we will look to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>321 Md. at 183, 582 A.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 720 A.2d 311 (1998), this Court discussed the standard to be applied under the 1982 revision to then Rule 735, which subsequently became Rule 4-246. We reviewed the history of the revision, which we stated, \u201cimplies that we wished to move away from the rigidity of the former rule 735 and <em>Countess.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> Id. </em>at 724, 720 A.2d at 318. We then concluded, with respect to the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d in the applicable rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cKnowledge,\u201d in this context means \u201cacquaintance\u201d with the principles of a jury and \u201cknowingly\u201d means acting consciously or intentionally in waiving the right to a jury. Because respondent\u2019s knowledge no longer need be \u201cfull,\u201d it need not be \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201centire.\u201d The rule no longer requires a specific in-court litany of advice with respect to the \u201cunanimity\u201d requirement for the trial court to accept and permit the waiver, by a defendant, of his right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 730, 720 A.2d at 321 (citations omitted). We considered whether a waiver could be made knowingly if the defendant was not told that all 12 jurors must unanimously agree on his guilt because, in <em>Bell, </em>the defendant had agreed to a court trial after the judge informed him that a jury was comprised of 12 jurors, and that the charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt regardless of whether he chooses a jury trial or a court trial; the unanimity requirement was not addressed. We held that this colloquy sufficiently ensured that the defendant knowingly waived his right to a jury trial, even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the judge did not specifically address the unanimity requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In <em>State v. Hall, </em>321 Md. 178, 582 A.2d 507 (1990), this Court expressly rejected the proposition that a jury trial waiver cannot be knowing and voluntary unless the defendant is advised \u201cas to the details of the jury selection process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 582 A.2d at 510. In <em>Hall, </em>the respondent, who had entered a guilty plea pursuant to an agreement with the State, argued that his jury trial waiver was not \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d made because he was not asked any questions about (1) his mental condition at the time of the waiver, (2) his knowledge of the jury selection process, or (3) whether his waiver was the result of compulsion. While holding that the waiver at issue was knowing and voluntary, this Court stated yet again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Our cases hold that whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the jury trial right depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>319 Md. at 90, 570 A.2d at 1234; <em>Martinez, supra, </em>309 Md. at 134, 522 A.2d [at 955]; <em>Dortch v. State, </em>290 Md. 229, [235,] 428 A.2d 1220[, 1223] (1981). In determining whether the defendant has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial under Rule 4-246(b), \u201cthe questioner need not recite any fixed incantation.\u201d <em>Martinez, supra, </em>390[309] Md. at 134, 522 A.2d [at 955]. The court must, however, satisfy itself that the waiver is not a product of duress or coercion and further that the <em>defendant has some knowledge </em>of the jury trial right before being allowed to waive it. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 522 A.2d [at 955]. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 182-83, 582 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 289, 893 A.2d at 1018, Abeokuto appealed his court trial conviction for first degree murder and other criminal charges by challenging the court\u2019s finding that he made a voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial.

We emphasized that the trial court need not \u201cengage in a fixed litany or boilerplate colloquy,\u201d and found the waiver valid because he was explained \u201cthe jury trial process, standard of guilt, burden of proof, the necessity of a unanimous guilty verdict, and that, if convicted, [he] would have a later opportunity to choose whether to waive his right to a sentencing by jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 893 A.2d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Petitioner argues that the case at bar is controlled by <em>Tibbs v.

This Court held that the record was \u201cwoefully deficient\u201d to establish a knowing waiver of Tibbs\u2019 right to a jury trial because he had received no information concerning \u201cthe nature of a jury trial,\u201d \u201cnotwithstanding that Tibbs may have had some prior unspecified experience with the criminal justice system.\u201d ' <em>Id. </em>at 31-32, 590 A.2d at 551. We concluded that, \u201c[i]t is not sufficient that an accused merely respond affirmatively to a naked inquiry, either from his lawyer or the court, that he understood that he has a right to a jury trial, that he knows \u2018what a jury trial is,\u2019 and waives that right \u2018freely and voluntarily.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 590 A.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">In the case at bar, the record shows that Petitioner obviously had \u201csome knowledge\u201d of his right to a jury trial, because he (1) made a considered decision to pray a jury trial rather than stand trial in the District Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) had been a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>defendant in at least one jury trial presided over by the very same circuit court judge who presided over the case at bar, (3) was represented by counsel, who reached an agreement with the State, pursuant to which the State would drop all but one of several charges then pending against the defendant in the circuit court, (4) elected to proceed on a \u201cnot guilty agreed statement of facts\u201d in order to preserve for appellate review some issue that was thereafter abandoned,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (5) advised the circuit court that he understood that he was \u201cwaiving any right to have a jury trial of this matter, as well as a court trial[.]\u201d Under these circumstances, the circuit court had an adequate basis to determine that Petitioner\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Unlike cases in which the defendant chooses between a court trial and a jury trial in order to challenge the probative value of the State\u2019s evidence, the case at bar is one in which Petitioner was challenging the <em>admissibility </em>of the State\u2019s evidence rather than the <em>sufficiency </em>or the <em>probative value </em>of that evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To preserve his right to appellate review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>issue of whether the State\u2019s evidence was acquired in violation of his constitutional rights, Petitioner made a strategic decision to have the court determine his guilt or innocence on the basis of an agreed statement of facts that was the product of plea negotiations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record shows that, having prayed a jury trial in the District Court, Petitioner wanted to proceed in the circuit court on a \u201cnot guilty agreed statement of facts\u201d as a result of a bargained for arrangement that would allow him to (1) avoid prosecution on all but one of the charges he was then facing, and (2) obtain appellate review of the denial of some motion that he had filed. The record also shows that he agreed to the truthfulness of the facts that constituted the basis for his conviction of the one charge for which he would receive a \u201ctime served\u201d disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Petitioner does not argue that his waiver was the product of duress or coercion. For reasons stated in <em>State v. Bell, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Hall, supra, </em>the circuit court was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>required to advise the petitioner as to either the \u201cunanimity\u201d requirement or the jury selection process. Because the record does show that Petitioner had been a criminal defendant in a jury trial presided over by the very same circuit court judge who presided over the case at bar, Petitioner\u2019s jury trial experience distinguishes him from defendants who \u201cmay have some prior unspecified experience with the criminal justice system[.]\u201d <em>Tibbs v. State, </em>323 Md. 28, 32, 590 A.2d 550 (1991). Petitioner\u2019s knowledge of his jury trial right is hardly \u201cunspecified.\u201d He was the criminal defendant in at least one case that was tried before a jury. While it is true that the \u201csome knowledge\u201d requirement includes an on-the-record showing that the defendant knows that (1) a criminal defendant is presumed to be innocent and cannot be convicted unless the trier of fact is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and (2) if the defendant did not waive a jury trial, his or her case would be tried by a jury of twelve persons, it is clear that the requirement was satisfied in the case at bar because it is unreasonable to hypothesize that Petitioner \u2014 having elected a jury trial when facing criminal charges on at last one prior occasion \u2014 does not know either the prosecution\u2019s burden of persuasion or the number of persons who would be on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">BELL, C.J., BATTAGLIA and GREENE, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">.

Walker noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred in failing to conduct an examination, on the record, as to whether his waiver of a jury trial was made knowingly and voluntarily, in compliance with the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-246(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>which, prior to amendments taking effect on January 1, 2008, summarized the constitutional requirements as well as the procedure a circuit court must follow in accepting a waiver of a jury trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>In the circuit court a defendant having a right to trial by jury shall be tried by a jury unless the right is waived pursuant to section (b) of this Rule.

The majority clearly agrees that an agreed statement of facts is a trial, <em>see </em>Slip Op. at 17 n. 8, and because a trial is involved, the judge must comply with the dictates of Rule 4-246(b). Accordingly, Walker was entitled to engage in the appropriate colloquy. The only colloquy Walker engaged in concerning whether his waiver was made knowingly, was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APt\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay.

(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Asking Walker if he understood that he is waiving his right to trial and affirming that he \u201cunderstands about jury trials and [all that]\u201d was not the appropriate colloquy because the language is devoid of any information concerning the nature of a jury trial; unlike the defendants in cases where we have found a knowing waiver, Walker was not informed of <em>any </em>of the characteristics of a jury trial. <em>See Kang v. State, </em>393 Md. 97, 111-12, 899 A.2d 843, 851-52 (2006); <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 320, 893 A.2d 1018, 1036 (2006); <em>State v.

While courts need not engage in a \u201cfixed litany,\u201d <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 320, 893 A.2d at 1036, Walker received absolutely no information regarding the nature of a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Walker\u2019s colloquy instead parallels the colloquy provided in <em>Tibbs v. State, </em>323 Md. 28, 590 A.2d 550 (1991). Walker\u2019s counsel asked him if he understood that he was waiving his right to a jury trial' and he responded that he did <em>not </em>understand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[COUNSEL FOR WALKER]: Okay. Now, do you understand that when you proceed in this way you are giving up or waiving your right to trial? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Z\">[WALKER]: No, I didn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The judge proceeded to ask Walker if he understood that he was waiving his right to trial to which he responded, \u201cI do now. I didn\u2019t at first. I didn\u2019t know it was a waiver. I knew it was an appealable right, you know____\u201d Subsequently, the judge stated that Walker \u201cunderstands about jury trials and [all that],\u201d to which Walker then responded affirmatively. This encounter is similar to the \u201cnaked inquiry\u201d to which Tibbs affirmatively responded but that we nonetheless found \u201cwoefully deficient.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 31-32, 590 A.2d at 551. Just like Tibbs, Walker\u2019s record reflects the lack of \u201cany information at all concerning the nature of a jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 590 A.2d at 551. His waiver may be more deficient because Walker at first stated on the record that he did not understand he was waiving his right to a jury trial. Therefore, under the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d set forth in <em>Bell, </em>he cannot be said to have been \u201cacting consciously or intentionally in waiving the right to a jury.\u201d <em>See </em>351 Md. at 730, 720 A.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">In the absence of meaningful litany, the majority distinguishes this case from <em>Tibbs, </em>by stating that the trial judge\u2019s personal knowledge of Walker\u2019s experience with the criminal justice system established that Walker had the requisite knowledge of jury trials before waiving the right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>[THE COURT]: \u2014 you [have] the right to appeal, but as you know because you and I have been down this road\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADq\">[WALKER]: \u2014 oh, yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">[THE COURT]: \u2014 you and I have been down this road before and I think we have had at least one jury trial, maybe two.

We conclude, therefore, that constitutional due process requirements were transgressed in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">323 Md. at 31-32, 590 A.2d at 551-52. In <em>Tibbs, </em>we were clear in our holding that unspecified criminal justice experience is not enough to establish a knowing waiver. A number of other jurisdictions agree with this stance. <em>See also State v. Baker, </em>217 Ariz. 118, 170 P.3d 727, 730 (2007) (finding that a valid jury trial waiver cannot be \u201caccomplished by reliance upon a defendant\u2019s prior experience in the system\u201d); <em>People v. Campbell, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 305, 310, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 315 (Cal.Ct.App. 1999) (\u201cThe Attorney General instead contends we should infer from [defendant\u2019s] experience and familiarity with the criminal justice system that he intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights. We decline to do so. If this experience were sufficient to constitute a voluntary and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights, courts would rarely be required to give <em>Boykin/Tahl </em>admonitions.\u201d). <em>But see State v. Ross, </em>472 N.W.2d 651, 654 (Minn.1991) (concluding there was support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>for a valid waiver based on defendant\u2019s familiarity with the criminal justice system although it was not clear whether his past convictions were by plea or trial).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The majority, nevertheless, distinguishes <em>Tibbs </em>by arguing that, although the trial court in that case was faced with prior unspecified experience with the criminal justice system, the trial court here had personal knowledge of Walker\u2019s past experience with jury trials. The trial judge\u2019s knowledge, while personal, was unspecified: \u201cI think we have had at least one jury trial, maybe two. One time you got a hung jury and the other time, I think \u2014 well, I don!t know, I can\u2019t recall everything.\u201d To accept the majority\u2019s reasoning would require concluding that such unspecified knowledge can be imputed to the defendant to support a knowing waiver of a jury trial. Nothing on the record confirms Walker did have jury trial experience and, if so, when such trials occurred. The record is absent of any discussion specifically establishing the extent, if any, of. Walker\u2019s jury trial experience. We therefore, should not assume that the judge\u2019s assertion of Walker\u2019s unspecified experience with the criminal justice sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tem equates with Walker\u2019s actual knowledge of the nature of jury trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The majority also incorrectly assumes that representation by counsel and counsel\u2019s decisions to 1) elect a jury trial; 2) negotiate an agreement regarding sentence; and 3) proceed on an agreed statement of facts impute knowledge to the defendant. It cannot, however, be assumed that the significance of such decisions are adequately communicated to a defendant by counsel or that, if explained, the defendant in fact understands the significance of such decisions; in fact, the record reflects Walker did not understand. Hence, Rule 4-246(b) explicitly requires that a waiver examination be \u201con the record in open court.\u201d We have recently noted that the presence of counsel \u201cwill not mitigate an inaccurate or incomplete court instruction\u201d when considering whether the waiver of a jury sentencing right was knowing and voluntary. <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 348 n. 21, 893 A.2d at 1052 n. 21. Therefore, neither the presence of counsel nor decisions made by counsel in the present case can overcome the requirement of Rule 4-246(b) that Walker\u2019s waiver examination be \u201con the record in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Walker was not informed on the record of the nature of a jury trial and the combination of his affirmative response to the judge\u2019s \u201cnaked inquiry\u201d as to whether he \u201cfully understood] about jury trials and [all that],\u201d the judge\u2019s assertion of past trial experience with Walker, and any information that counsel could have, but may not have, provided him, when considered under the totality of the circumstances, fail to amount to a knowing waiver. The precedent set by the majority\u2019s opinion undermines the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-246(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge GREENE authorize me to state that they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. Other jurisdictions have looked to a defendant\u2019s specific experience with the criminal justice system to determine whether it is sufficient to support a knowing waiver. <em>See Hill v. Beyer, </em>62 F.3d 474, 485 (3d Cir.1995) (declaring that while past experience with the criminal justice system could demonstrate an awareness of constitutional rights, the facts were insufficient to support a knowing waiver when defendant\u2019s criminal record consisted of only one conviction for which he pled guilly); <em>Hensley v. United States, </em>281 F.2d 605, 608-09 &amp; n. 6 (D.C.Cir. 1960) (finding experience with two prior jury trials in which defendant was acquitted as a factor to consider in determining whether there was a knowing waiver); <em>People v. Turner, </em>375 Ill.App.3d 1101, 1110, 314 Ill.Dec. 665, 674, 875 N.E.2d 175, 184 (2007) (finding that, although not necessary to the decision, defendant\u2019s two, prior criminal convictions and six prior traffic convictions lent additional support to the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver); Justice Lytton, concurring opinion, <em>id. </em>at 1111, 314 Ill.Dec. at 675, 875 N.E.2d at 185 (stating that \"reference to defendant\u2019s supposed knowledge of the criminal justice system\u201d should be omitted because \"[djefendant\u2019s 'familiarity' with the criminal justice system was a ten-year-old felony, a ten-year-old misdemeanor, and a smattering of traffic tickets handed out over a period of 23 years,\u201d which \u201c[tjaken together ... give the defendant little basis for knowing the nature and import of a jury waiver\u201d), <em>appeal denied, </em>226 Ill.2d 606, 316 Ill.Dec. 550, 879 N.E.2d 938 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
