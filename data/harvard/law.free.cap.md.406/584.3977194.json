ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKYZ\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">This is an action for judicial review of a final adjudicatory administrative decision by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. In that decision, the Department amended the petitioner VNA Hospice of Maryland\u2019s hospice care license to exclude VNA from providing home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties. The decision was based upon Maryland Code (2000, 2005 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In deciding to rescind that part of VNA\u2019s license relating to Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties, the Department rejected VNA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article. The Department also rejected VNA\u2019s alternative arguments that, if \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) precluded VNA from performing home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties, the statute as applied to VNA was unconstitutional on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County reversed the administrative decision on state constitutional grounds. The Court of Special Appeals, however, rejected VNA\u2019s constitutional arguments, reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, and directed the Circuit Court to affirm the Department\u2019s final decision. <em>Dept. of Health v. VNA </em>176 Md.App. 475, 501-502, 933 A.2d 512, 527 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">This Court granted VNA\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari which presented numerous constitutional questions. <em>VNA Hospice v. Department of Health, </em>402 Md. 355, 936 A.2d 852 (2007). Although we recognize that some of VNA\u2019s constitutional arguments are substantial, we shall not decide any of the constitutional issues. Instead, we shall vacate the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and direct an affirmance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Circuit Court\u2019s judgment on the ground that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statutory provisions, and particularly \u00a7 19-906(c)(3), was not legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">VNA, before the Department\u2019s action complained of here, was licensed to provide and had been providing home-based hospice services, to \u201cdying individuals and their families,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, and Prince George\u2019s Counties, as well as Baltimore City. As a result of the Department\u2019s final decision in this case, VNA could no longer provide home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties unless it applied for and received a Certificate of Need (hereafter sometimes referred to as a \u201cCON\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Since 1982, hospice care programs have been included in Maryland\u2019s health care planning statutory definition of \u201chealth care facility.\u201d Maryland Code (2000, 2005 Repl. VoL), \u00a7 19-114(d)(1)(vii) of the Health-General Article. Also since 1983, new facility-based hospice care programs have been required to have a Certificate of Need and to meet licensing requirements. Many pre-existing hospice providers, although still having to meet the licensing requirements, were \u201cgrandfathered\u201d with respect to the CON requirement because of an uncodified provision, in a 1987 statute, exempting existing programs. Ch. 670 of the Acts of 1987, \u00a7 2, stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATL\">\u201c[tjhat those hospice care programs in existence and delivering hospice care services before January 1, 1987, that request licensure between July 1, 1987, and July 1, 1988, shall not be required to obtain a certificate of need prior to licensure. However, those hospice care programs seeking exemption from formal submission of a certificate of need for a hospice care program under this section shall meet the criteria established by the Maryland Health Resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Planning Commission in consultation with interested groups, including the Hospice Network of Maryland, Inc., for determining whether a hospice care program was in existence and delivering hospice care services before January 1, 1987.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As more requirements were subsequently added in order to obtain a CON for a hospice program, existing programs continued to benefit from grandfathering provisions. This history was described by the Maryland Health Care Commission, Division of Health Resources, in a report entitled <em>An Analysis and Evaluation of Certificate of Need Regulation in Maryland, Working Paper: Hospice Services, </em>at 23-24 (2000), as follows (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201cSince the enactment of the statute creating the former Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission in 1982, hospice care programs (as well as home health agencies) have been included in the definition of \u2018health care facility\u2019 for purposes of coverage by CON review requirements. However, since most home health agencies and virtually all hospice programs existing at that time had been created by hospitals or nursing homes as a facility-based medical service, statutory language was added at several junctures over the next several years to clarify that any geographic expansion (beyond their current jurisdictions) by an existing hospice or home health agency required an additional CON. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Existing programs of both kinds rushed to be \u2018grandfathered\u2019 as these successive additions to Commission and licensing law established additional requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\u201cSince Medicare did not include hospice care as a covered service until the 1983 effective date of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982, followed by Medicaid\u2019s adding the benefit in 1985, relatively few freestanding hospices existed at the time of the 1984 amendments to statute. The imposition of a separate State licensure requirement for hospice programs in 1987 was an indicator of the program\u2019s growth, and the increasing interest of freestanding providers. This new law explicitly stated that, except for a program with a limited license, a person seeking licensure \u2018shall have a certificate of need ... for the hospice program to be operated.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cUncodified language in the 1987 licensure statute provided that hospice care programs established without CON approval, \u2018in existence and delivering hospice care services before January 1, 1987\u2019 that sought State licensure between July 1, 1987 and July 1, 1988 would \u2018not be required to obtain a Certificate of Need prior to licensure.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The report continued <em>(id. </em>at 24):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cSince hospice programs that existed before either the CON or the licensure requirement had no geographic limitation on their service area, once grandfathered, this service area was determined to be statewide. This was reinforced by the argument that since nearly all of these pre-existing hospice programs had been established as medical services within hospitals or nursing homes, which may serve a resident of any Maryland jurisdiction (and in the case of facilities with specialized services, often draw patients from across the state), the determination that their hospice programs had similar geographic scope. Even when, beginning in the early 1990s, corporate tax advantages, changed reimbursement rales, or mergers with other facilities provided incentive to \u2018spin off facility-based hospice services into a freestanding, though usually still affiliated program, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>determination of \u2018statewide authority<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to serve patients was found still to apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">As explained above, licensed hospice programs that qualified under grandfathering provisions were authorized to provide services throughout the State of Maryland. Moreover, because hospice care programs were, and are, freely transferable, a provider seeking to serve the entire State of Maryland could simply acquire one of the grandfathered, CON-exempted licenses, and thereby acquire a license allowing it to serve the entire State without meeting the CON requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Consequently, CON-exempt licenses allowing providers to serve the entire State became a highly valued commodity. In one transaction, described in the Department of Legislative Services\u2019 Bill File on Senate Bill 732 of the 2003 General Assembly\u2019s legislative session, a program licensed to provide state-wide services without a CON was transferred to a large out-of-state organization, which then announced its intention to expand the program\u2019s capacity to serve more people in more areas of Maryland than any of the previous owners of that program. To address the competition felt by smaller local hospices competing with these larger providers, Senate Bill 732 was introduced at the 2003 Session of the General Assembly. One member of the Senate supporting the Bill, in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on March 6, 2003, testified that it was \u201cthese little hospices around the State that we are trying to protect.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Senate Bill 732 was enacted, and signed by the Governor on May 22, 2003, as Ch. 404 of the Acts of 2003. The effective date of Ch. 404 was July 1, 2003. The Act added several new provisions to Title 19 of the Health-General Article, which were designed to address some of the previously discussed matters. For example, new \u00a7 19-120(k)(5)(ii) provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cthe purchaser of the general hospice may only acquire the authority to provide home-based hospice services in jurisdictions in which the seller of the general hospice is licensed to provide home-based hospice services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">New \u00a7 19-120(o) also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201cThe Commission may not issue a certificate of need or a determination with respect to an acquisition that authorizes a general hospice to provide home-based hospice services on a statewide basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">With regard to the dispute in the present case, the key provision added by Ch. 404 of the Acts of 2003 was \u00a7 19-906(c)(2) and (3) which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201c(2) The Secretary, in consultation with the Maryland Health Care Commission, shall specify those jurisdictions in which a general hospice is authorized to provide home-based hospice services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\u201c(3) A general hospice may not be licensed to provide home-based hospice services in a jurisdiction unless the general hospice or an entity acquired by the general hospice provided home-based hospice services to a patient in the jurisdiction during the 12-month period ending December 31, 2001.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">As previously mentioned, subsection (3) above was the basis for the Department\u2019s decision which rescinded that portion of VNA\u2019s license relating to Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties, thereby precluding VNA from performing home-based hospice services in those two jurisdictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">In a letter dated August 18, 2003, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene notified VNA that, because of the enactment of \u00a7 19-906(c)(3), \u201cthis letter amends your license to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>show that you are authorized to provide hospice services only\u201d in \u201cAnne Arundel [County], Baltimore City, Baltimore [County], Cecil [County], Harford [County], [and] Howard [County].\u201d The letter asserted that these jurisdictions were the only ones in which VNA had performed hospice services in the year 2001. The Department\u2019s letter also stated that, if VNA disagreed with the amendment restricting its license, it could request a hearing by writing to the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings. Three days later, VNA sent a letter to the Office of Administrative Hearings and the Department stating that it had provided to the State \u201cstatistics ... demonstrating that services had been provided by VNA to patients in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s [C]ounties in 2001.\u201d VNA requested a hearing to be conducted by the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The hearing was held on October 31, 2003, before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Office of Administrative Hearings. There was no testimony from witnesses. Instead, the matter was tried on a detailed stipulation of facts submitted by counsel for VNA and counsel for the Department, various exhibits, affidavits, legal memoranda, and oral argument by counsel for each side. VNA argued that, under a correct interpretation of Title 19, Subtitle 9, of the Health-General Article, consisting of \u00a7 \u00a7 19-901 through 19-913, VNA did provide home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties in 2001. The dispute between VNA and the Department regarding this issue was not a factual dispute; all of the underlying facts concerning VNA\u2019s activities with respect to Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties were agreed upon. Instead, the dispute concerned the correct interpretation of the statutory provisions. The disputed statutory interpretation issue was whether VNA\u2019s provision of home-based bereavement services to family members of the dying or deceased persons, in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties during the year 2001, constituted the provision of \u201chome-based hospice services to a patient in\u201d those Counties within the meaning of \u00a7 19 \u2014 906(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>VNA argued before the ALJ that the provision of bereavement services to family members qualified under the statute, whereas the Department contended that the only services which qualified under \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) were services rendered to the dying person. VNA alternatively argued that, if the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statute were correct, \u00a7 19-906(c)(3), as applied to VNA under the circumstances of this case, was unconstitutional. VNA relied on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. VNA also maintained that, as interpreted by the Department, \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) effected the taking of VNA\u2019s property right without just compensation, in violation of the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as well as in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as applied in <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, </em>370 Md. 604, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These were the principal constitutional arguments made, although VNA did raise some additional issues under the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The ALJ rendered an extensive Proposed Decision and a separate Recommended Order on January 15, 2004. The Findings of Fact in the Proposed Decision, based upon the stipulation and other documents submitted, consisted of several pages delineating in detail the home-based hospice services which VNA Hospice provided in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties, during the year 2001, to family members of deceased persons. As set forth in the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, for example, a Carroll County resident was referred to VNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Hospice \u201cfor hospice services\u201d on December 5, 2000. VNA Hospice \u201cdid an evaluation of the\u201d person \u201cand developed a plan of care\u201d which included \u201ca bereavement plan of care to provide services\u201d after the person\u2019s death to the person\u2019s \u201csignificant other\u201d and her father who lived in Carroll County. According to the ALJ, \u201c[bjereavement services of up to one year after the death ... are a core service under the Medicare program and are reimbursed\u201d at the same rate as services to the deceased. The deceased died on December 8, 2000, and VNA Hospice provided bereavement services, in accordance with the plan, to the \u201csignificant other\u201d and the father in Carroll County during the year 2001. The ALJ\u2019s Findings of Fact described five other situations, involving five other Carroll County residents who died in the year 2000, where VNA Hospice during the year 2001 provided bereavement services to the deceased persons\u2019 families in Carroll County. In addition, the ALJ\u2019s Findings of Fact described a similar situation where VNA Hospice provided bereavement services during 2001 to the deceased\u2019s mother in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">After setting forth the factual findings, the ALJ first turned to the statutory interpretation issue and rejected VNA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 19-906(c)(3). The ALJ, largely relying upon the phrase \u201cservices to a patient\u201d in subsection (c)(3), interpreted the language to mean that bereavement services to the deceased\u2019s family in a county of their residence failed to qualify under the subsection. The ALJ placed particular emphasis on the use of the word \u201cto\u201d rather than the word \u201cfor.\u201d Thus, the ALJ explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cThe literal meaning of the words, \u2018services to a patient in the jurisdiction\u2019 supports the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statutory provision in dispute. The Appellant\u2019s suggested interpretation would have the ALJ read the statutory language as hospice services \u2018for\u2019 not \u2018to\u2019 a patient. The ordinary and natural import of the words <em>\u2018to </em>a patient\u2019 seem inconsistent with the Appellant\u2019s suggested interpretation. It does not seem apparent from the literal meaning of the text, that Legislators who enacted the statute would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>contemplated services to family members after the patient died as qualifying \u2018services to a patient in the jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">Although the ALJ referred to numerous rules of statutory construction, and later discussed the constitutional issues at length, the ALJ did not mention the principle that \u201cthe preferred construction [of a statute] is that which avoids the determination of constitutionality.\u201d <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 172, 638 A.2d 93, 104-105 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The ALJ next rejected all of VNA\u2019s constitutional arguments, generally relying upon the principle that \u201c[a] presumption of constitutionality attaches to any act of the Legislature.\u201d With respect to VNA\u2019s Taking and Due Process arguments, the ALJ held that VNA had no \u201cproperty right\u201d under its license, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201cThe Appellant is not engaged in a common occupation or calling. The Appellant is a provider of hospice care. There is a significant difference between a provider of hospice care, a regulated industry integrally involved with public health, and the occupation of crabbers or oystermen [whose property rights were involved in cases relied on by VNA].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFPQ\">The ALJ also stated that VNA\u2019s reliance on <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, supra, </em>370 Md. 604, 805 A.2d 1061, was \u201cmisplaced\u201d because, in addition to VNA\u2019s license not constituting a \u201cproperty right,\u201d Ch. 404 of the Acts of 2003 \u201capplies prospectively.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s Recommended Order was that the decision amending VNA\u2019s license to exclude the performance of hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties \u201cbe upheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIM\">VNA filed with the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s Proposed Decision. A designee of the Secretary considered the exceptions and, on June 21, 2004, \u201cadopt[ed] all of the proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set forth in the [ALJ\u2019s] Proposed Decision,\u201d and upheld the original decision \u201cto amend VNA\u2019s hospice care license to exclude VNA from providing home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties pursuant to\u201d \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article. The Board of Review of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>after hearing oral argument, filed on October 13, 2004, a brief order affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision. This was the final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">VNA brought, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, an action for judicial review of the Department\u2019s decision. The Circuit Court reversed the administrative decision on the ground that VNA\u2019s license to provide home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties was a property right, and that \u00a7 19 \u2014 906(c)(3), as applied to VNA, constituted the taking of a property right without just compensation in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as applied in <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, supra, </em>370 Md. 604, 805 A.2d 1061. With regard to some of the other grounds argued, the Circuit Court stated that the use of the 2001 date, in a statute enacted in 2003, was \u201carbitrary\u201d and a \u201cretroactive application,\u201d \u201cand raises serious concerns regarding the constitutional validity of 19 \u2014 906(c)(3).\u201d The Circuit Court did not reach any of the federal constitutional issues raised, or the other state constitutional grounds, or the statutory interpretation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The Department appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred and that \u00a7 19 \u2014 906(c)(3) was constitutional. VNA, as appellee, relied upon all of the same constitutional arguments that it had made in the administrative proceedings and before the Circuit Court. Regarding the statutory interpretation issue, however, VNA expressly stated in its brief that \u201cVNA is not raising this issue in this appeal.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief in the Court of Special Appeals at 2, n. 1). The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat HG \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) is not unconstitutional on any of the grounds asserted by VNA. We therefore reverse the judgment of the circuit court with the direction that it affirm the Final Decision of the Department.\u201d <em>Dept. of Health v. VNA, supra, </em>176 Md.App. at 479, 933 A.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">VNA filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising all of the constitutional issues which it had previously raised. VNA did not include in its certiorari petition the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>statutory interpretation issue, which had been its primary argument during the administrative proceedings. The Department did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. As stated earlier, this Court granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The constitutional arguments made by VNA throughout this case, and repeated in its certiorari petition and brief in this Court, are neither organized very well nor always separately delineated. Nevertheless, some of them are substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">VNA\u2019s principal argument is that \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article effected a taking of the petitioner\u2019s property right without just compensation in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, in light of the principles set forth in <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, supra, </em>370 Md. 604, 805 A.2d 1061. Interspersed within this argument, however, is the contention that \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) \u201cviolates the [petitioner\u2019s] substantive due process rights.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 7). Thus, the petitioner argues that the statute does not relate to \u201cthe public\u2019s health, safety or welfare,\u201d that Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights protects \u201ca <em>substantive right </em>as well as vested property rights\u201d and petitioner\u2019s \u201csubstantive right\u201d was violated, and that \u00a7 19-906(e)(3) represents an \u201cexercise of arbitrary power.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 5, 7, 9, 11, 13).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The petitioner also relies upon, and quotes extensively from, leading procedural due process cases and equal protection cases. In addition, VNA asserts that \u00a7 19-906(c)(3) creates a monopoly in violation of Article 41 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Finally, the petitioner takes the position that, wholly separate from the limitations upon governmental power under \u201ctaking\u201d principles, or under the \u201csubstantive due process\u201d doctrine, or under the other constitutional principles mentioned above, an enactment of the General Assembly must be within the \u201cpolice power\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u00a7 19-906(c)(3) is not \u201ca valid exercise of the police powers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 24-27).

For example, while \u201c[t]he right to practice [an occupation] is a property right of which [one] cannot be deprived without due process of law,\u201d it is subject to the \u201c \u2018regulatory power\u2019 \u201d of the State. <em>Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline v.

Neither these nor similar cases in this Court, however, have involved the revocation, in whole or in part, of a license to engage in an occupation based upon a licensee\u2019s conduct years in the past, which conduct was lawful, proper, and free of any fault at the time when it took place. The Circuit Court, in a comprehensive opinion, held that, under the circumstances of this case, the partial revocation of the license constituted the taking of a property right without just compensation in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The procedural due process issue presented by the application of \u00a7 19-906(e)(3) under the circumstances here may be even more substantial. There is obviously an unfairness in revoking a license pursuant to a statute enacted in 2003 because of entirely lawful and proper events in 2001 \u2014 events which in no manner involved any fault, error, negligence, improper conduct, or anything similar, on the part of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">When \u00a7 19 \u2014 906(c)(3) was enacted in 2003, requiring certain conditions to have happened in 2001 in order to retain a license to operate in particular counties, it was impossible for the petitioner to comply with the conditions. An analogous hypothetical would be for this Court, in the year 2008, to promulgate a rule providing that a member of the Maryland Bar could practice law, without having to take and pass the bar examination for a second time, only in those Maryland counties where the lawyer practiced law in the year 2006. Few, if any, Maryland lawyers would consider that such a rule was fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">At the oral argument in this case, the attorney for the Department conceded that a \u201clicense[ ] to provide home-based hospice services in a jurisdiction\u201d (\u00a7 19 \u2014 906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article) is a \u201cproperty right\u201d for purposes of procedural due process. <em>See also, e.g., Barry v.

Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that the Court\u2019s construction and applications of the Maryland statutory scheme in this and prior cases obviously are influenced by constitutional considerations.

Instead, we construed the Maryland Public Defender Act and certain provisions of the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Rules as granting a statutory right to counsel at the trial court proceeding. After discussing the principle that the Court will not decide a constitutional issue when the case can properly be resolved on a non-constitutional ground, the <em>McCarter </em>opinion continued by pointing out that \u201c[t]his principle applies even if the non-constitutional ground was not raised by any party in the case,\u201d and that it is an exception to the requirement that an issue be presented in a certiorari petition. <em>McCarter v.

Under the cases, if the statutory provisions can reasonably be interpreted so that the petitioner was providing home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties in the year 2001, the Court is required to decide the case on that statutory interpretation ground and to avoid reaching the constitutional issues presented by the Department\u2019s construction of the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">As discussed earlier, the first issue raised by VNA Hospice at the administrative proceedings was whether the bereavement services provided in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Counties during 2001 constituted the provision of \u201chome-based hospice services\u201d in those counties within the meaning of \u00a7 19-906(c)(2) and (3) of the Health-General Article. Those subsections state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201c(2) The Secretary, in consultation with the Maryland Health Care Commission, shall specify those jurisdictions in which a general hospice is authorized to provide home-based hospice services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c(3) A general hospice may not be licensed to provide home-based hospice services in a jurisdiction unless the general hospice or an entity acquired by the general hospice provided home-based hospice services to a patient in the jurisdiction during the 12-month period ending December 31, 2001.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The ALJ, relying on the phrase \u201cservices <em>to </em>a patient\u201d in subsection (c)(3), held that bereavement services to the deceased\u2019s family in a county of their residence failed to qualify. The ALJ indicated that, if the subsection had said \u201cservices <em>for </em>a patient,\u201d bereavement services to the deceased\u2019s family would qualify. The ALJ\u2019s interpretation fails to consider the statute as a whole, particularly in light of the principle that, if reasonably possible, a statute should not be construed to raise substantial constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Title 19, Subtitle 9, of the Health-General Article, entitled <em>\u201cHospice Care Facilities,\u201d </em>begins with a \u201cDefinitions\u201d section in \u00a7 19-901. The remainder of the subtitle consists of \u00a7\u00a7 19-902 through 19-913. The word \u201cpatient\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 19-901. While the word \u201cpatient\u201d is used in some places in the Subtitle, the Subtitle often employs the words \u201cdying individuals\u201d or \u201cindividuals who have no reasonable prospect of cure \u2014 \u201d Although the word \u201cpatient\u201d may usually refer to a person with a physical or mental illness, it certainly could encompass a member of the dying or deceased person\u2019s family who is suffering emotionally and needs bereavement services. It is significant that <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>at p. 1655 (1981), gives as one of the definitions of the noun \u201cpatient,\u201d \u201cone that suffers.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The \u201cDefinitions\u201d section for Subtitle 9 divides \u201chome-based hospice care programs\u201d into two types, and defines each of these types. Section 19-901 provides in subsections (d) through (g) as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">\u201c(d) <em>General hospice care program. </em>\u2014 \u2018General hospice care program\u2019 means a coordinated, interdisciplinary program of hospice care services for meeting the special physical, psychological, spiritual, and social needs of dying individuals <em>and their families, </em>by providing palliative and supportive medical, nursing, and other health services through home or inpatient care during the illness and bereavement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">(1) To individuals who have no reasonable prospect of cure as estimated by a physician; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>(2) To the families of those individuals.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">(e) <em>General license. </em>\u2014 \u2018General license\u2019 means a license issued by the Secretary to operate a general hospice care program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">(f) <em>Limited hospice care program. </em>\u2014 \u2018Limited hospice care program\u2019 means a coordinated, interdisciplinary program of hospice care services for meeting the special physical, psychological, spiritual, and social needs of dying individuals <em>and their families, </em>by providing palliative and supportive nonskilled services through a home-based hospice care program during illness and bereavement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">(1) To individuals who have no reasonable prospect of cure as estimated by a physician; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\n<em>(2) To the families of those individuals.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">(g) <em>Limited license. </em>\u2014 \u2018Limited license\u2019 means a license issued by the Secretary to operate a limited hospice care program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">It is significant that the definitions of both types of home-based hospice care programs expressly include \u201cbereavement\u201d services \u201c[t]o the families\u201d of \u201cindividuals who have no reasonable prospect of cure.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">Section 19-902 of Subtitle 9 specifies the \u201cpurposes\u201d of the Subtitle, and it draws no distinction between services to dying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>individuals and services to other \u201cindividuals who want a supportive environment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the Title of Ch. 404 of the Acts of 2003 draws no distinction between services to dying individuals and services to their families. Furthermore, the Title does not use the word \u201cpatient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Section 19-903 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene to adopt regulations for the operation of hospice care programs, and it imposes numerous \u201crequirements\u201d for such regulations. Subsection (b)(3) of \u00a7 19-903 states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201c(3) The regulations for a home-based hospice care program shall require:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">(i) The medical director to be a physician licensed to practice medicine in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">(ii) The provision of bereavement services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">(iii) The provision of services to meet the spiritual or social needs of dying individuals and their families____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Again, the statute makes no distinction between providing services to dying individuals and providing services to their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">As numerous provisions of Subtitle 9 demonstrate, the furnishing of bereavement services to families of dying individuals is clearly an integral part of both types of home-based hospice care programs. Section 19\u2014906(c)(2) states that the Secretary \u201cshall specify those jurisdictions in which a general hospice is authorized to provide home-based hospice services,\u201d and \u00a7 19-901 states that a \u201cgeneral\u201d hospice program includes bereavement services to the deceased\u2019s family. An interpretation of \u00a7 19-906(e)(3), which excludes bereavement services to a family, based upon a difference in phraseology between \u201cto a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>patient\u201d and \u201cfor a patient,\u201d seems unreasonable. This is particularly true in light of the substantial constitutional issues presented under the ALJ\u2019s and Department\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We hold, therefore, that the petitioner was performing home-based hospice services in Carroll and Prince George\u2019s Counties during 2001. Consequently, we do not decide any of the constitutional issues raised. We shall direct an affirmance of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, although on a different ground than that relied upon by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY.

Section 19-906(c)(3) of the Health-General Article, enacted as part of Ch. 404 of the Acts of 2003, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">\"(3) A general hospice may not be licensed to provide home-based hospice services in a jurisdiction unless the general hospice or an entity acquired by the general hospice provided home-based hospice services to a patient in the jurisdiction during the 12-month period ending December 31, 2001.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">.

At the time this statute was enacted, the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission, an agency within the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, administered the CON regulations for the hospice care program.

Section 19-906(c)(4) created a few limited exceptions to \u00a7 19-906(c)(3), including the ability of a general hospice to apply for a CON to perform home-based hospice services in a previously excluded jurisdiction. None of these limited exceptions is applicable under the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">. Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asr\">\u201cSection 40.

There are, of course, significant differences between an unconstitutional \"taking\u201d in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and a violation of the so-called \u201csubstantive due process\u201d doctrine under Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights. It is somewhat similar to the difference, in the United States Constitution, between a violation of the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment and a violation of so-called \"substantive due process\u201d principles under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Compare, e.g., Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, </em>524 U.S. 498, 503-538, 118 S.Ct. 2131, 2137-2153, 141 L.Ed.2d 451 (1998) (plurality opinion) with 524 U.S. at 539-550, 118 S.Ct. at 2154-2161, 141 L.Ed.2d at 481 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">While in certain situations, this Court's \"taking\u201d cases rest on both Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution and Article 24 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Declaration of Rights, the reference to Article 24 should not be construed as mixing \"taking principles\u201d with the doctrine of \"substantive due process.\" This Court in <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, </em>370 Md. 604, 629-630, 805 A.2d 1061, 1076 (2002) explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\"In light of this Court's opinions, it is clear that retrospective statutes abrogating vested property rights (including contractual rights) violate the Maryland Constitution. To reiterate, the central issue, in cases like the present ones, is whether vested rights are violated and not whether the retroactive statutes are 'rational.' The Court's opinions indicate that the particular provisions of the Constitution which are violated by such acts are Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Constitution. Furthermore, these constitutional provisions literally cover the matter. A statute having the effect of abrogating a vested property right, and not providing for compensation, does 'authoriz[e] private property, to be taken ..., without just compensation\u2019 (Article III, \u00a7 40). Concomitantly, such a statute results in a person or entity being \u2018deprived of his ... property\u2019 contraiy to \u2018the law of the land\u2019 (Article 24).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANu\">The <em>Dua </em>opinion continued (370 Md. at 630, n. 9, 805 A.2d at 1076, n. 9):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cWe recognize that, in some contexts, there are differences between the analyses applied when determining whether particular governmental action constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of property in violation of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights and an unconstitutional taking of property in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution. Nevertheless, there are also situations involving an overlap, where this Court has held that the same governmental action violates both Article 24 and Article III, \u00a7 40. <em>See </em>the discussions in <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm'n v. Chadwick, </em>286 Md. 1, 8-18, 405 A.2d 241, 244-250 (1979); <em>Bureau of Mines v. George\u2019s Creek, </em>272 Md. 143, 156-165, 321 A.2d 748, 755-760 (1974); <em>Arnold v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>270 Md. 285, 294, 311 A.2d 223, 228 (1973); <em>Leet v. Montgomery County, </em>264 Md. 606, 611-616, 287 A.2d 491, 494-497 (1972). The opinions of this Court, holding that retrospective statutes impairing vested rights are unconstitutional, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>clearly based on both Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b655-5\">. The entire authority relied upon for this theory consists of five cases, three of which invalidated governmental action under the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <em>(Frankel v. Board of Regents, </em>361 Md. 298, 761 A.2d 324 (2000); <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 635 A.2d 967 (1994); <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 703-728, 426 A.2d 929, 940-954 (1981)), one of which rejected a \u201csubstantive due process\u201d challenge to a state statute, based upon Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Dawson v. State, </em>329 Md. 275, 282-290, 619 A.2d 111, 114-118 (1993)), and one of which rejected the argument that the government\u2019s destruction of the appellants' wild animal constituted a taking of property without paying just compensation in violation of Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution, and the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment <em>(Raynor v.

Historically, the phrase \u201cpolice power\u201d has been used to signify residual governmental power which does not violate particular limitations set forth in the United States or Maryland Constitutions. <em>See, e.g., Brown v.
