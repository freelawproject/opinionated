On the record before us, we shall hold that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Respondent, Old Europe Manor, LLC (\u201cOld Europe\u201d) was a tenant of Double H Family. Further, we shall hold that the Circuit Court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that Old Europe\u2019s status on Double H Family\u2019s property was that of either a licensee or a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In February 2003, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area was hit by a winter storm of unusually heavy rain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>snowfall. Following the storm, Old Europe sustained considerable water damage to its merchandise and the space it occupied, allegedly, when runoff water trapped by accumulated trash and debris infiltrated the premises at 4124-F Howard Avenue in Kensington, Maryland. On May 2, 2005, Old Europe and owner, Isabelle Sanchez-Tintenier,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a civil action seeking damages from Double H Family and La Belle Epoque. Old Europe sued Double H Family for negligence, breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In the negligence count against La Belle Epoque, Old Europe maintained that La Belle Epoque negligently created the pile of debris and trash outside the shared building which subsequently led to the infiltration of runoff water into Old Europe\u2019s space. Upon motions by La Belle Epoque and Double H Family, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted summary judgment on all counts against Old Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Old Europe filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and that court subsequently vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. The intermediate appellate court agreed with the trial court that Old Europe could not assert rights against Double H Family under a lease that was orally transferred to Old Europe because the oral assignment did not satisfy the Statute of Frauds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals concluded, however, \u201cthat there [we]re material disputes as to whether Old Europe became Double H Family\u2019s periodic tenant by operation of law and as to whether Double H Family and La Belle Epoque negligently caused damage to its neighbor.\u201d We granted both Double H Family\u2019s and La Belle Epoque\u2019s petitions for writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The relevant facts taken in a light most favorable to Old Europe are as follows. Double H Family is the owner of a commercial two-story building on Howard Avenue in Kensington, Maryland. The building has two leased spaces: 4088-A Howard Avenue (the upstairs space) and 4124-F Howard Avenue (the downstairs space). The building sits against the side of a hill so that the downstairs space opens onto Howard Avenue and the upstairs space can only be accessed by \u201can [elevated] alley at the base of the building that runs parallel to Howard Avenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On July 23, 2001, Double H Family executed a five-year lease (\u201cthe Lease\u201d) with Francois Desbois for the premises known as 4124-F Howard Avenue for the operation of his antique business, Vieille France Antiques. Both Desbois and Sanchez-Tintenier, who was the vice president and secretary of Vieille France Antiques at that time, were present at the signing of the Lease. Sanchez-Tintenier played a large role in negotiating the Lease because Desbois does not speak English. At some time either prior to or after the execution of the Lease with Desbois, Double H Family leased 4088-A Howard Avenue to La Belle Epoque for its antique storage business.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The Lease between Double H Family and Desbois commenced on September 1, 2001, for a five year term ending on August 31, 2006. In relevant part to this appeal, the Lease reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">2.5 <em>Repairs and Improvements. </em>Landlord shall deliver the Premises with all electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems and equipment in good working condition. And will replace the sink and toilet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">Landlord shall be responsible for maintenance and repair of the roof, exterior walls, foundation, downspouts, gutters and structural elements of the building of which the Premises are a part, unless such repair or maintenance is necessitated by any act or neglect of Tenant or anyone acting by, through or under Tenant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, Tenant shall promptly repair, at Tenant\u2019s expense, any damage to the Premises and to any equipment, systems, and facilities therein, and will make all repairs and replacements thereto, whether such repairs and replacements be necessitated by ordinary wear and tear or other event of any kind, except a Casualty as provided in Section 3.2 hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant\u2019s maintenance, repair and replacement responsibilities shall include the interior of the Premises, all doors, windows and loading docks, if any, and all electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, security, fire prevention, and sprinkler systems and equipment, if any, presently or hereafter installed in the Premises. Tenant has had the opportunity to inspect the Premises and is leasing the Premises \u201cAS IS\u201d, without any representation, warranty, or covenant by the Landlord or Agent respecting the suitability of the Premises for Tenant\u2019s use thereof of the condition of the Premises or any element thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">Tenant shall pay all expenses of operating and maintaining the Premises, including, but not limited to, expenses for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>refusal removal, janitorial services, carpet cleaning, and painting----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">2.7 <em>Notices. </em>All notices hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be hand delivered or mailed by Registered or Certified U.S. Mail, Return Receipt Requested, First Class, postage prepaid, to the parties hereto at their respective addresses set forth below, or at such other address of which either party shall notify the other in accordance with the provisions hereof.

Consent by Landlord to any assignment or subletting shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>constitute a waiver of the requirement for Landlord\u2019s consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting. The acceptance by Landlord of the payment of rent following any assignment of subletting shall not be deemed to be a consent by Landlord to such assignment or subletting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APu\">Sanchez-Tintenier was principally responsible for the operation of Desbois\u2019s business. She was the sole employee of the store from the outset of Desbois\u2019s tenancy. She managed the store, corresponded with Double H Family\u2019s leasing agent on matters affecting the business, and prepared checks drawn on Desbois\u2019s Riggs banking account for Desbois\u2019s signature (Sanehez-Tintenier never signed checks on behalf of Desbois). Sanchez-Tintenier was single-handedly responsible for the store\u2019s operation because Desbois did not live in the United States. Instead, he lived in France and visited the United States every two or three months for 10 to 14 days at a time. Sanchez-Tintenier was not, however, responsible for the store\u2019s inventory and pricing; that task was left solely to Desbois.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">About a year into Desbois\u2019s five-year Lease with Double H Family, Desbois removed his merchandise from the premises and discontinued his U.S. business. Sanchez-Tintenier took over the premises in July or August 2002, paying Desbois approximately $10,000 to do so. Sanchez-Tintenier recalled that she paid Desbois \u201c$7,500 for the rent and then $2,500 in a security deposit.\u201d Desbois sold Sanchez-Tintenier the business name \u2014 Vieille France Antiques \u2014 for $1.00. SanchezTintenier, however, initially called her business \u201cVieille France and German Antiques,\u201d but soon after September 11, 2001, she changed the name to \u201cOld Europe Antique Manor.\u201d Despite the name change, Sanchez-Tintenier did not replace the sign bearing the name \u201cVieille France Antiques\u201d until September 2003, after the flood in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Sanchez-Tintenier believed \u201cthat both Michael Management <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Double H Family knew that [she] was the tenant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>4124-F Howard Avenue.\u201d Sanchez-Tintenier contends that she told David Dant of Michael Management \u201cthat I am going to take care of the store and to take over the store and that [Desbois] don\u2019t (sic) want anymore.\u201d She further contends that Dant told her \u201c[t]hat it was no problem\u201d and \u201cthat was fine to take it over.\u201d Sanchez-Tintenier understood that she would be subject to the Lease that was signed by Desbois. According to Sanchez-Tintenier, she informed Dant of the transfer and was never told by Michael Management that she needed to contact Double H Family directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">After taking over the space from Desbois in August 2002, Sanchez-Tintenier made monthly rental payments to Michael Management for the next 17 months. She usually wrote the checks on her Riggs bank account, in the name of \u201cOld Europe Antique Manor LLC[;]\u201d although, between five and seven times she paid the rent by certified check or money order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although Michael Management accepted rental payments from Sanchez-Tintenier, it continued to address the rental bills to Desbois.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Storm Damage</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In its complaint, Old Europe contends that in the weeks prior to the February 2003 storm, La Belle Epoque \u201cnegligently and recklessly created a huge pile of debris outside\u201d the building that Old Europe and La Belle Epoque occupied. On behalf of Old Europe, Sanchez-Tintenier also contends that she issued complaints, about the accumulated debris, to Michael Management, Double H Family\u2019s leasing agent; however, Double H Family and La Belle Epoque \u201cfailed to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the debris to be removed\u201d prior to the flood. It is alleged that when Kensington was hit with \u201csubstantial snowfall and rain,\u201d melted snow and surface water accumulated among the debris, entered the building through the second floor and then \u201cpoured into the antiques store.\u201d According to Old Europe, \u201c[t]he area of the property that caused the damage was in the exterior part of the property, where tenant La Belle Epoque had placed garbage and debris\u201d outside its upstairs unit. Sanchez-Tintenier described the water infiltration as a \u201cflood,\u201d where the \u201cwater was going around the walls like Niagara Falls, and the ceiling too.\u201d Water accumulated up to about 20 to 25 centimeters in the store. According to Sanchez-Tintenier, she suffered more than $300,000.00 in damages to her inventory and was \u201cforced ... to close\u201d as a result of the flood. In addition, Sanchez-Tintenier contends that she suffered cardiac problems relating to the stress of dealing with the aftermath of the flood.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Post-Storm Dealings</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">According to Sanchez-Tintenier, after the storm damage in February 2003, Double H Family\u2019s agent \u201ccame on several occasions to inspect the damage from the flood, and met with [Old Europe\u2019s] former attorney, Bill Scanlin, on several occasions.\u201d In April 2003, the agent notified Sanchez-Tintenier that she \u201ccould reenter the premises.\u201d In May 2003, the agent entered the premises to take photos of a ceiling that had collapsed. In June, July, and September of 2003, as well as January and February of 2004, the agent inspected the premises and, according to Sanchez-Tintenier, \u201c[o]n each of the occasions he promised that he would take [care] of the damage and make needed repairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In addition, Sanchez-Tintenier \u201cmet Lou Kressin of Double H Family\u201d at least twice after the flood. In May 2003, Kressin came to the premises and told Sanchez-Tintenier \u201cthat he was [her] landlord and that he was there to meet an insurance agent to file a claim [regarding] the flood.\u201d Sanchez-Tintenier met Kressin again in March 2004 when the Montgomery County Environmental Protection Agency in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>spected the premises after a report of mold infestation. On April 1, 2003, Sanchez-Tintenier and Desbois presented to Double H Family a signed amendment to the original Lease transferring the Lease from Desbois to Sanchez-Tintenier. Double H Family, however, would not consent to the assignment at that time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On May 2, 2005, Old Europe filed, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a complaint against Double H Family and La Belle Epoque. Old Europe alleged that Double H Family was liable for negligence, breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint also alleged that La Belle Epoque was guilty of negligence. Double H Family moved for summary judgment, arguing that Old Europe was not a tenant under the terms of the written Lease, because the Lease was executed between Desbois and Double H Family and did not allow for assignments without the written consent of Double H Family. In addition, Double H Family argued that Old Europe had not alleged or offered evidence to establish that Double H Family had breached its duty to refrain from willful injury or entrapment. La Belle Epoque moved to dismiss the complaint, or, in the alternative, moved for summary judgment, arguing that Old Europe did not allege or offer evidence showing that La Belle Epoque breached its duty under Maryland law; that is, to refrain from willful injury or entrapment of a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On May 16, 2006, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of Double H Family and La Belle Epoque on all counts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">I really don\u2019t see that there\u2019s any facts to support that Ms. Tintenier is a tenant---- She always operated as an agent for the actual tenant, Mr. [Desbois]____I think there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>is a valid statute of frauds issue. I certainly think that if she\u2019s not the tenant, which the [cjourt finds that she wasn\u2019t, she would either be a trespasser or a bare licensee. And certainly, it\u2019s true then the duty would be not anything other than just willful injury. And there is nothing like that alleged here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On May 26, 2006, Sanchez-Tintenier filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On August 30, 2007, the intermediate appellate court issued an unreported opinion vacating the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals held that the Circuit Court correctly concluded that \u201cOld Europe cannot assert the rights of an assignee under the Lease against Double H Family.\u201d Ultimately the court held that the Circuit Court \u201cerred in concluding as a matter of law that there was no tenancy relationship.\u201d The intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">An occupant who is present with the landlord\u2019s knowledge and pays rent may have a common law tenancy giving rise to a suit that is not barred by the statute of frauds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">On this record, Old Europe could establish a month-to-month tenancy under common law, because rent payments were made one month in advance, after Tintenier notified Dant that she was taking over for Desbois, and Dant agreed to that arrangement on behalf of Double H Family. Contrary to Double H Family\u2019s contention, there is ample evidence from which a reasonable person might conclude that Double H Family was aware of Old Europe\u2019s tenancy, accepted it, and therefore \u201cgranted possession\u201d of the premises to Old Europe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Furthermore, the court held that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that Double H Family could not be liable under established negligence principles governing liability to occupiers of land. The intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlY\">As owner of the property, Double H Family occupied and controlled the common area where La Belle Epoque allegedly placed water-collecting and -diverting junk. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>to Kressin, he and his agents were aware before the flood that the common area adjacent to La Belle Epoque\u2019s premises \u201cresembled a junk yard,\u201d and he instructed Dant to have it cleaned up. In the aftermath of the storm, water that was allegedly collected and redirected as a result of the debris infiltrated both La Belle Epoque\u2019s and Old Europe\u2019s premises. In these circumstances, a reasonable person could conclude that Double H Family breached its duty of care to Old Europe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The Court of Special Appeals further held that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of La Belle Epoque. The intermediate appellate court stated: \u201c[T]here is evidence from which a fact finder might conclude that La Belle Epoque\u2019s activities on or around its premises (i.e., storing junk) proximately caused the flood that damaged Old Europe\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFP\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Anderson v. The Gables, </em>404 Md. 560, 948 A.2d 11(2008), we summarized the standards applicable to our review of the grant of a motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOr\">In considering a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, this Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Bednar v.

Essentially, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we examine \u201cthe same information from the record and determine the same issues of law as the trial court.\u201d <em>Miller v. Bay City, </em>393 Md. 620, 632, 903 A.2d 938, 945 (2006). We only look to the evidence submitted in opposition and support of the motion for summary judgment in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motion. <em>Miller, </em>393 Md. 620, 903 A.2d 938; <em>Livesay v. Baltimore, </em>384 Md. 1, 10, 862 A.2d 33, 38 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Breach of Contract and the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair-Dealing</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Old Europe contends that Double H Family breached the original Lease between Double H Family and Desbois (purportedly transferred to Old Europe) and violated the covenant of good faith and fair-dealing by failing to provide a rental space fit for ordinary use. Old Europe posits that it is a valid assignee of the Lease and that Double H Family waived its ability to contest the assignment to Old Europe when it accepted Old Europe\u2019s rent with knowledge of Old Europe\u2019s presence on the premises. To establish that Double H Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>knew of and consented to a landlord-tenant relationship, Old Europe points to the change in the signage on the building,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> its payment of seventeen consecutive months of rent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the timely response by Double H Family\u2019s agent in making repairs to the shop during the alleged assignment period. Old Europe also contends that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in its conclusion that it was a commercial tenant at common law. Further, Old Europe argues that it was a periodic tenant of Double H Family based upon its entry onto the premises and subsequent payment of rent. In that regard, Old Europe relies primarily on <em>Annapolis Fire v. Rich, </em>239 Md. 573, 212 A.2d 249 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Double H Family contends, however, that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding erroneously creates a \u201ccommercial tenancy\u201d at common law. Specifically, it argues that \u201cthe payment of rent by a non-tenant is insufficient to create a new \u2018commercial tenancy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in favor of the entity making the payment.\u201d Double H Family posits that Old Europe was never a tenant because Double H Family, as landlord, never granted Old Europe the right of possession. In this regard, Double H Family argues that the attempted assignment of the leasehold from Desbois to Old Europe was invalid because Desbois provided no written notice of the assignment to Double H Family as required by the written Lease; and, moreover, prior to the flood, Desbois failed to provide any notice of the assignment whatsoever (verbal or written).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In addition, Double H Family contends that an employee\u2019s continued presence at a place of employment and payment of rent is insufficient to create a \u201ccommercial tenancy\u201d by operation of Maryland law. Double H Family specifically points out that this case is distinguishable from <em>Annapolis Fire </em>because in that case, \u201cthe tenant clearly and unambiguously gave verbal or written notice that an assignment occurred, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>landlord consented to the change in the lease\u2019s terms.\u201d Pertinent to this contention, Double H Family argues that the only verbal or written notice of intent it received from SanchezTintenier was when she stated \u201c[I am] going to take care of the store\u201d and that this statement is ambiguous and implies \u201ca future action\u201d or \u201cone that has not come to fruition yet.\u201d Moreover, Double H Family asserts that under Maryland law, a landlord must have clear notice of and consent to its involvement in a \u201ccommercial tenancy\u201d and that holding otherwise will create ambiguity and inconsistency in landlord/tenant relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In essence we are asked to determine, for purposes of our review of a grant of summary judgment, whether on the record before us, Old Europe held a legally cognizable property interest in the premises known as 4124-F Howard Avenue at the time of the flood. First, we must determine whether Desbois made a valid assignment of the original Lease to Sanehez-Tintenier. This requires us to determine if the alleged assignment is enforceable in accordance with the written Lease between Double H Family and Desbois and in accordance with the Maryland Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A lessee may transfer his or her interest in a lease agreement by assignment. <em>Italian Fisherman v. Middlemas, </em>313 Md. 156, 163, 545 A.2d 1, 4 (1988). When a lease is assigned, an assignee \u201csteps into the lessee\u2019s shoes and acquires all the lessee\u2019s rights in the lease.\u201d <em>Italian Fisherman, </em>313 Md. at 163, 545 A.2d at 4. Privity of estate ends between the lessor and lessee and is created between the lessor and the assignee. <em>Italian Fisherman, </em>313 Md. at 163, 545 A.2d at 4. Contractual rights are assigned when the assignor manifests the intent to make the assignment. <em>See Central Collection v. Columbia Medical, </em>300 Md. 318, 331, 478 A.2d 303, 309 (1984) (\u201cIn determining the validity of [the] assignment we look to the intent of the parties.\u201d); <em>accord </em>E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, <em>Assignment and Delegation, </em>\u00a7 11.3 at 69 (3rd ed. 2004) (\u201cWhether the owner of a right has manifested an intention to transfer it is a question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>contract interpretation to be answered from all the circumstances, including words and other conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">For an assignment of a leasehold interest to be enforceable, however, it must comply with provisions found within the original lease agreement and applicable statutory law. <em>See Julian v. Christopher, </em>320 Md. 1, 7, 575 A.2d 735, 737 (1990) (\u201cContractual restrictions on alienability of leasehold interests are permitted.\u201d); <em>See also Lamm v. Port Deposit Homestead Association, </em>49 Md. 233, 240 (1878) (explaining that the Statute of Frauds applies to contracts for the sale of land and in any interest in or concerning them). In pertinent part, the Lease between Desbois and Double H Family stated: \u201cTenant will not assign this Lease, in whole or in part, or sublet all or any part of the Premises, without first obtaining the Landlord\u2019s written consent... .The acceptance by Landlord of the payment of rent following any assignment or subletting shall not be deemed to be a consent by the Landlord to such assignment or subletting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On this record, there is no evidence of any writing purporting to assign Desbois\u2019s leasehold interest prior to the flood. There is also no evidence that Desbois notified Double H Family verbally or in writing of his intent to assign his leasehold interest to Sanchez-Tintenier. There is, however, evidence that Sanchez-Tintenier, who often interacted with Double H Family on Desbois\u2019s behalf, notified Double H Family\u2019s agent, Michael Management, Inc., that she was \u201ctaking over\u201d the premises and that Desbois no longer wanted the store. During this conversation, David Dant indicated to Sanchez-Tintenier that it would be \u201cno problem\u201d and \u201cfine\u201d for her to takeover. The record further indicates that Double H Family accepted rent payments from Sanchez-Tintenier (rather than Desbois) for several months after this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We hold that the record before us presents genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Double H Family waived its ability to contest the validity of the assignment from Desbois to Sanchez-Tintenier under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Lease and whether Double H Family is estopped from arguing the assignment is non-enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A party waives a contractual right by intentionally relinquishing the right or engaging in conduct that warrants the inference that the right has been relinquished. <em>Food Fair v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, 531, 200 A.2d 166, 172 (1964). Whether a waiver has taken place is generally an issue of intent, which is determined by the factual circumstances of each case. <em>See Chertkof v. Southland Corp., </em>280 Md. 1, 6, 371 A.2d 124, 127 (1977) (\u201cWe have, in common with many other courts, treated waiver of a breach by the acceptance of rent as a matter of intent, which necessarily turns on the factual circumstances of each case.\u201d); <em>Chas. J. Frank, Inc. v. Assoc. Jewish Ch., </em>294 Md. 443, 449, 450 A.2d 1304, 1306-07 (1982). Generally under Maryland law, when a lessor accepts rent from a new entity with knowledge that the lease has been assigned to that entity, the lessor waives the ability to contest the assignment under a lease covenant that provides the lease may not be assigned without the lessor\u2019s written consent. <em>See Chertkof, </em>280 Md. 1, 371 A.2d 124 (Landlord\u2019s acceptance of rent from assignee for two years, along with repeated negotiations to renew lease, constitutes waiver of the breach of covenant prohibiting the assignment of the lease without consent); <em>See also </em>Richard Powell, Powell on Real Property, \u00a7 17.04(2)(a) at 17-50 (Michael A. Wolf ed. 2000) (\u201cAlthough the mere acceptance of rent after a prohibited assignment will not normally be considered a waiver, continued acceptance of rent coupled with knowledge of the assignment generally is construed as a waiver.\u201d); <em>accord Sarete, Inc. v. 1344 U St. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>871 A.2d 480 (D.C.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On this record, a trier of fact could also find that an assignment occurred by operation of law and that Double H Family is estopped from contesting its validity pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Real Property Article \u00a7 5-103. According to \u00a7 5-103: \u201cNo corporeal estate, leasehold or freehold, or incorporeal interest in land may be assigned, granted, or surrendered, unless it is in writing signed by the party assigning, granting, or surrendering it, or his agent authorized lawfully by writing, or by act and operation of law.\u201d An assignment that occurs by act and operation of law escapes the purview of \u00a7 5-103\u2019s writing requirement. <em>See Prevas v. Gottlieb, </em>229 Md. 188, 193-194, 182 A.2d 489, 492-93 (1962) (illustrating that \u201cact and operation of law\u201d does not involve a writing, but refers to conduct a party engages in that may not be denied because of the principal of estoppel). A leasehold interest in land is assigned, granted, or surrendered by operation of law when the parties form the common intent for the assignment, grant, or surrender to take place and then engage in acts that are \u201ctantamount to a stipulation\u201d to effectuate the assignment. <em>See Eidelman v. Walker &amp; Dunlop, </em>265 Md. 538, 544, 290 A.2d 780, 784 (1972) (explaining how a surrender occurs by operation of law under \u00a7 5-103); <em>See also Prevas, </em>229 Md. at 193-194, 182 A.2d at 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We conclude, on the basis of the record before us, that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the attempt to assign the leasehold estate to Old Europe was a departure from the terms of the written Lease and constituted a transfer within the Statute of Frauds. Notwithstanding the terms of the Lease and the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, the trier of fact could find that Double H Family waived both the requirements of the Lease and the Statute of Frauds. As a result of these findings, the trier of fact could conclude that Old Europe stands in the shoes of the original tenant, Debois, pursuant to the original Lease. Thus, based upon a determination that the leasehold was transferred by operation of law, the trier of fact could then decide the merits of Old Europe\u2019s breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealings claims. Accordingly, we disagree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the Circuit Court correctly determined that Old Europe, as a matter of law, cannot assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the rights of an assignee under the Lease entered into between Double H Family and Desbois.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Assuming there was no assignment by operation of law, Old Europe posits that its possession of the leased premises and payment of rent to Double H Family created a tenancy at common law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Old Europe cites <em>Annapolis Fire </em>to support this position. In <em>Annapolis Fire, </em>General and Excess Underwriters, Inc., the original tenant under a written lease, notified the landlord that two other entities would begin leasing the premises along with it. 239 Md. at 578, 212 A.2d at 252. The landlord expressly agreed to this arrangement and confirmed that agreement in writing. <em>Annapolis Fire, </em>239 Md. at 578-79, 212 A.2d at 252. This Court concluded that the parties\u2019 oral agreement to add the two new tenants constituted a surrender of the original lease between the original parties and the creation of a new agreement between the landlord and all three tenants. <em>Annapolis Fire, </em>239 Md. at 585, 212 A.2d at 255. When the oral tenancy expired and the two newer tenants stayed on, we held they had a common law periodic tenancy, reasoning that such a tenancy is implied when one is both in possession of the premises by grant of the owner and pays rent to the owner. <em>Annapolis Fire, </em>239 Md. at 582, 585, 212 A.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Here, in order to determine if Old Europe established a common law tenancy (or \u201ccommercial tenancy\u201d) in the premises at 4124-F Howard Avenue, it is first necessary to determine whether Desbois surrendered his existing leasehold interest in the premises. Surrenders, like assignments, are subject to \u00a7 5-103 and can arise by act and operation of law. For this to occur, both parties to the original lease agreement must evidence the common intent to relinquish their legal relationship and take actions that clearly evidence that intent. <em>Eidelman, </em>265 Md. at 543-44, 290 A.2d at 783-84; <em>Prevas, </em>229 Md. at 193, 182 A.2d at 492; <em>accord Beall v. White, </em>94 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>382, 389, 24 L.Ed. 173 (1876) (A surrender occurs by operation of law \u201cwhen the parties without express surrender do some act which implies that they have both agreed to consider the surrender as made.\u201d). Determinations of whether a surrender has occurred are made on a case by case basis and are generally a matter for the trier of fact. <em>See Eidelman, </em>265 Md. at 543, 290 A.2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">A surrender of the original leasehold interest occurred in <em>Annwpolis Fire </em>when the original tenant expressly indicated to the landlord that the tenant wished to share his leasehold interest in the premises with two other tenants, the landlord clearly agreed to this arrangement (verbally and in writing), and the parties engaged in conduct consistent with this agreement. It was only after the surrender of the original lease that the new lease between the three entities, and later the periodic tenancy, came into existence. The record before us, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, presents genuine issues of material fact as to whether Desbois and Double H Family surrendered their lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Intent is a key inquiry in this case. The trier of fact must determine whether Double H Family and Desbois intended to surrender the Lease and/or whether Double H Family intended to accept Old Europe as an assignee under the Lease, and whether Double H Family, by its actions, waived the requirements of the Lease and Statute of Frauds.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the trier of fact determines that Desbois and Double H Family surrendered the Lease agreement, then the inquiry properly turns to whether Old Europe acquired a common law tenancy in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Negligence Counts Against Double H Family and La Belle Epoque</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Double H Family and La Belle Epoque contend that because Old Europe was not an authorized tenant of 4124-F <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Howard Avenue, it may only be considered a trespasser or a bare licensee to whom a minimum duty, i.e., the duty to avoid willful injury or entrapment, was owed. Additionally, Double H Family posits that it owed no duty to maintain the common areas under the Lease agreement because the Lease specifically designated this responsibility to the tenant. It further states that even if it did reserve control over the common areas in the Lease agreement, it exercised the reasonable care and diligence required of it to maintain such areas. Old Europe argues that it had a lawful tenancy in the premises and was owed, at the minimum, a duty of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Upon review of the record, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that Old Europe was a bare licensee or a trespasser as to the negligence counts against Double H Family and La Belle Epoque. We have determined that a genuine dispute of material fact exists concerning Old Europe\u2019s status as an assignee under the Lease and whether the Lease between Desbois and Double H Family was surrendered. If a trier of fact finds that Old Europe had a valid leasehold interest, then the trier of fact must also determine if Double H Family breached duties owed to Old Europe by virtue of Maryland law and/or the Lease agreement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>If we assume <em>arguendo </em>that Old Europe acquired a leasehold interest and that the alley involved in this case is a common area, it is well established, under Maryland law, that a landlord ordinarily has control over the common areas, and has a duty to avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others caused by activities conducted within the common areas. <em>See Langley Park Apts. v. Lund, Adm\u2019r, </em>234 Md. 402, 407, 199 A.2d 620, 623 (1964) (\u201c[W]here a landlord leases separate portions of his property to different tenants and reserves under his control the passageways and stairways, and other parts of the property for the common use of all the tenants he must exercise ordinary care and diligence to maintain the retained portions in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d); <em>See also Matthews v. Amberwood, </em>351 Md. 544, 557-58, 719 A.2d 119, 125 (1998) (A landlord may be held liable for neglecting to remedy defects or dangers in an area that the landlord controls.). Moreover, Maryland law provides that a landlord may not include exculpatory clauses within leases that exempt the landlord from liability for harm that occurs in areas that the landlord controls. Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 8-105 of the Real Property Article; <em>See also Prince Philip Partnership v. Cutlip, </em>321 Md. 296, 304, 582 A.2d 992, 995 (1990); <em>Adloo v. H.T. Brown, </em>344 Md. 254, 259, 686 A.2d 298, 301 n. 4 (1996). Accordingly, upon the record before us, if a reasonable trier of fact finds that Double H Family maintained control of the alley at issue in this case, the trier of fact could also conclude that Double H Family breached its duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As to La Belle Epoque, it would be liable for its own negligence for injury caused to others resulting from the placement of debris in the alley, whether or not the alley is considered a common area. <em>See Frenkil v. Johnson, </em>175 Md. 592, 599, 3 A.2d 479, 482 (1939) (\u201c[0]ne must use their own rights and property so as to do no injury to those of others.\u201d); <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. 58, 76, 642 A.2d 180, 189 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>(\u201c[T]he occupier of land owes a duty to occupants of neighboring land to use care when conducting activities on the land so as to avoid harm to the neighboring land.\u201d). When a person elects to do or keep something on his or her property that exposes neighboring property to danger, that person has a duty to make the condition reasonably safe. <em>Toy v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., </em>176 Md. 197, 213, 4 A.2d 757, 765 (1939). A person who negligently fails to make the condition reasonably safe can be liable for harm that the condition causes to neighboring premises. <em>See Toy, </em>176 Md. at 213, 4 A.2d at 765; <em>See also Frenkil, </em>175 Md. at 600, 3 A.2d at 482. We hold that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the pile of trash and debris that La Belle Epoque allegedly allowed to accumulate in the alley constituted a dangerous condition on the premises and that La Belle Epoque failed to remove the debris or protect others from that condition. Therefore, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether La Belle Epoque negligently caused injury to Old Europe. As such, we shall remand this matter to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">HARRELL, J. and RAKER, J. join judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\">.

If Old Europe acquired no leasehold interest, then Desbois remained the tenant of the premises at all times and as leaseholder, was entitled to invite others to enter and occupy the leased premises. The facts before us establish that Old Europe was present on the premises at 4124-F Howard Avenue at Desbois's invitation and with his consent. A trial court\u2019s determination of an individual\u2019s status on the subject premises, at the time of the injury, is not necessarily affected by the consent (or lack thereof) of the landlord if the tenant consented to the individual\u2019s presence. <em>See </em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts \u00a7 63, at 434 (W.
