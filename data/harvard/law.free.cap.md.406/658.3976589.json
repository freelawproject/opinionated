Specific events, however, may occur during a three year cycle that may result in a \u201cmid-cycle\u201d revaluation of the property, although they are limited by Section 8-104(c) to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">(i) the zoning classification is changed at the initiative of the owner or anyone having an interest in the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">(ii) a change in use or character occurs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">(iii) substantially completed improvements are made which add at least $50,000 in value to the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(iv) an error in calculation or measurement of the real property caused the value to be erroneous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">(v) a residential use assessment is terminated pursuant to \u00a7 8-226 of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">(vi) a subdivision occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">The mid-cycle revaluation affects the value of the real property as of the original date of finality under 8-104(c)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">In the case at bar, a mid-cycle revaluation was prompted by a sale of the property rather than any of the six statutory factors and so, we are presented with the question raised on certiorari by the Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">When the value of the subject property has increased by more than $50,000 because of substantially completed renovations in the previous calendar year, and this increase in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>value is not captured in the existing assessment, is the \u00a7 8-104(c) mandate to revalue the property at a new, correct value negated when the Supervisor\u2019s review of the property was prompted by a recent sale or the assessor had some knowledge of the renovations at the time of the last triennial assessment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In this case, the purchasers of Georgian Towers,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stellar GT (\u201cStellar\u201d), appealed a mid-cycle reassessment of the apartment building from $52,561,600 to $88,865,500, which would have resulted in a substantial tax increase. Stellar first appealed to the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board, which ultimately affirmed, and then to the Maryland Tax Court. The Tax Court held a hearing on May 10, 2006, during which Thomas Borger, the President of Borger Management, the property and construction manager of Georgian Towers since 1988, testified that nearly 13 million dollars in renovations to the building took place between 1999 and 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Borger also testified that in October of 2003 he met with David M. Gantz, an assessor of commercial property with the Montgomery County Office of the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, who valued Georgian Towers in anticipation of the 2004 assessment notice, and tendered<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a completed Income Questionnaire and a Construction Summary. The Income Questionnaire included income from rents, parking and retail stores as well as expenses from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002; there was no information provided for 2003. The Construction Summary listed all renova<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tions, including enhancements and deferred maintenance costs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Borger further stated that Gantz had not \u201clooked at the property in any detail\u201d; in fact, the parties stipulated that \u201cDavid M. Gantz also states that he did not inspect the subject property after the renovation information ... was presented to him by Thomas Borger in October of 2003.\u201d Borger testified that he had no further contact with the Assessment Office after he received the Notice of Assessment for $52,561,600 dated December 30, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In March of 2004, Borger testified, the property was sold to Stellar, the current owner of the property for approximately $89,000,000. Although Borger did not know of any change in the building\u2019s assessment until late in July 2004, the record does reflect that within three months of the sale, and only six months after the date of finality, on June 1, 2004, the Montgomery County Office of the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation sent a Notice of Assessment to Stellar to inform the company that Georgian Towers had been revalued from $52,561,600 to $88,865,500, an increase of $36,303,900. The Notice stated that \u201cState law provides that in any year of a 3 year cycle, real property shall be revalued when certain factors cause a change in value. This is to notify you that the value of your property has been changed due to new construction for the full year.\u201d The Notice provided that the new phased-in market values, \u201cfor the next three taxable years,\u201d were as follows: $79,875,033 for 2004; $84,370,266 for 2005; and $88,865,500 for 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Daniel Ercolani, the Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County Office of the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation at the time of the hearing, also testified, explaining that in the reassessment cycle, the actual work year for January 1, 2004 assessments was from January of 2003 to December of 2003 during which time \u201cAssessors are going to be reviewing the permits, sending their Income Question<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>naires to the owners, receiving the Income questionnaires, doing market studies of rents and cap rates and such.\u201d He further testified that in the instant case, Gantz used the income approach for the assessment of Georgian Towers, reflecting that he \u201ctook the number of units, the type of units, he put what he assumed were the accurate rents for each type of unit, he deducted a vacancy and expense, he capitalized it by a cap rate of 10.46, and that resulted in a valuation of [$52,561,600].\u201d Ercolani also described the process of revaluing new construction and renovated properties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">[I]n Montgomery County we have quarterly pickups. We are notified through the Montgomery County Permit Office of either additions or new construction. The permits are given to the Assessors in those areas. The Assessors make physical reviews of the properties, they determine what the values of what the new construction, what those values are, and notices are sent on a quarterly basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Ercolani acknowledged that he was statutorily prohibited from changing an assessment before the end of the three year cycle if the change was based upon a sale. Ercolani also acknowledged that the Montgomery County Permit Office notifies his office of additions and new construction on a quarterly basis and that he relied on that information to determine if a renovation had occurred that could have increased the value of a property by more than $50,000. According to him, were such a renovation to occur, the sales price of a building could then have been used to determine its value. Ercolani testified further that it was not until the March 2004 sale of Georgian Towers for approximately 89 million dollars that he realized that, \u201cwe had missed the valuation by such a large margin\u201d and \u201casked the Assessors to go back out and to take another look to see if we had missed something.\u201d He related that two assessors, other than Gantz, then looked to whether any permits were on file and, after pulling the permits, a physical review of the building was conducted, both of which confirmed \u201cthat there had been [$50,000] spent in 2008.\u201d According to Ercolani, the building was then revalued based upon the sale price of $89,000,000 without taking into account the cost of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>renovations, relating further that \u201c[t]he sale triggered it to come to my attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">At the close of the evidence presented, the Maryland Tax Court, determined that the $88,865,500 reassessment was appropriate. The Tax Court\u2019s oral opinion<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provided both findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">The property has been the subject of a renovation of at least Twelve to Thirteen Million Dollars since January 1 \u2014 actually, since 1999____[A]s of the beginning of '03, much of the renovation, although much of it was completed, there was a renovation of the East Lobby was \u2014 based on the documentary evidence as well as the testimony \u2014 was going to cost approximately Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars. And that apparently was performed predominantly in the calendar year 2003, although some may have been performed in '04, but that\u2019s not really consequential to the decision in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">There is no dispute that the renovation of this particular property, the subject property, added at least Fifty Thousand Dollars in the value in the calendar year 2003. If there was a dispute, that\u2019s my finding as a matter of fact, that based upon the evidence that I\u2019ve heard, that the renovation did, in fact, increase the value of the property at least Fifty Thousand Dollars during 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">Now, in this particular case, there were some discussions between the Agent for the property owner, as well as Mr. Gantz \u2014 well known to the Court \u2014 an Assessor with Montgomery County for many, many years. And there were some discussions, there was some information passed on between the two regarding the renovations. But I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t think that that has a particular impact on what the law is in this particular case. Mr. Gantz was trying to do his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>job, and, as far as I could see, the Petitioner was trying to assist Mr. Gantz in doing his job. But Mr. Gantz, after reviewing the information, increased the value from, I think, Forty Million to approximately Fifty-two Million. But that is not what caused the real issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">What happened was, in March of '04, the property sold for approximately Eighty-nine Million Dollars, and that required the Supervisor and others with the Department of Assessments in Montgomery County to take a hard look to find out what happened, which, I think, is the right way to handle something like that. If you have a Fifty-two Million Dollar assessment as of January 1, '04, and the property sells for Eighty-nine Million, if I was in charge of the Department, I\u2019d be asking some questions too. So I think that was an appropriate response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">And, after looking at it, it was very obvious that there had been over Fifty Thousand Dollars in renovation or increased value due to substantial renovations, which occurred over this time period. Well, there\u2019s little question that prior to '03 \u2014 in '03 there were at least Fifty Thousand that increased the value at least Fifty-two Thousand and Fifty Thousand Dollars. And the reason that\u2019s important is based on the Code, Section 8 \u2014 104(c): In any year of a three year cycle \u2014 I\u2019m reading from the Code \u2014 a revaluation is required and, in fact, real property shall be revalued \u2014 key word, revalued \u2014 if any of the factors listed below cause a change in the value of the real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">Of course, the pertinent section here is (c)(iii) where it states that substantially completed improvements are made, which add at least Fifty Thousand Dollars in value to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">Under 8-104, the Department of Assessments, from my standpoint or of my interpretation of the statute, is mandated to do a mid-cycle review under this particular circumstance. And, as [the attorney for the Supervisor] has pointed out, I think it is a trigger. It is not a trigger just to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>add the value of the improvements, it\u2019s a trigger to revalue the improvements. To merely add the value of the improvements would require the Assessor only to consider one of the approaches and not all three of the approaches because to do otherwise would basically minimize the market approach, as well as the income approach. And from my standpoint, it would seem reasonable that the sale in March of '04 had to be considered because that revaluation under 8-401[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] requires that you have a different date of finality. You have a semi-annual date of finality, which would have been, I believe, July 1st, which means that everything \u2014 any new evidence which occurred prior to that date had to be considered by the Assessor in making their determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEL\">In essence, then, the Tax Court concluded that revaluation was permissible, regardless of what actually precipitated it, as long as one of the statutory bases for revaluation existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Stellar sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, where the decision of the Tax Court was affirmed, and appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed. In a reported opinion, Judge Raymond G. Thieme, Jr., writing for the intermediate appellate court, held that the facts presented to the Tax Court \u201cdo not support the legal conclusions reached by the court,\u201d because \u201cthe Supervisor used the sale price of the property as a retroactive justification for a reassessment,\u201d and the sales price did \u201cnot fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the statutory scheme,\u201d providing for reassessments every three years. <em>Stellar GT v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>178 Md.App. 624, 636, 943 A.2d 100, 107 (2008). He also noted that reliance on the three sources of data typically precipitating a revaluation based on substantially completed improvements, including a review of available building permits, a visual inspection by assessors or a review of owner submitted documents, was not supported by the record \u2014 the reassessment had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>based upon any data other than sales price. <em>Id. </em>at 634, 943 A.2d at 106. We granted certiorari, 405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008), and shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">When reviewing an administrative decision from the Maryland Tax Court, we generally review that decision directly, not the decision of the circuit court on judicial review. <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Science Applications Intern. Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 192, 950 A.2d 766, 770 (2008). The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed unless that decision is not supported by substantial evidence appearing in the record or is erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 535, 890 A.2d 279, 283 (2006); <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Consol. Coal Sales Co., </em>382 Md. 439, 454, 855 A.2d 1197, 1206 (2004). We have previously noted that \u201cthe interpretation of the tax law can be a mixed question of fact and law, the resolution of which requires agency expertise.\u201d <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Citicorp Intern. Communications, Inc., </em>389 Md. 156, 164, 884 A.2d 112, 116 (2005). The Tax Court\u2019s decision, however, will be overturned if it was based on an error of law. <em>Consol. Coal Sales Co., </em>382 Md. at 454, 855 A.2d at 1206, citing <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Hartge Yacht Yard, Inc., </em>379 Md. 452, 461, 842 A.2d 732, 737 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The issue of whether the mid-cycle revaluation in the case at bar was proper under Section 8-104(c) is a question of statutory interpretation. In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, 402 </em>Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007) . We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006). If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the language is not clear when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The Supervisor argues that, upon learning of substantially completed improvements adding value to property, which have not been captured in an existing assessment, he must revalue the property, regardless of how he acquired that knowledge; he contends that Section 8-104 does not restrict the use of information concerning an increase in value even if the source of information differs from what is asserted to be the basis of the revaluation. The Supervisor also proffers that when there has been substantial completion of improvements that add $50,000 in value to a property, Section 8-401(f)(4) permits a revaluation during the next calendar year. Stellar, conversely, asserts that the Court of Special Appeals holding should be affirmed, because a sale after the date of finality is not one of the circumstances permitting revaluation under Section 8-104, whether or not one of the specified factors that could initiate the revaluation was uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Section 8-104 provides that \u201conce in every 8-year cycle\u201d real property should be valued to establish its value as of a date of finality, after which the value is phased in over the three year cycle; property may be revalued as of the date of finality if one of six factors, including \u201csubstantially completed improvements,\u201d <em>\u201ccauses </em>a change in the value of the property.\u201d (emphasis added). The word \u201ccause\u201d is unambiguous and dictates the result in this case. \u201cCause\u201d is defined by Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary as \u201ca reason for an action or condition\u201d and \u201csomething that brings about an effect or result.\u201d 196 (11th ed.2005). <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 235 (8th ed.2004) (defining cause as \u201c[t]o bring about or effect\u201d). The basis for the revaluation clearly was the sales price, rather than a review of the premises, the documents available from the permit office or the documents submitted by the owner. The reassessment was mired in Ercolini\u2019s admissions in testimony that \u201cthe major guide in arriving at [the $88,865,500] figure was the sales price\u201d and that he \u201cdid not take [the renovation costs] into account\u201d in revaluing the property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As noted by the Court of Special Appeals, Ercolini testified that he was not prompted to initiate the action of revaluation by the issuance of building permits, any review of the premises or documents submitted by the owner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">As to the first method, it was not until <em>after </em>Ercolani had decided that the sale price indicated that the regular assessment must have been erroneous that he asked to see the relevant building permits. As to the second, the assessor, Gantz, did not conduct a visual inspection of the renovation work. As to the third, the documents submitted to Gantz for his use in preparing the regularly scheduled assessment showed the work being performed on the lobby and listed its value as $ 425,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>Stellar GT, </em>178 Md.App. at 634, 943 A.2d at 106. (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Our conclusion that one of the factors specifically enumerated in Section 8-104(c) must bring about the revaluation and the change in value is supported by <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City v. Chase Associates, </em>306 Md. 568, 571, 510 A.2d 568, 569 (1986). In <em>Chase Associates, </em>we recognized that \u201cthe legislature chose not to provide generally that any change in value would precipitate mid-cycle reassessment, but rather to link reassessment to the occurrence of certain specified events ... likely to presage a change in value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 510 A.2d at 572. In that case we denied the validity of a mid-cycle reassessment of a high-rise apartment building when the revaluation was instituted \u201csolely in response to the establishment of a condominium regime on the property,\u201d just over 10 months after the date of finality. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 510 A.2d at 569. The Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City had \u201cissued new, individual Notices of Assessment for each of the 246 condominium units,\u201d which reflected a value for each unit, causing the value of the building to increase from $3,603,700 to $14,175,350 when the aggregate value of each condominium was considered. <em>Id. </em>We first noted that Section 232(8)(d), the precursor to current Section 8-104, provided for revaluation only in limited circumstances including when \u201ca substantial change occurs in the use of the property\u201d and that Section 19(a)(1) provided that \u201cland may be reassessed whenever it has been subdivided or the character or use is changed after the date of finality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 510 A.2d at 569. In evaluating whether either of the statutory provisions allowed for a mid-cycle revaluation based on the conversion of the building to condominium units, we summarized the purpose of mid-cycle revaluations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">The purpose underlying the mid-cycle reassessment procedure of \u00a7 232(8)(d) was clearly to improve the accuracy with which a property\u2019s assessed value reflects its current value throughout a triennial cycle. In implementing this purpose, however, <em>the legislature chose not to provide generally that any change in value would precipitate mid-cycle reassess</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>ment, but rather to link reassessment to the occurrence of certain specified events, including a substantial change in use, likely to presage a change in value. </em>The legislature\u2019s reasons for drafting the statute in this manner may well have included lessening the tremendous administrative burden the more general provision would have created, and increasing the predictability and consistency with which the reassessment process would be invoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 577, 510 A.2d at 572. (emphasis added). We concluded that the filing of a condominium declaration was not a \u201csubdivision\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We reflected that were we to consider the conversion of the building to condominium units as a \u201cchange in use,\u201d we would, \u201cdisregard the legislature\u2019s deliberate choice of a specific rather than a general drafting style.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further noted that, \u201c[although a change in use may occasion or coincide with a change in value, the concepts are entirely distinct, and the Tax Court erred in equating them for purposes of \u00a7 232(8)(d)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578-79, 510 A.2d at 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In <em>Chase Associates, </em>306 Md. at 577, 510 A.2d at 572, we equated \u201ccause\u201d in the statute with \u201clinkage,\u201d rather than \u201ctrigger\u201d as the Tax Court opined in the present case. Linking reassessment to the occurrence of certain specified events, as defining causation, differs from the Supervisor\u2019s and the Tax Court\u2019s concept of causation; both would obviate any direct linkage between the change in value and its cause and rely only on the proffered existence of one of the statutory factors, even if the revaluation was not based upon that statutory factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The Supervisor must assert that linkage exists between substantially completed improvements and the new value in the present case, because we have heretofore held that a sale cannot be linked to a mid-cycle revaluation. <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors, Inc. v. Montgomery County, 287 </em>Md. 101, 103, 411 A.2d 97, 98 (1980). In <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors, </em>the County Council enacted a ordinance entitled \u201cReal Property Tax Recapture,\u201d which im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>posed \u201cupon the transfer of real property located in Montgomery County a tax on the amount by which the taxable value of such property on the date of recognition[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] exceeds the assessed valuation of that property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We determined that Montgomery County\u2019s attempt to \u201creassess and tax real property after the date of finality\u201d was in direct conflict with the statutory provisions relating to the date of finality,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> concluding that \u201cits effect is to move forward the date of finality as to sales made after that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109-110, 411 A.2d at 101-02. We emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">On the basis of an actual sale subsequent to the date of finality the County seeks to second guess the State\u2019s expert appraisers in the office of the Montgomery County Supervisor of Assessments and thus to make a retroactive reassessment. As a matter of fact, a sale during the year at a price in excess of the value placed on the property at the time of assessment does not necessarily indicate erroneous valuation. First of all, we have commented on several occasions that valuation of land is not an exact science and that experts will often differ as to their opinion of fair market value. Secondly, although assessments are as of the date of finality, the valuation upon which the assessment is based is necessarily made some time in advance of that date. A number of factors could occur even between the date of finality and the date of ultimate sale which would alter property values. An example of a reverse change in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>values is the current report in the public press that real estate values have dropped substantially in recent months as a result of high mortgage interest rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 110, 411 A.2d at 102. (citations omitted). Therefore, to avoid the epithet of retroactive reassessment, a revaluation must not be linked to a sale, but to one of the statutory factors, which admittedly did not cause the revaluation in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Supervisor attempts to distinguish <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors, </em>asserting that we were concerned in that case with not only the retroactive reassessment but also the fact that the effect was to \u201cimpose a property tax in past years on the value that was in excess of the assessment in the previous year.\u201d He proffers that in the present case, however, \u201cthe property\u2019s valuation has been brought to its current value based upon the triggering event, but it will only be taxed upon that value on a prospective basis.\u201d He further specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">In this case, a notice of an increase in value was issued in June 2004, which was within the calendar year after the completion of the renovations that caused the $50,000 increase in value. <em>That notice reflected a new value as of the original date of finality, January 1, 2004, </em>of $88,865,600, which was phased in for the tax year commencing on July 1, 2004 with a taxable assessment of $79,875,033.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">(Emphasis added). The Supervisor errs in his distinction, however, because in this case and in <em>Montgomery County Board of Realtors, </em>we were concerned primarily with the retroactive effect of the increase in value of the properties as of the date of finality, rather than when the newly computed tax would be imposed. When the tax is imposed, therefore, is not before us. The retroactive nature of an assessment caused by a factor not set forth in Section 8-104 is the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The Supervisor, however, asserts that Section 8-401 enables him to revalue the property during the next calendar year, or in this case during 2004, no matter what precipitated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the revaluation.

or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">(6) the assessment has been decreased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Section 8-401, thus, pertains to the \u201c[e]ffect of failure to send notice\u201d within 30 days of the date of finality or other pertinent date and \u201ccreates an irrebuttable presumption that ... the prior value has not changed\u201d absent certain factors, including when \u201cextensive improvements have been made on the property during the previous calendar year as provided in \u00a7 8-104(c)(1)(iii) of this title.\u201d Therefore, unlike what the Supervisor asserts, Section 8-401 is dependent on Section 8-104 for the permissible factors for reassessment and does not enable revaluation for any factor other than those statutorily specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Because we conclude that the revaluation of Georgian Towers for $88,865,500 was \u201ccaused\u201d by its sale for $89,000,000, amounting to a retroactive reassessment, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
