Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), has been beneficial and well-applied for the most part over the ensuing years. The synthesis of earlier cases threaded through its reasoning supplies a lucid explanation of the legislative calculus for why some land uses, at the time of original adoption or later amendment of the text of a zoning ordinance, are placed in the blessed category of permitted uses in a zone or zones while other uses in the same zone or zones receive a more measured imprimatur of presumptive compatibility as allowed only with the grant of a special exception or conditional use. <em>Schultz </em>also iterated how special exception uses are useful zoning tools for fleshing out the grand design of land use planning, as well as postulated an analytical paradigm for how individual special exception applications are to be evaluated. In carrying-out the latter goal, however, some of the language of Judge Davidson\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Schultz </em>occasionally has been mis-perceived by subsequent appellate courts and frequently misunderstood by some attorneys, planners, governmental authorities, and other citizens. We aim in the present case for greater clarity in explaining the proper evaluative framework for discrete special exception/conditional use applications and dispelling any lingering mis-understandings of what the Court truly intended when it filed the opinion in <em>Schultz </em>twenty-seven years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In October 2001, Loyola College in Maryland (\u201cLoyola\u201d) contracted to purchase a fifty-three acre parcel (the Property) in northern Baltimore County for the purpose of constructing several buildings to be used for weekend spiritual retreats. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The Property is located in the R.C.2 (Resource Conservation) zone. According to the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (BCZR) \u00a7 1A01.1(B), the purpose of the Resource Conservation zone is \u201cto foster conditions favorable to a continued agricultural use of the productive agricultural areas of Baltimore County by preventing incompatible forms and degrees of urban uses.\u201d Among the permitted uses allowed as of right in the R.C.2 zone are \u201cone-family detached\u201d dwellings, \u201cagricultural operations,\u201d \u201copen space,\u201d and \u201cpublic schools.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2. BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2(C) allows \u201cchurches or other buildings for religious worship,\u201d \u201ccamps, including day camps,\u201d and \u201cschools, including but not limited to private preparatory schools, colleges, business ,and trade schools, conservatories or other fine arts schools\u201d as special exceptions in the R.C.2 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In early 2004, Loyola submitted to Baltimore County a plan to develop the Property into a Retreat Center. The plan proposed development of just over ten of the fifty-three acres of the Property, leaving the balance in an \u201cas is\u201d state. Loyola concurrently filed a petition for special exception for the Retreat Center as a school or college, church, or camp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Baltimore County Zoning Commissioner/Hearing Officer, in April 2004, conducted a three-day hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the development plan and special exception petition. The hearing officer issued an opinion and order on 10 June 2004 approving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>development plan and granting the special exception. A group of citizens acting individually and collectively as Citizens Against Loyola Multi-use Center (\u201cCitizens\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed to the Baltimore County Board of Appeals (Board of Appeals).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board of Appeals held a <em>de novo </em>hearing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> regarding the special exception and an appeal on the record regarding the development plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The combined hearing continued over a total of six days between 15 September 2004 and 4 January 2005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Both sides presented voluminous evidence regarding the effect that the proposed special exception use would have on the surrounding neighborhood. Because Petitioners narrowed the legal issue before this Court in their Petition for Certiorari, we shall summarize only the relevant evidence presented at the hearing. Loyola produced evidence, which the Board of Appeals credited, that the impacts of the proposed use on agriculture would be minimal. Loyola pointed out that the proposed Retreat Center would occupy only 10.18 acres of land, less than twenty percent of the Property. The remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>der of the Property would be used for agriculture or open space. Robert Sheelsey, an environmental consultant and licensed sanitarian, testified for Loyola that the Property is located \u201cright on the fringe\u201d of the agricultural zone and within the Interstate 88 corridor. Based on this evidence, the Board of Appeals concluded that the Retreat Center \u201cwill not harm agricultural activity in the vicinity.\u201d Loyola presented evidence that the outdoor lighting at the Retreat Center would be \u201cdark skies compliant.\u201d Two additional experts testified on behalf of Loyola that the Retreat Center would not be detrimental to the neighborhood because \u201cit was a very low intensity use\u201d of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Substantial testimony at the hearing concerned the onsite septic system and water usage of the Retreat Center. Sheelsey testified that there are proper soils for septic discharge in the proposed septic field. He further explained that the discharge from the septic system would undergo \u201cbiological/biochemical pretreatment\u201d prior to discharge, making the discharge \u201cmost likely 99% clear and treated.\u201d The proposed septic discharge system would contain a \u201cflow equalization\u201d mechanism to account for the nature of the use of the Retreat Center (heavy use for a few days followed by no use at all for the remainder of the week). Regarding water usage, Thomas Mills, an expert geologist, testified for Loyola that the \u201csupply of groundwater was more than adequate\u201d for the Retreat Center, even under drought scenarios, and that the Retreat Center\u2019s water usage would not affect neighboring wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">There was controversy over the \u201cthermal impacts\u201d from proposed stormwater ponds at the Retreat Center. Citizens argued that discharges from the stormwater detention ponds would warm a tributary to the Fourth Mine Branch, described as a local trout stream, impairing the ability of the trout to reproduce. Professor Edward J. Bouwer of The Johns Hopkins University and Charles Gougeon of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources testified as to their belief that the run-off from the stormwater ponds would warm the tributary. Loyola countered with the testimony of an ecologist, Joseph Berg, Jr. Berg testified that the tributary would not be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sustainable habitat for trout in any event. In addition, he testified that any impact from rain run-off would be minimal. In its written opinion, the Board of Appeals stated that it \u201cwas not persuaded by the testimony of Professor Bouwer or Mr. Gougeon \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The parties also disputed the impact of nitrogen and phosphorous discharges from the septic system. Citizens presented the testimony of Professor Brian Reed of the University of Maryland. He took the position that guidelines from the Maryland Department of the Environment required that septic systems that discharged over 5,000 gallons per day needed further study. Sheelsey, in rebuttal testimony, pointed out that, with the proposed flow equalization mechanism in place, the septic system would discharge only 2,881 gallons per day. He also identified a study that indicated that the Retreat Center\u2019s nitrogen discharge is below the threshold deemed safe for drinking water. The Board found that Loyola met its burden regarding the nitrogen and phosphorous impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Petitioners described Stablersville Road, the main ingress/egress public road for the Retreat Center, as being a narrow country road with no shoulder and steep banks on both sides. It was claimed to be impossible for traffic to pass safely around slow-moving farm vehicles that used the road to move from property to property. Terrence Sawyer, Vice President of Administration at Loyola, responded with the various steps Loyola will take to minimize the traffic impact from the Retreat Center. Students will arrive in vans or buses owned by Loyola. Deliveries and pickups would be made between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. Loyola also produced a local Traffic Impact Analysis prepared by Wes Guckert, an expert on traffic engineering. Guckert testified that, assuming a worst case traffic scenario from the Retreat Center use, local critical intersections would continue to operate \u201cat level A service\u201d (the best volume operation level) without any detrimental effect. The Board of Appeals found his testimony to be credible and noted that \u201cLoyola has made a concerted effort to keep traffic to and from the site to a bare minimum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Citizens also presented certain evidence that the Board of Appeals chose not to consider. Citizens argued that the standard established in Schultz<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for special exception applicants required Loyola to show that there are no other locations within the R.C.2 zone in Baltimore County where the proposed use would have less of an adverse effect than on the local neighborhood of the Property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board of Appeals dismissed this argument, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\">We disagree with [Petitioners\u2019] argument that [the Schultz] standard should be interpreted to mean that, as long as there are other locations in the zone in which certain adverse effects would be less adverse, the use should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>denied in the subject location. The standard is very clear that only the general vicinity of the subject property is to be taken into account. Therefore, the fact that there are wider roads in other areas of the R.C.2 zone, or other areas of the zone without Class 3 trout streams, are beside the point. The Board must examine each criterion of BCZR Section 502.1[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] and determine whether the impacts in the subject location are above and beyond those inherent to the use \u2014 in this case, a college facility \u2014 itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Accordingly, the Board ignored evidence presented by Petitioners that there were other areas in the R.C.2 zone in Baltimore County that would be less adversely affected by the proposed use than the area surrounding the Property. Paul Solomon<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> testified to that effect on behalf of Petitioners. After explaining his methodology in searching for alternative locations, Solomon identified four other areas within the R.C.2 zone where the proposed use could be located \u201cwithout the impact on the subject area.\u201d Specifically, Solomon identified the \u201cHanover Pike area in the west, the Granite area to the south, the Shawan Road area in the north central section, and the Bird River area to the southeast.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Solomon argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the proposed use would have the least amount of adverse impact in areas where farms are smaller in size, and therefore less productive, and where there already were existing intrusions or developments within the adjacent farming community. Solomon surveyed 42 tax maps where the properties predominately were in the R.C.2 zone and where farming remained the central activity. He found that the area around the Property had the second highest number of parcels in agricultural use and the eighth largest average size of individual parcels. Therefore, he argued, the adverse effect of the Retreat Center would be particularly dramatic in its proposed location compared with the alternative R.C.2 sites he found and surveyed elsewhere in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Lynne Jones also testified in opposition to the Retreat Center. She represented that she surveyed 28 roads traversing areas in largely R.C.2-zoned neighborhoods in Baltimore County. She found that the widths of the 28 roads ranged from 20 feet to 24 feet.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Some had shoulders extending up to nine feet wide. By comparison, Stablersville Road in the vicinity of the proposed Retreat Center is only 17 to 19 feet wide and lacks shoulders. Loyola did not dispute Jones\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Richard Klein, an environmental expert, testified regarding other potential sites for the proposed use in the R.C.2 zone elsewhere in the County. He identified vacant sites in the R.C.2 zone that consisted of ten acres or more, were not owned by a government agency, and were not located in a watershed with trout streams. He found four parcels in the Bird River area and 12 in the Granite area. At these locations, he argued, there would be no possible adverse impact from the proposed use on the (nonexistent) local trout populations.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Loyola, by contrast, presented no evidence regarding how its Retreat Center proposal would operate at other sites in Baltimore County in the R.C.2 zone. Thus, Solomon\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Jones\u2019s, and Klein\u2019s testimonies largely were uncontradicted by the applicant for the special exception and ignored by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The Board of Appeals held public deliberations on 24 March 2005. On 21 June 2005, the Board, in a written opinion, affirmed the conclusions of the hearing officer with regard to the development plan and granted Loyola\u2019s petition for a special exception as a \u201ccollege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Citizens timely filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, a Petition for Judicial Review of the Board of Appeals\u2019s decision. People\u2019s Counsel filed a Petition for Judicial Review as well.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Circuit Court remanded the case to the Board of Appeals for further action. Specifically, the Circuit Court held that the \u201cappropriate geographic scope of inquiry is a broad, comprehensive, zone-wide analysis.\u201d Thus, the Circuit Court concluded that the Board \u201cdid err as a matter of law and misapplied the special exception standards of <em>Schultz </em>in restricting its geographic scope of inquiry.\u201d Loyola appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case with instructions to affirm the decision of the Board of Appeals. We granted the Petition for Writ of Certiorari filed by Citizens and People\u2019s Counsel. 403 Md. 612, 943 A.2d 1244 (2008). Although the Petition presents three questions for our review,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> all three questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>share a common legal theme.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the sole legal issue in this case properly may be distilled into a sole question presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">Does <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), require that, before of a special exception may be granted, an applicant must adduce evidence of, and the zoning body must consider, a comparison of the potential adverse effects of the proposed use at the proposed location to the potential adverse effects of the proposed use at other, similarly-zoned \u25a0 locations throughout the jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We conclude 'that <em>Schultz </em>imposes no such requirement. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">When we review the final decision of an administrative agency, such as the Board of Appeals, we look \u201cthrough the circuit court\u2019s and intermediate' appellate court\u2019s decisions, although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate[ ] the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899, 910 (2007). \u201cJudicial review of administrative agency action is narrow. The court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tive agency. . . .\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County, </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994) (quotation omitted). In our review, \u201cwe inquire whether the zoning body\u2019s determination was supported by \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 681, 929 A.2d at 910 (quoting <em>Mayor of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 398, 396 A.2d 1080, 1089 (1979)). \u201cAs we have frequently indicated, the order of an administrative agency, such as a county zoning board, must be upheld on review if it is not premised upon an error of law and if the agency\u2019s conclusions reasonably may be based upon the facts proven.\u201d <em>Ad </em>+ <em>Soil, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 307, 338, 513 A.2d 893, 909 (1986) (internal quotation omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">There is some dispute mounted in the present case as to the appropriate standard of review to be afforded the Board of Appeals\u2019s legal conclusions. Loyola argues that the Board of Appeals\u2019s legal analysis is to be afforded some deference. To support this proposition, Loyola relies on <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 172, 783 A.2d 169, 177 (2001), where we stated that \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d This argument is without merit. By its own terms, the deference \u201coften ... accorded\u201d an agency\u2019s interpretation extends only to the application of the statutes or regulations that the agency administers. The controversy before us concerns the proper application and analysis of caselaw, specifically <em>Schultz v. Pritts </em>and its progeny. This is a purely legal issue uniquely within the ken of a reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>court. \u201cGenerally, a decision of an administrative agency, including a local zoning board, is owed no deference when its conclusions are based upon an error of law.\u201d <em>Belvoir Farms Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. North, </em>355 Md. 259, 267-68, 734 A.2d 227, 232 (1999). Thus, the Board of Appeals\u2019s legal conclusions, if erroneous, are entitled to no deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Standards Governing Special Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">As noted earlier, \u00a7 502.1 of the BCZR provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">Before any special exception may be granted, it must appear that the use for which the special exception is requested will not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">A.

Tend to create congestion in roads, streets or alleys therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">C.

Tend to overcrowd land and cause undue concentration of population;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">E.

Be detrimental to the environmental and natural resources of the site and vicinity including forests, streams, wetlands, aquifers and floodplains in an R.C.2, R.C.4, R.C.5 or R.C.7 Zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">Within each individual factor, including the general factor in \u00a7 502.1(A) of the BCZR, lurks another test, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Schultz v. Pritts </em>standard. <em>Harford County v. Earl E. Preston, Jr., Inc., </em>322 Md. 493, 500, 588 A.2d 772, 776 (1991) (noting that the <em>Schultz v.

In this respect, the <em>Schultz </em>analytical paradigm is not a second, separate test (in addition to the statutory requirements) that an applicant must meet in order to qualify for the grant of a special exception. Rather, the <em>Schultz </em>explication speaks to two different contexts, one by which a legislative body decides to classify a particular use as requiring the grant of a special exception before it may be established in a given zone, and a second one by which individual applications for special exceptions are to be evaluated by the zoning body delegated with responsibility to consider and act on those applications in accordance with criteria promulgated in the zoning ordinance. <em>See Earl E.

The special exception adds flexibility to a comprehensive legislative zoning scheme by serving as a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between permitted uses and prohibited uses in a particular zone. Permitted and prohibited uses serve as binary, polar opposites in a zoning scheme. A permitted use in a given zone is permitted as of right within the zone, without regard to any potential or actual adverse effect that the use will have on neighboring properties. A special exception, by contrast, is merely deemed <em>prima facie </em>compatible in a given zone. The special exception requires a case-by-case evaluation by an administrative zoning body or officer according to legislatively-defined standards. That case-by-case evaluation is what enables special exception uses to achieve some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>flexibility in an otherwise semi-rigid comprehensive legislative zoning scheme.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">History of the Special Exception in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">One of our earliest cases to mention and discuss meaningfully the special exception as a zoning tool<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is <em>Heath v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>187 Md. 296, 49 A.2d 799 (1946) <em>(Heath I), </em>although the case apparently uses the term in a different sense than it is used today. In <em>Heath I, </em>nearby landowners challenged the Baltimore City Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019s decision to permit their neighbor to erect a two-car garage. At the time, the Baltimore City Zoning Ordinance permitted the Board of Zoning Appeals to grant special exceptions to such garages in residential areas. We noted that an \u201c\u2018exception\u2019 within the meaning of a zoning ordinance is a dispensation permissible where the Board of Zoning Appeals finds existing those facts and circumstances specified in the ordinance as sufficient to warrant a deviation from the general rule.\u201d <em>Heath I, </em>187 Md. at 303, 49 A.2d at 803. The Baltimore City Zoning Ordinance \u201cempower[ed] the Board of Zoning Appeals to make special exceptions or variances only where the proposed building, alteration, or use \u2018shall not create hazards from fire or disease or shall not menace the public health, security, or morals.\u2019 It then provides that the board, in passing upon applications for special exceptions or variances as to use, height, or area, shall give consideration to the various factors enumerated in [the Zoning Ordinance].\u201d <em>Heath I, </em>187 Md. at 302-03, 49 A.2d at 803. Although we held that the Board of Zoning Appeals had authority to grant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>special exception, we reversed its decision because it failed to fairly describe the rationale and supporting facts for its decision. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">in passing on an application for a special exception in a residential use district, the Board of Zoning Appeals must take into consideration all pertinent factors enumerated in Section 1, such as fire hazards, traffic problems, transportation requirements and facilities, streets and paving, and schools, parks and playgrounds, and its action must be reasonable in the light of these and all other pertinent facts. In this case the board announced merely that it had \u2018made a study of the premises and neighborhood,\u2019 and there was no supporting evidence upon which to base a rational judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Heath I, </em>187 Md. at 305, 49 A.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">From a modern vantage point, the zoning device at the heart of <em>Heath I </em>actually resembles more the notion of a variance. When the case again came to the Court of Appeals after remand, the Court, applying an analysis grounded in hardship consideration, treated the granting of the special exception as if the applicant were seeking a variance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Heath v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>190 Md. 478, 483-484, 58 A.2d 896, 898 (1948) <em>(Heath </em>II). This appears to have been a frequent conflation in cases from that era. The use of the term \u201cspecial exception\u201d in the <em>Heath </em>cases seems to have had a different meaning than the one given to the phrase by more recent Maryland land use jurisprudence. <em>See, e.g., Easter v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>195 Md. 395, 400, 73 A.2d 491, 492 (1950) (\u201cThe burden of showing facts to justify a[ ] [special] exception or variance rests upon the applicant, and it must be shown that the hardship affects the particular premises and is not common to other property in the neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>hood.\u201d); <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v.

Ass\u2019n, </em>197 Md. 46, 50, 78 A.2d 164, 165 (1951), the Court repeatedly noted that the applicants in that case were seeking a \u201cspecial exception.\u201d Over 50 years later, in analyzing <em>Gleason, </em>we deduced that the opinion actually addressed a zoning re-classification, variance, or \u201calternate classification possibility.\u201d <em>Richard Roeser Prof'l Builder, Inc. v.

In reversing the Board\u2019s decision, we held that the special exception provision in the zoning ordinance \u201cdelegate^] to the Zoning Board a limited authority to permit enumerated uses which the legislative body finds in effect <em>prima facie </em>properly residential, absent any fact or circumstance in a particular case which would change this presumptive finding. The duties given the Board are to judge whether the neighboring properties and the general neighborhood would be adversely affected, and whether the use, in the particular case, is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning plan.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>Merlands </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Club, </em>202 Md. at 287-88, 96 A.2d at 264 We further noted that \u201cwhere a specific use is permitted by the legislative body in a given area if the general zoning plan is conformed to and there is no adverse effect on the neighborhood, the application can be granted.... \u201d <em>Merlands Club, </em>202 Md. at 289, 96 A.2d at 265. Describing the presumption afforded special exception uses, we noted that \u201cprivate clubs are <em>prima facie </em>to be permitted in a residential use area. The applicant for such a use need not show either practical difficulty, unnecessary hardship, or great urgency, but only that the project is a private club and that it would be in general harmony with the zoning plan and would not adversely affect the neighboring properties and the general neighborhood.\u201d <em>Merlands Club, </em>202 Md. at 290, 96 A.2d at 265. Thus, in <em>Merlands Club, </em>the Court discarded the consideration generally of hardship as part of the special exception analysis, unless the particular zoning ordinance explicitly injects hardship as a factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>We later considered the teachings of <em>Merlands Club </em>in the context of special exceptions provided for in the zoning ordinance in Baltimore County. In <em>Oursler v. Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>204 Md. 397, 104 A.2d 568 (1954) (our first substantial opportunity to examine the regulation of special exceptions in Baltimore County), we affirmed an order of the Baltimore County Board of Zoning Appeals granting a special exception (in <em>Oursler </em>it was referred to as a \u201cspecial permit\u201d) to operate a restaurant in a residential area. The zoning ordinance section governing special exceptions in effect at that time was identical to the current version of BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a) through (f). In applying the zoning ordinance, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">It is the function of the Zoning Commissioner, and the Board of Zoning Appeals on appeal, to determine whether or not any proposed use for which a special permit is sought would be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the Zoning Regulations, and whether it could be conducted without being detrimental to the welfare of the neighborhood. Accordingly, in Baltimore County, where restaurants are <em>prima facie </em>permissible in residential zones, an applicant for a permit to conduct a restaurant in a residential zone is not required to show that denial of a permit would result in \u201cpractical difficulty, or unnecessary or unreasonable hardship,\u201d as in the case of a variance, but must show only that the exception would be in harmony with the zoning plan and would not be detrimental to the welfare of the neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>Oursler, </em>204 Md. at 401-02, 104 A.2d at 570; <em>See also Erdman v.

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>205 Md. 557, 109 A.2d 739 (1954), the Baltimore City Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals granted a permit<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to erect a billboard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>in a \u201cfirst commercial use\u201d district. We affirmed and discussed the legislative presumption afforded special exception \u201cpermits\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">The argument of the appellants that the erection of a billboard in a first commercial use district, in which there are residences, would lead to slums and, in this way, in the future affect adversely the public health or safety, is an argument that billboards should not be permitted at all in a district in which there are residences or substantial and attractive businesses, although it is zoned first commercial. Whatever the merits of this argument, it is one which should be addressed to the Legislature or the Baltimore City Council in an effort to have the law changed. As the law now stands, the argument is fanciful. The legislative branch of the government, in allowing billboards to be erected in such areas, has said, in effect, that the likelihood that their presence will bring about the dire consequences foreseen by the appellant, is not great enough to forbid generally the use of property to accommodate them. It has added a safeguard for the instances contrary to the general rule in the procedures required by Sections 37, 38 and 39 of the Ordinance, whereby the Board, as a legislative agent, may determine in any particular instance that the public health, safety, welfare, security and morals will be affected \u2014 not in the deterioration of the neighborhood over a period of time because of the presence of the billboards, but because of some immediate fact, circumstance or condition which would bring about the evils guarded against.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Gilmor, </em>205 Md. at 565, 109 A.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In 1957, we decided <em>Huff v.

In <em>Huff, </em>the local legislature enacted a zoning tool which would be described in modern zoning terminology as a \u201cfloating zone.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A landowner meeting certain statutory requirements (such as minimum lot size and parking requirements) could petition for his property to be zoned \u201cManufacturing, Restricted.\u201d The decision whether to grant a petition was to be made in the first instance by the Zoning Commissioner with the right of appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The statute further stated that such a rezoning was intended \u201cto protect the uses in neighboring residential zones\u201d and that \u201cthe building and grounds must be continuously maintained so that they will not adversely affect vicinal properties.\u201d <em>Huff, </em>214 Md. at 59, 133 A.2d at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In upholding the legislation creating the \u201cManufacturing, Restricted\u201d floating zone, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">We read the provisions of the regulations as to the purpose and intent in establishing [Manufacturing, Restricted] Zones and as to the mechanics employed to be sure that the plan approved will continue to \u201cprotect the uses in neighboring residential zones\u201d and not adversely affect \u201cvicinal properties,\u201d to mean that an area cannot be properly zoned or rezoned Manufacturing, Restricted unless in actual opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tion and effect it will be a harmonious part of the comprehensive plan and serve the purposes of the enabling act; that is, that the zoning will be not only in the public good but in the interests of nearby property owners. If the regulations be read as we read them, it is clear that the Manufacturing, Restricted classification is analogous to a special exception, and the rules which are applicable to special exceptions would apply, not the general rules of original error or change in conditions or the character of the neighborhood, that control the propriety of rezoning. This is because, as in the case of a special exception, there has been a prior legislative determination, as part of a comprehensive plan, that the use which the administrative body permits, upon application to the particular case of the specified standards, is <em>prima facie </em>proper in the environment in which it is permitted. This prior determination and the establishment of sufficient standards effectively refute the claim of improper delegation of legislative power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><em>Huff, </em>214 Md. at 62, 138 A.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>Merlands Club </em>and <em>Oursler </em>were cited favorably in <em>Crowther, Inc. v.

In <em>Crowther, </em>we affirmed the Board of Appeals\u2019s denial of a special exception to operate a trailer home park in the \u201cManufacturing, Light\u201d zone. We began our analysis by noting the appropriate standard to be applied in evaluating an application for a special exception by noting that \u201cconditions upon which a special exception may be granted are set out in the ordinance, and the board is given a wide latitude of discretion in passing upon special exceptions so long as the resulting use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning plan and will not adversely affect the use of neighboring properties and the general plan of the neighborhood as provided by the zoning ordinance.\u201d We determined that substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s denial of the special exception \u201c(a) because it would be inconsistent with the continued development of a planned and existing, though only partly developed, manufacturing area needed for such purposes in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>particular locality for the development of a large area in accordance with a comprehensive plan, and (b) because it would adversely affect property values in the vicinity.\u201d <em>Crowther, 225 </em>Md. at 385, 170 A.2d at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In <em>Deen v.

The Zoning Commissioner granted the special exception for only part of the utility company\u2019s five-mile right-of-way. The remainder of the power transmission lines would be required to be buried. BG &amp; E appealed to the County Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals, after a six-day <em>de novo </em>hearing, granted the special exception in part, requiring still that some of the power transmission lines be buried. The company appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, which held that the special exception should have been granted for the entire right-of-way.

The extent of any harm or disturbance to the neighboring area and uses is, of course, material but if there is no probative evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved or of factors causing disharmony to the functioning of the comprehensive plan, a denial of an application for a special exception is arbitrary, capricious and illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In <em>Anderson v.

The court noted that \u201cin order to deny the right of the property owner to enjoy the requested special exception, the Board needed before it probative evidence that the proposed use would, in fact, create traffic congestion on Sunberry Road, and would, in fact, be detrimental otherwise to the general welfare of the locality involved. In this case there was no such probative evidence presented.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>23 Md.App. at 617-18, 329 A.2d at 720. In an often-quoted section, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>There can be no doubt that an undertaking business has an inherent depressing and disturbing psychological effect which may adversely affect persons residing in the immediate neighborhood in the enjoyment of their homes and which may lessen the values thereof. Indeed, it is precisely because of such inherent deleterious effects that the action of a local legislature in prohibiting such uses in a given zone or zones will be regarded as promoting the general welfare and as constitutionally sound. But in the instant case the legislature of Baltimore County has determined that as part of its comprehensive plan funeral homes are to be allowed in residential zones notwithstanding their inherent deleterious effects. By defining a funeral home as an appropriate use by way of special exception, the legislature of Baltimore County has, in essence, declared that such uses, if they satisfy the other specific requirements of the ordinance, do promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community. As part of the comprehensive zoning plan this legislative declaration shares in a presumption of validity and correctness which the courts will honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">The presumption that the general welfare is promoted by allowing funeral homes in a residential use district, notwithstanding their inherent depressing effects, cannot be overcome unless there are strong and substantial existing facts or circumstances showing that the particularized proposed use has detrimental effects above and beyond the inherent ones ordinarily associated with such uses. Consequently, the bald allegation that a funeral home use is inherently psychologically depressing and adversely influences adjoining property values, as well as other evidence which confirms that generally accepted conclusion, is insufficient to overcome the presumption that such a use promotes the general welfare of a local community. Because there were neither facts nor valid reasons to support the conclusion that the grant of the requested special exception would adversely affect adjoining and surrounding properties in any way other than would result from the location of any funeral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>home in any residential zone, the evidence presented by the protestants was, in effect, no evidence at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">... The protestants have shown nothing more than that they would suffer the same degree of harm as would be suffered by any homeowner if a funeral home were permitted on land adjacent or in close proximity to their residences. If the residents of Baltimore County do not want funeral homes in residential use districts, they should prevail upon the local legislature to change the ordinance, (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Anderson, </em>23 Md.App. at 624-25, 329 A.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Less than a year after <em>Anderson, </em>in <em>Gowl v.

Thus, the proper evaluative standard to be applied in special exception cases was not considered until the case reached us. The Court of Appeals issued a writ of certiorari to consider all issues raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Judge Davidson, now writing for the Court of Appeals, first cleared the way to reach the merits, holding that the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Court\u2019s order remanding the case was an appealable final judgment and that the Board\u2019s actions did not violate the Prittses\u2019 due process rights. Judge Davidson then proceeded to the merits of the Prittses\u2019 other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Prittses argued that the Board of Zoning Appeals erred because it declined to apply the <em>Gowl </em>standard in evaluating their application for the special exception. Specifically, they contended that their proposed use, a funeral home, would generate less traffic than several permitted uses allowed in the zone in which the subject property was placed. Thus, they contended, the Board of Zoning Appeals should have approved the special exception to operate a funeral home.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In finding no merit in the Prittses\u2019 argument, the Court unequivocally rejected the <em>Gowl </em>standard. The Court began its analysis by reviewing the proper standard to be applied by a zoning body in reviewing an application for a special exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">This Court has frequently expressed the applicable standards for judicial review of the grant or denial of a special exception use. The special exception use is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan sharing the presumption that, as such, it is in the interest of the general welfare, and therefore, valid. The special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to allow enumerated uses which the legislature has determined to be permissible absent any fact or circumstance negating the presumption. The duties given the Board are to judge whether the neighboring properties in the general neighborhood would be adversely affected and whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">Whereas, the applicant has the burden of adducing testimony which will show that his use meets the prescribed standards and requirements, he does not have the burden of establishing affirmatively that his proposed use would be a benefit to the community. If he shows to the satisfaction of the Board that the proposed use would be conducted with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>out real detriment to the neighborhood and would not actually adversely affect the public interest, he has met his burden. The extent of any harm or disturbance to the neighboring area and uses is, of course, material. If the evidence makes the question of harm or disturbance or the question of the disruption of the harmony of the comprehensive plan of zoning fairly debatable, the matter is one for the Board to decide. But if there is no probative evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved or of factors causing disharmony to the operation of the comprehensive plan, a denial of an application for a special exception use is arbitrary, capricious, and illegal. <em>Turner v.

Sawyer, 23 </em>Md.App. 612, 617, 329 A.2d 716, 720 (1974).

The Court then surveyed prior caselaw, focusing on <em>Deen </em>and <em>Anderson. </em>The Court concluded in an often-quoted paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">These cases establish that a special exception use has an adverse effect and must be denied when it is determined from the facts and circumstances that the grant of the requested special exception use would result in an adverse effect upon adjoining and surrounding properties unique and different from the adverse effect that would otherwise result from the development of such a special exception use located anywhere within the zone. Thus, these cases establish that the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327. After summarizing the facts and analysis in <em>Gowl, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[i]n reaching this conclusion, the trial court cited only <em>Deen, </em>240 Md. at 330-31, 214 A.2d at 153, and the Court of Special Appeals cited no authority at all. Indeed, there is no persuasive authority that applies the <em>Gowl </em>standard or supports this conclusion.\u201d <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 19, 432 A.2d at 1329.

Finally, the Court articulated the standard to govern special exception cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">We now hold that the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone. <em>Turner, </em>270 Md. at 54-55, 310 A.2d at 550-51; <em>Deen, </em>240 Md. at 330-31, 214 A.2d at 153; <em>Anderson, </em>23 Md.App. at 617-18, 624-25, 329 A.2d at 720, 724.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 22-23, 432 A.2d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Schultz\u2019s Progeny</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\"><em>Schultz </em>has been cited in over 100 reported Maryland appellate' decisions. Both sides in this litigation have sifted through this vast body of law and highlighted particular applications of parts of the relevant language in <em>Schultz </em>that, they contend, support their respective positions. Petitioners, for example, point to <em>Lucas v. People\u2019s Counsel For Baltimore County, </em>147 Md.App. 209, 807 A.2d 1176 (2002). In <em>Lucas, </em>a horse farm owner in Baltimore County applied for a special exception to operate an \u201cairport\u201d on his property so that a part owner of a thoroughbred business located at the farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>could commute to and from the property via airplane. A helicopter pad already was in operation on the property. The Board of Appeals denied the request for special exception, concluding that the proposed use constituted an \u201cairstrip,\u201d \u201cheliport,\u201d or \u201chelistop,\u201d which were not permitted by special exception in the zone. As an alternative holding, the Board of Appeals relied on its interpretation of the <em>Schultz </em>standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuJ\">In reaching that determination, the Board used the following standard: \u201cThe question is one of whether or not the adverse effects are greater at the proposed site than they would be elsewhere in the County where they may be established, i.e., the other areas within the R.C. 2 zones.\u201d The Board noted that it believed that \u201cthe appellant has the burden of establishing that the impact factor caused by the proposed use is not greater at the site than the same use elsewhere in the zone (R.C. 2 zone).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><em>Lucas, </em>147 Md.App. at 223, 807 A.2d at 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The Board of Appeals thus found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuB\">the impact upon the National Historic District would be greater in the Greenspring Valley than if located in other northern areas of the R.C. 2 zones. Relying considerably on the expertise of (expert witnesses) Messrs. Dillon, Solomon and Gerber, there are individual areas in the Northern part of the county that would be less impacted than at the present site. The Board concludes that it is not a matter of finding a better site for the proposed use in the R.C. 2 zone, but rather the question is one of total impact; and the Board concludes that the Appellants have not established that fact by the preponderance of the evidence to the Board\u2019s satisfaction. Acknowledging that airports and helicopter uses have inherent negative impacts, the detrimental effects upon the smaller Greenspring Valley district would clearly have a greater negative impact than if located elsewhere in the vast acreage constituting the R.C. 2 zone of Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\"><em>Lucas, </em>147 Md.App. at 223-24, 807 A.2d at 1184-85.

The Cecil County Board of Appeals denied the special exception request. \u201cWe granted the Board\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider whether the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision comported with the applicable zoning ordinance and with the standard for judicial review of a special exception set forth in <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981).\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 214, 550 A.2d at 667 (1988). The Court there summarized the <em>Schultz </em>standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afbj\">In summary, where the facts and circumstances indicate that the particular special exception use and location proposed would cause an adverse effect upon adjoining and surrounding properties unique and different, in kind or degree, than that inherently associated with such a use regardless of its location within the zone, the application should be denied.

In reaching that conclusion, however, the Court appeared to shift the focus from the particular adverse effects on the properties neighboring the proposed use to the availability of other areas where the mobile home would have less of an adverse effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">We find no cause to question the Board\u2019s conclusion that the mobile home, in this particular location, would impair neighboring property value to a greater extent than it would elsewhere in the zone. Countless locations exist within the zone, and indeed, within Holbrook\u2019s own property, where the presence of a mobile home would have no effect whatsoever upon adjoining property values. If, for example, trees or topography hid the mobile home from the view of the neighboring property owners, there would remain, as the Board\u2019s counsel conceded, absolutely no grounds for denying a special exception permit. The Court of Special Appeals failed to acknowledge these potential scenarios. Instead, the intermediate appellate court based its holding on the mistaken premise that, regardless of a mobile home\u2019s particular location within a zone, its negative impact on adjacent properties would remain the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">At any rate, in light of the mobile home\u2019s high degree of visibility in this particular location, its proximity to the Peters\u2019s home, and the markedly disparate values of the Holbrook and Peters residences, we hold that the Board reasonably concluded that the permanent presence of the Holbrook mobile home would create significantly greater adverse effects in this location than were it located elsewhere in the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\"><em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 220, 550 A.2d at 669. Petitioners argue that <em>Holbrook, </em>particularly the passage previously quoted, supports the proposition that <em>Schultz </em>compels a district-wide comparative geographic analysis of effects in each special exception. The most sympathetic statement to that effect in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Holbrook </em>is that \u201c[cjountless locations exist within the zone, and indeed, within Holbrook\u2019s own property, where the presence of a mobile home would have no effect whatsoever upon adjoining property values.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>however, subsequently has been interpreted in a much different light than Petitioners argue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">There is not necessarily a comparative analysis requirement imbedded in <em>Holbrook. </em>In a bit of rhetorical flourish, the Court actually was dismissing the intermediate appellate court\u2019s \u201cmistaken premise that, regardless of a mobile home\u2019s particular location within a zone, its negative impact on adjacent properties would remain the same.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 220, 550 A.2d at 669. The Court did not compare the location of the proposed use to other locations within the zone, or require such an analysis in every case. Instead, it highlighted characteristics of the particular neighborhood that exacerbated the problems inherent to the placement of a mobile home there. <em>See E. Outdoor Adver. Co., </em>146 Md.App. at 309, 807 A.2d at 64 (noting that in <em>Holbrook </em>\u201cthe Court considered the deleterious impact of a mobile home on the value of adjacent properties in the \u2018neighborhood\u2019 \u201d); <em>Sharp v. Howard County Bd. of Appeals, </em>98 Md.App. 57, 83, 632 A.2d 248, 261 (1993) (discussing <em>Holbrook </em>and stating that \u201cthe Court [in <em>Holbrook </em>] construed the relative lack of vegetative screening between the two structures and the apparently level topography as sufficient localized circumstances that rendered the adverse property value impact, arguably always inherent in this particular use, uniquely adverse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Petitioners also point to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Futoryan v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>150 Md.App. 157, 819 A.2d 1074 (2003). In <em>Futoryan, </em>a landowner appealed the denial of a special exception to operate an automobile service station in the B-3-2 zone. The subject property of the special exception application was the only property within the jurisdiction zoned B-2-3. The intermediate appellate court described the problem this situation presented with the application of its view of the <em>Schultz </em>standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">The B-3-2 zone in this case is a tiny island, measuring a mere 64' by 122.5' and completely surrounded by residential zoning. Futoryan\u2019s property is the entire zone. The conditional use here cannot, by definition, have a greater adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>impact at this location than it would have at some other location within the zone because there is no such thing as \u201csome other location within the zone.\u201d There can be no comparative degree, no greater adverse impact and no lesser adverse impact, when there is nothing with which to compare the location in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><em>Futoryan, </em>150 Md.App. at 178, 819 A.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">To solve this perceived quandary, the Court of Special Appeals divided the <em>Schultz </em>test into what the court considered to be its elements, noting that \u201c[although in their articulation the tests are sometimes telescoped together into a single compound test, there are actually two tests inherent in the <em>Schultz v. Pritts </em>guidelines.\u201d <em>Futoryan, </em>150 Md.App. at 178, 819 A.2d at 1086. The court continued that \u201c[t]he more prominent and high profile of the two is that which assumes an adverse impact from the conditional use and then compares the relative severity of the adverse impact at the location in question with its likely severity at other locations within the zone.\u201d <em>Futoryan, </em>150 Md.App. at 178-79, 819 A.2d at 1086. The court, setting the stage for application of its view, concluded its analysis of the <em>Schultz </em>test, stating that \u201c[i]f ... the adverse effect were weightier than the beneficial purpose [of the proposed use], the assessment of the relative severity [of the adverse effect] at different locations would then be called for.\u201d <em>Futoryan, </em>150 Md.App. at 180, 819 A.2d at 1087. It then held that where no other properties assigned to the particular zone are available for a comparative analysis, the zoning body should compare the adverse effect of the proposed use on the neighboring properties with the \u201clikely adverse influences [of the proposed use] at other locations in other similar zones.\u201d <em>Futoryan, </em>150 Md.App. at 181, 819 A.2d at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Petitioners also rely on <em>Hayfields, Inc. v. Valleys Planning Council, Inc., </em>122 Md.App. 616, 716 A.2d 311 (1998). In <em>Hayfields, </em>a landowner sought a special exception to build a golf course in the R.C.2 zone in Baltimore County. Opponents of the golf course argued that the geological formation underlying the golf course, known as the Cockeysville Marble <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>formation, would increase the adverse effects of contaminant runoff. The Board of Appeals rejected their concerns, noting that there were other areas in the R.C.2 zone that were part of the Coekeysville Marble formation. Therefore, the Board of Appeals found, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the effects of the golf course would be greater at the proposed location than other areas within the R.C.2 zone. The Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthis finding does not comport with the test set forth in <em>Schultz. </em>Assuming that Coekeysville Marble <em>is </em>more susceptible to contamination, the mere fact that <em>some </em>of the land elsewhere in the R.C.2 zone is underlain with Coekeysville Marble does not mean that the effect would be no worse at this locality than elsewhere in the zone.\u201d <em>Hayfields, </em>122 Md.App. at 653-54, 716 A.2d at 330. The Court of Special Appeals remanded the case to the Board of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">If all or a substantial portion of the off-site R.C.2 land is underlain by Coekeysville Marble then it is at least possible that the Board could fairly conclude that the golf course, at its proposed site, would cause no more contamination to the aquifer than if it were located elsewhere in the R.C.2 zone. Conversely, if the Board finds that only a relatively small portion of the off-site R.C.2-zoned land is underlain with Coekeysville Marble, and if it also finds that the Cockeysville Marble formation makes the aquifer more susceptible to contamination, then it cannot be said that the golf course at the intended site would pose no greater danger to groundwater than if it were located elsewhere in the R.C.2 zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Hayfields, </em>122 Md.App. at 654-55, 716 A.2d at 330 (footnote omitted). Petitioners contend that <em>Hayfields </em>required a comparison of the geology and hydrology of the site of the proposed special exception to other properties within the R.C.2 zone elsewhere in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Loyola\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Hayfields </em>is not persuasive. Loyola argues that, in the present case, there are no \u201ctruly unique\u201d factors, such as a \u201cCoekeysville Marble\u201d formation, that would affect the Property. According to Loyola, all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the potential adverse effects of the proposed Retreat Center at issue (traffic impact, agricultural impact, and environmental impact) are adverse effects inherent from the operation of any school or college use. The \u201cCockeysville Marble\u201d formation in <em>Hayfields, </em>however, is not an adverse effect. The adverse effect at issue in <em>Hayfields </em>was runoff from the operation and maintenance of the golf course, containing groundwater contaminants. Contaminated runoff is a potential adverse effect inherent in the operation of a golf course. The characteristics of the locality involved, notably the \u201cCockeysville Marble\u201d geology, arguably increased or amplified those adverse effects or made the locality more sensitive to those adverse effects. This is similar to the evidence adduced by Petitioners in the present case of arguably narrow roads frequently used by automobiles, trucks, and farm equipment and an assertedly environmentally-sensitive trout stream near the Property. Petitioners here contended before the Board of Appeals that those characteristics of the local neighborhood increased the debatable adverse effects attributed to the proposed Retreat Center. Thus, if the reasoning in <em>Hayfields </em>is good law, <em>Hayfields </em>squarely supports Petitioners\u2019 contention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Petitioners also point to <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 8-9, 666 A.2d 1253, 1257 (1995). In <em>Mossburg, </em>the Montgomery County Board of Appeals denied a landowner\u2019s request for a special exception to operate a solid waste transfer station in \u201can 1-2 Industrial Zone.\u201d The Board denied the request for two reasons: \u201ctraffic safety\u201d and the \u201cenvironment.\u201d With regard to the environment, the \u201cBoard found that there would be adverse impact from runoff from the subject site into a tributary that ultimately drains into Rock Creek, the Potomac River, and the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d <em>Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 13, 666 A.2d at 1259. The intermediate appellate court rejected this rationale, noting that \u201cwe know of no areas in Montgomery County where storm water runoff does not ultimately drain into the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d <em>Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 13, 666 A.2d at 1259.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">But even more important, as we indicated earlier, there is absolutely no evidence, in respect to environmental con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>cerns, that the environmental impact of appellants\u2019 use at the subject site would be greater, or above and beyond, that impact elsewhere within the 1-2 Zone in this industrial corridor or other 1-2 Zones in that part of the regional district situated in Montgomery County. In fact, all of the evidence indicates that the impact would be the same anywhere within this 1-2 industrial corridor; from the evidence, the entire area appears to be in the Southlawn Creek watershed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><em>Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 24-25, 666 A.2d at 1265. The panel of the Court of Special Appeals described its view of the <em>Schultz </em>standard thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">Moreover, it is not whether a use permitted by way of a special exception will have adverse effects (adverse effects are implied in the first instance by making such uses conditional uses or special exceptions rather than permitted uses), it is whether the adverse effects in a particular location would be greater than the adverse effects ordinarily associated with a particular use that is to be considered by the agency.... The question in the case sub judice, therefore, is not whether a solid waste transfer station has adverse effects. It inherently has them. The question is also not whether the solid waste transfer station at issue here will have adverse effects at this proposed location. Certainly, it will and those adverse effects are contemplated by the statute. The proper question is whether those adverse effects are above and beyond, <em>i.e., </em>greater here than they would generally be elsewhere within the areas of the County where they may be established, <em>ie., </em>the other few I-2 Industrial Zones. In other words, if it must be shown, as it must be, that the adverse effects at the particular site are greater or \u201cabove and beyond,\u201d then it must be asked, greater than what? Above and beyond what? Once an applicant presents sufficient evidence establishing that his proposed use meets the requirements of the statute, even including that it has attached to it some inherent adverse impact, an otherwise silent record does not establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>impact, however severe at a given location, is greater at that location than elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 8-9, 666 A.2d at 1257.

The requirement for such an analysis focused on the local neighborhood is apparent in the often-quoted <em>Schultz </em>holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">We now hold that the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJW\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 22-23, 432 A.2d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The <em>Schultz </em>standard requires an analysis of the effects of a proposed use \u201cirrespective of its location within the zone.\u201d \u201cIrrespective of\u2019 is defined by Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993) as \u201cregardless of.\u201d The same dictionary defines \u201cregardless of\u2019 as \u201cwithout taking into account.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 argument urges the opposite result. Petitioners contend that <em>Schultz </em>requires an applicant for a special exception to compare, and concomitantly the zoning body to consider, the adverse effects of the proposed use at the proposed location to, at least, a reasonable selection or representative sampling of other sites within the same zone throughout the district or jurisdiction, <em>taking into account </em>the particular characteristics of the areas surrounding those other test sites. The <em>Schultz </em>standard requires no such evidentiary burden be shouldered by an applicant nor analysis undertaken by the zoning decision-maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Schultz </em>speaks pointedly to an individual case analysis focused on the particular locality involved around the proposed site. <em>See Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327 (\u201cThese cases establish that a special exception use has an adverse effect and must be denied when it is determined from the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and circumstances that the grant of the requested special exception use would result in <em>an adverse effect upon adjoining and surrounding properties </em>unique and different from the adverse effect that would otherwise result from the development of such a special exception use located anywhere within the zone.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d at 1324 (\u201cThe duties given the Board are to judge whether <em>the neighboring properties in the general neighborhood would be adversely affected </em>and whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>(\u201cIf [the applicant] shows to the satisfaction of the Board that the proposed use would be conducted <em>without real detriment to the neighborhood </em>and would not actually adversely affect the public interest, he has met his burden.

As discussed above, <em>Anderson </em>involved a request for a special exception to operate a funeral home in a residential area. The Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Appeals in <em>Anderson </em>discussed at length two particular adverse effects inherent in the operation of a funeral home. First, the Court rejected the argument that the special exception request should be denied because of the depressing psychological effects deemed inherent to the operation of a funeral home. There was no probative evidence offered that the depressing effect of the funeral home would be any greater at the proposed location than in any other residential area in the same zone where it was allowed by special exception. Second, the Court of Special Appeals discussed the effect of traffic, also inherent to operation of a funeral home. The intermediate appellate court\u2019s discussion of the increase in traffic that may be caused by the funeral home focused only on the potential for an adverse effect at the particular location. No comparative, multiple site impact analysis was performed or called for to determine what adverse effects were in excess of those \u201cinherent\u201d in a funeral home establishment. Thus, the <em>Schultz </em>standard, as presaged in <em>Anderson, </em>requires that the adverse effect \u201cinherent\u201d in a proposed use be determined without recourse to a comparative geographic analysis. Any language to the contrary in <em>Holbrook, Lucas, Futoryan, Hayfields, </em>and <em>Mossburg </em>is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">But what sense is to be made of <em>Schultz\u2019s </em>language referring to consideration of whether \u201cthe particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone\u201d? Is it to be declared surplusage? Is it to be stricken or disapproved because the 2008 composition of this Court simply has had a change of mind twenty-seven years later? The answer is \u201cno.\u201d The language retains vitality and sense as long as the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for its inclusion in <em>Schultz </em>is understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As noted previously and frequently, a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">special exception is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to permit enumerated uses which the legislative body has determined can, <em>prima facie, </em>properly be allowed in a specified use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>district, absent any fact or circumstance in a particular case which would change this presumptive finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Merlands Club, </em>202 Md. at 287, 96 A.2d at 264; <em>see also Creswell v.

In that sense, the local legislature puts on its \u201cSorting Hat\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and separates permitted uses, special exceptions, and all other uses. That is why the uses are designated special exception uses, not permitted uses. The inherent effects notwithstanding, the legislative determination necessarily is that the uses conceptually are compatible in the particular zone with otherwise permitted uses and with surrounding zones and uses already in place, provided that, at a given location, adduced evidence does not convince the body to whom the power to grant or deny individual applications is given that actual incompatibility would occur. With this understanding of the legislative process (the \u201cpresumptive finding\u201d) in mind, the otherwise problematic language in <em>Schultz </em>makes perfect sense. The language is a backwards-looking reference to the legislative \u201cpresumptive finding\u201d in the first instance made when the particular use was made a special exception use in the zoning ordinance. It is not a part of the required analysis to be made in the review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>process for each special exception application.

As Loyola noted in its brief to this Court, the exact formulation of Petitioners' argument has varied somewhat through different stages of this litigation. Before the Board of Appeals and in the Circuit Court, Citizens argued that the special exception applicant must show that there are no other locations within the R.C.2 zone where the proposed use would have less of an adverse impact. In this Court, however, Petitioners contend that the Board must consider the effects of the proposed use as if it were proposed at a reasonable number of other locations within the R.C.2 zone. The evolution (or inconsistency) in Petitioners\u2019 argument over time is irrelevant to the resolution of the underlying legal issue. The core of Petitioners' legal argument remains the same. They contend that <em>some </em>comparative geographic analysis of impacts of the proposed use at other R.C.2 sites is required under <em>Schultz. </em>The Board of Appeals refused, in error Petitioners argue, to require from Loyola or consider from Petitioners <em>any </em>comparative geographic analysis evidence. Thus, the various permutations of Petitioners' argument do not detract from the distinct and narrow legal issue before us in the present case. If Loyola is required to present a comparative geographic impact analysis, Loyola failed, as a matter of law, to meet its burden before the Board of Appeals. Thus, if any such comparative analysis is required, the decision of the Board of Appeals must be reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b117-5\">.

Petitioners, particularly People\u2019s Counsel, discuss at length in their briefs to this Court the additional testimony of a local resident and expert farmer, Wayne McGinnis. It appears to us, however, that most of McGinnis\u2019s testimony focused on the adverse effects, particularly traffic and agriculture-related ones, of the Retreat Center on the area immediately surrounding the Property. He did not compare the adverse effects of the Retreat Center at the Property to adverse effects of the Retreat Center if it were located at other R.C.2 sites \u2014 the heart of the legal issue in this appeal. His testimony appears to have been afforded very little weight by the Board of Appeals in this regard.

Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>204 Md. 397, 402, 104 A.2d 568, 570 (1954), cites <em>Merlands Club </em>as support for the assertion that a special exception applicant \u201cmust show only that the exception would be in harmony with the zoning plan.\u201d In describing the statutory authorization for special exceptions in Baltimore County, we noted that \"[i]n 1943 the Legislature passed an amendment to the Zoning Enabling Act authorizing the County Commissioners to provide that the Zoning Commissioner may make special exceptions to the Zoning Regulations in harmony with their general purposes and intent.\u201d <em>Oursler, </em>204 Md. at 400, 104 A.2d at 569. In <em>Crowther, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>225 Md. 379, 385, 170 A.2d 768, 771 (1961), we cited to the language in <em>Oursler </em>and <em>Merlands Club </em>when considering testimony that a proposed special exception would be \"out of step with the comprehensive zoning plan.\u201d <em>See also Crowther, </em>225 Md. at 383, 170 A.2d 768, 770 (noting that a zoning body \u201cis given a wide latitude of discretion in passing upon special exceptions so long as the resulting use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of <em>the zoning plan and will not adversely affect the use of neighboring properties and the general plan of the neighborhood as provided by the zoning ordinance\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In fact, we have characterized a zoning ordinance as a comprehensive plan. In <em>Huff v. Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>214 Md. 48, 51, 133 A.2d 83, 85 (1957), we held that a comprehensive zoning ordinance constituted a \"comprehensive plan.\u201d We noted the statutory authority of the county to enact zoning laws, stating that the \u201cstatute now found in the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore County, 1955, Title 30, Sec. 532, provided, at the times here material, that the County Commissioners were empowered to enact zoning regulations '... in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u2019 \u201d Opponents of a zoning reclassification argued that the reclassification was improper because it was not \"in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d as required by the statute. We held that \"the Baltimore County zoning regulations of 1955, including the provisions as to Manufacturing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Restricted zones, constitute a comprehensive plan.\u201d <em>Huff, </em>214 Md. 48, 59, 133 A.2d 83, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 55, 310 A.2d 543, 551 (1973), we noted that a proposed use could not be approved as a special exception if it caused \"disharmony to the functioning of the comprehensive plan.\u201d The comprehensive plan referred to in <em>Turner </em>was the zoning ordinance. The <em>Turner </em>opinion relied on two cases for this language, <em>Merlands Club, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>and <em>Rockville Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Board of Appeals of City of Gaithersburg, </em>257 Md. 183, 262 A.2d 499 (1970). <em>Rockville Fuel, </em>in turn, relied upon <em>Merlands Club </em>and <em>Oursler </em>in its discussion of the requirement that a special exception conform to a zoning plan. <em>See also Rockville Fuel, </em>257 Md. at 190, 262 A.2d at 503 (\"The legislative body of the City of Gaithersburg has in effect said that if certain standards and requirements enumerated in the ordinance are met in a particular case, the various special exceptions specifically authorized <em>are a part of the comprehensive zoning plan </em>and therefore promote the health, safety and general welfare, to the same extent as do the uses permitted as of right in the zone involved.\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, the \"comprehensive plan\u201d referred to in <em>Turner </em>is the zoning ordinance. <em>See also Turner, </em>270 Md. at 54, 310 A.2d at 550 (noting that \"the conditional use or special exception, as it is generally called, <em>is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan </em>sharing the presumption that as such it is in the interest of the general welfare and, therefore, valid.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In <em>Anderson v. Sawyer, </em>23 Md.App. 612, 617, 329 A.2d 716, 720 (1974), Judge Rita Davidson noted that a proposed use must be in harmony with the \"comprehensive plan.\u201d That reference, as well, was to the county zoning ordinance as a whole. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">But in the instant case the legislature of Baltimore County has determined that as part of its comprehensive plan funeral homes are to be allowed in residential zones notwithstanding their inherent deleterious effects. By defining a funeral home as an appropriate use by way of special exception, the legislature of Baltimore County has, in essence, declared that such uses, if they satisfy the other specific requirements of the ordinance, do promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community. As part of the comprehensive zoning plan this legislative declaration shares in a presumption of validity and correctness which the courts will honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\"><em>Anderson, </em>23 Md.App. at 624, 329 A.2d at 724. It is apparent from this passage that <em>Anderson </em>is describing the legislative process in enacting or amending a zoning ordinance, where a legislative body divides those uses permitted in a Euclidean zone as of right from those requiring a special exception. In addition, <em>Anderson </em>uses the terms \"comprehensive plan\u201d and \"comprehensive plan of zoning\u201d interchangeably in consecutive sentences. <em>See Anderson, </em>23 Md.App. at 617, 329 A.2d at 720 (\"If the evidence makes the question of harm or disturbance or the question of the disruption of the harmony of the <em>comprehensive plan of zoning </em>fairly debatable, the matter is one for the Board to decide. But if there is no probative evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved or of factors causing disharmony to the operation of the <em>comprehensive plan, </em>a denial of an application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>special exception is arbitrary, capricious and illegal.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">To be sure, a legislature validly may require that an applicant for a special exception show that a proposed use is in conformance, is consistent, or is in harmony with a land planning document, such as a general plan, master plan, or functional master plan. For example, in <em>Board of County Commissioners for Prince George's County v. Luria, </em>249 Md. 1, 2 n. 2, 238 A.2d 108, 109 n. 2 (1968), the zoning ordinance then in effect in Prince George\u2019s County stated that \"[a] special exception may be granted when the Council finds that ... proposed use is in harmony with the purpose and intent of the General Plan for the physical development of the District as embodied in this Ordinance and in any Master Plan or portion thereof adopted or proposed as part of said General Plan.\u201d That language from the Prince George\u2019s County zoning ordinance was repeated in <em>Cason v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>261 Md. 699, 706-07, 276 A.2d 661, 664 (1971). Currently, \u00a7 27-317(a)(3) of the Prince George\u2019s County Code (zoning ordinance) requires that, in order for a special exception to be approved, the proposed use must \"not substantially impair the integrity of any validly approved Master Plan or Functional Master Plan, or, in the absence of a Master Plan or Functional Plan, the General Plan.\u201d Thus, typically and at least in special exception cases originating in Prince George\u2019s County, a judicial reference in an appellate opinion to a requirement that a proposed use conform to a land planning document may not be referring to the zoning ordinance alone or at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. Although the <em>Gilmor </em>opinion refers to the granting of a \"permit/' the case clearly is directed to what would be considered today a special exception.

Such unlocated special zoning districts are popularly referred to as 'floating zones,' in that they float over the entire municipality until by application of a property owner one of these special zones descends upon his land thereby reclassifying it for the special use. The zoning ordinance is carefully drawn so as to impose restrictive use limitation upon the owner in these special use zones in order to protect the adjoining residential areas. Usually there is a minimum lot requirement with large set-back restrictions for the structures, both from the streets and from the adjoining residences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 539 n. 15, 814 A.2d at 484 n. 15 (quoting <em>Eschinger v.

The Board, under the <em>Schultz </em>standard, reviewed the evidence for the required particular adverse impact.

There was testimony concerning the effects of the development along the York Road corridor and the erosion created by the development and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>storm water runoff. There was testimony concerning the effects of the intrusion of the project into the residential neighborhood presently existing around that location.
