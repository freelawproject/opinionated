The Circuit Court for Baltimore City determined, in granting conditional release to Linwood Bean, that Bean did not have to produce expert testimony to meet his evidentiary burden under the circumstances of his case. The Court of Special Appeals reversed, concluding that, in all such cases, the issue of whether a person would pose a danger to himself or others if released from confinement presents a complicated medical question that may be resolved only by weighing competing relevant expert testimony. For reasons to be explained, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand with directions to affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">On 3 December 1985, Linwood Bean was found not criminally responsible of a charge of assault with intent to <em>murder</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>He was committed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDepartment\u201d) for inpatient care and treatment. Bean thereafter was released conditionally from inpatient treatment, after his commitment in 1985, on three different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>occasions, the most recent of which was revoked on 15 October 2001 due to allegations that he assaulted his landlady. Since then, Bean has been a patient at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On 23 December 2004, pursuant to \u00a7 3-119 of the Criminal Procedure Article, Bean filed a petition with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City requesting conditional release or discharge from his inpatient commitment to the Department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>trial was held on 20 June 2006 to determine whether Bean was eligible for conditional release or discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">During the trial, Bean presented, as his case-in-chief, testimony from two witnesses: himself and a friend, Andrew Conwell. Neither Bean nor Conwell was offered as an expert; indeed, neither is a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, or other mental health or medical professional. Bean, for his part, acknowledged that he has a mental disorder, but that, in his opinion, his release would not pose any danger to himself or others as a result of the disorder because he would continue to take the required medicine and because he would have the proper support system for his reintegration into the community.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>testified that he has known Bean since 1965; employed Bean as a contractor without any problems during the earlier occasions Bean was released conditionally; had further daily interaction with Bean without problems during Bean\u2019s previous releases; and that, based on these experiences, Bean should be considered eligible for release. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">At the close of Bean\u2019s case-in-chief, the Department moved for judgment on the ground that Bean, who had the burden of proof, failed to present any expert testimony as to whether his mental disorder would render him a danger to himself or the person or property of others if he were to be released from commitment, with or without conditions. The trial judge denied the Department\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In its case-in-chief, the Department adduced the testimony of Lisa Sloat, M.D., a psychiatrist at Perkins Hospital. After qualifying as an expert in forensic psychiatry, Dr. Sloat testified that her diagnosis for Bean is Schizoaffective Disorder<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and that, because of that mental disorder, Bean would be a danger to himself and to others if he were released, with or without conditions, from inpatient treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to her, due to Bean\u2019s lack of insight into his mental disorder, there was little assurance that his violent past behaviors would not be repeated. Dr. Sloat also testified that, in her opinion, Bean likely would not be able to control his behavior if or when his symptoms returned. Dr. Sloat\u2019s testimony, however, suggested that, although Bean had a history of mental disorder and physically disruptive behavior, the medicinal treatments he received under professional supervision had more or less caused his symptoms to subside and improved his behavior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>At the close of all the evidence, the Department renewed its motion for judgment on the same ground as its earlier motion \u2014 Bean\u2019s failure to produce expert testimony. The Circuit Court denied the motion, and submitted the case to the jury. The jury determined that Bean should be released from inpatient commitment, with conditions. On 26 July 2006, the Court entered an Order for Conditional Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">On 27 July 2006, pursuant to \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(d)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article, the Department filed an Application for Leave to Appeal. The Department concurrently moved in the Circuit Court for a Stay Pending Appeal. The Circuit Court denied the stay request. The Department then filed a Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-425, with the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals granted the Department\u2019s Application and the Motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>for Stay Pending Appeal. In a reported opinion, <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Bean, </em>178 Md.App. 418, 941 A.2d 1232 (2008), the intermediate appellate court reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment on the ground that a committed person must produce expert testimony or evidence to satisfy his/her burden of proof with regard to eligibility for release. We granted Bean\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Bean v. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>404 Md. 152, 945 A.2d 1271 (2008).

Bean, </em>178 Md.App. at 427, 941 A.2d at 1238. Thus, according to the intermediate appellate court, although the statutory procedure provides for the trier of fact, in many cases a jury, to determine whether a committed person is eligible for release based on the evidence presented, a prima facie case supporting eligibility for release that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>go to the fact-finder on the merits will not exist, absent an expert opinion supporting such eligibility. In light of the statutory scheme in \u00a7\u00a7 3-114 through 3-122 of the Criminal Procedure Article and relevant case law, we disagree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s recognition of such a threshold requirement in all cases and specifically on the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Title 3 of the Criminal Procedure Article provides for the standards and procedures for determining competency and criminal responsibility in criminal cases. Title 3, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 3-101 through 3-123, provides certain standards, such as \u201cnot criminally responsible\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cincompetent to stand trial,\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that are to be determined based on the presentation of evidence. A review of the whole of Title 3 reveals that in not one section is there any legislative mandate or directive that the courts must receive and consider expert medical opinion in making these determinations in each and every case, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>eligibility for release determinations. Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 3-114. It would seem that the necessity for such evidence was left by the Legislature to be determined on the facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In the present case, the evidence presented in the parties\u2019 cases-in-chief at trial revealed that Bean and the Department were in agreement on two major points: Bean has a mental disorder, and the symptoms and potentially troubling behavior Bean exhibits as a result of that disorder more or less can be controlled by his taking prescribed medication. The main factual dispute presented to the jury to resolve was whether Bean would continue to take the prescribed medications if released conditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">As indicated <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-114 provides that a committed person is eligible for conditional release \u201conly if that person would not be a danger, as a result of mental disorder or mental retardation, to self or to the person or property of others if released from confinement with conditions imposed by the court.\u201d Because Bean acknowledged that he has a specific mental disorder and the Department conceded that the disorder may be managed with medication, the material issue contested before the jury was the factual dispute over whether Bean would take the necessary medications if granted a conditional release. Consistent with Maryland case law holding that expert medical opinion is required only \u201cwhen the subject of the inference [presented to the jury] is so particularly related to some science or profession that it is beyond the ken of the average layman\u201d and is not required \u201con matters of which the jurors would be aware by virtue of common knowledge,\u201d <em>CIGNA Prop. &amp; Cas. Cos. v. Zeitler, </em>126 Md.App. 444, 463, 730 A.2d 248, 259-60 (1999) (quoting <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 257, 674 A.2d 106, 125-26 (1996), <em>affd, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997)), Bean did not need to present expert medical opinion in support of his desired relief because the principal dispute that needed to be resolved by the jury in this case did not present a complex medical issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>but rather depended on resolving a factual dispute, dependent to a great extent on a credibility assessment of Bean\u2019s testimony, a matter within a jury\u2019s ken. <em>See Wilhelm v. State Traffic Safety Comm\u2019n, </em>230 Md. 91, 99, 185 A.2d 715, 719 (1962) (\u201cThere are, unquestionably, many occasions where the causal connection between a defendant\u2019s negligence and a disability claimed by a plaintiff does not need to be established by expert testimony. Particularly this is true when the disability develops coincidentally with, or within a reasonable time after, the negligent act, or where the causal connection is clearly apparent from the illness itself and the circumstances surrounding it, or where the cause of the injury relates to matters of common experience, knowledge, or observation of laymen.\u201d); <em>Fink v. Steele, </em>166 Md. 354, 361, 171 A. 49, 52 (1934) (noting that in malpractice cases against physicians and surgeons, \u201c[t]here may be cases in which there is such gross negligence and unskillfulness as to dispense with professional witnesses\u201d); <em>CIGNA Prop. &amp; Cas. Cos., </em>126 Md.App. at 469, 730 A.2d at 261 (noting that \u201cthe duty to render a professional judgment regarding a subrogation clause in a commercial lease is beyond the ken of the average juror,\u201d whereas \u201c[i]n contrast, the issue concerning the duty to inform a client that the coverage actually obtained differs from what was sought is, ordinarily, not beyond the understanding of the average juror\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Whether Bean would take the necessary medications as prescribed, the penultimate issue to be decided by jury in this case, was a factual one quintessentially for the jury to resolve. Bean and Conwell testified as to Bean\u2019s positive behavior upon his previous releases and his willingness to comply with court or hospital-imposed coping programs and medicines. The Department countered, as it would in the overwhelming majority of \u00a7 3-119 release proceedings, with an expert witness, such as Dr. Sloat, in this case, who testified as to a lack of faith in Bean\u2019s likelihood of compliance with the programs and medications were he to be released conditionally. She bolstered her opinion with observations regarding Bean\u2019s prior failures to take his medications faithfully and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>resultant relapses in behavior. The jury had the opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to determine whether Bean proved his eligibility to its satisfaction. The jury determined that Bean satisfied his burden of proof to obtain a conditional release. \u201cIn a jury case in which there is legally sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict, the Court will not inquire into the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Gray v. Director, Patuxent Inst., 245 </em>Md. 80, 84, 224 A.2d 879, 881 (1966).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Respondent, alternatively, argues that in all \u00a7 3-119 release eligibility proceedings the committed person must present expert medical opinion in his/her favor because the issue of whether the committed person would pose a danger presents a complicated medical issue which, at common law, requires expert opinion evidence. Respondent urges this Court to conclude that the Court of Special Appeals followed \u201cfirmly established common law\u201d in characterizing proof of a lack of dangerousness as a complicated medical question, necessarily requiring the presentation of expert testimony. We reject this categorical argument and determine rather that the lack of dangerousness issue does not present always a complicated medical question necessarily requiring the presentation of expert testimony. Whether expert testimony is required to be adduced by a committed person will depend on the nature of the disputed issues in the proceeding and therefore must be approached on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In support of its analysis, the Court of Special Appeals relied on the proposition that \u201creliance on lay testimony alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>is not justified when the medical question involved is a complicated one, involving fact finding which properly falls within the province of medical experts,\u201d taken from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. Blamble, </em>227 Md. 1, 7, 174 A.2d 764, 767 (1961), in support of the conclusion that favorable expert medical opinion is required always of applicants in release eligibility proceedings if the applicants hope to prevail. In placing unrestrained reliance on this observation, the Court of Special Appeals erred in two respects. First, close examination of <em>Jewel Tea Co. </em>indicates that this Court did not apply the quoted proposition to the issue at hand in that case. Second, in Maryland and other jurisdictions, courts have concluded that the determination of whether a committed person poses a danger if not confined is not necessarily the type of complicated medical question that only may be resolved through the consideration of dueling expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">l.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. Blamble, </em>227 Md. 1, 174 A.2d 764, we considered whether the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to prove that her injuries constituted \u201ctotal disability,\u201d meaning \u201cincapacity to do work of <em>any </em>kind, and not mere incapacity to perform that work which the employee was accustomed and qualified to perform before the injury.\u201d <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 3, 174 A.2d at 765 (emphasis in original). In support of her position that her on-the-job injuries caused her \u201ctotal disability,\u201d the plaintiff presented expert medical testimony and the lay opinion of herself and her landlady. The only medical testimony presented at trial was by the plaintiffs attending physician, who testified that, in his opinion, although the plaintiff suffered severe injuries, she could work at a sit-down job for three to four hours a day, with rest periods. <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 5, 174 A.2d at 766. The plaintiff testified that, largely due to certain subjective physical feelings, she felt she could not go back to work. <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 4, 174 A.2d at 766. As the <em>Jewel </em>Court noted, she based \u201cher conclusion not upon any attempt she has made to work but only on her own personal feelings and certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>experiences around the house and in a department store. . . .\u201d <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 4-5,174 A.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We held that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to warrant submission to the jury of the question of permanent total disability. <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 8, 174 A.2d at 768. The holding was premised not on the fact that the expert and lay opinions conflicted, but because the plaintiffs testimony was grounded in conjecture or possibility. As the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">In the absence of more compelling proof than the opinion of the employee herself and that of her landlady that she is totally disabled within the intendment of the statute, and in the light of medical opinion to the contrary, we must hold that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the appellant\u2019s prayer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 8, 174 A.2d at 768. Had the plaintiff presented evidence beyond her subjective feelings about the future, her claim of permanency and total disability might have been sufficient to submit the case to the jury for a verdict, despite having presented conflicting expert medical opinion or even no expert medical opinion at all. <em>See Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 7, 174 A.2d at 767 (\u201cIt is obvious that in cases such as the one before us the experience and information secured by medical experts concerning the type, degree, extent and duration of disability attendant upon the disease involved here, and the superimposing of their findings upon the general physical and mental condition of the patient, are invaluable. In the instant case such expert testimony was in fact, in our opinion, determinative, in contradistinction to the testimony of the lay witnesses, which, from the nature of this case, could only be conjectural.\u201d). Thus, the Court explicitly acknowledged \u201c[w]hat we have said should not be taken as indicating that we conclude that all awards in cases of injuries of a subjective nature can stand only if accompanied by definitive medical testimony, as the appellant suggests.\u201d <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 7, 174 A.2d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u00dc.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">A holding in the present case that whether a committed person poses a danger if released always presents a complicated medical issue requiring expert testimony would contradict parallel or analogous Maryland and Supreme Court authorities holding that there is no absolute requirement that such testimony be present in order to make such a determination. In <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 369 A.2d 98 (1977), the Court of Special Appeals addressed the need for expert medical opinion in the context of those instances in which a defendant pleads before the trial court that he or she is incompetent to stand trial. The appellate court expressly overruled dicta in an earlier case, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">There is no doubt that the issue of competency to stand trial in many cases may involve a necessity for the trial judge to have or indeed, perhaps to seek, the testimony of medically trained psychiatrists before making a determination of competency....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">[However, w]e find nothing in the statute to indicate that testimony by a medically trained psychiatrist that the accused is competent to stand trial is <em>necessarily required, </em>before the court may make a determination of competency beyond a reasonable doubt. We did not intend the decision in <em>Colbert [v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 632, 308 A.2d 726 (1973)] to indicate otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Hill, </em>35 Md.App. at 108-10, 369 A.2d at 104-05. The court found this view to be consistent with federal case law on point, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">This court recognizes that in making a competency determination it may be very useful for the trial judge to question both the defendant and his counsel; the applicable criteria measure one\u2019s ability to consult with his lawyer and to understand the course of legal proceedings. Thus counsel\u2019s first-hand evaluation of a defendant\u2019s ability to consult on his case and to understand the charges and proceedings against him may be as valuable as an expert psychiatric opinion on his competency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Hill, </em>35 Md.App. at 110, 369 A.2d at 105 (quoting <em>United States v. David, </em>511 F.2d 355, 360 (D.C.Cir.1975)). The competency situation is sufficiently analogous to the present issue because of the similarity of the evidence that typically may be evaluated in each situation. In both situations, both lay and expert medical opinion regarding behaviors and thought processes may be highly relevant to the determination, yet in neither case has the General Assembly required that expert medical opinion necessarily be presented. For the competency determination, the standard is whether the accused is able to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense, <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 297, 372 A.2d 1069, 1072 (1977), a test that makes expert medical and lay opinion potentially highly relevant. <em>See Sangster v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 456, 464-65, 521 A.2d 811, 815 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>312 Md. 560, 541 A.2d 637 (1988) (\u201cIn the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant raised the issue of his competency to stand trial. He presented evidence from a psychiatrist ... that he suffered from a chronic schizophrenic disorder and that because of this mental disorder he could neither understand the nature of the proceedings nor assist in his defense. The State called no witnesses in rebuttal, but apparently submitted a report from Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital in which it was concluded that the appellant was competent to stand trial.\u201d) (footnotes omitted). Likewise, the standard for release eligibility, persuading a fact-finder that one would not pose a danger as a result of mental disorder if discharged, makes lay and expert medical opinion potentially highly relevant, as demonstrated by the testimonies of Bean, Conwel l, and Dr. Sloat in this case. Because expert opinion has been found not to be required absolutely in every competency determination, this Court is unwilling to embrace a per se rule, under \u00a7 3-119, that expert medical opinion necessarily must be presented in favor of committed persons in release eligibility proceedings in every case in order to submit the matter to the fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2008), discussed by both parties in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>briefs, the Supreme Court addressed a petitioner\u2019s contention that his Texas death sentence should be set aside on the ground that psychiatrists, as part of the Texas capital sentencing proceedings,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> can not predict competently and within an acceptable degree of reliability that a particular criminal will commit other crimes and so represents a danger to the community. <em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 896, 103 S.Ct. 3383. The Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument, finding that psychiatric testimony would be relevant and helpful to the jury in making its determination. <em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 902-03, 103 S.Ct. 3383. In rejecting the petitioner\u2019s argument, the Court also acknowledged that, although expert medical opinion could be relevant and helpful, it by no means absolutely was required to show that an accused likely poses a danger to the community. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Although there was only lay testimony with respect to dangerousness in Jurek [v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976)], there was no suggestion by the Court that the testimony of doctors would be inadmissible. To the contrary, the Court said that the jury should be presented with all of the relevant information____ [T]he rules of evidence generally extant at the federal and state levels anticipate that relevant, unprivileged evidence should be admitted and its weight left to the fact finder, who would have the benefit of cross examination and contrary evidence by the opposing party. Psychiatric testimony predicting dangerousness may be countered not only as erroneous in a particular case but as generally so unreliable that it should be ignored. <em>If the jury may make up its mind about future dangerousness unaided by psychiatric testimony, </em>jurors should not be barred from hearing the views of the State\u2019s psychiatrists along with opposing views of the defendant\u2019s doctors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\"><em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 897-99, 103 S.Ct. 3383 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Respondent in the present case seeks to distinguish <em>Barefoot </em>on the ground that its holding is inapplicable here because the expert testimony in <em>Barefoot </em>was in the context of \u201cpredictions of the probability that a particular criminal defendant will commit additional crimes as part of a capital sentencing scheme,\u201d rather than in the context of the standards governing release eligibility proceedings. On this record, the distinction is unpersuasive. Proof of future dangerousness under the Texas capital punishment statute in <em>Barefoot </em>was not limited to mental or psychiatric causation, unlike the nature of a \u00a7 3-119 proceeding such as here. Nonetheless, because at Bean\u2019s specific proceeding the existence of his mental disease or condition was conceded, effectively his \u00a7 3-119 action was on the same conceptual footing as the statute in play in <em>Barefoot. </em>Thus, in the capital sentencing scheme in Texas, expert opinion bearing on an accused\u2019s likelihood of future dangerousness could be presented to a jury charged with deciding whether the defendant\u2019s situation met the standards for the imposition of capital punishment, but was not required. If \u201cpsychiatry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and psychology are so particularly related to determinations of dangerousness that these specialists must be involved in the decision-making process,\u201d as Respondent urges, then it would seem apparent that the Supreme Court would have had a serious problem where a defendant\u2019s life hinged on the determination of future dangerousness, but no expert opinion was presented regarding that issue. The Supreme Court had no such problem in <em>Barefoot </em>Further, the Supreme Court found on other occasions that expert psychiatric or psychological testimony is often too subjective or inconclusive to be a required basis of such determinations. <em>See Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 430, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) (\u201cThe subtleties and nuances of psychiatric diagnosis render certainties virtually beyond reach in most situations. The reasonable-doubt standard of criminal law functions in its realm because there the standard is addressed to specific, knowable facts. Psychiatric diagnosis, in contrast, is to a large extent based on medical \u2018impressions\u2019 drawn from subjective analysis and filtered through the experience of the diagnostician. This process often makes it very difficult for the expert physician to offer definite conclusions about any particular point.\u201d). Thus, we are unwilling to interject a mandatory expert medical testimony requirement in every release eligibility proceeding under \u00a7 3-119 of the Criminal Procedure Article. While it is highly likely that the Department, in virtually every case, will adduce expert medical testimony, and that many committed persons will as well, whether the absence of that testimony would be fatal to a particular party\u2019s position as a matter of law will depend on the particular contested issues in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY; COSTS IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AND THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">.
