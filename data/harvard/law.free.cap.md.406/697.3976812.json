Did the Circuit Court err in ruling that a voter challenge to certification of a referendum petition that failed to carry the required number of signatures, which challenge was filed within ten days of the certification, is nonetheless partially time-barred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATB\">2. Did the Circuit Court err in ruling, contrary to the strict compliance standard dictated by this Court in an unbroken line of decisions, that specific signature requirements prescribed under the election laws for referenda petitions need not be met, with the result that a referendum petition carrying an insufficient number of valid signatures was certified for the ballot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">3. [Did] the Circuit Court err[ ] in holding that the Board is required to include inactive voters in calculating the total number of registered voters in Montgomery County and, thus, in calculating 5% of that number to determine the number of signatures required on the petition for referendum[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">On November 21, 2007, Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett signed into law Bill No. 23-07, enacted by the Montgomery County Council, which prohibited discrimination based on \u201cgender identity\u201d under the County\u2019s anti-discrimination statutes. The Citizens Group opposed to the enactment of the \u201cgender identity\u201d bill initiated the process of obtaining the signatures of 5% of the registered voters in the County to petition the law to referendum.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">We, the undersigned registered voters of Montgomery County, Maryland, do hereby petition for a referendum vote of the registered voters of the County for approval or rejection in the next general election on Bill 23-07, NonDiscrimination \u2014 Gender Identity, entitled: \u201cAn Act to prohibit discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodation, cable television service, and taxicab service on the basis of gender identity; and generally to amend County laws regarding discrimination\u201d, enacted on November 13, 2007 by the County Council for Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The County Board\u2019s Director, Margaret Jurgensen, emailed Ruth M. Jacobs, President of the Citizens Group, on November 30, 2007 to inform her that the petition would require 25,001<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> signatures of Montgomery County registered voters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>with 50% due by February 4, 2008 and the other 50% due by February 19, 2008. Letters from the County Board\u2019s attorney approving the form of the petition as well as an internet version of the form, were sent to the Citizens Group on December 3, 2007, and December 7, 2007, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The Citizens Group submitted 15,146 petition signatures to the County Board on February 4, 2008. On February 19, 2008, the Citizens Group submitted 15,506 more signatures, and the next day, February 20, 2008, the Director of the County Board sent a letter to the President of the Citizens Group formally notifying her that of the 15,146 signatures submitted on February 4, 13,476 were \u201cvalid, accepted signatures.\u201d On March 6, 2008, the County Board sent a letter to the Montgomery County Executive and the President of the Montgomery County Council, among others, certifying the petition and stating that the \u201cpetition contained more than the requisite number of signatures necessary to place the question on the 2008 General Election ballot\u201d and \u201cthat the petition appears to meet the necessary requirements\u201d regarding content under Section 6-201.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>After the petition was certified by the County Board on March 6, 2008, eight days later, on March 14, 2008, twelve Montgomery County citizens, Jane Doe, et al., filed a complaint pursuant to Section 6-209, seeking judicial review and declaratory relief in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County. The complaint alleged, among other arguments, that the County Board \u201ccertified the Petition despite the Petition\u2019s failure to include, by the legal deadlines, the requisite number of valid signatures required for certification.\u201d The County Board answered and then moved for summary judgment, arguing that Jane Doe\u2019s complaint was time-barred because it was not filed within the 10-day period prescribed by Section 6-210, and that even if it was timely filed, Jane Doe did not present a legal basis for challenging the County Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>decision to certify the ballot. Jane Doe filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, contending that the petition should be decertified because thousands of purported signatures were invalid and because the petition itself was defective. During the hearing on the summary judgment motions, counsel for the County Board revealed, for the first time, that \u201cinactive\u201d voters were not included in the total number of registered county voters from which the Board derived the <em>5% </em>figure, and based on this new information, Jane Doe moved for leave to amend the complaint. The Circuit Court granted the motion, stating in a later order that it believed that the \u201cnew theory [wa]s based upon the same core of operative facts originally pled by Plaintiffs\u201d; an amended complaint was filed on July 8, 2008. The County Board did not file a motion to strike or a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s order granting leave to amend, and the case proceeded on the basis of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">After the completion of oral argument on the motions for summary judgment, the judge granted the County Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied Jane Doe\u2019s cross-motion and in his Memorandum Decision and Declaratory Judgment Order, dismissed the amended complaint because he determined that the 6-209 cause of action for judicial review and declaratory relief accrued on February 20, when the County Board had sent the Citizens Group a letter stating that 13,476 signatures of the 15,146 purported signatures submitted on February 4 were \u201cvalid [and] accepted,\u201d so that the complaint was filed beyond the limitations period; the judge also explored the various bases for invalidating the petition and held that the challenged signatures were valid, but insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In addressing the sufficiency of the challenged signatures, the court determined that \u201cinactive\u201d voters should have been included as registered voters, having declined to accept the County Board\u2019s argument that doing so \u201cwould artificially inflate the number of signatures required to successfully petition for referendum.\u201d The court also considered whether the signatures on the referendum petition were required to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ply with the provisions of Section 6-203.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On this issue the parties stipulated that 5,141 signatures included in the February 4 submission and 5,735 signatures of the February 19 submission failed to mirror the voter\u2019s identity on the statewide voter registration list. The court determined that the signature provisions of Section 6-203 were merely suggestive as opposed to required and validated the 10,876 challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>signatures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Jane Doe petitioned for certiorari as well as for expedited review, and the County Board cross-petitioned; we granted both petitions. <em>Doe v. Board of Elections, </em>405 Md. 505, 954 A.2d 467 (2008). Oral argument was heard on September 8, 2008, and the next day, on September 9, 2008, we issued our Per Curiam Order reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanding the case to that court with directions to enter judgment in favor of Jane Doe.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Doe v. Montgomery County Board of Elections, </em>406 Md. 110, 111, 956 A.2d 199, 200 (2008). We shall now set forth our reasons for that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are asked to consider two questions: whether Jane Doe filed a timely complaint for judicial review and declaratory relief contesting the Board\u2019s certification of the referendum petition for the November 2008 ballot; and then, if the suit is not time-barred, whether the referendum contained a sufficient number of valid signatures to reach 5% of Montgomery County registered voters, as required by Section 114 of the Montgomery County Charter. Because we shall hold that the complaint was not time-barred, we shall address the merits of the referendum challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The parties before us had filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the County Board and denied Jane Doe\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In considering a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, this Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Bednar v. Provident Bank of Maryland, Inc., </em>402 Md. 532, 542, 937 A.2d 210, 215 (2007); <em>Rhoads v.

If no material facts are placed in genuine dispute, this Court must determine whether the Circuit Court correctly entered summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-501(f);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Bednar, </em>402 Md. at 532, 937 A.2d at 216; <em>Saks, </em>399 Md. at 82, 923 A.2d at 6; <em>Prop. and Cas.

In the case before us, there are no material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Here, we are also faced with the interpretation of four sections of the Election Law Article, Sections 3-503, 6-203, 6-209 and 6-210. In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 708-09; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v.

If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003). When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body,\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 390, 863 A.2d at 952, 962 (2004); <em>Drew v. First Guar.

The Circuit Court, in granting the County Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, agreed that February 20, when half of the signatures were accepted as valid, was the relevant \u201cdetermination\u201d to trigger the Section 6-210(e), 10-day limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Jane Doe argues, on the other hand, that the 10-day limitations period does not apply, and, even if it applied, that she complied with the limitations period because the complaint was filed on March 14, which was -within 10-days of March 6, when the County Board made a final determination that all of the necessary signatures had been gathered and certified the referendum question for the November 2008 ballot. Jane Doe argues that she was not \u201caggrieved\u201d before the March 6 determination of the County Board, and that therefore, she could not have sought judicial review before that date.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Section 6-210(e) establishes a 10-day period within which an aggrieved person must seek judicial review of a determination under Section 6-209:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">(e) <em>Judicial review. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any judicial review of a determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>as provided in \u00a7 6-209 of this subtitle, shall be sought by the 10th day following the determination to which it relates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au0\">For the purposes of this analysis, we assume, without deciding, that this 10-day period applies and must interpret Section 6-209 to analyze when the cause of action for judicial review accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Section 6-209(a), entitled <em>\u201cIn general,\u201d </em>governs when a plaintiff may seek judicial review of an election board determination and provides for relief to be afforded by the court, \u201cas it considers appropriate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u00a7 6-209.

In <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Association v. Department of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 288, 686 A.2d 605, 614 (1996), Judge John C.

Judge Glenn T. Harrell, speaking on behalf of this Court in <em>Heery International, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>384 Md. 129, 137, 862 A.2d 976, 981 (2004), also iterated the general rule, requiring a final determination before an aggrieved party, a potential plaintiff, can seek judicial review of an agency decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">We have long held that \u201c[wjhere an administrative agency has primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a controversy, the parties to the controversy must ordinarily await a final administrative decision before resorting to the courts for resolution of the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>In the present case, the Circuit Court Judge relied upon <em>Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 912 A.2d 658 (2006), to decide that Jane Doe should have initiated a judicial review action of the February 20 Board determination that half of the signatures were valid, even though another half was still necessary to certify the petition for the November ballot, stating that <em>\u201cRoskelly </em>mandates that where referendum petitioners are aggrieved by a rejection of signatures at the first step of the signature-gathering process, they are required to seek judicial review within 10 days of the determination.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In <em>Roskelly </em>the sponsor of the petition did not file for judicial review of a June 8 determination of the Board of Elections, which stated that Roskelly\u2019s petition was deficient, so his challenge 19 days later was time-barred. Clearly, Roskelly, as the petition sponsor, was \u201caggrieved\u201d on June 8 when a final determination denying certification was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Here, Jane Doe was not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the actions of the County Board in letters sent on November 30, December 3 and 7, or February 20, nor were these actions \u201cfinal.\u201d On November 30, 2007, the County Board merely informed the Citizens Group of the necessary number of valid signatures to place the referendum on the ballot. On December 3 and 7, 2007, the County Board sent a letter to the Citizens Group, stating that the paper and internet forms of the Citizens Group\u2019s petition were valid. On February 20, 2008, the County Board determined that the Citizens Group had submitted over 50% of the signatures, but needed 11,534 more to be submitted before the referendum could be successfully certified and placed on the November ballot. Rather, not until March 6, 2008, when the County Board certified that the Citizens Group had met the statutory requirements to put the referendum question on the November 2008 ballot, was Jane Doe \u201caggrieved\u201d by a final \u201cdetermination\u201d of the County Board and capable of seeking judicial review under Section 6-209. Accordingly, March 6, 2008, was the triggering date for when Jane Doe\u2019s cause of action for judicial review accrued, and the complaint filed on March 14 was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\n<em>Amended Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We next address the effect that the amended pleading had on the original complaint. The County Board argues that Jane Doe failed to challenge the determination regarding the number of registered voters within ten days of March 6, 2008, because the amended complaint, filed July 8, 2008, which more specifically addressed the issue of \u201cinactive\u201d voters, \u201cadded a new theory or cause of action and, thus, does not relate back to the filing of the original complaint.\u201d Doe counters that paragraph 51 on the original complaint, which pled that the \u201c[defendant BOARD OF ELECTIONS certified the Petition despite the Petition\u2019s failure to include, by the legal deadlines, the requisite number of valid signatures required for certification,\u201d adequately stated the factual basis for the cause of action for judicial review and declaratory relief, and that the later amended complaint merely added greater specificity to this assertion. Leave to amend the complaint was granted, nevertheless, because the trial judge determined that the \u201cnew theory is based upon the same core of operative facts originally pled by Plaintiffs, and that amendment [would] facilitate a determination based on the true issues of the litigations and [would avoid] an injustice by reasons of a procedural technicality.\u201d The County Board, furthermore, filed no motion challenging the trial court\u2019s grant of leave to amend because the amended complaint originated from the same core of operative facts, and the summary judgment process proceeded on the basis of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In <em>Morrell v. Williams, </em>279 Md. 497, 506, 366 A.2d 1040, 1044 (1976), we explained the relation-back principle, iterating that \u201can amended [complaint] filed after the expiration of a statute of limitations will be barred, if [it] states a new cause of action or a new theory of liability.\u201d <em>See also Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v.

We also have held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>on numerous other occasions, that when the amendment does not state a new cause of action or theory of liability, it will relate back to the filing of the original. <em>See, e.g., Crowe v.

The reason for this rule is that the bringing of the suit stops the running of the statute and consequently, so long as the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>proceeds for the <em>same </em>cause of action, the bar of the statute cannot attach. When, however, by amendment, the <em>cause of action </em>is changed, a new suit is begun when the amendment is made, and if between the accruing of <em>that </em>cause of action and the date of the amendment, which <em>for the first time </em>invokes that cause of action, the period of limitations has supervened, then the plea may be interposed to that <em>new </em>suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">(Emphasis in original). <em>See also State ex rel.

Zier died on July 2, 1900, and the wife\u2019s suit was brought on January 3, 1901, with an amendment filed on April 17, 1902, past the one-year limitation period for a wrongful death action. The lower court dismissed the entire Complaint, holding that it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations. We reinstated the Complaint, holding that the addition of the employer\u2019s negligence in the amendment did not recite a new cause of action for wrongful-death and therefore related-back to the original:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">The <em>statement </em>of the cause of action was different, but the <em>cause of action </em>itself was identical.

The Complaint was then amended in July to allege, based upon the recently revealed information proffered by the attorney for the County Board, that \u201cinactive\u201d voters had not been included in the total number of registered voters, so that the requisite number of valid signatures had not been included. Clearly, as in <em>Zier, </em>\u201c[t]he <em>statement </em>of the cause of action was different, but the <em>cause of action </em>itself was identical,\u201d for Doe\u2019s amended complaint did not \u201cconvert the original suit into a new and different suit\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Because we hold that Jane Doe\u2019s complaint was timely, we now turn to whether the percentage of registered voters included only \u201cactive\u201d voters or the combined total of \u201cactive\u201d plus \u201cinactive\u201d voters. According to Section 3-503(a),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> an \u201cinactive\u201d voter is one who has been placed on \u201cinactive\u201d status for failing to respond to a confirmation of address notice;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Jane Doe asserts that \u201cinactive\u201d voters should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>been combined with the number of \u201cactive\u201d voters to constitute the total number of registered voters upon which the 5% requisite number of signatures would be based. Essentially, Jane Doe asserts that the denominator of the equation, or the total number of <em>registered voters, </em>means a combination of \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d voters, while the numerator of the equation would represent the number of registered voters constituting 5% of the total. The County Board, conversely, argues that \u201cinactive\u201d voters should not be included in the denominator, because doing so would artificially inflate the number of signatures required to place the referendum on the ballot and also that for the purposes of determining the number of people supporting a referendum, an \u201cinactive\u201d voter becomes an \u201cactive\u201d one merely by affixing a signature on a referendum petition. Had \u201cinactive\u201d voters been included in the total, the requisite number of signatures would not have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Section 114 of the Montgomery County Charter refers only to the universe of registered voters: \u201cAny legislation enacted by the Council shall be submitted to a referendum of the voters upon petition of five percent of the <em>registered voters </em>of the County. ...\u201d (emphasis added). We recently had the opportunity to interpret whether the term \u201cregistered voter\u201d included \u201cinactive\u201d voters in <em>Maryland Green Party v. Maryland Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 832 A.2d 214 (2003). In that case, the Maryland Board of Elections declined to certify a nominating petition for a Congressional candidate due to a lack of verifiable signatures on the petition; among the reasons cited for the rejection of over a thousand signatures was that many of the signatures were from \u201cinactive\u201d voters. At the time of <em>Green Party, </em>Section 1-101(mm) of the Election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Law Article stated that \u201c \u2018registered voter\u2019 does not include an individual whose name is on a list of inactive voters,\u201d and Section 3-504(f)(4) provided that \u201c[[Individuals whose names have been placed on the inactive list may not be counted as part of the registry.\u201d We declared these provisions unconstitutional, because the Maryland Constitution, in speaking of registered voters, did not distinguish an \u201cinactive\u201d voter from a registered one; both are registered voters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">[Section 2 of Article I of the Maryland Constitution<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] contemplates a <em>single </em>registry for a particular area, containing the names of <em>all </em>qualified voters, leaving the General Assembly no discretion to decide who may or may not be listed therein, no discretion to create a second registry for \u201c inactive\u201d voters, and no authority to decree that an \u201cinactive\u201d voter is not a \u201cregistered voter\u201d with all the rights of a registered voter. Furthermore, \u00a7 2 provides that, once registered, the registration shall be \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence of the right to vote.

In this regard, the County Board is in essence arguing that the validation of signatures, which, for the purposes of this case, requires an election official to confirm that each entry includes the signature of the individual\u2019s name as it appears on the statewide voter registration list or at least one first name, the initials of any other names and a surname, must be construed liberally in light of the verification provisions, which require election authorities to \u201censure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a registered voter.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>We disagree that the verification provision renders the \u201cvalidation\u201d provision ambiguous; validation is a distinct step in the process that must occur before a signature can be verified.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The purpose of validation, relating to whether the signature is sufficient, is to \u201cprovide additional means by which fraudulent or otherwise improper signatures upon a referendum petition may be detected,\u201d <em>see Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72, 204 A.2d at 793, while the purpose of signature verification, relating to the existence of registration of the voter and the signature count, is to \u201censure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a registered voter.\u201d Section 6-207.

Sections 6-203 and 6-207 have been amended both recently and frequently; had the Legislature intended to overrule the standard we articulated in <em>Bames, </em>they could have done so by removing the word \"shall\u201d in any of the numerous revisions to Section 6-203. <em>See </em>2005 Maryland Laws, Chapter 572; 2002 Maryland Laws, Chapter 291, Section 4; 1998 Maryland Laws, Chapter 585, Section 2.

Because we conclude that verification and validation are two distinct steps and the verification process is not at issue in the present case, we need not address the County Board's argument that COMAR 33.06.05.02, the State Board\u2019s \"guidelines for petition verification process\u201d or the legislative history to Section 6-207, which involves only verification, render Section 6-203, governing validation, ambiguous. The Board\u2019s reliance on <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987) is inapposite for the same reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">.

Tawes, </em>225 Md. 484, 491, 171 A.2d 688 (1961), for the proposition that mandatory compliance with signature requirements would inhibit the ability to seek referendum is unconvincing. As it applies to referendum petitions, the mandatory signature requirements of Section 6-203(a)(l) are not unduly burdensome, requiring a signer to provide only a surname, one full given name, the initials of any other names, the signer\u2019s address and date of signing. Additionally, the County Board\u2019s reliance on <em>Nader for President 2004 v.

That section provides: \u201cA person aggrieved by a determination made under \u00a7 6-202, \u00a7 6-206, or \u00a7 6-208(a)(2) of this subtitle may seek judicial review!)]\u201d EL \u00a7 6-209(a)(l). Section 6-209 applies to the Board\u2019s determination that 2.5% of the County voters had signed the petition, because this determination relates to the \u201cnumber of signatures,\u201d as called for in EL section 6-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Section 6-210 establishes the time period for when a person must file a petition for judicial review.

As the circuit court explained in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">Plaintiffs ... judicially challenged the denominator too late.... [A] a judicial challenge to the fixing of the denominator should have been filed on or before February 20, 2008, and perhaps earlier. Certainly, Plaintiffs had constructive notice of the denominator no later than that day, when the first set of signatures was verified and counted by Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">The court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion made at the July 9 hearing that the date the petition was certified to the county executive is the measuring date for seeking judicial review. Certification under \u00a7 6-208 occurs at the <em>end </em>of the signature-gathering process. While it is true that \u00a7 6-209 provides for judicial review of the certification, it does not give Plaintiffs a second bite at the apple on the denominator issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\"><em>Roskelly [v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 912 A.2d 658 (2006)] mandates that where referendum petitioners are aggrieved by a rejection of signatures at the first step of the signature-gathering process, they are required to seek judicial review within 10 days of the determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">Because their request for judicial review was filed on March 14, limitations bars any remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">In <em>Roskelly, </em>a citizens group and its chair, Thomas Roskelly (collectively, \u201cRoskelly\u201d), filed a petition for referendum on a new law allowing early voting in the 2006 elections. The new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>law was passed in 2005, but then vetoed by the Governor. During the next legislative session in 2006, the legislature overrode the veto. Roskelly did not file its petition for referendum until after the override, on May 31, 2006, and he submitted 20,221 signatures in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">By letter from chief election official Linda Lamone dated June 8, 2006, the Maryland State Board of Elections rejected Roskelly\u2019s petition as untimely on the grounds that Roskelly waited until 2006 to file a petition, rather than filing it in the year the legislation originally passed. According to Lamone\u2019s letter, the Maryland Constitution required that a petition for referendum be filed in the same year as passage of the bill.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roskelly did not take any appeal from the Board\u2019s June 8, 2006 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On June 21, 2006, the Board informed Roskelly that the petition was deficient for another, independent reason, i.e., Roskelly was required under the Maryland Constitution to file one-third of the total required signatures before June 1, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Roskelly failed to file a sufficient number of valid signatures by June 1, and Lamone, after counting the signatures, notified him on June 21, 2006 that, for such additional reason, his petition was deficient. Roskelly filed a petition for judicial review within ten days of this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The Court explained how these two determinations by the Election Board interrelated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>If, as Lamone maintains and the trial court found, the June 8 letter contained a determination by Lamone, that determination was properly and timely made and mailed to the appellants, the appellants sought judicial review too late and we must affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of their action, notwithstanding the timeliness of the action with respect to signature count and validation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 46, 912 A.2d at 669-70 (emphasis added). It then summarized Roskelly\u2019s argument on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">The appellants renew in this Court the argument they advanced in the Circuit Court, that the determination by the State Administrator in the June 8 letter was premature since their May 31 submission, because it was not complete, <em>i.e. </em>did not contain the full number of the required signatures and contemplated a subsequent filing, was not the petition. Proceeding from that premise, they further argue that the signature validation process also was premature-until the complete petition is filed, they maintain, neither a determination as to the sufficiency or deficiency of the incomplete petition nor the sufficiency of the number of signatures it contains is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 47, 912 A.2d at 670 (footnote omitted). The Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s judgment dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The majority\u2019s holding in this case is comparable to Roskelly\u2019s argument that the election administrator\u2019s June 8 notification to Roskelly was interlocutory and no appeal need be taken from it. The Court in <em>Roskelly rejected </em>Roskelly\u2019s notion that there could be no appealable determination until 100% of the necessary signatures were filed. But here, the majority <em>embraces </em>that concept in holding that the Board\u2019s determination that the 13,476 validated signatures complied with the \u201cfifty percent within 75 days\u201d requirement of Montgomery County Charter Section 115, was not appealable under EL section 6-209 because it was only the first step in a two step signature gathering process.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The <em>Roskelly </em>Court\u2019s rejection of this contention, its holding that the State Administrator could make more than one appealable determination, and that it was a \u201ctwo-step pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>cess,\u201d persuades me that we should reject Doe\u2019s comparable contention in this case. In the words of Chief Judge Bell, speaking for the Court in <em>Roskelly:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-4\">To refer a law to the vote of the people requires, whether done in one step or two, the filing, before the constitutionally prescribed deadline, of a minimum number of signatures with the Secretary of State. Section 2 of Article XVI states explicitly what is to be filed, a \u201cpetition.\u201d That is true whether the filing is to be a single one or two. To be successful, both requirements-the filing of the petition and the requisite number of signatures before June 1-must be met. Although in the case of the two-step process, an additional thirty days, is afforded for the gathering and filing of the signatures, that additional time is obtainable only when the threshold filing of the petition, containing a specified number of signatures, has timely occurred. Entitlement to proceed to the second step, in other words, is dependent upon the sufficiency of the compliance in the first step____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">[Bjecause what the appellants filed was a referendum petition, the State Administrator was required to, as she did, review it, EL \u00a7 6-205(a), with an eye toward determining its sufficiency or deficiency and making the required determinations. EL \u00a7 6-206. To be sure, the State Administrator advised the appellants of her conclusion that the petition was deficient and she was not required to do more. Nevertheless ... she proceeded to verify the signatures and count the validated ones. EL \u00a7 6-210. In addition to the reasons stated, this was done, and was necessary, precisely because the appellants\u2019 right to file additional signatures was dependent on whether they had filled the required number prior to the deadline. Whether a referendum petition filed pursuant to \u00a7 3(b) is valid is determined by reference to whether it contained, when filed, the required number of valid signatures-more than one-third of the number needed to complete the petition.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 912 A.2d at 672-73 (emphasis added). This Court held that Roskelly failed to meet the ten day window for filing his petition for judicial review of the Election Board\u2019s June 8 determination that the petition was required to be filed in 2005. Doe is in a similar position here. I would apply that holding here, reasoning that when the Board accepted 13,476 of the Citizens Group\u2019s first batch of signatures on February 20, 2006, determining that they constituted one-half of the signatures required, the first step in this two-step process was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">This determination resolved the question of how many voters\u2019 signatures were needed to fulfill the requisite 2.5 % of registered voters, and correspondingly, the number that would constitute 5%. Doe had an opportunity to appeal this determination, but chose not to do so. I share the Circuit Court\u2019s view that the ten day window set by EL section 6-210(e) was the only opportunity to judicially challenge this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The majority distinguishes <em>Roskelly </em>on grounds that \u201cRoskelly, as the petition sponsor was \u2018aggrieved\u2019 on June 8 when a final determination denying certification was made.\u201d It holds that Doe was not aggrieved on February 20, and would only become aggrieved if the Citizens Group met all of the legal requirements for a referendum, including filing 100% of the requisite signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">I appreciate the difference in position between Roskelly and Doe, in that Doe\u2019s objective might have been achieved without judicial review if the Citizen\u2019s Group had failed to complete the second stage of the referendum process. But the majority cites no authority for the proposition that the term \u201caggrieved person\u201d in EL section 6-209 means that there must be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>possibility that the party seeking referendum will fail in the second stage of the process. If the legislature had intended this result, it could easily have said that no judicial review will occur until the chief election official certifies under EL section 6-208 that the petition process has been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The majority\u2019s invoking the \u201caggrieved\u201d requirement to prop up its ruling does not change the simple truth that the word \u201cfinal\u201d does not appear in either EL section 6-209 or EL 6-210. Under the majority\u2019s view, EL section 6-209(a)(1) would read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">A person aggrieved by a [final] determination made under \u00a7 6-202, \u00a7 6-206, or \u00a7 6-208(a)(2) of this subtitle may seek judicial review[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Similarly, EL section 6-210(e) would read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">[A]ny judicial review of a determination as provided in \u00a7 6-209 of this subtitle, shall be sought by the 10th day following the [final] determination to which it relates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">In ruling as it does, not only does the majority insert the word \u201cfinal\u201d into the statute, but it fails to recognize that the statute uses two different terms: \u201cdetermination[,]\u201d on the on\u00e9 hand, and \u201ccertification\u201d on the other. The latter does not occur until the \u201cconclusion of the verification and counting processes[.]\u201d EL \u00a7 6-208(a). At that time, \u201c[i]f the chief election official determines that a petition has satisfied all requirements established by law relating to that petition, the chief election official shall certify that the petition process has been completed[.]\u201d EL \u00a7 6-208(b). Instead of recognizing both \u201cdetermination\u201d and \u201ccertification\u201d as distinct words, the majority fuses the two into one term \u2014 \u201cfinal determination.\u201d To do so violates the familiar rule of statutory construction that \u201cabsent a clear intent to the contrary, a statute is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523-24, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">There is nothing else in the statute, moreover, that suggests that the legislature intended this interpretation. Adding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>these words does not resolve an inconsistency elsewhere in the statute. Nor is this interpretation more consistent with the purpose of the statute than one that treats the words as they were written. Indeed, the plain words of the statute create a more sensible statutory scheme in that they permit any legal issue about the number or geographical distribution of the required signatures to be resolved more in advance of the election. This gives election officials and the disputing sides of the issue more time to prepare for the election. The party seeking referendum has time to obtain additional or different signatures before the ninety-day deadline has expired. The party favoring the initial legislation has additional time to prepare to defend it in the minds of the voting public.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The necessity for a compressed time period in which to conduct the referendum process, including judicial review thereof, was obviously a concern for the legislature. In establishing the schedule for the referendum process in EL section 6-210, it imposed a five day limit on the election official to provide an \u201cadvance determination\u201d; it gave the chief election official only twenty days to perform the verification and counting of the validated signatures on a petition; and instituted a twenty day limitation for filing a petition for judicial review of a determination. As all of these time frames are shorter than those seen in other contexts, I discern a legislative effort to shorten the process in order to facilitate an orderly election process.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The majority justifies its insertion of the word \u201cfinal\u201d into both EL sections 6-209 and 6-210 by relying on three administrative law cases, which apply the rule that ordinarily an appeal from an administrative contested case proceeding can only be taken from a final judgment. The present case, however, fits perfectly within one of the exceptions to the rule: exhaustion is not required when the legislature \u201chas indicated its intent that a statutory administration [sic] remedy need not be invoked and exhausted under some circumstances.\u201d <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>294 Md. 225, 232 n. 4, 449 A.2d 385, 388 n. 4 (1982) (citing <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 649, 387 A.2d 260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>(1978)); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 595-96, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). Unlike the administrative law cases that are cited by the majority, this case involves the statutory referendum process. In enacting Title 6 of the Election Law Article, the legislature recognized the need for a compressed time frame that would allow a more speedy judicial resolution of a challenge to the County Board\u2019s determination than would a more typical agency decision. It clearly did so by using the term \u201ca determination\u201d rather than \u201ca final determination,\u201d \u201ccertification\u201d or other term indicating the end of the referendum petition process. <em>Cf., e.g., </em>Md.Code (1999, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 10-309(a)(1) of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cA claimant aggrieved by a final determination of the Board may file a petition for judicial review in the circuit court of the county where the injury occurred or where the claimant resides.\u201d); Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-630 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cA person aggrieved by a final determination and order of the Attorney General under Part II of this subtitle may seek judicial review.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">For the reasons stated above, I would affirm the Circuit Court, on the basis that Doe failed to file a timely petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s February 20 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Judges HARRELL and MURPHY authorize me to state that they join this Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">. Section 115 of the Montgomery County Charter provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">Any petition to refer legislation to the voters of the County shall be filed with the Board of Supervisors of Elections within ninety days after the date on which the legislation shall become law, provided that fifty percent of the required signatures accompanying the petition are filed within seventy-five days after the date when the legislation becomes law. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">. Lamone advised that \" 'a referendum effort must occur immediately after the regular session at which the legislation is initially passed. Thus, the required signatures should have been filed no later than June 1, 2005.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 33, 912 A.2d 658, 661-62 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">. Maryland Constitution, Art.

That was a determination of deficiency she was required by \u00a7 2-206(c)(5) to make. The appellants did not timely respond to this determination by seeking judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 47, 912 A.2d at 670.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
