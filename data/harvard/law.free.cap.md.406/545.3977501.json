For that particular conviction, McGlone was sentenced as a habitual offender, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>to Md.Code (1957,1982 Repl.Vol., 1986 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 64313(e),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to 25 years incarceration without the possibility of parole. In June 2007, McGlone filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, contending that his two prior convictions for crimes of violence should not have qualified as predicate convictions for an enhanced sentence because they neither occurred sequentially nor were separated by a term of confinement, as required by law. The Circuit Court denied the motion without a hearing and McGlone noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to any proceedings in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own initiative, <em>McGlone v. State, </em>402 Md. 623, 938 A.2d 825 (2008), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">1. Can two convictions that are not separated by a term of confinement qualify as two predicate convictions for purposes of sentence enhancement pursuant to Md.Code. Ann., Art. 27 \u00a7 64313(c)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">2. Is Md.Code. Ann., Art. 27 \u00a7 64313(c) ambiguous as to the requirement of sequentiality for two prior predicate convictions used for the purpose of sentence enhancement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGS\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">On June 9, 1988, McGlone was indicted by the Grand Jury for Montgomery County for various crimes relating to his conduct in the manufacturing and distribution of PCP as well as his conduct in eluding law enforcement authorities during his apprehension on April 6, 1988. On February 14, 1989, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, McGlone was convicted of sixteen of the nineteen counts contained in the indictment filed against him, including the crime of use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The Circuit Court, pursuant to \u00a7 643B(c), sentenced McGlone to 25 years incarceration without the possibility of parole for the crime of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On June 13, 2007, McGlone filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, contending that his mandatory sentence for the crime of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence was illegal because the \u201ctwo predicate convictions\u201d did not occur sequentially and were not separated by a term of confinement, as required by law. The trial court denied the motion on August 16, 2007. This appeal of the denial of the motion to correct an illegal sentence ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Predicate Convictions Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">On June 27, 1977, McGlone was indicted in New Jersey for eight criminal offenses relating to an armed robbery that occurred at the A &amp; P Food Market in Lindenwold, New Jersey on May 19,1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">On December 5, 1979, while out on bond, pending trial in New Jersey, McGlone, along with an accomplice, broke into a People\u2019s Drug Store in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, and robbed the store clerk. McGlone was subsequently arrested and indicted in Prince George\u2019s County for three criminal offenses relating to the robbery. On June 19, 1980, McGlone pled guilty to one count of robbery and was convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ed by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. He was sentenced to ten years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">On November 25, 1980, while serving the sentence for the Maryland conviction, McGlone pled guilty and was convicted in New Jersey of one count of robbery and one count of armed robbery relating to the June 27, 1977 incident. The New Jersey court sentenced McGlone to ten years incarceration for the robbery conviction, to run concurrently with the sentence McGlone was serving in Maryland. The New Jersey court also imposed a five-year sentence of incarceration for armed robbery; however, the five-year sentence was to run concurrent with the ten-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">McGlone contends that the Circuit Court erred in denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. Specifically, McGlone contends that his two prior convictions are not separated by a term of confinement and, therefore, cannot qualify as two predicate convictions for the purposes of sentence enhancement under \u00a7 643B(c). McGlone argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. 599, 613, 521 A.2d. 720, 727 (1987), requires that the \u201c[t]wo convictions must be separated by an intervening term of confinement before they may each serve as a predicate conviction for the purposes of \u00a7 643B(b).\u201d McGlone explains: \u201cThis requirement of intervening terms of confinement was necessary to enable an individual to have the opportunity to reform and rehabilitate in between the first and second convictions.\u201d He emphasizes that \u201cconcurrent sentences or concurrent terms of imprisonment are the antithesis of \u2018separate terms of confinement.\u2019 \u201d McGlone then contends that this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Montone, </em>regarding \u00a7 643B(b), is applicable in the case <em>sub judice </em>because we later stated, in <em>Minor v. State, </em>313 Md. 573, 576, 546 A.2d 1028, 1029 (1988), \u201c[a]lthough in <em>[Montone] </em>we were commenting on the operation of \u00a7 643B(b), our remarks are equally applicable to \u00a7 643B(c).\u201d Therefore, McGlone asserts: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cAs there was no intervening period of confinement between the sentence imposed in Maryland and the sentence imposed in New Jersey, [he] was denied the opportunity to reform and rehabilitate between the first and second convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The State asserts that the Circuit Court properly denied McGlone\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence because McGlone\u2019s two prior convictions, which were incurred separately, and one term of confinement, which he served, qualifies him for sentence enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 643B(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The State first disputes McGlone\u2019s reliance on <em>Minor </em>and <em>Montone, </em>arguing that he misinterprets the cases\u2019 holdings and ignores \u201cprecedent that squarely addresses the requirements for predicate offenses under \u00a7 643B(c).\u201d Specifically, the State contends that <em>\u201cMontone </em>was the interpretation of language used in \u00a7 643B(b), the so-called \u2018four strikes\u2019 statute,\u201d which is not related to \u00a7 643B(c). The State further argues that in <em>Montone, </em>the Court \u201cdeduced that the use of the terms \u2018separate\u2019 and \u2018terms of confinement,\u2019 revealed the General Assembly\u2019s intent to offer offenders an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves before \u2018locking them up and throwing away the key.\u2019 \u201d The State maintains: \u201cIn light of the legislative intent, this Court held that a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 643B(b) may be imposed, only after the offender \u2018shall have received three previous convictions,\u2019 and \u2018each conviction shall have been \u201cseparate\u201d from the others.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Second, the State argues that McGlone\u2019s position ignores the plain language difference between \u00a7\u00a7 643B(b) and (c). Specifically, according to the State, \u201c\u00a7 643B(c) does not mandate \u2018separate terms of confinement[;]\u2019 [rather,] the two convictions [must] be obtained on \u2018separate occasions,\u2019 and that the offender [must] have served \u2018at least one term of confinement.\u2019 \u201d The State then points to <em>Garrett v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 97, 474 A.2d 931, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 483, 479 A.2d 372 (1984) and <em>Simpkins v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 687, 558 A.2d 816 (1989), and contends that \u201cthe predicate offenses used for the purposes of sentence enhancement under \u00a7 643B(c) do not have to be separated by a term of confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Third, the State maintains that McGlone\u2019s reliance on the language contained in two sentences in the <em>Minor </em>opinion to argue that the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 643B(b) applies equally to \u00a7 643B(e) is misplaced. According to the State, McGlone takes the two sentences out of context, because the passage that follows the two sentences \u201cmakes clear that this Court only meant that \u00a7 643B(b) and (c) require \u2018separate\u2019 convictions, as the [same] term applies to those particular subsections.\u201d Moreover, the State cites <em>Creighton v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 124, 520 A.2d 382 (1987), and argues that \u201cone subsection\u2019s provisions should not [be] \u2018superimposed\u2019 onto another.\u201d Therefore, the State concludes: \u201cAccordingly, the plain language of \u00a7 643B(c) does not require that an offender\u2019s two felony convictions be separated by a term of confinement to qualify as predicates for sentence enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Prior to its recodification in 2002, \u00a7 643B(c) of Article 27 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">Third conviction of crime of violence. \u2014 Any person who (1) has been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence where the convictions do not arise from a single incident, and (2) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence, shall be sentenced, on being convicted a third time of a crime of violence, to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years. Neither the sentence nor any part of it may be suspended, and the person shall not be eligible for parole except in accordance with the provisions of Article 31B, \u00a7 11. A separate occasion shall be considered one in which the second or succeeding offense is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding occasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In other words, in order for a defendant to be designated a habitual offender and receive a 25 year mandatory sentence under \u00a7 643B(c), the State must prove that (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>defendant has been convicted on \u201ctwo separate occasions\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of a \u201ccrime of -violence\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (2) the two convictions arise from separate incidents; and (3) the defendant served at least one term of confinement as a result of a conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d If the State proves these elements, the sentencing judge must sentence the defendant, at a minimum, to a term of confinement not less than 25 years without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The facts in the record are clear that McGlone was convicted on two separate occasions of crimes of violence. In addition, it is clear that the convictions arose from separate incidents. McGlone was first convicted of robbery on June 19, 1980, resulting from an incident in Prince George\u2019s County on December 5, 1979. McGlone\u2019s second conviction occurred on November 25, 1980. The underlying offense for the second conviction was the June 27, 1977, armed robbery of a store clerk in a New Jersey food store. Both convictions involved crimes of violence. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum. Vol.), \u00a7 643B(a) of Article 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">It is also clear from the record that McGlone has served at least one term of confinement. Both of McGlone\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>convictions resulted in sentences of ten years incarceration, though McGlone\u2019s second sentence of ten years ran concurrent with the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">McGlone, however, contends that because his two prior convictions were not separated by a term of confinement, he is not eligible for the imposition of the mandatory 25 year sentence. McGlone\u2019s relies on our decisions in <em>Montone </em>and <em>Minor </em>to support his contention. His reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In <em>Montone v. State, supra, </em>we examined \u00a7 643B(b), what has been identified as the \u201cfour time loser\u201d sentencing provision, to determine whether Montone had been properly sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to the habitual offender provision. Specifically, we decided whether a defendant had to be convicted of three separate crimes of violence and serve three separate terms of confinement stemming from convictions of crimes of violence in order to be eligible for a mandatory life sentence. We answered in the affirmative. In coming to that conclusion, we looked at the legislative purpose of this provision. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">[Section] 643B(b)\u2019s purpose is not merely to punish. To interpret the statute\u2019s purpose as such would render the \u201cseparate\u201d and \u201cterms of confinement\u201d requirements therein superfluous. If the legislature intended \u00a7 643B(b) merely to inflict more severe punishment upon someone who is a persistent offender, the legislature would have enhanced an individual\u2019s sentence any time he had previous convictions. Rather, in \u00a7 643B(b), the legislature not only requires that before being sentenced as an habitual offender, an individual shall have received three previous convictions, it requires that each conviction shall have been \u201cseparate\u201d from the others. Moreover, \u00a7 643B(b) requires that the individual shall have actually <em>served </em>three separate terms of confinement in a correctional institution. Thus, the legislature\u2019s preoccupation with identifying those individuals incapable of rehabilitation and \u201clocking them up and throwing away the key\u201d is manifest. We cannot conclude otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">308 Md. at 612, 521 A.2d at 721 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">We then stated that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>[t]wo convictions must be separated by an intervening term of confinement before they may each serve as a predicate conviction for purposes of \u00a7 643B(b). This is so for two reasons. First, we would be thwarting the purpose of \u00a7 643B(b) if we allowed two convictions to count as two predicate convictions notwithstanding the fact that the individual was deprived of an intervening exposure to the correctional system. The purpose of \u00a7 643B(b) is to identify individuals incapable of rehabilitation and lock them up forever. The statute identifies these individuals by requiring that they have served \u201cthree separate terms\u201d within the correctional system, followed by three separate opportunities to prove that they have reformed. When an individual receives two convictions without any intervening term of confinement, he has had no opportunity to reform between his first and second convictions. Thus, the second conviction says nothing about that individual\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation. Accordingly, this second conviction cannot serve as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 643B(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Second, \u00a7 643B(b) by its terms requires that two convictions shall be separated by a term of confinement before they may qualify as two predicate convictions. Otherwise the two convictions could not result in two <em>\u201cseparate </em>terms of confinement\u201d as the statute requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">308 Md. at 613, 521 A.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">McGlone urges this Court to read into \u00a7 643B(e) the concept of \u201cseparate terms of confinement.\u201d We decline the invitation. Our analysis in <em>Montone </em>does not apply in this case. The plain language of \u00a7 643B(c) does not mandate \u201cseparate terms of confinement,\u201d as \u00a7 643B(b) does; rather, \u00a7 643B(c) requires only that the offender serve \u201cat least one term of confinement.\u201d Thus, a defendant need only serve <em>one </em>term of confinement and receive two convictions to satisfy the eligibility requirements for imposition of a mandatory sentence under \u00a7 643B(c). The required term of confinement may, therefore, occur after the first conviction, after the second conviction, or it may run concurrently with another sentence, as occurred in the case <em>sub judice, </em>without affecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the offender\u2019s eligibility for an enhanced sentence. Indeed, this statutory requirement contemplates that a sentencing judge may exercise wide discretion in fashioning a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See State v. Dopkowski, </em>325 Md. 671, 679, 602 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1992) (noting that the sentencing court has \u201cvirtually boundless discretion\u201d in imposing a sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">In arguing that this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Montone </em>is relevant to the outcome of the case <em>sub judice, </em>McGlone quotes the following two sentences from <em>Minor v. State, supra: </em>\u201cWe discussed the unique qualities of the Maryland habitual offender statute in <em>Montone v. State </em>.... Although in that case we were commenting on the operation of \u00a7 648B(b), our remarks are equally applicable to \u00a7 643B(c).\u201d McGlone\u2019s reliance on this passage of the most ephemeral obiter dicta in <em>Minor </em>is misplaced. In <em>Minor, </em>we were reviewing the constitutionality of \u00a7 643B(c). In the opening paragraphs of the opinion, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">We discussed the unique qualities of the Maryland habitual offender statute in <em>Montone v. State, </em>308 Md. 599, 521 A.2d 720 (1987). Although in that case we were commenting on the operation of \u00a7 643B(b), our remarks are equally applicable to \u00a7 643B (c). We said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">The Maryland statute requires more than merely \u201cprevious\u201d convictions; it requires <em>separate </em>convictions. Moreover, the statute\u2019s scope is narrowed by the fact that it requires not only that an individual shall have received separate convictions, but that he shall have been sentenced to, and shall have <em>actually served, </em>[a term] of confinement under the jurisdiction of the correctional system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 606, 521 A.2d at 723 (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">313 Md. at 576, 546 A.2d at 1029. It is clear from the reading of the above-quoted passage that the Court\u2019s statement relating to the applicability of <em>Montone </em>to an analysis of \u00a7 643B(c) was confined only to the quoted <em>Montone </em>passage. The Court, in discussing <em>Montone, </em>was pointing out that \u00a7\u00a7 643B(b) and (c) share two important requirements \u2014 one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>that the defendant have separate convictions for crimes of violence and, two, that the defendant have actually served the requisite number of terms of confinement for his/her crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">McGlone attempts to utilize this negligible comment from <em>Minor </em>to engulf the entire analysis of the <em>Montone </em>case as applicable to an interpretation of a criminal sentence pursuant to \u00a7 643B (c). We reject this attempt. There is no indication, and we do not take the liberty to invent such indication, that the Court\u2019s entire analysis in <em>Montone </em>is applicable to sentences fashioned pursuant to \u00a7 643B (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Therefore, we hold that the plain language of \u00a7 643B(c) does not require intervening terms of confinement between the predicate convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">McGlone next contends that while \u00a7 643B(c) is ambiguous as to the requirement of sequentiality of the two predicate convictions, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Garrett v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 97, 474 A.2d 931 (1984), \u201cimposed two separate requirements for a prior offense to count as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 643B(c)\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe convictions must be separate and, in addition, sequential.\u201d Because McGlone\u2019s two prior convictions for crimes of violence were not imposed sequentially,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> McGlone argues that these convictions cannot therefore serve as predicate convictions for the purpose of sentence enhancement under \u00a7 643B (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The State counters, asserting that the statute has been previously determined to be unambiguous in <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994), and that \u201creasoning applies with equal force in this case.\u201d Specifically, the State argues that the plain language of \u00a7 643B(c), and the intermediate appellate court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Garrett, </em>requires only that the defendant\u2019s predicate convictions precede the commission of the offense upon which the \u00a7 643B(c) sentencing is based. The State continues: \u201cMcGlone cites no authority that interprets \u00a7 643B(c) to require that the prior convictions incur in the matter he suggests____ McGlone\u2019s strained interpretation of <em>Garrett </em>is wholly unsupported by the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In essence, McGlone asks us to read into \u00a7 643B(c) a sequentiality requirement. We decline to do so. We interpret the words enacted by the Maryland General Assembly; we do not rewrite the language of a statute to add a new meaning. <em>Kushell v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005) (\u201cIn construing the plain language, \u2018[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted); <em>accord Magnetti v. University of Maryland, </em>402 Md. 548, 564-65, 937 A.2d 219, 228-29 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The statutory provision at hand contains no language which implies that each predicate offense must be committed and a defendant convicted in the sequence which McGlone advocates \u2014 commit offense one, conviction for offense one, commit offense two, conviction for offense two. Rather, a plain reading of \u00a7 643B(c) suggests that the only explicit requirement concerning sequentiality is via the definition of \u201cseparate occasion.\u201d This definition mandates that a second or succeeding conviction may serve as a predicate conviction only when the underlying offense (giving rise to the second or succeeding conviction) occurred after a charging document has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>been filed for the preceding predicate offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 643B(c) (\u201cA separate occasion shall be considered one in which the second or succeeding offense is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding occasion.\u201d). We have said that when a statute defines a term, courts utilize that definition of the term when interpreting the statute. <em>See Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 444, 903 A.2d 388, 396 (2006) (indicating that courts interpreting a statutory term initially determine if the legislature has defined the term; if the legislature has not, the court utilizes the common and popular meaning of the term). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 643B(c), convictions of crimes of violence may be utilized as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 643B(c) even if they are not obtained in a \u201ccommit offense one \u2014 conviction for offense one \u2014 commit offense two \u2014 conviction for offense two\u201d sequence. In other words, the court may utilize as a predicate conviction, a second or succeeding conviction for a crime of violence if the underlying offense (to that second or succeeding conviction) occurred prior to the first predicate conviction of a crime of violence, but after the filing of the charging document as to the first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The immediate consequence of this Court interjecting McGlone\u2019s desired sequentiality requirement into \u00a7 643B(c) would be to render the General Assembly\u2019s definition of separate occasion unworkable and meaningless. To require that the second (or succeeding) predicate offense occur after the conviction of the first predicate conviction overrides the express standard set forth by the Maryland Legislature. Specifically, \u00a7 643B(c) only requires that the second or succeeding offense occur after the charging document in the first or proceeding offense has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>McGlone was indicted for his first crime of violence on June 27, 1977. While out on bond, pending trial for that crime, McGlone committed his second crime of violence on January 9, 1978. Under the plain language of \u00a7 643B(c), McGlone\u2019s second crime of violence may be used as a predicate conviction because the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>offense for that conviction occurred after the charging document was filed for his first crime of violence. Therefore, we find no error in the sentencing judge\u2019s decision to sentence McGlone to a 25 year period of incarceration, pursuant to \u00a7 643B(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We, therefore, conclude that McGlone\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 643B (c) is not illegal. McGlone was subject to an enhanced sentence, under \u00a7 643B(c), because, prior to this most recent conviction for a crime of violence, he had been convicted of two crimes of violence on two separate occasions, arising from two separate incidents, and had served at least one term of confinement within the correctional system for those convictions. Accordingly, we affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s imposition of a sentence of 25 years incarceration without the possibility of parole for McGlone\u2019s conviction of the crime of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

And those purposes will not be, and, indeed, can not be, served unless the term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>confinement was imposed as a result of a conviction that occurred after the offender had been given the opportunity to \u201cheed\u201d the warning the prior conviction represented and reform him or herself before the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentences the statute prescribes. In other words, for the sentence enhancement prescribed by \u00a7 643B(c) to be triggered, there must be not only separate convictions, but also sequentiality of those convictions and the one required term of confinement. Without these requirements, the rehabilitative purpose of the statute is in no way served.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>McGlone was indicted for an armed robbery that occurred in May 1977 in New Jersey (offense # 1). While awaiting trial for offense # 1, McGlone was arrested in Prince George\u2019s County and charged with committing a robbery that occurred in January 1978 (offense # 2). McGlone was convicted of offense #2 in June 1980 and sentenced to ten years incarceration. While serving his sentence for offense # 2, McGlone pled guilty to offense # 1, was convicted of that offense, and was sentenced to a ten year sentence, to be served concurrently with his sentence for offense # 2. Subsequently, in 1989, McGlone was sentenced in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to twenty-five years incarceration without the possibility of parole, pursuant to \u00a7 643B (c) for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The two robbery convictions, both occurring in the same year, but in a sequence different from that in which they were committed, are the predicate convictions that are the subject of the appeal before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">When McGlone was sentenced in 1989, Article 27, \u00a7 643B(c) provided:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>\u201cThird conviction of crime of violence. </em>\u2014 Any person who (1) has been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] where the convictions do not arise from a single incident, and (2) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence, shall be sentenced, on being convicted a third time of a crime of violence, to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years. Neither the sentence nor any part of it may be suspended, and the person shall not be eligible for parole except in accordance with the provisions of Article 31B, \u00a7\u00a7 11.

He also argues that, since his convictions were not sequential, i.e. he committed offense number one, committed offense number two, was convicted for offense number two, and then convicted for offense number one, he, therefore, was improperly sentenced under \u00a7 643B(c). To test these premises, we must determine the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u00a7 643B(c), which implicates the \u201ccannons of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Chow v.

State, </em>308 Md. 599, 521 A.2d 720 (1987), considered and construed \u00a7 643B(b). In <em>Montone, </em>this Court held that the \u201cthree separate convictions of any crime of violence\u201d requirement contemplated and required sequentiality of the predicate convictions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u201cSection 643B(b) is unlike any other habitual offender statute in the country. The Maryland statute requires more than merely \u2018previous\u2019 convictions; it requires <em>separate </em>convictions. Moreover, the statute\u2019s scope is narrowed by the fact that it requires not only that an individual shall have received separate convictions, but that he shall have been sentenced to, and shall have <em>actually served, </em>three separate terms of confinement under the jurisdiction of the correctional system. Thus, the picture that emerges is one of a statute specifically designed to identify and target a unique class of people so that they may be permanently exiled from our free society. These are the violent criminals who have been exposed to the correctional system three distinct times, who have refused to conform their conduct to societal standards, and who, instead, have demonstrated violent criminal behavior after each encounter with the correctional system, thus evidencing the futility of any hope for their rehabilitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 606, 521 A.2d at 723. We further elucidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201cTwo convictions must be separated by an intervening term of confinement before they may each serve as a predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>conviction for purposes of \u00a7 643B(b). This is so for two reasons. First, we would be thwarting the purpose of \u00a7 643B(b) if we allowed two convictions to count as two predicate convictions notwithstanding the fact that the individual was deprived of an intervening exposure to the correctional system. The purpose of \u00a7 643 B(b) is to identify individuals incapable of rehabilitation and lock them up forever. The statute identifies these individuals by requiring that they have served \u2018three separate terms\u2019 within the correctional system, followed by three separate opportunities to prove that they have reformed. When an individual receives two convictions without any intervening term of confinement, he has had no opportunity to reform between his first and second convictions. Thus, the second conviction says nothing about that individual\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation. Accordingly, this second conviction cannot serve as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 643B(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 613, 521 A.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Unlike section 643B(b), the plain language of which requires separate terms of confinement for each predicate conviction, \u00a7 643B(c), on the other hand, is silent on that point. McGlone argues nevertheless that, as held in <em>Montone </em>with regard to \u00a7 643B (b), it should be construed to require a separate and sequential term of confinement. He relies on <em>Minor v. State, </em>313 Md. 573, 546 A.2d 1028 (1988). In <em>Minor, </em>this Court acknowledged that its analysis of \u00a7 643B(b) in <em>Montone </em>was equally applicable to \u00a7 643B(c), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201cWe discussed the unique qualities of the Maryland habitual offender statute in <em>Montone v.

We said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u2018The Maryland statute requires more than merely \u2018previous\u2019 convictions; it requires <em>separate </em>convictions.

State, </em>302 Md. 143, 148, 486 A.2d 179, 182 (1985).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\"><em>Minor, </em>313 Md. at 576, 546 A.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">McGlone argues, and I agree, that \u00a7 643B(b) and \u00a7 643B(c), should be construed together, the result of which, for internal consistency of the statutory scheme, would be that separate terms of confinement for each predicate conviction or, at the least, that the separate term of confinement follow a conviction that provides the offender with the opportunity for rehabilitation, is a requirement of \u00a7 643B(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The State argues that McGlone was sentenced properly pursuant to \u00a7 643B(c). In support of that argument, it relies on the clarity of the provision. Characterizing the language of the statute as plain and unambiguous, it notes that McGlone served a term of confinement and that his two prior convictions were separately incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">To be sure, \u00a7 643B(c) does provide that, \u201c[a]ny person who (1) has been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence where the convictions do not arise from a single incident, and (2) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence,\u201d is eligible for the mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years without suspension or parole, but the statute does not address the scenario where the predicate convictions are served concurrently, as in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Thus, \u00a7 643B(c), viewed by itself, clearly and unambiguously prescribes the number, and timing, of predicate convictions, as well as the requirement that a term of confinement be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>as a prerequisite to triggering the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence. So viewed, however, the statute does not define, clearly or otherwise, the interplay, if any, there is between the predicate convictions and the mandated term of confinement. Although it is clear from an isolated reading of \u00a7 643B(c), that the predicate convictions must be separate, \u00a7 643B(c) does not address whether those convictions also must be sequential. But, as we have seen, \u00a7 643B(c) does not exist in isolation; rather, it is a part of a statutory scheme that addresses the habitual offender. Accordingly, it must be interpreted in that context. So doing, given the purpose of the habitual offender statutory scheme and the interpretation given one of the related provisions by this Court, I think it clear beyond cavil that \u00a7 643B (c), far from being clear, is quite ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">This Court has recognized that, \u201c[v]ery often, a statute may be unambiguous in certain contexts but ambiguous in other contexts\u201d.

I argue, and the State conceded at oral argument, that the purpose of the habitual offender statute, including \u00a7 643B(b) and \u00a7 643B(c), is two-fold: the first objective is to punish the offender, while the second purpose is to attempt to rehabilitate him or her. It is clear from the lengthy sentence that McGlone received that the first purpose of \u00a7 643B(c), i.e. punishment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, is served. The second purpose of the statute, rehabilitation, under these facts, simply has not been engaged, never mind served. McGlone never had the opportunity to attempt to rehabilitate himself between convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tions one and two because these convictions were not separated by an intervening term of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">As mentioned earlier, this Court has previously addressed and interpreted the habitual offender statute in <em>Montone. </em>Despite the fact that <em>Montone </em>discusses a different subsection than the case <em>sub judice, </em>the two subsections are both part of a larger statutory scheme which has the same dual purposes of punishment and rehabilitation. Indeed, as we have seen, Minor says, \u201c[although in that case we were commenting on the operation of \u00a7 643B(b), our remarks are equally applicable to \u00a7 643B(e).\u201d <em>Minor, </em>313 Md. at 576, 546 A.2d at 1029. Montone notes that, \u201cwhen an individual receives two convictions without any intervening term of confinement, he has had no opportunity to reform between his first and second convictions. Thus, the second conviction says nothing about that individual\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Montone, </em>308 Md. at 613, 521 A.2d at 727. In an attempt to harmonize the provisions of the habitual offender statute and following the analysis of this statute in <em>Montone, </em>\u00a7 643B(c) should be interpreted to require that each predicate conviction be separated by separate terms of confinement for the purpose of sentence enhancement. It makes no sense, in my opinion, to require otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">McGlone also argues that because \u00a7 643B(c) is ambiguous, the rule of lenity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> must apply to his case. This Court has stated that, \u201c[f]undamental fairness dictates that the defendant understand clearly what debt he must pay to society for his transgressions. If there is doubt as to the penalty, then the law directs that his punishment must be construed to favor the milder penalty over a harsher one.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Lee, </em>317 Md. 371, 379-80, 564 A.2d 395, 399 (1989) (citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>A proper application of \u00a7 643B(c) is consistent with the rule of lenity. Strictly construing it in favor of McGlone, therefore, each predicate conviction should have been separated by intervening terms of confinement and sequential, just as is the standard pursuant to \u00a7 643B(b) and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Montone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent with the majority\u2019s holding. Article 27, \u00a7 643B(c) has the umbrella of serving the dual purpose of punishment and rehabilitation of the offender, but in actuality, it is only a punishment tool as it is currently interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">RAKER, J. has authorized me to state that she joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\">.
