Appellant challenges the validity of the officers\u2019 actions as violating the Maryland Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit. Maryland Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit, Md.Code (2001, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 2-304 to-309 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall hold that the Act was not violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>because the officers reasonably suspected that Bost had committed a felony when they crossed into Maryland and they had probable cause to arrest Bost at the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Appellant, Robert Bost, was indicted by the Grand Jury for Prince George\u2019s County on charges of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, possession of cocaine, wearing a dangerous weapon concealed on or about the person, and use of a machine gun for an aggressive purpose, which the State later amended to carrying a handgun on or about his person. Bost filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized by the police incident to his arrest, arguing that the out-of-state District of Columbia Metropolitan police, in arresting appellant in Maryland, acted in violation of the Maryland Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence. Various officers from the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department testified that, on November 29, 2005, sixteen Metropolitan police officers in four unmarked cars were patrolling the 800 block of Southern Avenue, SE, in Washington, D.C., as part of a Focus Mission Unit targeting street level narcotics and firearm recovery in high crime areas. The block divides the District of Columbia and Maryland. At approximately 6:00 p.m., three officers, wearing jackets with \u201cPolice\u201d written across them, left their vehicle and walked towards about a dozen people who were drinking alcohol on the sidewalk in a no-loitering area. Officer Phillip testified that he \u201cconducted a \u2018contact\u2019,\u201d at which time, one of the people, later identified as Robert Bost, immediately left, walking away \u201cin a briskful manner\u201d while clutching his right waistband with his right elbow. Officer Phillip said that Bost started picked up his pace, and \u201cimmediately took flight on foot crossing the street onto the Prince George\u2019s County side.\u201d Officer Phillip testified that he had reasonable, articulable suspicion that Bost was concealing something and that based upon his experience, he believed that Bost was \u201ctrying to conceal a weapon\u201d and because Bost was \u201cholding ... his waistband, continuously looking back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Bost ran into a wooded area, falling several times, each time clutching at his right side. The officers followed in pursuit, eventually crossing into Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Once in Maryland, the officers caught up to Bost and physically restrained him on the ground. As one officer attempted to grab Bost\u2019s elbows to turn him onto his side, the officer felt a metal object and indicated to the other officers \u201cgun, gun.\u201d The officer unzipped Bost\u2019s jacket and discovered a black nine millimeter semiautomatic pistol with 21 rounds of ammunition. The gun was tied around Bost\u2019s neck to his body. Bost was arrested, and a further search incident to arrest revealed two large, white, rock-like substances and $140 from the pocket of Bost\u2019s pants. The Metropolitan Police immediately contacted Prince George\u2019s County officials, who responded and took custody of Bost.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The trial court denied Bost\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence. The trial court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201cThis is one of those difficult cases where you have to balance a person\u2019s right to run I suppose versus the police department and law enforcement in general\u2019s right to inquire based on the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cThe facts are fairly clear, the defendant is in a drug trafficking area known to the police department in the District of Columbia. A group of people that number between 12 and 15 I believe. When the police arrive the defendant took flight clutching at his waistband. Certainly the police department and the police officers involved in this instance based on their training, experience, had cause to believe that crime was afoot here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cIn chasing the defendant, after ordering him to stop several times, he continued to clutch at his side as if he had a weapon or something else illegal. Of course, they couldn\u2019t tell at the time. The question is do they have a right to inquire? I think they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201cI will deny the motion to suppress for those reasons. I think they had a right to inquire. I appreciate the argument of counsel, it is certainly to his credit. I will deny the motion to suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Following the court\u2019s ruling, the case proceeded to trial before the court on a not guilty plea, agreed statement of facts, to the possession with intent to distribute cocaine and carrying a handgun on or about his person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court found Bost guilty and sentenced him to three years incarceration, with all but one year suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Bost noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court, on its own initiative, issued a writ of certiorari before the intermediate court decided the appeal to consider the ruling of the Circuit Court on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Bost v. State, </em>402 Md. 352, 936 A.2d 850 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Appellant presents a single argument to this Court. He argues that the Circuit Court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, because the Metropolitan police officers violated the Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit. In particular, appellant maintains that the Metropolitan officers lacked the authority to cross the state line into Maryland under \u00a7 2-305 of the Act, which grants the authority for an out-of-state officer \u201cwho enters this State in fresh pursuit and continues within this State in fresh pursuit of a person to arrest the person on the ground that the person is believed to have committed a felony in the other state.\u201d Appellant contends that the Metropolitan Police Officers did not have reasonable grounds to believe that Bost had committed a felony in the District of Columbia at the time the officers crossed into Maryland. He maintains that the fact that appellant was observed clutching his waistband did not give rise to a reasonable belief that a felony had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The State presents three arguments to support the search and seizure. First, the State contends that the Metropolitan police officers were authorized under the Act to enter into Maryland in fresh pursuit because they in fact had reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant had committed a felony. The State argues that the Act requires only reasonable suspicion at the time officers cross the border into Maryland, and not probable cause. Under this analysis, the State argues that the totality of the circumstances involved \u2014 including factors such as the high crime area in which Bost was located, Bost\u2019s unprovoked flight from police, and the police officer\u2019s experience and training in recognizing behavior such as Bost\u2019s clutching at his waistband as consistent with possession of a concealed weapon \u2014 meets the standard of reasonable suspicion. Second, the State argues that the arrest was lawful because one of the District of Columbia police officers had been deputized by the United States Marshal Service and therefore, while on duty, he is authorized to go anywhere to investigate cases and to arrest outside of the District of Columbia. Finally, the State argues that even if the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>was violated, the evidence should not be suppressed because the Act does not contain an exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In reviewing the ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we consider only the evidence contained in the record of the suppression hearing. <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 82-83, 939 A.2d 689, 697 (2008). We extend great deference to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and those findings will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 939 A.2d at 697. We review the evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. We make our own independent appraisal as to whether a constitutional right has been violated by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Appellant does not contend that the police officers lacked probable cause to arrest him. Nor does he contend that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. His argument on appeal rests solely on an interpretation of the Uniform Act found at \u00a7 2-305 of the Criminal Law Article. Appellant claims that the Metropolitan police officers lacked the authority under the statute to cross the border into Maryland at the time they did so, and that the statute would be ineffective unless read broadly to include an exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to determine whether the Act was violated, we look to the canons of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 645, 943 A.2d 1260, 1264 (2008). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>construing a statute, we look first to the plain language of the statute, and if that language is clear and unambiguous, we look no further than the text of the statute. <em>Ishola v. State, </em>404 Md. 155, 160, 945 A.2d 1273, 1276 (2008). A plain reading of the statute assumes none of its language is superfluous or nugatory. <em>Tribbitt, supra, </em>403 Md. at 646, 943 A.2d at 1264. \u201cWe neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 662, 911 A.2d 1245, 1250 (2006) (quoting <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654 (2001)). We have often stated that if the language of the statute is not ambiguous, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends. <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443-44, 903 A.2d 388, 395 (2006). If the meaning of the plain language is ambiguous or unclear, to discern legislative intent, we look to the legislative history, prior case law, the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based, and the statute as a whole. <em>Stoddard, supra, </em>395 Md. at 662, 911 A.2d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit, including Maryland\u2019s version of the model act, \u201cconsists of a grant of authority from the enacting state to officers from other states, permitting those officers to enter the enacting state.\u201d <em>State v. Meyer, </em>183 Or.App. 536, 53 P.3d 940, 944 (Or.Ct.App.2002). The Maryland Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201c(a) A member of a state,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] county, or municipal law enforcement unit of another state who enters this State in fresh pursuit and continues within this State in fresh pursuit of a person to arrest the person on the ground that the person is believed to have committed a felony in the other state has the same authority to arrest and hold the person in custody as has a member of a duly organized State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>county, or municipal corporation law enforcement unit of this State to arrest and hold a person in custody on the ground that the person is believed to have committed a felony in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u201c(b) This section does not make unlawful an arrest in this State that would otherwise be lawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00a7 2-305. Based on a plain reading, the statute authorizes a state, county, or municipal law enforcement officer of another state to enter Maryland if in \u201cfresh pursuit.\u201d Both Maryland and the District of Columbia expressly permit officers from the other jurisdiction to enter their respective state territories for the purpose of pursuing persons (in hot pursuit) who reasonably are believed to have committed a felony. A valid arrest requires probable cause. U.S. Const. amend. IV; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>356 Md. 498, 504, 740 A.2d 615, 618 (1999). In keeping with the law of arrest, the Act requires that the officer have probable cause at the time of the arrest. In order to determine whether the officer has authority to enter into Maryland, however, it is necessary to examine the concept of \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d and its statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The Act, in \u00a7 2-304(b), defines fresh pursuit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201c(b) \u2018Fresh pursuit\u2019 includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">(1) fresh pursuit as defined by the common law;[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>(2) pursuit without unreasonable delay, but not necessarily instant pursuit, of a person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">(i) has committed or is reasonably suspected of having committed a felony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">(ii) is suspected of having committed a felony, although a felony has not been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We focus on the language of \u00a7 2 \u2014 304(b)(2)(i), which includes pursuit of one who \u201cis reasonably suspected of having committed a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Under the Act, an out-of-state officer is authorized to enter Maryland to arrest and hold a person in custody if that officer has reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a felony. \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d is a less demanding standard than probable cause. <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 675, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Sokolow, </em>reasonable suspicion is more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 \u201d but is \u201cconsiderably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d and less than probable cause, which is \u201c\u2018a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sokolow, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1585. While less than probable cause is required under the Act, nonetheless, \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d requires that the officer articulate more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 \u201d of criminal activity. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Our reading of the statute conforms with the purpose of the Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit, which is to extend authority to officers from other jurisdictions to cross state lines to arrest criminals who might otherwise use state lines to escape apprehension. The Council of State Governments, The Handbook on Interstate Crime Control 119 (Rev. ed.1966), states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the Uniform Act on Interstate Fresh Pursuit is to prevent criminals from utilizing state lines to handicap our police in their apprehension. At the present time our most desperate criminals head straight across state lines after the commission of a crime, knowing that there is comparative safety beyond the border. For in the foreign state the pursuing officer from the state wherein the crime was committed is, in general, no longer an officer. This abnormality, so contrary to all justice and reason, is remedied in a simple manner by the Fresh Pursuit Act. Thereunder, the moment an officer in fresh pursuit of a criminal crosses a state line, the state he enters will authorize him to catch and arrest such criminal within its bounds. The statute grants this right only when the officer is in fresh pursuit of a criminal, that is, pursuit without unreasonable delay, by a member of a duly organized peace unit, and only in cases of felonies or supposed felonies occurring outside the boundaries of the state adopting the act. It is thus based upon the little-known common-law doctrine of fresh pursuit, from which the statute has derived its name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2d\">Thus the overall intent is a grant of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reached the same conclusion when considering the Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit in <em>Hutchinson v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 160, 380 A.2d 232 (1977). In <em>Hutchinson, </em>a Montgomery County police officer entered into the District of Columbia and arrested Hutchinson in relation to a homicide. Hutchinson was convicted and sentenced for felony murder and use of a handgun in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Hutchinson appealed, arguing that, among other things, the arrest by a Montgomery County officer in the District of Columbia was unlawful. It was clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>that the officer had probable cause at the time of Hutchinson\u2019s arrest, but not at the point at which the officer crossed the border into the District of Columbia, following Hutchinson\u2019s car. Interpreting the District of Columbia statute, which mirrors essentially the Maryland statute, the Court of Special Appeals stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">\u201cWas the statute intended to blind the eye and stop the ear of an officer who <em>entered </em>the District under its authority? We think not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cThe circumstances in <em>State v. Tillman, </em>208 Kan. 954, 494 P.2d 1178 (1972), closely parallel the subject case. Both Kansas and Missouri had enacted the Uniform Law on Fresh Pursuit. In <em>Tillman, </em>as here, the arresting officers <em>entered </em>the foreign State without probable cause to arrest. In <em>Tillman, </em>as here, a missing factor essential to probable cause was supplied by knowledge gained in the foreign State. The Supreme Court of Kansas, sustaining the validity of the arrest, said at 1182:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201c \u2018In the case at bar the robbers fled from the scene of the robbery in Kansas City, Kansas, to Kansas City, Missouri, where they were apprehended 90 minutes later. The pursuit was continuous, uninterrupted and without unreasonable delay. It was a \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d; hence the arrest of the appellants by the Kansas police officers in Missouri was a valid arrest since the police had actual knowledge that the robbery had been committed and since the appellants were identified [in Missouri] as the robbers by Craig (Moon) Davis prior to their arrest at Southtown Motors.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 168-69, 380 A.2d at 236-37 (emphasis in original). The court then reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201c[T]he Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit should not be so narrowly construed as to alter the firmly fixed rule of law that the existence of probable cause at the time of an arrest should be the measure of its validity. We think that the statute intended no such alteration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cAccordingly, we hold that the statute was intended to permit any member of an organized peace unit of any State to <em>enter </em>in fresh pursuit; to <em>continue </em>in fresh pursuit within the District; and <em>to arrest the person pursued, whom he has probable cause to believe, at the time of arrest, committed a felony in the place of the officer\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 172, 380 A.2d at 238 (emphasis in original). Implicit in the court\u2019s holding was that probable cause was not required when the officer crossed into the District of Columbia in fresh pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Our holding comports with the standard adopted by several states that have examined the issue. In <em>State v. Ferrell, </em>218 Neb. 463, 356 N.W.2d 868 (1984), the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that requiring probable cause at the time of crossing the state line into Iowa \u201cis too strict an interpretation of the statute which authorizes pursuit of a person \u2018who is reasonably <em>suspected </em>of having committed a felony.\u2019 This is sufficient to authorize an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 870 (emphasis in original); <em>see also State v. Joy, </em>637 So.2d 946, 948 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994) (finding, when interpreting the Florida Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 901.25 (2004), that \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that the truck was speeding justifiefd] the extraterritorial stop under a fresh pursuit theory\u201d). One commentator notes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cIn some states, fresh pursuit statutes have been interpreted to authorize not only pursuit in order to arrest, but also pursuit for the purpose of conducting a <em>Terry </em>stop <em>[Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)]. <em>State v. Merchant, </em>490 So.2d 336, 339 (La.Ct.App.1986); <em>State v. Dahlheimer, </em>413 N.W.2d 255, 257 (Minn.Ct.App. 1987); <em>Commonwealth v. Montgomery, </em>513 Pa. 138, 144, 518 A.2d 1197, 1201 (1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 935, 107 S.Ct. 1579, 94 L.Ed.2d 769 (1987). The justification generally given is that police need not have probable cause to arrest at the time they cross their jurisdictional limits, but only at the time they make the arrest. <em>Montgomery, </em>513 Pa. at 144-46, 518 A.2d at 1200-01. One court has noted also its belief that a close pursuit stop is within the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>state fresh pursuit statute. <em>State v. Bickham, </em>404 So.2d 929, 932 (La.1981). In dissent, one justice has argued that investigation should not justify fresh pursuit because the purpose of a <em>Terry </em>stop is to prevent presently occurring criminal activity, whereas the purpose of fresh pursuit is the apprehension of a suspect where a crime has already been committed. <em>Montgomery, </em>513 Pa. at 147-49, 518 A.2d at 1202 (Zappala, J., dissenting).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Judith V.

Reviewing whether reasonable suspicion exists, we have stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\">\u201cWhile there is no litmus test to define the \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 standard, it has been defined as nothing more than \u2018a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity,\u2019 and as a common sense, nontechnical conception that considers factual and practical aspects of daily life and how reasonable and prudent people act---- Moreover, \u2018[w]hen evaluating the validity of a detention, we must examine the totality of the circumstances the whole picture.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-10\"><em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 415-16, 765 A.2d 612, 616 (2001) (internal citations omitted). The test is \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\u201d viewed through the eyes of a reasonable, prudent, police officer. In <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 391-92, 735 A.2d 491, 510 (1999), we explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">\u201c[A] police officer, \u2018by reason of training and experience, may be able to explain the special significance of ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>observed facts.\u2019 Thus, conduct that appears innocuous to the average layperson may in fact be suspicious when observed by a trained law enforcement official. The Fourth Amendment, however, does not allow the law enforcement official to simply assert that apparently innocent conduct was suspicious to him or her; rather the officer must offer \u2018the factual basis upon which he or she bases the conclusion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990), the Supreme Court elaborated on the concept of reasonable suspicion, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">\u201cReasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause ... [An] unverified tip from [a] known informant might not have been reliable enough to establish probable cause, but nevertheless found it sufficiently reliable to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. Reasonable suspicion, like probable cause, is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability. Both factors \u2014 quantity and quality \u2014 are considered in the \u2018totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture,\u2019 that must be taken into account when evaluating whether there is reasonable suspicion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416 (internal citations omitted). In <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981), former Chief Justice Burger discussed the appropriate test, the totality of the circumstances test, pointing out that it contains two interdependent analytical techniques:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201cThe idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion contains two elements, each of which must be present before a stop is permissible. First, the assessment must be based upon all of the circumstances. The analysis proceeds with various objective ob-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>serrations, information from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions\u2014 inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The United States Supreme Court has made clear that unprovoked flight is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). The Court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cIn this case, moreover, it was not merely respondent\u2019s presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking that aroused the officers\u2019 suspicion, but his unprovoked flight upon noticing the police. Our cases have also recognized that nervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion. <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 885, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975); <em>Florida v. Rodriguez, </em>469 U.S. 1, 6, 105 S.Ct. 308, 83 L.Ed.2d 165. 469 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 308, 83 L.Ed.2d 165 (1984) <em>(per curiam); United States v. Sokolow, </em>[490 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)]. Headlong flight\u2014 wherever it occurs \u2014 is the consummate act of evasion: [i]t is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such. In reviewing the propriety of an officer\u2019s conduct, courts do not have available empirical studies dealing with inferences drawn from suspicious behavior, and we cannot reasonably demand scientific certainty from judges or law enforcement officers where none exists. Thus, the determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior. <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981).

On the other hand, however, the trial court\u2019s determination as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>whether, or not, the facts found rise to the level of reasonable suspicion is reviewed <em>de novo. Stokes v.

Stated differently, we make our \u201cown independent constitutional appraisal [of the ultimate constitutional question], by reviewing the law and applying it to the peculiar facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>343 Md. at 457, 682 A.2d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">With regard to this latter point, this Court has recognized that, determining whether certain facts give rise to \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d of criminal conduct is not an exact science. <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. at 507, 924 A.2d at 1141. We have made clear, however, that, in order for there to be \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d there must be \u201ca particularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting that the person stopped has engaged in, or committed, criminal activity. <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 507, 924 A.2d 1129, 1141 (2007) (citing <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, 629 (1981)). A similar, if not the identical, definitional conundrum is presented by our fresh pursuit statute\u2019s requirement that the trigger for pursuit be that the person pursued be \u201creasonably suspected of having committed a felony\u201d or that \u201cthere is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed.\u201d The <em>Longshore </em>formulation addresses that issue and applies as well to this case. Thus, applying the <em>Longshore </em>test, in order to pursue Bost into Maryland, the D.C. police officers had to have a \u201cparticularized and objective\u201d basis to believe that Bost had committed a felony, not just simply that he was engaged in unspecified, generalized criminal conduct. A mere \u201chunch\u201d by D.C. police officers that the conduct they actually observed was felonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>would not be sufficient under the Act. <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 508, 924 A.2d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The only conduct that Officer Phillip and his fellow law enforcement officers observed was Bost clutching his side as he walked away from a group of approximately twelve men, whom they observed were drinking alcohol in open containers in a \u201chigh crime area.\u201d Officer Phillip never saw a gun; he never saw anything resembling a weapon in Bost\u2019s possession when he made his way toward the group; and he never saw drugs, either being used or exchanged. There are many reasonable inferences that could be drawn from Bost\u2019s conduct, not least of which is that he wanted to avoid getting in trouble for drinking beer from an open container in public. That surely is not a felony. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 25-1001 (2005) (punishing consumption of alcohol in public places in D.C. as a misdemeanor). Perhaps Bost, as he was certainly permitted to do, notwithstanding his presence in a \u201chigh crime area,\u201d simply decided that he did not want to talk to the police and was clutching his newspaper, or some other innocent object, one that he may not have wanted the police to see, under his arm as he walked away. The possibilities of what Bost might have been clutching are endless. To be sure, those possibilities may have included objects that were illegal to possess, i.e. drugs or weapons; but to concede that is merely to concede what the police believed, that Bost was engaged in criminal conduct, the nature of which was not and could not be known in any particularized or objective manner until, as done in this case, he was stopped and searched. The point is this: there was nothing about Bost\u2019s behavior that could possibly lead one reasonably to believe that Bost had committed a felony. True, his conduct might have been suspicious to the police and it may well have justified the belief that he was engaged in \u201csome\u201d criminal conduct. That conduct was not such as to justify a belief that a felony had been or was being committed. The Fresh Pursuit Act required of Officer Phillip more than just suspicion; he had to reasonably suspect Bost of having committed a felony and there must have been reasonable ground for believing that that was so.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The majority\u2019s decision today allows a law enforcement officer\u2019s invocation of \u201cbuzzwords\u201d \u2014 \u201chigh crime area,\u201d \u201cmy training and my experience,\u201d \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d \u2014 to substitute for the judicial function. The trial court\u2019s ruling at the suppression hearing makes, and emphasizes, the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">\u201c[The Court]: The facts are fairly clear, the defendant is in a drug trafficking area known to the police department in the District of Columbia. A group of people that number between 12 and 15 I believe. When the police arrive the defendant took flight[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] clutching at his waistband. Certainly the police officers involved in this instance based on their training, experience, had cause to believe that crime was afoot here. In chasing the defendant, after ordering him to stop several times, he continued to clutch at his side as if he had a weapon or something else illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">It is significant that the motions judge acknowledged the lack of particularization and objectivity with regard to what, if any, criminal conduct was observed or was afoot, noting only that the officers\u2019 experience led them to believe crime was afoot and conceding that the defendant was acting \u201cas if he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>weapon or something else illegal.\u201d The trial court, in this case, failed to heed the admonition given by Judge Wilner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALW\">\u201cThe command that we generally respect the inferences and conclusions drawn by experienced police officers does not require that we abandon our responsibility to make the ultimate determination of whether the police have acted in a lawful manner or that we \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 conduct simply because the officer believed he had a right to engage in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhzB\"><em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 110-11, 816 A.2d 901, 908 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Not once does the motions judge\u2019s ruling mention the word \u201cfelony\u201d or even engage in an analysis of whether the objective facts of Officer Phillip\u2019s \u201ccontact\u201d with Bost rose to the level sufficient to give an officer reasonable suspicion to believe that Bost had committed a felony. The closest the trial court comes to mentioning any sort of felony at all is hypothecating that Bost could have had a \u201cweapon.\u201d But this mere mentioning of a weapon by the trial court does not negate the fact that the majority of the trial court\u2019s ruling seemed to be determining merely whether there was reasonable suspicion to believe that some crime had taken place. In fact, the part of the trial court\u2019s ruling that states that the officers \u201chad cause to believe that crime was afoot here\u201d is telling, because that it not the standard that must be met under the Fresh Pursuit Act. Instead, the trial court had to determine whether there was reasonable suspicion to believe that a \u201cfelony\u201d was afoot here. This standard clearly was not properly applied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Judge Wilner\u2019s admonition is not limited to trial courts; it applies as well to appellate courts, and perhaps it is more important that it be heeded by such courts. The majority did not engage in the proper analysis nor apply the proper standard and, thus, \u201c \u2018rubber stamp[ed]\u2019 conduct simply because the officer believed he had a right to engage in it.\u201d <em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. at 110-11, 816 A.2d at 908. In so doing, the majority, in effect, \u201cabandon[s][its] responsibility to make the ultimate determination of whether the police have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>acted in a lawful manner.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZD\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">HARRELL, J. and GREENE, J. have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\">. Md.Code (2001, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 2-304(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\" 'Fresh pursuit' includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">\u201c(1) fresh pursuit as defined by the common law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">\"(2) pursuit without unreasonable delay, but not necessarily instant pursuit, of a person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">\"(i) has committed or is reasonably suspected of having committed a felony, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">\"(ii) is suspected of having committed a felony, although a felony has not been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">Subsection (b)(2) prescribes two scenarios justifying fresh pursuit of a suspected person into Maryland: subsection (b)(2)(i), when the suspect has committed a felony, and subsection (b)(2)(ii), when the suspect is only suspected of committing a felony, but did not. These two subsections do not state that different standards apply when a felony has or has not been committed. Instead, the use of \"reasonable ground\u201d in (b)(2)(h) merely restates the standard of \"reasonably suspected\" in (b)(2)(i). These two formulations are, in essence, synonymous with each other; there simply is not any substantive difference between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\"reasonably suspected\u201d and \u201creasonable ground for believing\u201d when determining if an out-of-state law enforcement officer was indeed in \"fresh pursuit\u201d under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">. Maryland Rule 8-131 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">\"(a) Generally. The issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court. Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">. In <em>Watkins v. State, </em>288 Md. 597, 420 A.2d 270 (1980), this Court upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction, after ruling that the police had a reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop where that officer, approaching a group of 30 to 50 people standing on the corner while responding to a call for assistance from another police officer involved in a foot pursuit in a high-crime area, heard someone yell \"run, police\u201d and immediately thereafter observed the defendant running. <em>Watkins, </em>288 Md. at 599, 420 A.2d at 271. Although the defendant in <em>Watkins </em>was not one of the people originally being pursued, he still was arrested and subsequently convicted of serious drug charges. <em>Watkins, </em>288 Md. at 598-99, 420 A.2d at 271. Judge Cole\u2019s comments about the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Watkins </em>are instructive and warrant repeating here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\"The Court\u2019s decision today has the potential for becoming a true chimera, especially in the economically depressed areas of the State where police-community relations are, to say the least, strained. The Court gives license to the police to stop any individual who runs when the police happen upon the scene.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\"><em>Watkins v. State, </em>288 Md. 597, 617, 420 A.2d 270, 281 (1980) (Cole, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">. In <em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 816 A.2d 901 (2003), Judge Raker, author of the majority opinion in this case, wrote a concurring opinion in which she rejected the State\u2019s contention that sufficient grounds existed for police officers to conduct <em>a-Terry </em>stop. In <em>Ransome, </em>the defendant was either standing or walking on the sidewalk with an acquaintance in a high-crime neighborhood in Baltimore City when the police began to observe the defendant from an unmarked car. <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 101, 816 A.2d at 902. As the police brought their cruiser near the defendant, the defendant turned to look at the cruiser. <em>Id. </em>One of the police officers regarded this as suspicious and noted that the defendant had a bulge in his pants pocket, which the officer thought could have been a gun. Subsequently, the police approached the defendant and, eventually, conducted a <em>Terry </em>stop which revealed large quantities of drugs. <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 101-02, 816 A.2d at 902. In her concurring opinion, Judge Raker made a point that has particular relevance to the circumstances presented in this case: \"[i]f Ransome\u2019s actions were sufficient to warrant a <em>Terry </em>stop, then anyone standing on a corner, talking with a friend in the late evening, in a high-crime area, with an unidentified \u2018bulge\u2019 in a pocket, may be stopped.\" <em>Ransome </em>v. <em>State, </em>373 Md. 99, 114, 816 A.2d 901, 910 (2003) (Raker, J., concurring). The only fact that is different in this case is that Bost ran. The principle, however, is the same: the courts must not succumb to the temptation of allowing law enforcement officers to invoke the \"buzz words\u201d found in the statute to justify their actions. Unless the courts, both on the trial and appellate levels, take these standards seriously, there will be no protection against illegal stops and intrusions by overzealous law enforcement officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
