The Motor Lodge and the bar are in Prince George\u2019s County. A van approached and cornered the women between several parked cars. Three men got out of the van. One of them, later identified as Raymond Leon Adams, was carrying a gun. Adams, threatening to shoot the women, ordered them to get into the van. Adams grabbed Kathy P., struck her over her head, and, together with other men, pushed her into the van. The vehicle, with Kathy P. inside, sped off on Branch Avenue in the direction of the District of Columbia. Adams drove the van. It was stipulated at trial that it is between a mile and a mile and a half from the Prince George\u2019s Motor Lodge to the District of Columbia border.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Shortly after being forced into the van, Kathy P, was ordered to remove her jewelry and forcibly stripped of her clothing. One of the other male occupants in the van, later identified as William Raleigh Knight, raped her at gunpoint within minutes of the abduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly after the first rape, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the van turned right off of Branch Avenue and went the wrong way on a one-way street. The van was involved in a minor accident with another vehicle. Kathy P. then endured a series of sexual attacks and rapes by several men. She estimated that approximately fifteen minutes elapsed between the kidnapping and this series of sexual attacks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kathy P. said she asked her abductors whether they were still in Maryland. They responded that they were in Maryland, however, she testified that she did not believe them because they laughed while responding. Just over two hours after the abduction, Kathy P. was pushed out of the van in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. She knocked on the door of a nearby apartment and was able to contact the Prince George\u2019s County Police for assistance. Teresa B. identified the driver of the van as Adams and also identified the passenger in the van as William Raleigh Knight. Kathy P. identified Adams in a photo array shortly after the attack, as well as again several days later and yet again at trial. Adams also was identified by a District of Columbia police officer who stopped Adams while he was driving a van matching the description of the van used in the abduction and attacks. A search of the van revealed three used prophylactics, and a scarf and comb belonging to Kathy P. It was stipulated at trial that Kathy P. suffered physical injuries consistent with a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Adams was charged with kidnapping, robbery with a deadly weapon, six counts of first degree rape, and three counts -of first degree sex offense. At his 1979 trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Adams contended that the rapes occurred outside the State of Maryland, and thus Maryland did not have jurisdiction to try him for the crimes. The State presented two counter-arguments. First, the State contended that the evidence showed that the rapes, in fact, did occur in Maryland. Second, the State argued that, even assuming that the rapes occurred in the District of Columbia, the State could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>assert jurisdiction under Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 465. Section 465 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">If a person is transported by any means, with the intent to violate this subheading [sexual offenses] and the intent is followed by actual violation of this subheading, the defendant may be tried in the appropriate court within whose jurisdiction the county lies where the transportation was offered, solicited, begun, continued or ended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl-Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Adams retorted that \u00a7 465 addressed the matter of venue, not the territorial jurisdiction, of a particular court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Adams further contended that Maryland had \u201cno authority to legislate itself into having jurisdiction over acts that do not occur within the State.\u201d After several lengthy discussions of jurisdiction at different stages of the trial, the trial court denied Adams\u2019s motions and ruled that the question would be submitted to the jury. At that point, the following discussion took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Court: ... I think I am going to solve this problem very easily. I am going to instruct on the statute, and also add the question to be decided by the jury where all these acts took place. At this time I may agree with [the State\u2019s Attorney]. Maybe at a later time I may disagree with you. If the jury can make a finding it might solve a lot of problems, if this case went to the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals and there was a specific finding in that regard by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Defense Counsel: Your Honor, I hate to interrupt the Court, but I think this is the very issue we addressed earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">Defense Counsel: The State has not shown anything upon which the jury can make that determination. And that is why I submit to the Court that this should not be passed to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">Court: ... [A]ll that I know is that the intent started out in a Prince George\u2019s County motel. All I have in front of me at this time is that is where it started. I have testimony from [Kathy P.] that sexual assaults were inflicted on her while the van was in motion, and that subsequent sexual assaults were inflicted on her at various places, and she was told they were in Maryland. Whether she believed what they told her or she didn\u2019t believe that makes no difference. Nobody has told me that this incident didn\u2019t occur in the State of Maryland. There is no evidence in this case at all that this didn\u2019t occur in Maryland, at this juncture. And if somebody does testify that they occurred in the District of Columbia that then becomes in my judgment a factual issue that a jury then can make a determination on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">At this juncture all that I know is it started out and it occurred in Maryland, and that is all I have in front of me. If someone gets up and says it occurred elsewhere I think that it is perfectly reasonable to let a jury make a \u2014 that is one of the issues a jury may have to determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">If this case is ever appealed, or he is convicted and I make a subsequent ruling the statute applies out of state, and the Court of Appeals says I am wrong, or the jury says that it did happen in the District and I am wrong, that ends it right then and there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">Do you [to the State\u2019s Attorney] think that is a solution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArJ\">State\u2019s Attorney: I don\u2019t really know. It is a good procedure to get the jury to come back with specific findings of fact in a case like this, obviously, if this case is appealed to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Court: How would the Court of Appeals know how the jury made a determination, based on what you told me? In other words, you want me to instruct them on the statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">State\u2019s Attorney: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Court: That if this defendant formed the intention to commit a sexual assault on this lady, and he formed that intention in the State of Maryland, and they so find, the fact that it happened in the District of Columbia makes no difference, that it could happen anywhere as long as he formed that intention, that is what you say the purpose of the statute is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">State\u2019s Attorney: That is correct, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">Court: All right. If they find it happened in the District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">Now suppose I agree with you and say you are absolutely right in your interpretation, then this case goes to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals says this is not the law, didn\u2019t have any jurisdiction because it happened \u2014 they don\u2019t really know where it happened. How does the Court of Appeals know where it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">State\u2019s Attorney: Well, I guess they don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t think there is any reason for the statute to exist\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">Court: You don\u2019t think there is any reason for the statute to exist other than this? You may be absolutely right. You don\u2019t want to submit it to the jury on special issue as to this, but you want them instructed that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">States Attorney: Special Instruction as to the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG4\">Court: Well all right. But you think the statute is applicable. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">State\u2019s Attorney: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">Court: Do you [to Defense Counsel] agree with that, there should be a special issue before the jury as to where this sexual act occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">Defense Counsel: Assuming that the Court is ruling that this issue goes to the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-15\">Court: Yes, that is a pretty good assumption at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">Defense Counsel: I understand that your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">Defense Counsel: I would submit that the Court\u2019s proposed method is the better method, and I would ask the Court to do that, to get a specific finding as to whether or not the incidents involving the sexual acts and the rapes took place in the District of Columbia or Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">Court: All of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">Defense Counsel: Assuming all of them go to the jury, your Honor, I would assume those questions would have to be answered definitely. I think the jury does have to find\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbD\">Court: Let\u2019s assume I do it that way, what is the burden of proof on that issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">Defense Counsel: It is the same as the burden for any other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">Court: Anything else? You have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">Defense Counsel: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">Court: Do you agree with that [to State\u2019s Attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">State\u2019s Attorney: If the Court submits that special issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">State\u2019s Attorney: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-14\">Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">The trial court proposed a special verdict sheet which included asking the jury whether it found jurisdiction, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, based upon the rapes occurring in Maryland or the application \u00a7 465. Adams objected, arguing that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that the rapes occurred in Maryland. The judge ruled that the evidence was sufficient to send the issue to the jury. Adams then agreed to the special verdict sheet proposed by the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court gave the jury the following pertinent jury instructions regarding the special verdict sheet:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmQ\">[You] will make a determination as to each one of these 12 charges, and they are numbered for your benefit, and you will find the defendant either not guilty or guilty of each one. And below that finding, if you find the defendant is guilty, you will also make a finding that the offense either occurred in Maryland or that jurisdiction was obtained in this case under Article 17, 465, of our Annotated Code, which I will tell you about later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">The judge later elaborated on the special verdict question available as to each of the individual counts. For example, he instructed the jury as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">Now, when you make that determination or if you make a determination as to first degree rape you will also make a determination as to where this rape occurred, and you will see there is a place for you to check either that the rape occurred in our State or that jurisdiction was obtained under Article 27, Section 465 of our Annotated Code. And our Legislature has enacted a statute that says in regards to sexual offenses if a person is transported by any means with intent to violate this subheading, meaning sexual offenses, and the intent is followed by actual violation of this subheading, the defendant may be tried in the appropriate court within whose jurisdiction the county lies where the transportation was offered, solicited, begun, continued, or ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">If you find that the application of this statute is how this particular sex offense occurred you will check that, if you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense occurred in our state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In a final reminder to the jury after closing arguments, the trial judge noted, \u201cAnd also that in regard to both the rape and sexual charges you must determine whether it occurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Maryland or whether there was jurisdiction under the statute. All right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The trial court also gave \u201cadvisory\u201d jury instructions, based on Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Throughout the twenty pages of instructions read to the jury, the trial judge made repeated references to the \u201cadvisory\u201d nature of his instructions. For example, he stated: Those of you who have sat previously as jurors in a criminal case know, and for those of you who have not sat previously and who do not know, that in our State, unlike [forty-eight] other states in our country, in a criminal case you as the jury sit not only as what we call the triers of fact, you also sit as what we call the judge of the law. And what this means, in essence, is that the facts in this case as you have sat and listened to for the past five days will be as you find them to be, and the law in this case will be as you find it to be. And because you are both the judges of the fact and the judges of the law anything that I may now tell you about either the facts or the law is purely advisory. You may disregard anything that I tell you, and you may pay absolutely no attention to what I tell you concerning either the facts or the law, with this one admonition concerning the law. You are not to apply the law as you think it ought to be or what it should be, but what it in fact is in this particular case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">And because you are the judges of the law [the State\u2019s Attorney] and [Adams\u2019s trial counsel] in their closing arguments to you may tell you what they think the law is in our State and how you should apply it in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">I, therefore, instruct you in an advisory capacity that in this case that you will sit on, that is of a criminal nature, the law places the burden on the State of Maryland to prove that the defendant, and in this case [Adams] is guilty beyond what we call a reasonable doubt. No defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>any criminal case has to prove he is innocent. Accordingly, you will assume that [Adams] is innocent unless you are convinced from all the evidence in this case that you have heard for the past five days that he is guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The trial court alluded to the advisory nature of the instructions at least ten times in the course of delivering the charge to the jury. Adams did not object to the references to the advisory nature of the jury instruction, despite their prominence in the charge to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On 7 December 1979, the jury found Adams guilty on all twelve counts. In addition, the jury made a special finding that all twelve counts occurred within the State of Maryland. Although the option was available on the verdict sheet, the jury did not check the option finding \u201cjurisdiction\u201d under Article 27, \u00a7 465. Adams was sentenced to one life term for one count of first degree rape, multiple concurrent life sentences for the remaining rapes and sexual assaults, thirty consecutive years of imprisonment for kidnapping, and twenty consecutive years for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Adams appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. He raised eight issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In an unreported opinion filed in 1980, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>intermediate appellate court affirmed Adams\u2019s conviction. We denied Adams\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari from that judgment. <em>Adams v. State, </em>289 Md. 738 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On 1 April 2004, some twenty-four years after his convictions and affirmance thereof on direct appeal, Adams filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County an initial Petition for Post Conviction Relief. The Petition alleged four bases for relief: (1) the trial court improperly gave only advisory jury instructions; (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on jurisdiction; (3) the trial court gave an incomplete reasonable doubt instruction; and (4) Adams\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. In support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Adams alleged that his attorney failed to object to the improper jurisdiction and reasonable doubt instructions and failed to file a Motion for Modification of Sentence. The post-conviction court granted the Petition on the grounds that the advisory jury instructions and the jury instructions on jurisdiction were improper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court also granted the Petition based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically Adams\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the assertedly erroneous jurisdiction instructions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals, on the State\u2019s appeal, affirmed the post-conviction Court in a reported opinion. <em>State v. Adams, </em>171 Md.App. 668, 912 A.2d 16 (2006). We granted the State\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari. <em>State v. Adams, </em>899 Md. 595, 925 A.2d 634 (2007). The State presents three questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">(1) Under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, has Adams waived his post conviction complaint that the trial court\u2019s advisory jury instructions denied him his constitutional right to due process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">(2) Under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, has Adams waived his right to challenge an instruction advising the jury that it could find jurisdiction under \u00a7 465 of Article 27 and, if not waived, in light of the special verdict in this case, was the instruction harmless?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">(3) Did the post conviction court err in concluding that Adams\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because counsel failed to object to the court\u2019s instructions on jurisdiction as counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instructions was not error and, in any event, was Adams prejudiced?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">We \u201cwill not disturb the factual findings of the post-conviction court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 348, 768 A.2d 675, 683 (2001) (citing <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 299, 681 A.2d 30, 51 (1996)); <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 672, 629 A.2d 685, 696 (1993)). Although reviewing factual determinations of the post-conviction court under a clearly erroneous standard, we make an independent determination of relevant law and its application to the facts. <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 375, 879 A.2d 1064, 1068 (2005); <em>State v. Peterson, </em>158 Md.App. 558, 584, 857 A.2d 1132, 1147 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Stare Decisis</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Adams\u2019s flagship contention is that the advisory jury instructions employed at his trial violated the reasoning iterated by this Court in <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980) , and <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 437 A.2d 654 (1981) . Adams\u2019s facially reasonable argument, however, suffers from a fundamental flaw. The holdings in <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>by their express terms, did not announce new law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">In <em>Stevenson, </em>a defendant challenged her conviction for first degree murder on the ground that Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. At Stevenson\u2019s trial, the trial court gave broad advisory instructions, much like the advisory instructions given in the present case. Stevenson, however, narrowly objected only to the constitutionality of Article 23, failing to object that the broad advisory instructions given at her trial exceeded the scope of Article 23. In essence, Stevenson mounted a facial challenge to the constitutionality of Article 23. The Court of Appeals affirmed Stevenson\u2019s conviction because, although the broad advisory instructions violated the scope of Article 23,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a proper application of Article 23 would not violate the Federal Constitution. Thus, Article 23 was not facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The Court majority opinion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> noted that \u201c[ijmplicit in the decisions of this Court limiting the jury\u2019s judicial role to the \u2018law of the crime\u2019 is a recognition that all other legal issues are for the judge alone to decide.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 179, 423 A.2d at 565. By its terms, <em>Stevenson </em>purported to express the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>limitations on the power of the jury implicit in earlier Maryland appellate decisions. <em>See, e.g., Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 724, 404 A.2d 1073, 1083 (1979); <em>Vogel v. State, </em>163 Md. 267, 272, 162 A. 705, 708 (1932); <em>Bell, alias Kimball v. State, </em>57 Md. 108, 120 (1881); <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>42 Md. 563, 570 (1875). \u201cRather, the <em>Stevenson </em>court is clear that it did not make new law, but rather it merely clarified what has always been the law in Maryland.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Smith, </em>38 F.Supp.2d 417, 421 (D.Md.1999), <em>aff'd, Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679, 684 (4th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>Stevenson </em>Court pointed out that \u201cthis Court has consistently interpreted this constitutional provision as restraining the jury\u2019s law deciding power to this limited, albeit important, area.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564. The majority opinion highlighted, as an example, a then recent decision applying the long established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>principle that the jury serves only as a judge of the \u201claw of the crime.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 724, 404 A.2d 1073, 1083 (1979) (holding that instructions on the voluntariness of confessions are binding, not merely advisory, on the jury, and the jury should be instructed as such).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Because <em>Stevenson </em>did not announce a new rule and Adams waived any challenges based thereon, there is no need to consider retrospectivity here. <em>See Guardino v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 695, 702 n. 3, 440 A.2d 1101, 1105 n. 3 (1982) (\u201cNo retrospective question was presented by <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980) because it merely affirmed what it found to be long established law with respect to the law-judging function of the jury.\u201d); <em>Prokopis v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 531, 535, 433 A.2d 1191, 1194 (1981) (\u201cApplicant acknowledges that <em>Stevenson v.

Nevertheless, in the present case, we are unpersuaded that either <em>Stevenson </em>or <em>Montgomery </em>was held wrongly to be applied in a prospective manner only.

Section 7-102 permits a challenge to a conviction where the post-conviction issue has \u201cnot been previously and finally litigated or waived in the proceeding resulting in the conviction or in any other proceeding that the person has taken to secure relief from the person\u2019s conviction.\u201d \u00a7 7-102(b)(2).

In <em>Curtis, </em>we distinguished the minimum standards for waiver of a fundamental constitutional right from the standards for waiver of other rights. <em>Curtis, </em>284 Md. at 148, 395 A.2d at 473. Fundamental constitutional rights require an affirmative waiver from a defendant. <em>See, e.g., Johnson, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (requiring intentional relinquishment of a known right in order to effect waiver of right to counsel in federal criminal actions); <em>Adams v.

Non-fundamental rights may be waived without an affirmative acknowledgment of waiver by the defendant to the court. \u201cIt is clear that a \u2018procedural default\u2019 in certain circumstances, even where a defendant may personally have been without knowledge or understanding of the matter, may result in his being precluded from asserting important rights.\u201d <em>Curtis, </em>284 Md. at 147, 395 A.2d at 472; <em>see Hunt v.

State, </em>343 Md. 629, 644-45, 684 A.2d 429, 436-37 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">[W]e are aware of no decision by the Supreme Court or this Court holding that waiver of an issue over the accuracy of a jury instruction concerning the elements of an offense requires intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself____[A] multitude of cases in this Court[ ] make it clear that the failure to object to a jury instruction ordinarily constitutes a waiver of any later claim that the instruction was erroneous____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">Furthermore, we have consistently held that the failure to object to or otherwise challenge a jury instruction constitutes a waiver of the issue for purposes of the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">This is true even of transparently erroneous jury instructions that appear to shift the burden of proof to a defendant. For example, in <em>Davis v. State, </em>285 Md. 19, 400 A.2d 406 (1979), the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cin order to prove an alibi conclusively, the testimony must cover the whole time in which the crime by any possibility might have been committed and it should be rigid, it should be subjected to rigid scrutiny.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>285 Md. at 21, 400 A.2d at 406 (1979). The State in <em>Davis </em>conceded that the jury instruction was erroneous in that it improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. We held that the challenge to the jury instruction nonetheless was waived by the petitioner\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Similarly, in <em>Rose, </em>we considered an allegedly erroneous instruction regarding the burden of proof in a criminal action. We stated the \u201cgeneral rule is that the failure to object to a jury instruction at trial results in a waiver of any defects in the instruction, and normally precludes further review of any claim of error relating to the instruction.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>345 Md. at 245-46, 691 A.2d at 1317. Rose, however, argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>subject reasonable doubt instruction was integral to a fair trial, and any errors in instructing the jury on reasonable doubt were \u201cerrors of a constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>345 Md. at 247, 691 A.2d at 1318. Therefore, Rose argued, a waiver of an error in a jury instruction regarding reasonable doubt required that the defendant knowingly and intelligently make the waiver. We expressly rejected Rose\u2019s argument, holding that a claim of error as to a reasonable doubt instruction could be waived by a failure to object at trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Applying these principles to the instant case, it is apparent that Adams\u2019s claims regarding the erroneous jury instructions were waived. The most egregiously wrong jury instruction at his trial was the statement that the jury may disregard the proper burden of proof in criminal actions. As noted above, the trial court said to the jury, \u201cin an advisory capacity that in this case that you will sit on, that is of a criminal nature, the law places the burden on the State of Maryland to prove that the defendant, and in this case [Adams] is guilty beyond what we call a reasonable doubt.\u201d It is uncontested, however, that Adams did not challenge the instruction, either at trial or on direct appeal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>State v. Colvin, </em>314 Md. 1, 22-23, 548 A.2d 506, 516-17 (1988), is directly on point. There we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>When submitting guilt or innocence to the jury, the trial court instructed that art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights made the jury the judge of the law, and that as a result the court\u2019s instructions were advisory only and not binding____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">There were no exceptions taken to these instructions. On direct appeal when Colvin-El was represented by new counsel, the points were not presented. Under Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(c), part of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, failure to make the allegations is presumed to have been done intelligently and knowingly. Nothing is presented here to rebut the presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzL\">Therefore, as was the fate of the defendants\u2019 comparable arguments in <em>Davis, Rose, Foster, Colvin, Cirincione, </em>and <em>Morris, </em>Adams\u2019s current challenges to the pertinent jury instructions were waived and mounting those challenges for the first time in a post-conviction proceeding will not support relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">An Appeal to Our Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">At his trial, Adams raised no objection to the repeated description of the jury instructions as \u201cadvisory.\u201d Adams makes no attempt to rebut any presumption that he knowingly waived his right to challenge the instructions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Adams contends that his failure to object is excused because \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d justify review of his conviction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The dissent is correct in its contention that \u00a7 7-106 may not be applied to Adams\u2019s excusable waiver argument regarding the advisory jury instructions. Dissent op. at 302, 958 A.2d at 332-33. The first case of this Court expressing what appears to be the modern view of the waiver section of the post-conviction statute makes clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">Consequently, we believe that the Legislature, when it spoke of \u201cwaiver\u201d in subsection (c) of Art. 27, s 645A [now \u00a7 7\u2014106(b) ], was using the term in a narrow sense. It intended that subsection (c), with its \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d standard, be applicable only in those circumstances where the waiver concept of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>and <em>Fay v. Noia </em>was applicable. <em>Other situations are beyond the scope of subsection (c), to be governed by case law or any pertinent statutes or rules. </em>Tactical decisions[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] when made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>an authorized competent attorney, as well as legitimate procedural requirements, will normally bind a criminal defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 149-150, 395 A.2d 464, 474 (1978) (Eldridge, J. writing for the Court) (emphasis added). Thus, Adams\u2019s contentions, if reviewable in this proceeding at all, must be governed by caselaw or rule. As discussed above, the caselaw governing erroneous jury instruction challenges is clear. Any later imagined flaw in jury instructions ordinarily is waived by a failure to object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Further, the rules which permit an appellate court to notice \u201cplain error\u201d technically do not apply to post-conviction proceedings. As the Court noted in <em>Walker: </em>Rules 4-325(e) and 8-131(a), authorizing a court to take cognizance of \u201cplain error\u201d despite the waiver of an issue, literally apply only to direct appellate review of a judgment. Moreover, the similar \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d doctrine set forth in \u00a7 645A(c)(l) [now \u00a7 7\u2014106(b)(1)(ii) ], authorizing a court in a post conviction action to excuse a waiver, is applicable only to situations encompassed by \u00a7 645A(c) [now \u00a7 7-106(b) ], <em>i.e., </em>situations requiring intelligent and knowing action before there is a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\"><em>Walker v. State, </em>343 Md. 629, 647, 684 A.2d 429, 438 (1996).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Nonetheless, it is recognized that the Court of Appeals possesses discretion to excuse a waiver, outside of \u00a7 7-106, in a post-conviction proceeding. Apparently relying on Rule 8-131(a),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we have noted that, \u201c[u]nder that rule, the appellate courts possess the discretion to excuse the waiver [in the trial] of a right or claim waivable by less than knowing and voluntary action.\u201d <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 139, 691 A.2d 1255, 1263. Similarly, in <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 273, 681 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>30, 38 (1996), \u201cwe noted that, [u]nder Maryland Rule 8-131, this Court retains discretion to excuse a waiver [in a post-conviction proceeding].\u201d This reliance on Rule 8-131 as the wellspring of appellate discretion to notice waiver in a post-conviction proceeding, independent of the explicit provisions of the Post-Conviction Act, has not been without its critics, however. The Court of Special Appeals summarized the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of this discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">The Court itself noted the uncertain origin of this authority to excuse, since waivers of non-fundamental rights are not governed by the Act and since Maryland\u2019s rules of appellate procedure do not directly apply. <em>[Walker </em>] at 647, 684 A.2d at 438. Although Maryland courts have recognized the distinction between waivers of fundamental and non-fundamental rights since 1978, the first time the Court of Appeals ever spoke of such an excusal was in <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 273-74, 681 A.2d 30, 38 (1996), when it claimed such discretion under Rule 8-131. Prior to that time, a finding of waiver had always been dispositive, and the Court of Appeals had gone so far as to hold that a waived claim was \u201cnot ... a proper subject for review in [a post conviction] proceeding.\u201d <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 257, 582 A.2d 794, 798 (1990). The <em>Walker </em>Court premised its discretion to excuse on <em>Oken </em>but also indicated some measure of reliance on <em>Foster v. State, </em>305 Md. 306, 503 A.2d 1326 (1986), which was not a post conviction case. More recently, in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 152, 691 A.2d 1255, 1269 (1997), discretion to excuse was again based squarely on Rule 8-131. <em>But see State v. Rose, </em>345 Md. 238, 250, 691 A.2d 1314, 1320 (1997) (reversing this Court\u2019s grant of post conviction relief and remanding with instructions to affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial without allowing for this Court to consider whether to excuse the petitioner\u2019s waiver).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArM\"><em>Cirincione v.

As noted above, and pointed out by the dissent, \u00a7 7-106 does not apply strictly. Thus, if Adams\u2019s waiver is to be excused, it must rest on the exercise of our discretion. For reasons to be explained, we shall not exercise our discretion to excuse Adams\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Adams<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> contends that waiver should be excused in his ease because (1) the law at the time of his trial was clear that \u201cadvisory\u201d instructions were permissible; (2) at the time of the trial there was a misconception by a large segment of the Maryland bench and bar regarding the scope and application of Article 28 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights; and (3) the erroneous jury instructions constitute \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Law at the Time of Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Adams contends, and the post-conviction court and the intermediate appellate court agreed, that \u201cstate law barred\u201d a contemporaneous challenge to the jury instructions based on their being advisory.

Ross, </em>468 U.S. 1, 16 104 S.Ct. 2901, 2910, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984), that \u201cwhere a constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel, a defendant has cause for his failure to raise the claim in accordance with applicable state procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Adams\u2019s argument fails because the objection that he could have presented at trial was not novel, under either Maryland or federal law. \u201c[T]he question is not whether subsequent legal developments have made counsel\u2019s task easier, but whether at the time of the default the claim was \u2018available\u2019 at all. <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>477 U.S. 527, 537, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 2667, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986). \u201cThe precise contours of the novelty exception to the procedural bar doctrine are not as clear as one might hope.\u201d <em>Poyner v. Murray, </em>964 F.2d 1404, 1424 (4th Cir.1992). A constitutional theory of objection is not novel when the debate has been percolating demonstrably for years. <em>Pruett v. Thompson, </em>771 F.Supp. 1428, 1438 (E.D.Va.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>996 F.2d 1560 (4th Cir.1993) (citing 17A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward. H. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4266.1 at p. 460 n. 48 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As noted above, Adams\u2019s contention most worthy of consideration is that the advisory nature of the instructions improperly relieved the State of its burden to prove that Adams was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Montgomery, </em>292 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>at 91, 437 A.2d at 658 (listing the burden of proof as the first bedrock characteristic \u201cindispensable to the integrity of every criminal trial\u201d). Adam\u2019s argument fails, however, because an anticipatorily reasonable basis for an objection was available to Adams at trial. As discussed above, <em>Stevenson </em>merely articulated what had been implied for decades in the holdings of the Court of Appeals and other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The constitutional requirement that the State prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt was well established before Adams\u2019s trial in 1979. In <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 361, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1071, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), the Supreme Court held that the \u201crequirement that guilt of a criminal charge be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt dates at least from our early years as a Nation.\u201d By all accounts, <em>Winship </em>was a landmark case and has been held to put defendants on notice of their right to require the State to carry the beyond a reasonable doubt burden. <em>Compare Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982) (holding that a reasonable basis was available to counsel after <em>Winship </em>to challenge jury instruction on proper burdens, and thus waiver was unexcused) <em>with Reed v. Ross, </em>468 U.S. 1, 19, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 2912, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (holding that reasonable basis was not available to trial counsel to challenge jury instruction on proper burdens prior to <em>Winship, </em>thus waiver was excused by cause). \u201cThat the jury must be instructed that the Government is required to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 was not an open question after <em>Winship\u201d Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679, 684 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (\u201cAfter <em>Winship </em>the critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction must be not simply to determine whether the jury was properly instructed but [also] to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The requirement that the jury be instructed properly regarding the proper burdens was well established at the time of Adams\u2019s trial. In <em>Cool v. U.S., </em>409 U.S. 100, 100, 93 S.Ct. 354, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>355, 34 L.Ed.2d 335 (1972), the Supreme Court stated, \u201cIn this case, the court below held in effect that in a criminal trial, the jury may be instructed to ignore defense testimony unless it believes beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony is true. That holding is fundamentally inconsistent with our prior decisions ... and must therefore be reversed.\u201d The Court in <em>Cool </em>also noted that any instruction that \u201callow[edJ the jury to convict despite its failure to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d must be reversed. <em>Cool, </em>409 U.S. at 103-04, 93 S.Ct. 354, 34 L.Ed.2d 335.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Maryland law was in accord with these federal precepts prior to Adams\u2019s trial in 1979. In <em>State v. Grady, </em>276 Md. 178, 182, 345 A.2d 436, 438 (1975), we held that \u201cunder the Federal Constitution, as well as the law of Maryland, the burden is on the State to prove all elements of the alleged crime and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In 1971, in describing the jury as the \u201cjudges of the law\u201d in the Maryland Constitution, the Court of Special Appeals noted, that \u201c[i]t does not confer upon them, however, untrammeled discretion to enact new law or to repeal or ignore clearly existing law as whim, fancy, compassion or malevolence should dictate, even within the limited confines of a single criminal case.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 91, 98, 277 A.2d 460, 464 (1971), <em>aff'd </em>265 Md. 256, 288 A.2d 885 (1972). That language was repeated in <em>Dillon, </em>277 Md. 571, 581-82, 357 A.2d 360 (1976). \u201cWe expressly approved these principles in our affirmance of <em>Hamilton.\u201d Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 479, 365 A.2d 545, 553 (1976). Questions of law of a constitutional nature were always off limits to the jury. <em>Giles v. State, </em>229 Md. 370, 183 A.2d 359 (1962); <em>Franklin v. State, </em>12 Md. 236 (1858); <em>Hitchcock v. State, </em>213 Md. 273, 131 A.2d 714 (1957). Commentators discussing <em>Hamilton </em>noted that \u201c[cjlearly, the court\u2019s pronouncement means that the jury\u2019s role as judge of the law does not include judging the validity or merits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>law; nor does it diminish the judge\u2019s authority to rule on the law applicable to the trial process itself.\u201d Gary J. Jacobsohn, <em>The Right to Disagree: Judges, Juries, and the Administration of Criminal Justice in Maryland, </em>1976 WASH. U.L.Q. 571, 578 (1976). In July 1979, months before Adams\u2019s trial, the Court of Special Appeals noted that the \u201ccurious provision of the Maryland Constitution with respect to the jury\u2019s being judges of the law has <em>only meant that where there are conflicting interpretations of law, </em>the jury may have both interpretations argued to it and the jury may choose between, and further that the jury shall decide whether the law should be applied in dubious factual situations.\u201d <em>Ehrlich v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 730, 737, 403 A.2d 371, 376 (1979) (emphasis added). The Court of Special Appeals continued, \u201cIn deciding which of two conflicting interpretations of law is correct and in deciding whether the law should apply in a dubious factual situation, the jury is still carrying out its sole mission of determining guilt or innocence. Overriding limitations still abide as to what a jury shall not hear (by way of evidence or argument) <em>and what a jury shall not do. </em>\u201d <em>Ehrlich, </em>42 Md.App. at 737-38, 403 A.2d at 376 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The duty of a juror had been delineated clearly in caselaw prior to <em>Stevenson. See Hopkins v. State, </em>19 Md.App. 414, 420-21, 311 A.2d 483, 487 (1973) (\u201c[W]hen one sits on a jury, he is required to accept and apply the law as the judge gives it to him, whether or not he agrees with it and no matter what his personal feelings are toward the parties in question.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>337 F.Supp. 140 (S.D.N.Y.1972), aff<em>'d, </em>468 F.2d 1245 (2d Cir.1972))); <em>Neal v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 549, 556, 413 A.2d 1386, 1390 (1980) (\u201cA jury in a criminal case has no greater prerogative as judge of the law than would the court have had sitting without a jury....\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As discussed above, after <em>Winship </em>was decided in 1970, it was clearly established that the prosecution must prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Prior to his trial, Adams, based upon <em>Hamilton, Dillon, Ehrlich, </em>and <em>Hopkins </em>reasonably could have been expected to be aware that any instruction that he perceived as permitting the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to disregard such clearly established constitutional law was improper. It was not novel in 1979 for defense counsel to argue that the State was required to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. It was similarly not novel for defense counsel to argue that the jury must be instructed that the State is required to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Prior to Adams\u2019s trial, this issue had been preserved at trial on several recent occasions for review in reported appellate cases. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 182, 202, 348 A.2d 55, 67, (1975) , <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>279 Md. 1, 367 A.2d 1, (1976) , attorney F. Lee Bailey requested that the trial court instruct the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">the instructions of the Court are the sole and exclusive source of the law and the jury may find the law from no other source than the instructions of the Court and that they are absolutely obligated to follow those instructions, particularly those of constitutional dimension; the most important of which [based on some unusual circumstances in the <em>Jones </em>case] in all the circumstances of this trial is the impermissible nature of drawing an inference from the silence of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\"><em>Jones v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 182, 202 348 A.2d 55, 67 (1975), <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>279 Md. 1, 367 A.2d 1 (1976). In his brief to the Court of Special Appeals, Bailey argued that \u201cto allow juries to generally determine the law is to permit possible violations of criminal defendants\u2019 rights which are guaranteed by the federal constitution and binding on the states through the fourteenth amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In <em>Davis v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 474, 427 A.2d 1085 (1981), the defendants objected to an advisory jury instruction on reasonable doubt, an instruction similar to the one at issue in the present case. The trial court overruled the objection, and the defendants appealed. While the appeal was pending, the Court decided <em>Stevenson. </em>The Court of Special Appeals, in light of <em>Stevenson, </em>reversed the convictions in <em>Davis. Davis </em>is especially noteworthy here because defense counsel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Davis </em>objected to an advisory instruction <em>before Stevenson </em>was decided. In <em>Robertson v. State, </em>295 Md. 688, 689, 457 A.2d 826, 826 (1983), we held that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s counsel made clear to the trial judge that even though the jury was the judge of the law under Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, he was entitled to an instruction that the court\u2019s comments on the burden of proof were not merely advisory but were binding upon the jury. Failure to give the requested instruction constituted reversible error.\u201d The trial in <em>Robertson </em>occurred on 24 November 1980, <em>before Stevenson </em>was decided. In addition, the defendants in both <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>had the foresight to object to the advisory nature of instructions prior to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stevenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Although the correct objection reasonably was available here to trial counsel based on recent Maryland caselaw alone, trial counsel also could have looked to the annals of great American jurisprudence for inspiration. Justice Story noted in <em>U.S. v. Battiste, </em>24 F. Cas. 1042 (C.C.Mass.1835)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">... I hold it the most sacred constitutional right of every party accused of a crime, that the jury should respond as to the facts, and the court as to the law. It is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to the law; and it is the duty of the jury to follow the law, as it is laid down by the court. This is the right of every citizen; and it is his only protection. If the jury were at liberty to settle the law for themselves, the effect would be, not only that the law itself would be most uncertain, from the different views, which different juries might take of it; but in case of error, there would be no remedy or redress by the injured party; for the court would not have any right to review the law as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>had been settled by the jury. Indeed, it would be almost impracticable to ascertain, what the law, as settled by the jury, actually was. On the contrary, if the court should err, in laying down the law to the jury, there is an adequate remedy for the injured party, by a motion for a new trial, or a writ of error, as the nature of the jurisdiction of the particular court may require. Every person accused as a criminal has a right to be tried according to the law of the land, the fixed law of the land; and not by the law as a jury may understand it, or choose, from wantonness, or ignorance, or accidental mistake, to interpret it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The advisory instruction was also the subject of vigorous debates among notable members of the Maryland Bench and Bar for several decades prior to Adams\u2019s trial. <em>See Stewart v. LaGrand, </em>526 U.S. 115, 119, 119 S.Ct. 1018, 1021, 143 L.Ed.2d 196 (1999) (holding that a constitutional claim is not novel where there is an ongoing debate about the issue); <em>Cole v. Stevenson, </em>620 F.2d 1055, 1062 (4th Cir.1980) (holding that a change in law did not excuse waiver). At the time of his published opposition to the practice of advisory instructions, Judge Samuel K. Dennis was, among other things,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Chief Judge of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore. Samuel K. Dennis, <em>Maryland\u2019s Antique Constitutional Thom, </em>92 U. Pa. L.Rev. 34, 34 (1943). Chief Judge Prescott of the Court of Appeals, in an address to the Maryland State Bar Association, described his objection to advisory jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">I am opposed to it because it violates the fundamental concepts of trial by jury; it has been discarded and repudiated in nearly every jurisdiction where tried; it has retarded the growth of our substantive criminal law; it is contrary to the ancient maxims of the common law; such outstanding leaders of our profession as Justice Story, Lord Mansfield, Charles Evans Hughes, Judges Chesnut, Markell, and Dennis, Charles McHenry Howard and scores of others have spoken or written against it; juries are not trained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>experience nor training to interpret the law; of manifold other reasons why such an anomalous situation should not be permitted to remain as a blight upon the administration of justice in Maryland, In my humble judgment it is archaic, outmoded, and atrocious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Judge Stedman Prescott, <em>Juries as Judges of the Law: Should the Practice Be Continued?, </em>60 Md. St. Bar. Assc. Rep. 246, 257 (1955) (citations omitted). Chief Judge Henderson and Chief Judge Markell of the Court also publicized their objections to the practice of treating juries as the judges of law. Hon. William L. Henderson, <em>The Jury as Judges of Law and Fact in Maryland, 52 </em>MD. ST. BAR. ASSC. REP. 184 (1947); Charles Markell, <em>Trial by Jury: A Two-Horse Team or One-Horse Team, </em>42 MD. ST. BAR. ASSC. REP. 72 (1937); <em>see also </em>Judge W. Calvin Chesnut, <em>Courts and Juries, </em>46 Md. St. Bar. Assc. Rep. 159 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In sum, as <em>Stevenson </em>was merely an acknowledgment and application of existing law, there existed a reasonable basis for Adams to object at trial to the facially advisory nature of the instruction. Furthermore, Adams could have formulated an objection to the advisory instructions based on similar objections made in other criminal trials, earlier and contemporaneously published state court opinions, landmark opinions by United States Supreme Court Justices, and publicized comments by distinguished members of the Maryland Bench and Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Misconceptions within the Bench and Bar</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Adams relies on dicta in <em>Walker </em>to support the proposition that a relevant and contemporary \u201cmisconception by a large segment of the bench and the bar concerning the [law]\u201d may constitute special circumstances excusing waiver. <em>Walker, </em>343 Md. at 648, 684 A.2d at 438. In <em>Walker, </em>a petitioner sought post-conviction review of his waived allegations of error to the jury instructions regarding the intent element of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>for which Walker was convicted, arguing that mistake as to the law by a large segment of the bench and bar excused his waiver. Walker argued, and the post-conviction court found, that \u201cprior to Jenkins,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> many trial judges and lawyers [mistakenly] believed that a jury instruction like that given at Walker\u2019s trial was a correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>343 Md. at 634, 684 A.2d at 431. The \u201c \u2018special circumstances\u2019 found by the circuit court were that, at the time of Walker\u2019s trial, the law concerning the intent element of assault with intent to murder was misunderstood by trial judges and lawyers, and that the law was not finally clarified until this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Jenkins </em>. . . after Walker\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>343 Md. at 635, 684 A.2d at 432. Eschewing substantive analysis of the legal validity of the petitioner\u2019s argument, we rejected his argument because the alleged erroneous instruction regarding intent \u201cwas simply not an issue at all\u201d at Walker\u2019s trial. <em>Walker, </em>343 Md. at 650, 684 A.2d at 439. For the sake of argument, however, we, in dicta, \u201cassume[d] that, if the circumstances in [Walker\u2019s] case [nonetheless had presented an issue regarding intent], the circuit court\u2019s decision excusing Walker\u2019s waiver of the jury instruction issue would have been warranted.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Walker, </em>343 Md. at 648-49, 684 A.2d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">There is some facial justification for Adams\u2019s argument that, prior to <em>Stevenson, </em>there appeared to be some level of misconception afield among some contingent of the Bench and Bar regarding the proper role of the jury in criminal cases. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Court of Special Appeals noted such confusion on at least two occasions. In <em>Allnutt v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 694, 701, 478 A.2d 321, 324 (1984), the intermediate appellate court stated, \u201cUntil <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 179, 423 A.2d 558, was decided on December 17, 1980, it was generally believed by bench and bar that a judge\u2019s comments as to the law in a criminal case were advisory and not binding on the jury. A jury-twelve lay persons-was to determine not only the evidence but the law of the case.\u201d In <em>Petric v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 470, 478, 504 A.2d 1168, 1172 (1986), our appellate colleagues noted, \u201cEre <em>Stevenson, </em>it was generally thought by bench and bar alike that jurors in criminal cases were judges of the law and fact. <em>Stevenson </em>made clear that such was not the situation, but that a jury\u2019s judicial role was limited to the \u2018law of the crime.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Furthermore, at the time of Adams\u2019s trial, Maryland Rule 757(b) stated that \u201c[i]n every case in which instructions are given to the jury the court shall instruct the jury that they are the judges of the law and that the court\u2019s instructions are advisory only.\u201d <em>See Guardino, </em>50 Md.App. at 701 n. 2, 440 A.2d at 1105 n. 2 (\u201cWe note that Rule 757 b requires the court \u2018(i)n every case in which instructions are given\u2019 to instruct the jury that the instructions are advisory only. Under the dictates of <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 437 A.2d 654 (1981), this is manifestly not correct.\u201d). Those indicia, together with an analysis of the actual state of the law prior to Adams\u2019s trial <em>(supra </em>at 325-32, 958 A.2d at 349-51), suggest a certain degree of perceptible schizophrenia within the Maryland legal community regarding the proper role of the jury. As the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Guardino </em>recognized, the Court of Appeals consistently had limited the power of the jury to determine law outside of \u201cthe law of the crime,\u201d however, these teachings were \u201cnot recognized in practice by many of the trial courts.\u201d <em>Guardino, </em>50 Md.App. at 702, 440 A.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Despite the potential confusion within the bench and bar over the issue, we shall not exercise our discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>excuse Adams\u2019s waiver. As in <em>Oken, Hunt, </em>and <em>Walker, </em>the petitioner\u2019s argument shall be deemed waived and unexcused.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><em>Oken </em>provides a particularly apt comparison. In <em>Oken, </em>the defendant<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> argued that his waiver should be excused. We rejected that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">Oken\u2019s argument to excuse the waiver, however, is without merit. The \u201creverse <em>Witherspoon[v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968)]\u201d right to exclude jurors for cause was established by the Supreme Court in 1988 in <em>Ross v. Oklahoma, </em>487 U.S. 81, 108 S.Ct. 2273, 101 L.Ed.2d 80 (1988). We recognized this right in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 583 A.2d 218 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 273, 681 A.2d at 38. Thus, because the law upon which the defendant relied in the post-conviction proceeding to support his issue waived at trial was established at the time of his trial, and hence available to form the basis for a valid objection at trial, we declined to exercise our discretion to excuse the waiver. In the present case, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the basis for a valid objection regarding the advisory jury instructions was available in Maryland law at the time of Adams\u2019s trial. Although <em>Stevenson </em>was decided after Adams\u2019s trial, <em>Stevenson, </em>by its express terms, only described what already was the law, based upon cases decided well before Adams\u2019s trial. We also decline to exercise our discretion because of the potential for unfair prejudice to the State. In deciding whether to exercise discretion to consider unpreserved arguments, \u201cthe appellate court should consider whether the exercise of its discretion will work unfair prejudice to either of the parties.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 714, 843 A.2d 778, 784 (2004); <em>see also State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107, 113 (1994) (noting that \u201cthis discretion should be exercised only when it is clear that it will not work an unfair prejudice to the parties or to the court\u201d). A delay of twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>four years before asserting Ms waived arguments (which were based on two cases decided in 1980 and 1981, respectively) may be a testimonial to patience, but the delay poses a real potential for serious hardship and prejudice to the State\u2019s ability to mount a new prosecution. This delay is particularly inexcusable because \u201c[a]s originally enacted in 1958, the [Post-Conviction Procedure] Act did not place any limit on the number of post conviction petitions which a petitioner was entitled to file.\u201d <em>Mason v.

State, </em>379 Md. 704, 715, 843 A.2d 778, 784. To do so in this case would not. As noted by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Guardino, </em>where the jury instruction occurred before <em>Stevenson </em>was handed down:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_A\">We appreciate that both the bench and the bar are charged with having knowledge of the law. But in light of Rule 757 h, the failure of the trial judge to recognize that the Court of Appeals had \u201cconsistently interpreted\u201d Art. 23 as \u201crestraining the jury\u2019s law deciding power,\u201d limiting it to the law of the crime, cannot excuse the failure of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>counsel to recognize that restraint and interpose a timely objection when the trial judge failed to abide by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>Guardino, </em>50 Md.App. 695, 702, 440 A.2d 1101, 1106 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Plain Error</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Adams contends that his waiver is excused by the fact that the complained-about jury instruction constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d Adams\u2019s argument fails in the first instance because, as discussed above, \u201cplain error\u201d review under the Maryland Rules is not applicable in post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Adams\u2019s argument fails also because the fact that an error was \u201cplain\u201d does not excuse waiver. In <em>Stevenson, </em>we held that the objection to the specific advisory instructions had not been preserved for appellate review, despite the fact that Stevenson had preserved a general objection, based upon the Fourteenth Amendment, to advisory instructions. <em>Stevenson, 289 </em>Md. at 172-73, 423 A.2d at 561.

We decline to recognize plain error in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Jurisdiction Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Adams also argues that his petition for post-conviction relief should be granted because the trial court gave an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>erroneous jury instruction on jurisdiction. The trial court, utilizing a special verdict, instructed the jury that there were two possible bases for jurisdiction. First, the jury may find beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes occurred in Maryland. Second, the jury may find that the State had jurisdiction to prosecute the crimes under Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 465. Adams\u2019s post-conviction contention on this score, however, also has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As discussed above, it is clearly established that failure to object to a jury instruction at trial normally constitutes waiver of that ground for purposes of the UPPA. Adams failed to object at the time of the instruction and also failed to raise an appropriate issue on direct appeal.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Adams has not rebutted the presumption of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Furthermore, he has not shown any reason for us to excuse this waiver. The arguments upon which Adams relies in his arguments regarding the advisory jury instructions do not apply to his arguments regarding the jurisdiction alternatives. Arguments regarding jurisdiction were reasonably available to his trial counsel. Adams\u2019s counsel argued throughout the case about this point. At a preliminary hearing, counsel for Adams and counsel for Adams\u2019s then co-defendant, Knight, demonstrated apt understanding of the distinction between venue and jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">Counsel for Knight: Now, we think, we submit to the Court, that that conduct, those rapes which occurred outside of the State of Maryland, by virtue of the State\u2019s own evidence, this Court does not have jurisdiction over and we ask the Court to determine that question as a preliminary matter, since these counts are present in the indictment and testimony would be allowed otherwise to come before the jury relating to alleged criminal acts over which this Court has no jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>We think that the reliance of the State upon the provisions of the Maryland Statute in question, in light of the facts, make it really a question of law which can be determined in advance of trial; and therefore, if decided in favor of the defendant would not put the defendant in the position of having evidence come into this trial with respect to the allegations of the other charges in this indictment of rape that are alleged to have occurred in Maryland, that would infect the entire trial with evidence of a great many rapes over which the Court has no jurisdiction. The introduction of that testimony would prejudice the defendant severely, if otherwise not admissible, and so determined later. So, we would ask the Court to determine that as a preliminary matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">Court: All right. I assume you join in that, [Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Yes, I would join in [Counsel for Knight\u2019s] argument. And I would also add that it is basic law that in order for a given State to have jurisdiction over a criminal act the act basically must have occurred within the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">Now in this particular case I think it is incumbent upon the State to show the critical element, to wit, the perpetration of a rape occurred in the State of Maryland. As [Counsel for Knight] pointed out, the State\u2019s own witnesses, at least in preliminary reports, clearly indicate those acts did not take place in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">State\u2019s Attorney: Your Honor, I would point out a number of things. First of all, Article 27, Section 465, I suggest to the Court in fact makes it a crime to actually transport with intent to rape, regardless of where the rape eventually occurs. I would point out, first of all, under that particular statute that even if all the rapes occurred in D.C., which we do not in any way either suggest of [sic] concede, that the State would have jurisdiction, providing that we show that at the time of transportation there, in fact, was an intent to commit rapes. The Legislature I think clearly made it a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>crime in and of itself to transport with that intent, made it a crime equivalent to the actual act of rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">Secondly, in this particular case I think it is without dispute that some of the rapes without a doubt occurred in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">For all those reasons we ask the Court [to] deny the motions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">Counsel for Knight: Your Honor, [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] first comment, that 465 creates a separate crime, I don\u2019t believe that is true. But in any event, they weren\u2019t indicted for violation of 645, if that us some of new crime that is created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">Court: I don\u2019t think 465 creates any kind of crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">Counsel for Knight: He indicates a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">Court: It creates jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">State\u2019s Attorney: That is what I meant to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">Court: I have read this four times, and it says that if somebody transports with intent to violate any of the provisions, and that is any of the provisions of this subheading, which I assume is all rape offenses, and the intent is followed by an actual violation of this subheading, the defendant may be tried in an appropriate court within whose jurisdiction the county lies, where the transportation was offered, solicited, has begun, continued, or ended. I think it describes this. If you form an intention eventually to rape somebody, and you start out in Baltimore and you end up in the State of Washington, and you finally rape her there, I think this statute says that Baltimore has jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">Counsel for Knight: Well, I would submit to the Court that my interpretation of that statute, and would hope the Court would accept this interpretation of the statute, is that that statute relates to intercountry situations and intrastate situations; that Maryland would be constitutionally powerless to extend its jurisdiction for an act which occurs outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>of its boundaries by saying that if you merely form the intent in Maryland you are guilty of the substantive crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">That creates constitutional problems which I believe could only be avoided by interpreting that section the way the Court has interpreted that section in the annotation to that section, and that is a Baltimore City-Baltimore County situation, that provides for the place where trial may be held. And certainly there would be no constitutional problem to that, because there is no constitutional right to venue. But there certainly is a constitutional limitation on the power of the Court to extend its jurisdiction beyond the physical boundaries. And we would submit to the Court that the only way to avoid that inherent problem is the Court \u2014 and this is the only case that I have been able to find on this particular section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Court: That had to do with Baltimore County \u2014 Baltimore City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">Counsel for Knight: That is correct. I recognize the facts of that case are of little help under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akb\">Court: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">Counsel for Knight: But it is the only law that we have in Maryland. And I think that basically jurisdictional and constitutional law tells us that the State of Maryland can\u2019t extend its jurisdiction beyond the boundaries for a substantive act. And I think even though it is a venue case, the <em>McBurney</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>case is also instructive with respect to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">We have here a crime. A crime is not completed when the intent is formed to commit the rape. [Actus reus] is also an integral part of the crime, and that is really what establishes jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">So, I submit to the Court that on [the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] legal theory it can\u2019t create a separate offense. And I agree with the Court it doesn\u2019t purport to create a separate offense. I think it creates a situation where Prince George\u2019s County could try a guy for picking up somebody in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Prince George\u2019s County and transporting them and raping them in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Court: All right. Is there a motion here for me to decide this preliminarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Counsel for Knight: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Court: All right. Anything else you want to tell me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3B\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Your Honor, I would again adopt [Counsel for Knight\u2019s] arguments, and I would like to argue to the Court another line of cases where situations did arise where the acts were crossing state lines, particularly between the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">In one case, your Honor, the case of <em>Bowen v. State, </em>206 Md. 368 [111 A.2d 844 (1955)], a case of larceny after trust and embezzlement, where the acts were connected with Maryland, but the conversion of the assets and all the transactions involving the checks took place in D.C. The conviction by a Maryland Court was reversed for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Another case is <em>Goodman v. State, </em>237 Md. 64 [205 A.2d 53 (1964)], where a person obtained a prescription falsely to obtain narcotic drugs in Montgomery County, went to the District of Columbia and passed a prescription, received drugs. The Court held the critical element of the offense, which was passing the drugs, did not take place within the State of Maryland; therefore, Maryland did not have jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">Court: You didn\u2019t have a statute, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">Court: Didn\u2019t have any kind of statute like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: I would also cite <em>Urciolo [v. State1, </em>272 Md. 607 [325 A.2d 878 (1974) ], with which the Court may be familiar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">But your Honor, again I submit that Maryland has no authority to legislate itself into having jurisdiction over acts that do not occur within the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>During the direct examination of Kathy P., Adams\u2019s counsel objected to Kathy P.\u2019s testimony that the rapes occurred on Branch Avenue. At that point, the parties approached the bench, and the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Your Honor, I am going to object to any testimony about any sexual acts, because as I understand it now counsel is not in a position to proffer that any of those acts took place in the State of Maryland. As I understand it at this point the evidence that the State poses is to the contrary, being that all sexual acts took place within the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">State\u2019s Attorney: Your Honor, the evidence that we have, and I think it will come out through testimony, is as follows: That they started to undress her while she was on Branch Avenue, toward the District of Columbia; but at some point later she was in fact raped. When she was first raped she asked the individuals in the van where she was. They said in Maryland. She was then moved to another location, at which point she was raped by other individuals. She doesn\u2019t know where she was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">At any rate, under the jurisdiction statute which I previously cited the Court, Article 27, 465,1 think it is quite clear we have the transportation in this county either beginning, continuing or ending, and the intent is, in fact to commit a sexual offense, and when such action as that occurs the statute gives this county jurisdiction to prosecute, and that is the reason we are proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Your Honor, it is the position of the defendant that this statute cannot extend the jurisdiction of the State of Maryland beyond the State borders, but must be strictly within the counties within the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The exchanges illustrate that not only was the post-conviction argument regarding jurisdiction reasonably available to be made by Adams\u2019s counsel at trial, but that Adams\u2019s counsel understood the distinction between jurisdiction and venue. Therefore, Adams\u2019s objection regarding the jury instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>and special verdicts regarding jurisdiction was waived by his failure to object at trial or raise the issue on direct appeal.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Adams contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the jury instructions on jurisdiction. Unlike most of his other post-conviction claims, this contention has been not waived by inaction in the prior proceedings. Nonetheless, he shall not prevail with his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The trial court instructed the jury, \u201cIf you find that the application of this statute is how this particular sex offense occurred you will check that, if you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense occurred in our state.\u201d The instruction regarding the special verdict was repeated several times throughout the charge to the jury. Adams\u2019s trial counsel not only did not object, but actually requested the court to instruct the jury on a specific finding. The following exchange is particularly relevant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: I would submit that the Court\u2019s proposed method is the better method, and I would ask the Court to do that, to get a specific finding as to whether or not the incidents involving the sexual acts and the rapes took place in the District of Columbia or Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">Court: All of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Assuming all of them go to the jury/[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>] your Honor, I would assume those questions would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>have to be answered definitely. I think the jury does have to find\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">Court: Let\u2019s assume I do it that way, what is the burden of proof on that issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: It is the same as the burden for any other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Court: Anything else? You have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Adams\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims are governed by the two-part standard announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., that the representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different, <em>i.e., </em>a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\"><em>State v. Borchardt, </em>396 Md. 586, 602, 914 A.2d 1126, 1135 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">\u201cThere is, however, a heavy burden on the defendant to establish the deficiency.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 697, 496 A.2d 1074, 1080 (1985). \u201cThe ineffective assistance prong of <em>Strickland </em>is satisfied only where, given the facts known at the time, counsel\u2019s choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.\u201d <em>Borchardt, </em>396 Md. at 623, 914 A.2d at 1147 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">Adams\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. First, the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Adams\u2019s trial counsel regarding the jurisdiction instructions was not deficient. Adams\u2019s claims that his trial counsel should have objected to the instruction on jurisdiction necessarily includes a claim that the counsel should have objected to the special verdict. It would be impossible for the trial court to seek a special verdict on both the location of the crime and the application of \u00a7 465 if the trial court could not instruct the jury on how to come to such a verdict. Adams\u2019s claims fail, however, because failing to object to the special verdict was not deficient performance. A special verdict is a proper method to create an unambiguous record for appeal. \u201cWe have recommended, and continue to recommend, that trial judges use a special verdict to avoid ... ambiguity.\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 245 n. 33, 772 A.2d 283, 304 n. 33 (2001) (citations omitted); <em>Gover v. Turner, </em>28 Md. 600 (1868) (holding that special verdicts may be found in criminal as well as in civil cases); <em>see State v. Frye, </em>283 Md. 709, 723, 393 A.2d 1372, 1379 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">(Where there is more than one ground for a verdict on a criminal charge, but where the ramifications of a guilty verdict on that charge will be different depending upon the ground chosen by the jury .... the court should ... give them appropriate instructions so that the basis of a ... verdict will be revealed. [Citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In the present case, the trial court explained the ambiguity that otherwise could result from a guilty verdict absent the special finding. Any appellate review would be hampered by the lack of a clear finding by the jury, likely necessitating a new trial or dismissal.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals here found that Adams\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because he failed to object to the instruction despite the fact that <em>McBurney v. State, </em>280 Md. 21, 371 A.2d 129 (1977), \u201cproclaiming that \u00a7 465 of Article 27 had no extra-territorial effect, was handed down more than two years before [Adams\u2019s] trial.\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>171 Md. App. 668, 711, 912 A.2d 16, 42 (2006). We are at a loss to appreciate how <em>McBumey </em>could be read to contain such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201cproclamation.\u201d We need not summarize <em>McBurney. </em>here, as it is sufficient to the moment to observe that the Court in <em>McBurney </em>discussed neither \u00a7 465 of Article 27 nor extraterritorial jurisdiction. It merely offered a brief discussion of the difference between jurisdiction and venue. Adams\u2019s trial counsel, and for that matter the trial court, understood the difference between jurisdiction and venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The focus of Adams\u2019s post-conviction argument concerns the application of \u00a7 465. Its resolution depends on whether \u00a7 465 was intended to address venue or was a jurisdiction-expanding statute. Either interpretation was reasonable, and thus, Adams\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient for failing to object. The law on extra-territorial jurisdiction is well-settled that states validly may expand their common law territorial jurisdiction by statute to the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution. <em>See West v. State, </em>369 Md. 150, 161, 797 A.2d 1278, 1284 (2002) (\u201c[M]any states have by statute expanded territorial criminal jurisdiction, so that, if any element of an offense takes place in the state, the state would have jurisdiction. Maryland, however, has not enacted such a statute.\u201d (citing <em>Pennington v. State, </em>308 Md. 727, 728-29 n. 2, 521 A.2d 1216, 1216-17 n. 2 (1987))). Although it was later held to be a statute addressing venue, \u00a7 465 reasonably could be interpreted by counsel validly to be an effort to expand Maryland\u2019s territorial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Additionally, Adams\u2019s trial counsel was not deficient because he properly preserved his argument that \u00a7 465 did not expand Maryland\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. In fact, the trial court explained to Adams\u2019s counsel exactly how this particular instruction would assist him if the ruling on the statute later proved to be the subject of an appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Court: ... I think I am going to solve this problem very easily. I am going to instruct on the statute, and also add the question to be decided by the jury where all these acts took place. At this time I may agree with [the State\u2019s Attorney]. Maybe at a later time I may disagree with you. If the jury can make a finding it might solve a lot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>problems, if this case went to the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals and there was a specific finding in that regard by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: Your Honor, I hate to interrupt the Court, but I think this is the very issue we addressed earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Adams\u2019s Defense Counsel: The State has not shown anything upon which the jury can make that determination. And that is why I submit to the Court that this should not be passed to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">Court: If this case is ever appealed, or he is convicted and I make a subsequent ruling the statute applies out of state, and the Court of Appeals says I am wrong, or the jury says that it did happen in the District and I am wrong, that ends it right then and there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">State\u2019s Attorney: ... It is a good procedure to get the jury to come back with specific findings of fact in a case like this, obviously, if this case is appealed to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoM\">Court: How would the Court of Appeals know how the jury made a determination, based on what you told me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">Court: Now suppose I agree with you and say you are absolutely right in your interpretation, then this case goes to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals says this is not the law, didn\u2019t have any jurisdiction because it happened \u2014 they don\u2019t really know where it happened.

Adams also objected to the trial court\u2019s failure to give an instruction to the jury informing them that they may choose the weight to accord a photographic array and a lineup identification. The judge agreed with Adams and gave the instruction. Finally, Adams objected to the instruction given by the trial court that said a trial is \"a search for the truth.\u201d Adams contended that the definition of a trial was more properly described as a \u201cdetermination as to whether or not the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u201d The judge overruled Adams\u2019s objection to the \u201csearch for the truth\u201d instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\">. Adams contended that: (1) the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the crimes occurred in Maryland; (2) the in-court identifications by Kathy P. and Teresa B. should have been suppressed; (3) the absence of co-defendant Knight from the trial, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>he pled guilty, prejudiced the jury; (4) he was prejudiced when the jury members saw him wearing handcuffs in the hallway of the courthouse; (5) the indictment was invalid because the language of the indictment did not properly differentiate the various counts; (6) the trial court erred in denying Adams\u2019s pro se \"Motion to Dismiss Indictments Because of Delay to Prosecute\"; (7) the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on special difficulties posed by cross-racial identifications; and (8) the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a trial is a \"search for the truth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">.

The dissent contends that <em>Jenkins </em>is factually on point. Dissent op. at 332-33, 958 A.2d at 351-52. It is not, however, legally on point. The District Court in <em>Jenkins </em>stated that \u201cJenkins did not raise an objection to the advisory nature of the jury instructions at the trial or on appeal, and thus, consistent with Maryland\u2019s procedural default rule, appears to have waived the right to raise the issue on post-conviction or habeas review.\u201d <em>Jenkins v.

Despite Jenkins having procedurally waived his right to object to the jury instructions, the Circuit Court for Prince George's County addressed on the merits his argument raised for the first time in his fifth post conviction petition and fifth habeas corpus petition. The <em>Wainwright </em>rule is therefore inapplicable where the state in effect ignores its own independent state procedural default rule and addresses the merits of an argument....

Thus, the federal court avoided the issue of waiver because the state court previously addressed Jenkins\u2019s issues on the merits. In the present case, however, we review the waiver analysis of the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals. Because the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in <em>Jenkins </em>addressed the merits, the federal court bypassed the waiver issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"><em>. </em>Judge Eldridge concurred in the result, joined by Judge Davidson.

Maryland Code (2001), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 7-106(c) provides that a post-conviction petitioner may obtain relief, even if the claim for relief has been waived or finally litigated, if a judicial decision from a \"binding\u201d court imposes a new \"procedural or substantive standard\u201d that is \"intended to be applied retrospectively.\" <em>Stevenson </em>did not articulate a new \"procedural or substantive standard. Therefore, Adams may not obtain relief under \u00a7 7-106(c). In any event, such an argument is not properly before this Court. Adams attempts to adopt in this regard, by reference, the arguments contained in an amicus brief filed by Families Against Injustice. Adams cites Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 503(0, which provides that in a \"case involving more than one appellant or appellee, any appellant or appellee may adopt by reference any part of the brief of another.\u201d The present case has only a single appellant, the State, and a single appellee, Adams. The rule only permits litigants to adopt the arguments of other parties to the litigation. Thus, this argument is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The dissent is critical of this footnote. Dissent op. at 311-12, 958 A.2d at 338-39 n. 6. Maryland Rule 8-503 requires that a case must \"involved more than one appellant or appellee\u201d before a party may adopt the arguments in the brief of another. Further, the dissent conflates \"issues\u201d with \"arguments.\u201d The two are not the same. The issue of whether \u00a7 7-106 applies to Adams\u2019s case is properly before this Court. Adams\u2019s arguments regarding the application of 7-106(c) are not. In any event, a further footnote duel is pointless. The dissent and majority opinion agree that \"the waiver provisions of the Post Conviction Act are not directly applicable to this case.\u201d Dissent op. at 302, 958 A.2d at 332-33 n. 1. The considerations discussed in \u00a7 7-106(c), nonetheless, may serve as guidance in determining whether discretion should be exercised to excuse a waiver. Further, the real disagreement between the dissent's position and our own is that we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>were not \u201cnew law\u201d when they were decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">.

In endeavoring to rebut the presumption of waiver, normally the petitioner is attempting to demonstrate that, although he intended to act to preserve an issue for review, an excusable oversight caused the issue not to be preserved. For example, in <em>Creighton v.

There is a tactical aspect associated with the decision whether to object to the advisory jury instructions. Judge Markell described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>advisory jury instruction as a \"special constitutional boon\u201d to defendants. Charles Markell, <em>Trial by Jury: A Two-Horse Team or One-Horse Team, </em>42 Md. St. Bar. Assc. Rep. 72, 91 (1937). In 1976, Gary J. Jacobsohn conducted a survey of Maryland judges, soliciting their opinions regarding the advisory jury instruction. Over thirty-eight percent of respondents to the survey said that the advisory instruction \u201ctends to help the Defendant.\u201d No respondents said that it helped the prosecution. Gary J. Jacobsohn, <em>The Right to Disagree: Judges, Juries, and the Administration of Criminal Justice in Maryland, </em>1976 WASH. U.L.Q. 571, 588 (1976). In the face of these data, it is obvious why a criminal defendant may decline to object to advisory jury instructions. Recognizing its potential benefits to their cause, some defendants sought to have the advisory jury instruction revived after <em>Stevenson. E.g., Allnutt v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 694, 701, 478 A.2d 321, 324 (1984); <em>Sibiga v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 69, 74, 499 A.2d 484, 486 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">.

There is no doubt that an appellate court may exercise its discretion under Rule 8-131 to consider an unpreserved issue that should have been raised in the earlier-reviewing post-conviction court or courts. This distinction is key. For example, in <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 843 A.2d 778 (2004), the Court of Special Appeals exercised discretion to consider the merits of the State's argument mounted initially before the intermediate appellate court, though not properly preserved in the post-conviction trial court. We affirmed the intermediate appellate court's exercise of discretion. <em>Jones, </em>379 Md. at 715, 843 A.2d at 785.

As a result, the post-conviction court did not address waiver in connection with these arguments.

We can only find one case that has gone so far as to imply a similar discretion in a trial court when it considers a post-conviction petition. <em>See Walker, </em>343 Md. at 647-648, 684 A.2d at 438 (\"Nevertheless, as the circuit court recognized in the present case, this Court has taken the position that a court, in a post-conviction proceeding, can excuse a waiver based upon an earlier procedural default if the circumstances warrant such action. In effect, we have upheld the application of the 'plain error\u2019 or 'special circumstances\u2019 principles to waivers of the type here involved.\u201d). As noted in <em>Cirincione, </em>the authorities relied upon by <em>Walker </em>in support of this assertion, however, do not support <em>Walker\u2019s </em>expansive view of judicial discretion. <em>Walker </em>first cites <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 272-274, 681 A.2d at 38. <em>Oken, </em>however, states that \"[fonder Maryland Rule 8-131, this Court retains discretion to excuse a waiver.\u201d Thus, <em>Oken </em>relies upon a rule applicable only to appellate courts considering direct appeals.

The use by Adams and the courts below of the word \u201cbar\u201d overtaxes its proper definition. \"Bar,\u201d used as verb, means \"to prevent, especially by legal objection.\u201d Black's Law Dictionary 158 (8th ed.2004). There was nothing to \"bar\u201d Adams from raising objections to the jury instructions. Nothing prevented Adams from making this objection known to the trial court immediately after the jury was given the instructions. At best, Adams\u2019s contention should be understood as asserting that had he made a proper objection in this regard, the trial court likely would have overruled his objection. Assuming that to be the case, Adams hardly was \"barred\u201d from making such an objection and preserving it for appeal. There is nothing in this record, however, to indicate that such an objection would have been futile. <em>See Bobbitt v.

At the time of this discussion, Adams's counsel was waiting on a ruling on a motion for acquittal where he had argued that there was insufficient evidence for the case to go to the jury. The motion was later denied. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed on direct appeal, holding that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes occurred in Maryland. That issue has been finally litigated and is not before us here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. There is a basis for a tactical decision to permit the trial court to instruct the jury on \u00a7 465. The instructions to the jury were clear that they were to consider first whether the rapes occurred in Maryland. If they could not find that beyond a reasonable doubt, only then were they to proceed to potential jurisdiction under \u00a7 465. If the jury found jurisdiction under \u00a7 465, it necessarily would have found a reasonable doubt that the rapes occurred in Maryland. On appellate review of a conviction, Adams would be in a better position with a conviction with jurisdiction founded on \u00a7 465 than a general verdict. If the review was of a general verdict, the case likely would be remanded for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>because any appellate court would be unable to discern whether the jury verdict was based upon an impermissible interpretation of a venue statute. If the verdict was based on a special verdict under \u00a7 465, Adams would have a valid argument that the conviction should be reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to enter a verdict of not guilty because, by addressing \u00a7 465, the jury necessarily would have found that there was a reasonable doubt whether the rapes occurred in Maryland. Adams could argue such a finding mandates that a judgment of not guilty be entered in his favor. Jeopardy would have attached, and Adams would be free from re-trial by the State. This, of course, would be a far better result than the remand for a new trial based on the general verdict because Adams, a defendant accused of brutal and violent crimes and relying on a technical jurisdictional defense, would again have to face a jury of his peers. That the jury found that the crimes actually occurred in Maryland does not alter our analysis of the possible tactical nature of Adams\u2019s trial counsel's decision. \u201cWe are, however, without authority to review errors in trial tactics of defense counsel or to speculate as to possibilities that different tactics might have produced a different result.\u201d <em>Madison v. State, </em>200 Md. 1, 8-9, 87 A.2d 593, 596 (1952); <em>see also Vickers v. State, </em>320 Ark. 437, 898 S.W.2d 26, 28 (1995) (\u201c[Mjatters of trial tactics and strategy ... are not grounds for post-conviction relief.\u201d); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (\u201c[SJtrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Furthermore, that the jury was instructed on the special verdict only increases the potential for a \"compromise verdict\u201d regarding jurisdiction. If a compromise verdict were to occur, finding jurisdiction based on \u00a7 465, it could have set in motion the wheels leading to Adams\u2019s outright acquittal. Adams may now claim that the special verdict and jurisdiction instruction were improper and he suffered prejudice; however, at the time of the trial, it may have been the only trial tactic that possibly could have resulted in an acquittal in spite of the substantial evidence of his guilt. This Court will not find counsel to be ineffective where there is a reasonable tactical basis to support trial counsel\u2019s actions. <em>See Oken, </em>343 Md. at 283, 681 A.2d at 43 (holding that to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must \"overcome the presumption that the challenged action might, under the circumstances, be considered sound trial strategy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">. In the typical <em>Strickland </em>analysis, we would review evidence against the petitioner to determine if, but for counsel\u2019s errors, \"substantial possibility\u201d existed that the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Bowers v.

In the instant case, however, we shall not consider the substantial evidence indicating Adams\u2019s guilt because the result of his trial would have been different if he was able to raise a reasonable doubt that the \"vital\u201d element of the crime of rape, the proscribed harmful physical contact with the victim, occurred in Maryland. <em>West, </em>369 Md. at 158, 797 A.2d at 1283.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">I would affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The majority opinion today, like the majority opinion in <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980), mis-reads the pre-1980 opinions of this Court dealing with the Maryland constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases. Moreover, the majority opinion in the case at bar is replete with erroneous statements, unsupported assertions, and faulty analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The principal issue before this Court is whether the respondent Adams is entitled to post-conviction relief even though, at his 1979 trial, there was no objection to the advisory nature of the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions. Under our cases, if <em>Stevenson v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 437 A.2d 654 (1981), represented a new constitutional ruling or set forth a new constitutional standard governing Maryland criminal proceedings, and were retroactive, Adams is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">An examination of this Court\u2019s <em>pre-Stevenson </em>opinions, construing or applying the state constitutional mandate that juries are the judges of the law in criminal cases, demonstrates that <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>constituted a major departure from this Court\u2019s previous opinions. The <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>interpretation of the constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases was a new interpretation, and it was fully retroactive. This Court\u2019s opinions clearly entitled Adams to a new trial governed by the principles set forth in <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Before turning to the principal issue in this case, however, there is a preliminary matter which should be noted. As set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Stevenson v. State, supra, </em>289 Md. at 189-204, 423 A.2d at 570-577, and my concurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>opinion in <em>Montgomery v. State, supra, </em>292 Md. at 96, 437 A.2d at 660 (1981), I continue to believe that the first paragraph of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, on its face, violates the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The first paragraph of Article 23 mandates: \u201cIn the trial of <em>all criminal cases, </em>the Jury shall be the Judges of <em>Law, </em>as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added). The majority construes the phrase \u201call criminal cases\u201d to mean only some criminal cases and the word \u201cLaw\u201d to mean only a very small portion of the applicable law. This approach is in sharp contrast with the numerous opinions of this Court holding that constitutional or statutory language should not be distorted in order to reach a particular result. <em>See, e.g., Bednar v. Provident, </em>402 Md. 532, 543-544, 937 A.2d 210, 216 (2007) (The word \u201cany\u201d in a statute \u201cdoes not mean only \u2018some\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bowen v. Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 615, 937 A.2d 242, 250 (2007) (The \u201c \u2018meaning of the [word] \u201cany\u201d does not imply limitation\u2019 \u201d); <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N. A, </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654 (2001) (This Court does not \u201cengage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to ... limit the [enactment\u2019s] meaning\u201d); <em>Montrose Christian School v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 595, 770 A.2d 111, 129 (2001) (To substitute the word \u201cprimarily\u201d for the word \u201cpurely\u201d in an enactment, would \u201c \u2018be to re-draft the [enactment] under the guise of construction,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>294 Md. 370, 378, 451 A.2d 107, 111 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">As shown later in this opinion, prior to the <em>Stevenson </em>case in 1980, the state constitutional provision making the jury the judge of the law in a criminal case was largely construed as it read. Nevertheless, whether construed broadly in accordance with this Court\u2019s opinions before 1980, or \u201cconstrued\u201d narrowly in accordance with the <em>Stevenson </em>re-draft, the Maryland constitutional provision violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and violates the Jury Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The state constitutional provision is also inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>As discussed in the <em>Stevenson </em>dissent, 289 Md. at 191, 423 A.2d at 571, \u201c[a]n essential principle of \u2018due process of law\u2019 is the right to have a case tried and decided in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction.\u201d A system which allows a jury in a criminal case to decide the applicable law generally, or even just \u201cthe law of the crime,\u201d and tells the jury that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the law are \u201cadvisory\u201d and that the jury is free to disregard the instructions, is flatly inconsistent with the right to be tried in accordance with the law of land. Furthermore, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment provision for trial by jury in criminal cases contemplates a jury which is the judge of the facts, receiving binding instructions on the law from the court.\u201d <em>Stevenson </em>(dissenting opinion), 289 Md. at 193-194, 423 A.2d at 572. In addition, when one jury makes a determination as to what the law is, and another jury decides that the same law is totally different, even though the circumstances of both cases are the same, the defendants are not being accorded equal protection of the laws. As long as the trial judge\u2019s instructions, including advisory instructions, are free from error, as long as the evidence is sufficient under the trial court\u2019s and appellate court\u2019s determination of the correct law, and if no erroneous rulings appear on the record, the different determinations of the \u201csame law\u201d by different juries will not be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The first paragraph of Article 23, either as written or as redrafted by the <em>Stevenson </em>majority and the majority today, simply cannot be reconciled with federal constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Another matter should be addressed before discussing the novelty and retroactivity of the <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>interpretation of the state constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases. That matter concerns the applicable body of \u201cwaiver\u201d law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the Court of Special Appeals <em>(State v.

They are not.

State, </em>284 Md. 132, 149-150, 395 A.2d 464, 474 (1978), after reviewing the language and history of the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, as well as cases applying the statute, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cConsequently, we believe that the Legislature, when it spoke of \u2018waiver\u2019 in subsection (c) of Art. 27, \u00a7 645A [now \u00a7 7-106(b) and (c) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act], was using the term in a narrow sense. It intended that subsection (c), with its \u2018intelligent and knowing\u2019 standard, be applicable only in those circumstances where the waiver concept of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst[, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) ] and <em>Fay v. Noia[, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963) ] was applicable. Other situations are beyond the scope of subsection (c), to be governed by case law or any pertinent statutes or rules. Tactical decisions, when made by an authorized competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>attorney, as well as legitimate procedural requirements, will normally bind a criminal defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">More recently, this was explained by Judge Karwacki for the Court in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 137-138, 691 A.2d 1255, 1262-1263, <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1131, 117 S.Ct. 2536, 138 L.Ed.2d 1036 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cThus, the General Assembly contemplated, for purposes of subsection (c) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>waiver there described assumed the restrictive character to which the Supreme Court had ascribed it. This has necessarily led to a dual framework under which a post-conviction petitioner in Maryland may endeavor to assert certain, specific claims or rights not previously raised. That is to say, the nature of the right involved will determine whether the decision is governed by Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(c), or pertinent case law, statutes, or rules. On the one hand, if a defendant\u2019s claim does encompass that narrow band of rights that courts have traditionally required an individual knowingly and intelligently relinquish or abandon in order to waive the right or claim, <em>Walker v. State, </em>343 Md. 629, 642, 684 A.2d 429, 435 (1996), the failure to do so knowingly and intelligently will not preclude raising the matter on post-conviction review. Courts, however, do not apply the same standard of waiver to \u2018the vast array of trial decisions, strategic and tactical, which must be made before and during trial.\u2019 <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 512, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, 48 L.Ed.2d 126, 135 (1976). . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In <em>Walker v.

For example, waiver of a claim that trial counsel\u2019s representation was so inadequate that the defendant was denied his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel requires an \u201cintelligent and knowing waiver\u201d by the defendant; accordingly, the waiver provisions of the Post Conviction Procedure Act are applicable. <em>Curtis v. State, supra, </em>284 Md. at 150-151, 395 A.2d at 474-475, and cases there cited. On the other hand, waiver with respect to most issues does not require \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d action by the defendant, and, with regard to those issues, the waiver provisions of the Post Conviction Procedure Act are not directly applicable. Some Post Conviction Procedure Act cases present both types of issues, <em>i.e., </em>issues governed by the Act\u2019s waiver provisions and issues that are not strictly governed by the statutory provisions. <em>See, e.g., Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 681 A.2d 30 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997); <em>Davis v. State, </em>285 Md. 19, 400 A.2d 406 (1979). It should also be noted, however, that some of this Court\u2019s opinions have not always drawn an explicit distinction between the applicability of the Act\u2019s waiver section and the circumstances when that section does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Ordinarily, as the majority points out, a challenge to a jury instruction is not covered by the waiver provision contained in \u00a7 7-106(b) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act; instead, the failure at trial to object to a jury instruction normally constitutes a waiver of any challenge to the instruction. <em>See Walker v. State, supra, </em>343 Md. at 645-646, 684 A.2d at 437. For example, <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>285 Md. at 32-37, 400 A.2d at 412-414, involved a concededly erroneous jury instruction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>relieved the prosecution of its burden of proving criminal agency beyond a reasonable doubt. Even though the reasonable doubt standard reflects a fundamental constitutional right, the Court in <em>Davis </em>held that, in light of <em>Curtis, </em>the waiver section of the Post Conviction Procedure Act \u201cis not applicable to the advisory jury instruction here.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>285 Md. at 33, 400 A.2d at 413. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rose, </em>345 Md. 238, 243-250, 691 A.2d 1314, 1316-1320 (1997) (The issue concerned a Post Conviction Procedure Act challenge to the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d jury instruction at the defendant\u2019s trial, which was not objected to, and the Court held that the error had been waived by the failure to object); <em>Hunt v. State, supra, </em>345 Md. at 132-139, 149-152, 691 A.2d at 1260-1263, 1268-1269 (same).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In cases not governed by \u00a7 7-106(b) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, the provision in \u00a7 7-106(b)(1)(ii), excusing a waiver if \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exist, does not directly apply. Moreover, the \u201cplain error\u201d concept under Maryland Rule 8-131(a), applicable in direct appeals from criminal judgments, does not technically apply in post conviction actions. <em>Walker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>v. State, supra, </em>343 Md. at 647-648, 684 A.2d at 438. Nevertheless, our post conviction cases have excused waivers when circumstances have justified the application of a \u201cplain error\u201d concept. <em>See, e.g., Hunt v. State, supra, </em>345 Md. at 139, 691 A.2d at 1263 (In a post conviction action, we stated that \u201cthe Court may review otherwise unpreserved issues under the discretion granted by Maryland Rule 8-131\u201d); <em>Oken v. State, supra, </em>343 Md. at 273, 681 A.2d at 38 (A post conviction action in which we held: \u201cUnder Maryland Rule 8-131, this Court retains discretion to excuse a waiver\u201d); <em>Walker v. State, supra, </em>343 Md. at 647-648, 684 A.2d at 438 (\u201c[T]his Court has taken the position that a court, in a post conviction proceeding, can excuse a waiver based upon an earlier procedural default if the circumstances warrant such action\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>There is one situation where the defendant\u2019s failure to object to a jury instruction at trial, or failure otherwise to preserve an issue at trial, is <em>not </em>a waiver for purposes of a Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act proceeding or other post-trial proceeding. That situation is set forth in \u00a7 7-106(c)(2) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyL\">\u201c(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an allegation of error may not be considered to have been finally litigated or waived under this title if a court whose decisions are binding on the lower courts of the State holds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">(i) the Constitution of the United States or the Maryland Constitution imposes on State criminal proceedings a procedural or substantive standard not previously recognized; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">(ii) the standard is intended to be applied retrospectively and would thereby affect the validity of the petitioner\u2019s conviction or sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">When this principle is applicable, a failure to preserve an issue at trial does not constitute a waiver, and, consequently, a court\u2019s discretion to excuse a waiver is not involved. Moreover, under this Court\u2019s opinions, the principle embodied in \u00a7 7-106(c)(2) not only applies to cases directly governed by \u00a7 7-106(b) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, but applies to Post Conviction Procedure Act proceedings not governed by \u00a7 7-106(b), as well as other types of post-trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">For example, <em>State v. Colvin, </em>314 Md. 1, 24-26, 548 A.2d 506, 517-518 (1988), was a post conviction proceeding involving a challenge to the jury instructions and verdict form submitted to the jury in a capital case. Since waiver of jury instructions does not require knowing and intelligent action by the defendant, the <em>Colvin </em>Post Conviction Act proceeding was not directly governed by the waiver provision now in \u00a7 7-106(b) of the statute. The defendant Colvin had failed to object to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>jury instructions and the verdict form at his trial. Subsequent to Colvin\u2019s trial, the Supreme Court in <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), held that similar instructions and a similar verdict form were constitutionally defective. This Court, in Colvin\u2019s post conviction proceeding, held that <em>Mills </em>imposed a new standard and, because it affected the integrity of the fact-finding process, the new standard applied retroactively. The Court concluded (314 Md. at 25, 548 A.2d at 518): \u201cConsequently, Colvin-El\u2019s death sentence <em>must </em>be vacated\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>In <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 199, 362 A.2d 629, 631 (1976), a homicide case, the defendant Evans at his trial did not object to a jury instruction \u201cthat the accused had the burden of \u2018showing the elements which would reduce the crime to manslaughter or which would make the homicide justifiable and excusable.\u2019\u201d After Evans\u2019s conviction of second degree murder and during the pendency of appellate proceedings, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), held, <em>inter alia, </em>that such a jury instruction violated due process principles. This Court in <em>Evans, </em>278 Md. at 210, 362 A.2d at 637, held \u201cthat <em>Mullaney, </em>involving as it does the integrity of the fact-finding function, must be given full retroactive effect in view of our recent decision in <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>275 Md. 689, 344 A.2d 80 (1975).\u201d Even though the case was not covered by the Post Conviction Procedure Act, the Court, in an opinion by Chief Judge Murphy, utilized the Post Conviction Procedure Act in determining that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reversal of the conviction was justified (278 Md. at 211, 362 A.2d at 637):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au3\">\u201cUnder the Post Conviction Procedure Act, ... no error is deemed to have been waived in a case where a decision of the Supreme Court subsequently imposes upon State criminal proceedings \u2018a procedural or substantive standard not theretofore recognized, which such standard is intended to be applied retrospectively and would thereby affect the validity of the petitioner\u2019s conviction or sentence.\u2019 Undoubtedly, the court in <em>Evans </em>considered that the <em>Mullaney </em>errors were subject to collateral attack under this section in any event, and proceeded to recognize them on its own motion____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Numerous other cases, applying the principle of the <em>Evans </em>case, have held that the failure to raise an issue at trial did not constitute a waiver when there was a relevant post-trial Supreme Court or Maryland Court of Appeals ruling changing the legal standard concerning the issue, or have held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>previous failure to raise the issue amounted to a waiver when the subsequent Supreme Court or Court of Appeals ruling did not change the legal standard. <em>See, e.g., Hunt v. State, supra, </em>345 Md. at 151-152, 691 A.2d at 1269-1270 (Defendant\u2019s previous failure to challenge the trial court\u2019s \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction constituted a waiver because the post-trial case relied upon by <em>Hunt </em>\u201cdid not alter existing case law\u201d); <em>Walker v.

State and Montgomery v. State </em>clearly established a new legal standard. The majority opinion in <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564, held that the jury\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d under the first paragraph of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">\u201cis <em>limited </em>to deciding \u2018the law of the crime,\u2019 <em>Wheeler v.

None of the pre<em>Stevenson </em>opinions of this Court, cited by either the <em>Stevenson </em>majority or the majority today, and no other <em>pre-Stevenson </em>opinions of this Court which have come to my attention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>support the proposition that the jury\u2019s right to decide the law in criminal cases is limited to the \u201claw of the crime\u201d and the \u201clegal effect of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What the <em>Stevenson </em>majority did, and what the present majority re-affirms, is to take the phrases \u201claw of the crime\u201d and \u201clegal effect of the evidence\u201d out of context from <em>pre-Stevenson </em>opinions, and then insert the phrase \u201climited to\u201d or similar language which never appeared in the pr <em>e-Stevenson </em>opinions. No opinion of this Court prior to 1980 ever suggested or intimated that the constitutional provision was limited to the \u201claw of the crime\u201d and the \u201clegal effect of the evidence.\u201d On the contrary, this Court\u2019s pr <em>e-Stevenson </em>opinions demonstrate that juries in criminal cases had a broad role in determining the law, with the only two exceptions being the constitutionality of a federal or Maryland statute and rulings on the admissibility of evidence. More specifically, cases in this Court prior to <em>Stevenson </em>took the position that \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d and \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instructions were only \u201cadvisory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Those who purport to see, in this Court\u2019s pr <em>e-Stevenson </em>opinions, a very limited role for juries as judges of the law in criminal cases, remind me of the crowd (with the exception of one child) who purported to see and admire the Emperor\u2019s new clothes, although they knew better, in the story by Hans Christian Andersen. No rational person examining this Court\u2019s opinions prior to the date <em>Stevenson </em>was filed (December 17, 1980), can see more than two exceptions to the constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The constitutional provision, stating that juries are the judges of the law in criminal cases, was initially adopted as part of the Maryland Constitution of 1851. The first case discussing the provision, in dicta, was <em>Franklin v. State, </em>12 Md. 236 (1858). The conviction in <em>Franklin </em>was reversed because of a defective indictment. Justice Bartol delivered the opinion of the Court (12 Md. at 249-250), which agreed in dicta with a concurring opinion by Chief Justice LeGrand (12 Md. at 246) that the constitutional provision making juries the \u201cjudges of the law\u201d in criminal cases did not authorize the jury to decide \u201cthe constitutionality of an Act of Congress or of the State Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <em>Franklin </em>opinion did not discuss or recognize any other exception to the constitutional provision that juries are the judges of the law in criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The next opinion discussing the constitutional provision authorizing juries to decide the law in criminal cases was <em>Wheeler v. State, supra, </em>42 Md. at 570. As earlier noted, <em>supra </em>n. 7, <em>Wheeler </em>and <em>Beard v. State, supra, </em>71 Md. at 280, 17 A. at 1045, took the position that the jury\u2019s authority did not extend to the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence. This was the only exception to the constitutional provision mentioned by either opinion. In fact, Chief Judge Alvey for the Court in <em>Beard, </em>71 Md. at 279-280, 17 A. at 1045, emphasized that, when a trial judge decided that it was appropriate to instruct the jury, \u201cit has always been deemed necessary that he [or she] should be careful to put the instruction in an advisory form, so that the jury be left entirely free to find their verdict in accordance with their own judgment of the law, as well as the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Between 1858, when <em>Franklin v. State, supra, </em>was decided, until December 17, 1980, when <em>Stevenson </em>was decided, the opinions of this Court recognized no more than two exceptions to the constitutional mandate that juries were the judges of the law in criminal cases. Some of this Court\u2019s opinions discussing the constitutional provision failed to mention any exception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A number of opinions recognized that a ruling on the constitutionality of an Act of Congress or of an Act of the Maryland General Assembly constituted an exception.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>eral opinions by this Court indicated that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence was an exception to the constitutional provision, without mentioning any other exception.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There appear to be only two pr <em>e-Stevenson </em>opinions of this Court which recognize both of the above-mentioned exceptions,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and one opinion which stated that there is just \u201cone exception\u201d without specifying what the exception is.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Not only do the pr <em>e-Stevenson </em>opinions of this Court recognize just two exceptions to the constitutional mandate contained in the first paragraph of Article 23, but, as previously noted, the pr <em>e-Stevenson </em>opinions repeatedly indicate that the constitutional mandate is extremely broad. Thus in <em>Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 580, 357 A.2d 360, 366 (1976), Judge O\u2019Donnell for the Court explained (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQX\">\u201cUnder \u2018our almost unique Constitutional provision any instructions on the law which the [trial] court may give\u2019 are purely advisory and the jury must be so informed. <em>Schanker v. State, </em>208 Md. 15, 21, 116 A.2d 363, 366 (1955). As observed in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>180 Md. 658, 667, 26 A.2d 815, 819 (1942), \u2018[t]he judge may tell [the jury] what he thinks the law is, but he must tell them it is merely advisory and they are not bound to follow it____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cOur predecessors in <em>Slansky v. State, </em>192 Md. 94, 63 A.2d 599 (1949), pointed out that a trial judge, in instructing in a criminal case, \u2018should be careful to couch the instruction in an advisory form, so that the jury are left free to find their verdict in accordance with their own judgment of the law as well as the facts. When such an instruction is given, it goes to the jury simply <em>as a means of enlightenment, </em>and not, as in civil cases, as a binding rule for their government. <em>Broll v. State, </em>45 Md. 356 [(1876)]; <em>Swann v. State, </em>64 Md. 423,1 A. 872 [(1885)]; <em>Dick v.

It is impossible that the Legislature contemplated giving the right to parties in criminal cases to have instructions upon the law and the legal effect of evidence, and exceptions to such rulings, in the face of the constitutional provision under which juries are at liberty to treat such instructions with utter disregard, and to find their verdict in direct opposition to them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Moreover, the cases in this Court prior to 1980, all holding that juries in criminal cases had the authority to decide almost all legal issues, included cases involving constitutional rights.

State, supra, </em>285 Md. at 24-31, 400 A.2d at 408-412, an action under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, considered a jury instruction which erroneously placed the burden of proof upon the defendant with respect to \u201calibi.\u201d The Court held in <em>Davis </em>that the jury instruction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment but that the violation was waived by the defendant\u2019s failure at his trial to object to the erroneous instruction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is significant, however, that the Court\u2019s opinion referred \u201cto the <em>advisory </em>jury instruction here,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>285 Md. at 33, 400 A.2d at 413 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In <em>Bruce v. State, supra, </em>218 Md. at 97-98, 145 A.2d at 433-434, after stating that, \u201cwhen requested in a criminal case,\u201d the trial court should \u201cgive an <em>advisory </em>instruction on <em>every </em>essential question or point of law,\u201d this Court decided that the trial \u201ccourt properly <em>advised </em>the jury [that] the defendant is <em>\u2018presumed to be innocent </em>until proven guilty <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>and that presumption attends him throughout the trial until overcome by proof establishing his guilt <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>and to a moral certainty.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). .</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Similarly, in <em>Klein v. State, </em>151 Md. 484, 489, 135 A. 591, 593 (1926), this Court, upholding the criminal conviction, set forth with apparent approval part of the trial judge\u2019s instructions as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cIt seems that the jury which heard the case had been engaged in the trial of civil cases, and after the jury was sworn, but before anything further was done, the court undertook to advise the jury of some of the differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>between their duties in a criminal case and in a civil case in Maryland. He called their attention to the <em>presumption of innocence </em>which surrounds the accused in a criminal case, discussed the degree of proof needed for a conviction, gave an explanation of <em>the doctrine of reasonable doubt, </em>told them several times that they were the judges of both the law and the facts in a criminal case, and concluded with the statement that <em>all he had told them was merely advisory and that the jury, being judges of both the law and the facts, were not bound by what he had said.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The <em>Klein </em>opinion went on to reiterate that \u201cjuries in criminal cases are the judges of both the law and the facts, and hence the court cannot give them binding instructions in such cases.\u201d 151 Md. at 489, 185 A. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Court in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>239 Md. 245, 210 A.2d 824 (1965), reversed a conviction and remanded the case for a new trial because the trial judge would not allow defense counsel to argue to the jury search and seizure law and the law of arrest. Judge Sybert for the Court explained (239 Md. at 254, 210 A.2d at 828):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201cWe think the judgment must be reversed because the trial judge erred when he prevented defense counsel from arguing to the jury the questions whether the appellant had voluntarily consented to the searches and seizures, or whether his apparent acquiescence had been induced by an unlawful arrest. Whether these were questions of law or of fact, or a combination of both, they were within the domain of the jury and counsel was entitled to discuss the facts relative thereto and inform the jury of the applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">\u201cUnder our almost unique constitutional provision, the jury is the judge of the law as well as of the facts in criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">A criminal conviction was reversed in <em>Wilkerson v. State, </em>171 Md. 287, 188 A. 813 (1937), because the trial judge would not allow defense counsel to argue a principle of self-incrimination law to the jury. This Court stated (171 Md. at 289, 188 A. at 814):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201c[Defense] counsel, during the course of his argument to the jury, made the statement that, \u2018No presumption of guilt arose from the fact that traverser failed to take the witness stand,\u2019 whereupon the State\u2019s Attorney objected to the statement and was sustained by the court, who also remarked that it was \u2018not proper for counsel to comment in any way on the failure of the defendant to take the witness stand.\u2019 The court\u2019s action, of course, prevented traverser\u2019s counsel from stating to the jury the law applicable to the situation under consideration, notwithstanding ... the Maryland Constitution, which provides, \u2018in the trial of all criminal cases, the jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The <em>Wilkerson </em>opinion continued (171 Md. at 290, 188 A. at 814):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cSince, therefore, by constitutional provision the jurors are made the judges of law as well as of fact, it is difficult to understand how they are to know the law in any particular case if counsel are to be denied the privilege of stating it to them, for the court will take judicial knowledge of the fact that most jurors are laymen, and therefore do not possess knowledge of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>See also Wilson v.

A 1950 state constitutional amendment added the following language to the provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases: \u201cexcept that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d Before 1950, this Court took the position that the sufficiency of the evidence was for the jury. It was held that not even the Court of Appeals could \u201cpass upon ... the sufficiency of evidence to establish the crime charged.\u201d <em>Slansky v. State, </em>192 Md. 94, 109, 63 A.2d 599, 606 (1949). <em>See Dick v. State, </em>107 Md. 11, 17, 68 A. 286, 288 (1907) (\u201c[T]he motion to strike out the testimony of the State was in legal effect a demurrer to the evidence and an attempt to obtain an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>instruction from the Court to the jury to render a verdict for the defendant, and it is well settled that this cannot be done in Maryland, where the jury in criminal cases are the judges of the law, and of the ... legal sufficiency of the evidence, and the Court <em>only </em>determines the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d) (emphasis added) <em>See also Bloomer v.

The \u201cjury \u2018as Judges of the Law,\u2019 is free \u2018to construe [a statute] and apply it according to their own judgments,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dillon, </em>277 Md. at 583, 357 A.2d at 368. <em>See Vogel v.

State, supra, </em>107 Md. at 18, 68 A. at 289, one issue concerned the interpretation of a statute making an \u201cagent\u201d criminally liable for certain conduct. The State\u2019s Attorney, in argument to the jurors, told them \u201c \u2018that the construction of the statute, as to whether the defendant was an agent within the meaning of the statute was something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>they had nothing to do with, inasmuch as the Court had already determined that question in ruling upon the testimony\u2019____\u201d This Court reversed the criminal conviction because of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s argument, saying (107 Md. at 19, 68 A. at 289, emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cWe think it was clearly improper, for the State\u2019s Attorney to tell the jury that whether the defendant was an agent within the meaning of the statute was something with which they had nothing to do. It is manifest that if, as we have seen from our own decisions cited, the Court cannot pronounce and decide upon the legal effect of the evidence and can only <em>bind and conclude </em>the jury as to what evidence shall be <em>considered </em>by them, the State\u2019s Attorney cannot undertake to declare to the jury that the Court had in fact, by admitting the testimony deprived the jury of its constitutional power to construe and interpret the statute and apply it according to their own judgments. It may be apparently anomalous when the Court in passing upon the admissibility of testimony has given <em>its </em>interpretation of the meaning of the statute, that the jury should still be free to adopt <em>its own </em>interpretation; but this is precisely the anomaly resulting from our system of administering the criminal law and which results whenever the Court instructs the jury in a criminal case, and the verdict which follows is not in accord with the view expressed by the Court; and it is too well settled in this State to require the production of authority, that the Judge may state his own views of the law to the jury, provided he also informs them that his utterance is advisory only, and that they are free to adopt their own independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Many other types of legal issues have been involved in this Court\u2019s opinions regarding the constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases, and, prior to 1980, such issues have been deemed to fall within the province of the juries. <em>See, e.g., Dillon v. State, supra, </em>277 Md. at 582-583, 357 A.2d at 367-368. (It was held to be appropriate, because of the jury\u2019s constitutional role, to read to the jury the Declaration of Policy from the preamble to the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Handgun Statute, even though the Declaration \u201cforms no part of a statute\u201d); <em>Hardison v.

State, </em>285 Md. 705, 724, 404 A.2d 1073, 1083 (1979). The majority today, however, says (Opinion at 257-258, 958 A.2d at 306, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cThe <em>[Stevenson </em>] majority opinion highlighted, as an example, a then recent decision applying the long established principle that the jury serves only as a judge of the <em>\u2018law of the crime. </em>\u2019 <em>See Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 724, 404 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>1073, 1083 (1979) (holding that instructions on the voluntariness of confessions are binding, not merely advisory, on the jury, and the jury should be instructed as such).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The <em>Lewis </em>opinion never mentioned the phrase \u201claw of the crime.\u201d The only \u201cexception\u201d recognized by <em>Lewis </em>was the long-recognized exception for the admissibility of evidence, and the admissibility issue in <em>Lems </em>concerned the admissibility of a confession. The pertinent portion of the <em>Lewis </em>opinion reads as follows (285 Md. at 723-724, 404 A.2d at 1083, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201cUnder ... the Constitution of Maryland, implemented by Maryland Rule 757 b, a jury in a criminal trial is instructed that it is the judge of the law as well as the facts, and that the court\u2019s instructions are merely advisory. <em>See Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 357 A.2d 360 (1976). <em>An exception </em>to this principle is that determinations of the law governing the admissibility of evidence are within the sole domain of the trial judge, <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 89-90, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and the Maryland cases there discussed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">\u201cHere, the defendant contends that by instructing the jury as to the law pertaining to the admissibility of confessions, and later telling them generally that the instructions are merely advisory, error was committed. <em>In light of the instructions as a whole, we are not prepared to say that reversible error was committed. </em>Nevertheless, we agree with the defendant that, since the jury\u2019s consideration of the voluntariness of the confession involves a delegation to it to determine the propriety of admitting this evidence, <em>Dempsey v. State, supra, </em>277 Md. at 143-150, [355 A.2d 455 (1976)], the instructions in this regard fall within the exception discussed in <em>Brady </em>and are consequently binding upon the jury. Henceforth in all criminal cases involving the jury\u2019s consideration of the admissibility of a confession, including the instant case on retrial, appropriate instructions to this effect should be given to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">As indicated above, the conviction in <em>Lewis </em>was not reversed because of the \u201cadvisory\u201d jury instruction. The <em>Lewis </em>convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tion was reversed, and a new trial awarded, because of violations of the common law rules concerning the trial of accessories. <em>Lewis, </em>285 Md. at 713-717, 404 A.2d at 1077-1079 (\u201c[O]ur reversal in this case rests upon the common law doctrine of accessoryship\u201d). Furthermore, to reiterate, the <em>Lewis </em>opinion recognized only <em>\u201can </em>exception\u201d to the constitutional provision that juries are the judges of the law in criminal cases, namely the \u201cexception\u201d for rulings on the admissibility of evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In support of its argument that the <em>Stevenson </em>opinion did not \u201cmake new law\u201d in its interpretation of the Maryland constitutional provision mandating that juries are the judges of the law in criminal cases, the majority quotes the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in <em>Jenkins v. Smith, </em>38 F.Supp.2d 417, 421 (D.Md.1999), <em>motion to amend or alter judgment denied, </em>43 F.Supp.2d 556 (D.Md. 1999), <em>aff'd sub nom. Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679 (4th Cir.2000). Of course, the District Court in <em>Jenkins </em>was simply recounting how the <em>Stevenson </em>majority described the <em>Stevenson </em>opinion. What is significant, however, is that the <em>Jenkins </em>case is <em>factually </em>on point, that the United States District Court in a federal habeas corpus action granted Jenkins\u2019s habeas corpus petition, that the District Court set aside Jenkins\u2019s Maryland criminal conviction, that the District Court ordered Jenkins\u2019s immediate release unless the State of Maryland elected to retry him, and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Jenkins, like the respondent Adams, was convicted of various criminal offenses by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>George\u2019s County. His trial took place in 1975. At Jenkins\u2019s trial, like Adams\u2019s trial, the judge instructed the jury with regard to several rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the requirement that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Again, like the trial judge in the <em>Adams </em>case, the trial judge in the <em>Jenkins </em>case repeatedly told the jury that the judge\u2019s instructions were advisory and that the jury, as judge of the law, could disregard the instructions. As in the <em>Adams </em>case, the defendant Jenkins did not object to the advisory nature of the instructions and did not raise the issue on appeal. Nevertheless, both federal courts considered the merits of the question, and they held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Jenkins had been denied his federal constitutional rights and was entitled to relief. The United States Court of Appeals concluded (221 F.3d at 685-686):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cHere, the trial court clearly explained at the beginning of its charge to the jury that the jury was the sole judge of the law and that the instructions given by the court were advisory only. With each individual instruction, the court reminded the jury of the advisory nature of the instructions. We conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury interpreted these instructions as allowing it to ignore the \u2018advice\u2019 of the court that the jury should find proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we conclude that the advisory instructions violated Jenkins\u2019 right to due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">[A]n error in an instruction that relieves the State of its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt can never be harmless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The majority opinion in the instant case asserts that <em>Jenkins </em>is not \u201clegally on point.\u201d Nonetheless, <em>Jenkins </em>could not be more precise in its legal analysis that the advisory jury instructions deprived the accused of his constitutional rights and that the accused was entitled to relief. It is noteworthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that the Court of Special Appeals in the case at bar relied on, <em>inter alia, </em>the United State Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Jenkins. See State v. Adams, supra, </em>171 Md.App. at 698-704, 912 A.2d at 34-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Judge Harrell\u2019s opinion for the Court advances other arguments for his theory that <em>Stevenson </em>was not a novel ruling and did not depart from earlier Court of Appeals cases. The arguments are not persuasive and can be briefly answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The majority opinion suggests that because <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>\u201cwere decided relatively contemporaneously with Adams\u2019s trial,\u201d an objection by Adams to the advisory nature of the judge\u2019s instructions would not have been \u201cnovel\u201d under Maryland law. (Opinion at 272-273, 958 A.2d at 315 n. 28, 273-274, 958 A.2d at 315-316). Not only was Adams\u2019s trial more than a year before the <em>Stevenson </em>opinion, but his appeal and the denial of certiorari by this Court was prior to <em>Stevenson. </em>The opinion in <em>Lewis v. State, supra, </em>285 Md. at 723-724, 404 A.2d at 1083, however, was filed about three months before Adams\u2019s trial, and <em>Lewis </em>reiterated the requirement of the Maryland Constitution and the Maryland Rules that the \u201cjury in a criminal trial ... is the judge of the law as well as the facts, and that the court\u2019s instructions are merely advisory.\u201d As previously discussed, the only \u201cexception\u201d recognized in <em>Lewis </em>concerned rulings on the admissibility of evidence. One would not reasonably expect a defense attorney, just three months after the Court of Appeals\u2019 pronouncement in <em>Lewis, </em>to argue to a Maryland trial judge that the Court of Appeals was wrong in <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The majority opinion also argues that, because the requirements that the State prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jury be properly instructed regarding the State\u2019s burden, were \u201cwell established at the time of Adams\u2019s trial,\u201d Adams\u2019s attorney presumably should have objected to the advisory nature of the instructions. (Opinion at 275, 958 A.2d at 317). I agree that these matters were well-established and that the trial judge, at the time of Adams\u2019s trial, should have and did instruct the jury concerning the reasonable doubt standard and the State\u2019s burden. Whether he should also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>have refrained from telling the jury that these instructions were \u201cadvisory,\u201d is another matter. The Maryland Constitution, the cases in the Court of Appeals including the three most recent ones at the time <em>(Lewis, Davis, </em>and Dillon), and the Maryland Rules promulgated by this Court, all told the trial judge and the defense attorney in 1979 that the jury was the judge of the law and that <em>all </em>of the judge\u2019s instructions applicable to <em>Adams\u2019s </em>trial were \u201cadvisory.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It was not until 1980 that this Court gave Maryland trial judges a \u201clicense\u201d to depart from the language of the Maryland Constitution and the Maryland Rules and limit the advisory nature of jury instructions to instructions concerning the \u201claw of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Judge Harrell\u2019s opinion for the Court relies upon language in the <em>Dillon </em>opinion, 277 Md. at 581-582, 357 A.2d at 367, and an earlier Court of Special Appeals opinion, that the Maryland Constitution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201c \u2018does not confer upon (jurors], however, untrammeled discretion to enact new law or to repeal or ignore clearly existing law as whim, fancy, compassion or malevolence should dictate, even within the limited confines of a single criminal case.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">There is a huge difference between <em>which </em>person or entity decides what the law is and <em>how </em>that person or entity should perform the function. Today, in Maryland criminal cases where the \u201claw of the crime\u201d is not an issue, as well as in civil cases, the trial judge is the person who decides what the law is. Nevertheless, in performing this function, the trial judge is similarly not authorized \u201cto enact new law or to repeal or ignore clearly existing law as whim, fancy, compassion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>malevolence should dictate.\u201d <em>Dillon, supra, </em>277 Md. at 582-582, 357 A.2d at 367. As previously discussed, the <em>Dillon </em>opinion, filed in 1976, repeatedly emphasized that \u201c \u2018any instructions on the law which the [trial] court may give\u2019 are purely advisory and the jury must be so informed,\u201d that the judge \u201c \u2018must tell [the jurors] it [the instruction] is merely advisory and they are not bound to follow it,\u2019 \u201d that \u201c[t]hese principles, so well implanted, supplied the bases for Rule 756 b, which provides that \u2018[t]he court shall in every case in which instructions are given to the jury, instruct the jury that they are the judges of the law and that the court\u2019s instructions are advisory only,\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018the jury are left free to find their verdict in accordance with their own judgment of the law,\u2019 \u201d etc. <em>Dillon, </em>277 Md. at 580-581, 357 A.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The majority, in support of the argument that the <em>Stevenson </em>opinion was not novel and that it would have been \u201creasonable\u201d for Adams\u2019s attorney in 1979 to have \u201cobjected] at trial to the facially advisory nature of the instruction\u201d (Opinion at 280, 958 A.2d at 320), relies on the fact that the \u201cadvisory instruction\u201d required by the Maryland Constitution was \u201cthe subject of vigorous debates among notable members of the Maryland Bench and Bar for several decades prior to Adams\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 274, 958 A.2d at 319). The fact that a legal principle has been the subject of vigorous debates does not mean that the principle is tenuous, or that it is not firmly embedded in our law, or that the established principle might not be followed by a trial judge. This is particularly true when the legal principle is compelled by the unambiguous language of the Maryland Constitution. Many critics of the state constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases may have been advocating a proper nonjudicial state constitutional amendment or a judicial holding that the state constitutional provision violated the federal constitution. There is no evidence that the critics were urging the Court of Appeals to re-draft the state constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Moreover, there are numerous legal principles which have been and are presently the subject of vigorous debates, and which have been criticized by notable members of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>profession as well as other members of society. Nonetheless, few trial lawyers would undertake to persuade a trial judge to abandon such principles, at least absent some encouragement from a recent Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion. For example, few if any other legal principles have been criticized as much as this Court\u2019s continued adherence in negligence actions to the doctrine of contributory negligence and the Court\u2019s refusal to adopt comparative negligence. <em>See Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 456 A.2d 894 (1983). Furthermore, the doctrine of contributory negligence is a judge-made principle, and not one firmly embedded in the language of the Maryland Constitution. Should a \u201creasonable\u201d lawyer in a tort trial, because the doctrine is heavily criticized, object to a contributory negligence instruction and request a comparative negligence instruction? Examples of other legal principles which are heavily criticized but which are firmly established in our law include the following: the tort immunity of local governments with regard to \u201cgovernmental functions,\u201d <em>Austin v. City of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 405 A.2d 255 (1979); the parent-child. immunity rule, <em>Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 505 A.2d 826 (1986); the refusal to recognize a cause of action for \u201ceducational malpractice,\u201d <em>Doe v. Bd. of Educ., Montgomery Co., </em>295 Md. 67, 453 A.2d 814 (1982); the continued adherence to the conflict of laws <em>lex loci delicti </em>principle, <em>Hauch v. Connor, </em>295 Md. 120, 123-125, 453 A.2d 1207 (1983); the refusal to recognize so-called \u201cdram shop\u201d liability, <em>Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 438 A.2d 494 (1981); and many other legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Criticism of a legal principle does not mean that there is a likelihood that the principle will be changed. Criticism of the constitutional mandate that juries are the judges of the law in criminal cases did not mean in 1979 that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions applying the constitutional provision were about to be overruled, or that a reasonable trial attorney in 1979 should have objected to the advisory nature of the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">As earlier discussed, the only <em>pre-Stevenson </em>substantive change in the constitutional mandate that juries are the judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of the law in criminal cases was the 1950 constitutional amendment authorizing the court to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Between 1851 and 1980, there were also two procedural changes affecting the operation of the constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Following the 1950 constitutional amendment, this Court adopted a rule requiring a trial judge \u201cwhen requested in a criminal case, to give an advisory instruction on <em>every </em>essential question or point of law supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Bruce v. State, supra, </em>218 Md. at 97, 145 A.2d at 433 (emphasis added). Before the adoption of this rule, the giving of any advisory instructions had been within the trial judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">On January 1, 1950, our predecessors also adopted a rule \u201cwhich expressly provides that the court\u2019s giving of advisory instructions prior to the argument of the case shall not preclude counsel from arguing to the contrary.\u201d <em>Schanker v. State, supra, </em>208 Md. at 21-22, 116 A.2d at 367. <em>See also Wilson v. State, supra, </em>239 Md. at 256-257, 210 A.2d at 830. Prior to this rule, when the trial judge exercised discretion to give advisory instructions and gave them before the attorneys\u2019 closing arguments, there was a conflict among this Court\u2019s opinions as to whether the attorneys could argue contrary to the judge\u2019s advisory instructions. In this situation, even though the jury was entitled to disregard the advisory instructions, several cases held that counsel could not argue contrary to the instructions. <em>See, e.g., Slansky v. State, supra, </em>192 Md. at 107, 63 A.2d at 604-605 (\u201cBut even though an advisory instruction in a criminal case is not binding on the jury, yet * * * [w]hen an advisory instruction has been given, the judge may prevent counsel from arguing contrary to the instruction\u201d); <em>Vogel v. State, supra, </em>163 Md. at 272, 276, 162 A. at 707-708 (\u201c \u2018But whatever powers the Constitution may have conferred upon juries in criminal cases, it has conferred none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>upon counsel.\u2019 * * * It is consistent with the right of the jury to exercise their independent judgment as to the law, in a criminal case, that they should be informed of legal theories of the prosecution or defense which may be at variance with the court\u2019s advisory instruction. On the other hand, it seems hardly compatible with the relationship of members of the bar to the court ... to permit them to combat its formal rulings in their arguments to the jury. * * * When an advisory instruction is considered necessary by the court, but is deferred until the argument to the jury is completed, the problem of protecting the jury\u2019s prerogative ... and of insuring proper respect for the authority of the court, is greatly simplified\u201d); <em>Nolan v. State, </em>157 Md. 332, 340, 146 A. 268, 271 (1929); <em>Kelly v. State, supra, </em>151 Md. at 98-99, 133 A. at 903; <em>Bell, alias Kimball v. The State, </em>57 Md. 108, 120 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The pre-1950 cases, prohibiting a counsel\u2019s jury argument contrary to the trial judge\u2019s instructions, are significant because both the <em>Stevenson </em>majority and the majority today cite some of these cases in support of their argument that, prior to <em>Stevenson, </em>the jury\u2019s function as judge of the law in a criminal case was quite limited. For example, the <em>Stevenson </em>opinion, 289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564, stated: \u201cThus, we have held that it is not within the province of the jury to decide whether a statute has been repealed, <em>Nolan v. State, </em>157 Md. 332, 340, 146 A. 268, 271 (1929). . . .\u201d The <em>Nolan </em>opinion did not discuss or even cite the constitutional provision making juries the judges of the law in criminal cases. Instead, the portion of the <em>Nolan </em>opinion cited in <em>Stevenson </em>\u201cwas to the refusal of the court to allow counsel for the defendant to argue to the jury that section 247 of article 27 had been repealed.... \u201d <em>Nolan, </em>157 Md. at 340, 146 A. at 271. Similarly, the majority opinion today cites (opinion at 256-57, 958 A.2d at 305) the portions of <em>Vogel v. State, supra, </em>163 Md. at 272, 162 A. at 708, and <em>Bell, alias Kimball v. The State, supra, </em>57 Md. at 120, which dealt with the limitation on counsel\u2019s jury argument. Both opinions drew a sharp distinction between what counsel could argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>and the jury\u2019s prerogative to disregard the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Finally, there is strong practical evidence that, prior to <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>the jury\u2019s role in determining the law in Maryland criminal cases was very broad, and that the <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>opinions drastically changed the function of the jury in such cases. From the inception of the constitutional provision in 1851, until the <em>Montgomery </em>opinion filed 130 years later on December 4, 1981, it appears that no decision of this Court reversed a criminal conviction on the grounds that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on particular matters should not have been \u201cadvisory\u201d but should have been binding, or that the trial judge\u2019s instructions gave too large a scope to the constitutional provision making the jury the judge of the law in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On the other hand, several cases in this Court <em>reversed </em>criminal convictions because rulings in the trial courts curtailed the constitutional right of the jurors to be judges of the law in criminal cases, including the jurors\u2019 right to hear arguments on the law from counsel. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. State, supra, </em>239 Md. at 257, 210 A.2d at 830 (\u201cThus the denial of counsel\u2019s right to state the applicable law [regarding searches and seizures] to the jury was plainly prejudicial\u201d); <em>Wilkerson v. State, supra, </em>171 Md. 287, 188 A. 813 (Conviction reversed because a legal issue involving self-incrimination law was for the jury); <em>Dick v. State, supra, </em>107 Md. 11, 68 A. 286 (Conviction reversed on the ground that a statutory interpretation issue was for the jury and not the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">As previously shown, for many years jurors in criminal cases were told that all of a trial judge\u2019s instructions were advisory and that jurors could disregard them. The Rule in effect when <em>Stevenson </em>was decided, former Maryland Rule 757 b., mandated that \u201cthe court shall instruct the jury that they are the judges of the law and that the court\u2019s instructions are advisory only.\u201d Rule 757 contained no exceptions. Considering this sweeping instruction regularly given to jurors in criminal cases, if, prior to <em>Stevenson, </em>the jurors\u2019 constitutional function as judges of the law were as narrow as the <em>Stevenson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and <em>Montgomery </em>majorities claimed, it would be inconceivable that no criminal conviction, for 130 years, was reversed by this Court on the ground that the trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to a particular matter should have been binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Although the majority of this Court, from 1980 to the present, has been unwilling to acknowledge it, the truth is that <em>Stevenson </em>was a novel opinion which re-wrote what is now the first paragraph of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The <em>Stevenson </em>opinion did so in an effort to salvage an invalid state constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>opinions were intended by the Court in those cases to be fully retroactive; in addition, as a matter of settled Maryland law, <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>were fully retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">This Court, in numerous opinions, has explained when a decision shall be applied only prospectively. The first criterion for \u201cprospective only\u201d application is that the decision overrules prior law and establishes a new legal standard or principle. In <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 220, 513 A.2d 291, 293 (1986), the Court stated (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">\u201cAs both the Supreme Court and this Court have made clear, the question of whether a particular judicial decision should be applied prospectively or retroactively, depends in the first instance on whether or not the decision overrules prior law and declares a new principle of law. <em>If a decision does not declare' a new legal principle, no question of a \u2018prospective only\u2019 application arises; the decision applies retroactively in the same manner as most court decisions. United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 548-549, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 2586, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982); <em>Chevron Oil Company v. Huson, supra, </em>404 U.S. at 106, 92 S.Ct. at 355; <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>392 U.S. 481, 496, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 2233, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968); <em>Potts v.

State, supra, </em>300 Md. at 577, 479 A.2d 1335, Chief Judge Murphy pointed out for this Court that \u2018where a decision has applied settled precedent to new and different factual situations, the decision always applies retroactively.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cOur holding in the case at bar, ... is not \u2018novel\u2019 and does not overrule any earlier cases in this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The Court in <em>American Trucking Associations v. Goldstein, </em>312 Md. 583, 591, 541 A.2d 955, 958-959 (1988), further explained the initial question in determining whether a decision is to be given only prospective effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cIn the overwhelming majority of cases, a judicial decision sets forth and applies the rule of law that existed both before and after the date of the decision. In this usual situation, \u2018where a decision has applied settled precedent to new and different factual situations, the decision always applies retroactively.\u2019 <em>Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 577, 479 A.2d 1335 (1984). Thus, in the ordinary case, no issue of a \u2018prospective only\u2019 application arises. <em>See, e.g., Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>392 U.S. 481, 496, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 2233, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968); <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 220-221, 513 A.2d 291 (1986), and cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201cWhen, however, a court overrules a prior interpretation of a constitutional or statutory provision, and renders a new interpretation of the provision, the question arises as to whether the new ruling is to operate retroactively or prospectively only. Generally, in determining whether a new interpretation of a federal constitutional provision is to operate retrospectively, a court must assess the various factors set forth in <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), and its progeny. <em>See </em>the discussions in <em>Wiggins v.

Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 3-3, at 30-31 &amp; n. 26 (2d ed.1988). We have essentially followed the teaching of <em>Linkletter v. Walker, supra, </em>in deciding whether a new interpretation of a Maryland constitutional provision, statute, or rule, should receive retrospective effect. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 336-338, 403 A.2d 356, 370-371 (1979).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Commission v. Saridakis, </em>402 Md. 413, 427-428, 936 A.2d 886, 894-895 (2007) (Reiterating and applying the principles of <em>American Trucking Associations v. Goldstein, supra); Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 487-489, 869 A.2d 837, 848-851 (2005) (Summarizing both the federal law and Maryland law regarding prospective-retroactive application, and re-affirming the principles of the <em>American Trucking Associations case); Walker v.

Thus, the case is an appropriate one for considering whether such new interpretation should be given only prospective effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">It is clear that the majority of the Court in <em>Stevenson </em>and the majority of the Court in <em>Montgomery intended </em>that those two opinions be fully retroactive. This is because the majority in each case purported to believe that the two cases did not declare a new legal principle. \u201cIf a decision does not declare a new legal principle, ... the decision applies retroactively in the same manner as most court decisions.\u201d <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., supra, </em>307 Md. at 220, 513 A.2d at 293. Even though the Court\u2019s stated position in <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>was erroneous, it is noteworthy that \u00a7 7-106(c)(2)(ii) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act refers to a standard which \u201cis <em>intended </em>to be applied retrospectively____\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Regardless of the Court\u2019s intent in <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>however, our cases firmly establish that <em>Stevenson\u2019s </em>and <em>Montgomery\u2019s </em>new interpretation of the Maryland Constitution was fully retroactive. Under well-established Maryland law, a new interpretation of a constitutional provision or a statute is fully retroactive if that interpretation affects the integrity of the fact-finding process. This Court in <em>State v. Hicks, supra, </em>285 Md. at 336, 403 A.2d at 370, summarized (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cThe principles governing the retroactivity of new rulings by courts in criminal cases ... were extensively dealt with by both the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>275 Md. 689, 717, 344 A.2d 80, 95 (1975), and we shall not repeat in detail what was said in that case. Briefly, it was initially pointed out in <em>Wiggins </em>that <em>retroactivity </em>of application <em>was required where the rule involved affects the integrity of the fact-finding process, </em>or where it is a non-procedural rule that would render a trial constitutionally impermissible (e.g., a new double jeopardy ruling), or where it renders a certain type of punishment impermissible, 275 Md. at 701-707, 732-737, 344 A.2d 80. Under these criteria, it is clear that retroactivity of the new interpretation announced in the instant case is not required. It does not affect the integrity of the fact-finding process but is a sanction to compel compliance with the policy of prompt disposition of criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">A trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the controlling law, and the jury\u2019s application of the law to the facts, clearly involve the integrity of the fact-finding process. In a situation where a new ruling related to the jury\u2019s function, Judge Rodowsky for the Court in <em>State v. Colvin, supra, </em>314 Md. at 24-25, 548 A.2d at 517-518, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cIn <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), the Supreme Court held that the potential for uncertainty in a jury\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing form for capital cases specified by former Rule 772A violated the eighth amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cThe <em>Mills </em>analysis affects \u2018the very integrity of the fact-finding process\u2019 with respect to finding an absence of mitigating factors.

The majority opinion in the case at bar, for the most part, seems to agree that the waiver provisions of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, \u00a7 7-106(b) and (c) of the Criminal Procedure Article, are not directly applicable to this case. Nevertheless, the majority makes much ado over whether Adams\u2019s argument based on \u00a7 7-106(c) is, procedurally, properly before the Court (majority opinion at 260, 958 A.2d at 307-08, n. 16). The majority asserts that an argument based on \u00a7 7-106 (presumably \u00a7 7-106(b)) is properly before us whereas Adams\u2019s argument under \u00a7 7-106(c) is not.

The majority opinion in the present case takes the position that \"fundamental constitutional rights\u201d require a \"knowing and intelligent waiver\u201d by the defendant personally, whereas \"[n]on-fundamental rights\u201d do not require such a waiver. (Majority opinion at 262, 958 A.2d at 309). The majority states that an erroneous jury instruction on reasonable doubt is not a \"fundamental right\u201d and, therefore, it may be waived by a failure to object <em>(Id. </em>at 263, 958 A.2d at 309). In the middle of its discussion of this matter, however, the majority, somewhat inconsistently, quotes <em>State v. Rose, </em>345 Md. 238, 248, 691 A.2d 1314, 1319 (1997), \" \u2018that, simply because an asserted right is derived from the Constitution ... or is regarded as a \"fundamental\u201d right, does not necessarily make the \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d standard of waiver applicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 263, 958 A.22d at 309). The quotation from <em>Rose </em>correctly sets forth Maryland law. The majority\u2019s fundamental/non-fundamental dichotomy is not correct. The standard is whether \"a defendant's claim does encompass that narrow band of rights that courts have traditionally required [that] an individual knowingly and intelligently relinquish or abandon in order to waive the right or claim.\u201d <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. at 138, 691 A.2d at 1262. The inquiry is whether the right involved falls within that limited category of rights, with regard to which \"courts traditionally have required that a person intelligently and knowingly relinquish or abandon ... before he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>is deemed to have waived the right.\u201d <em>Walker v.

The majority opinion, in discussing the principle that a court in a Post Conviction Procedure Act proceeding has discretion to excuse a waiver, asserts that the court may consider the prejudice to the State in light of the delay between the accused\u2019s conviction and the filing of a post conviction action. The majority in effect says that, in a proceeding under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, laches is applicable in the exercise of discretion to excuse a waiver. For reasons hereafter set forth, there is no waiver in the present case, and, consequently, there is no waiver to excuse. Nevertheless, I do question the applicability of laches to a proceeding under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act. The General Assembly has enacted numerous exceptions and limitations to the Post Conviction Procedure Act, many of which have been enacted recently. The General Assembly has not, however, enacted a laches provision. It is a sound principle that where an enactment contains numerous exceptions or limitations, courts should not insert additional ones. See the cases cited in footnote 16, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">With respect to both the federal habeas corpus statute and many post conviction or habeas corpus statutes in other states, laches is embodied in the statutes or in applicable rules. In this regard, the Maryland statute differs from those statutes and rules. Absent a statutory or rule provision, the concept of laches is inapplicable in a post conviction proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Chessman v. Teets, </em>354 U.S. 156, 165, 77 S.Ct. 1127, 1132, 1 L.Ed.2d 1253, <em>1260 </em>(1957) \u201c[T]he overriding responsibility of this Court is to the Constitution of the United States, no matter how late it may be that a violation of the Constitution is found to exist\u201d); <em>Herman v.

The majority opinion in the present case does not discuss this portion of the <em>Colvin </em>case. Instead, the majority discusses that part of <em>Colvin </em>dealing with the trial judge's instructions that the jury is the judge of the law. The majority states that <em>Colvin </em>is \"directly on point,\u201d and quotes a selected portion of the <em>Colvin </em>opinion stating that the defendant had waived any challenge to the jury instructions concerning the advisory nature of the judge\u2019s instructions. (Majority opinion at 265, 958 A.2d at 311.) The full quotation from <em>Colvin, </em>however, shows that the jury instruction there was in accord with the <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>re-draft of the Maryland Constitutional provision. The Court stated in <em>Colvin, </em>314 Md. at 22-23, 548 A.2d at 516-517, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\"When submitting guilt or innocence to the <em>jury, the </em>trial court instructed that Art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights made the jury the judge of the law, and that as a result the court\u2019s instructions were advisory only and not binding. In conformance with <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980), however, the court went on to instruct that the juiy was to perform its role as a judge of the law only where there was a suggested conflict. Further, the court instructed that on the constitutional precepts such as burden of proof and need for unanimity, its instructions were binding and could not be disregarded. Colvin-El, citing <em>Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 403, 86 S.Ct. 518, 521, 15 L.Ed.2d 447, 450 (1966), contends that he was thereby deprived of due process because he was not tried in accordance with the law of the land and because the instruction was confusing. He also criticizes the reasonable doubt instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\"There were no exceptions taken to these instructions. On direct appeal when Colvin-El was represented by new counsel, the points were not presented. Under Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(c), part of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, failure to make the allegations is presumed to have been done intelligently and knowingly. Nothing is presented here to rebut the presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\"To the extent that Colvin-El rests his ineffectiveness of counsel argument on the absence of any exceptions to these instructions, we find neither deficient representation nor prejudice in light of the instructions, taken as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>If the jury instruction at Adams's trial had been like the jury instruction discussed above, this case would probably not be here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. The majority asserts (opinion at 260, 958 A.2d at 307-308, n. 16) that an argument under \u00a7 7-106(c) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, dealing with a new procedural or substantive standard, \"is not properly before this Court\u201d because Adams \"attempts to adopt\u201d the argument from an amicus brief, and Maryland Rule 8-503(f) \"only permits litigants to adopt the arguments of other parties to the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">This procedural argument is devoid of merit for several reasons. As previously discussed, \u00a7 7-106(b) and (c) are not directly applicable to this case. Even if \u00a7 7-106(c) were controlling, Rule 8-503(f) does not preclude the adoption of an argument from an amicus brief. The Rule simply does not address an amicus brief or whether a party may adopt an argument from an amicus brief. The majority cites no case holding that a party may not adopt an argument from an amicus brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Furthermore, \u00a7 7-106(c) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act is not a \"stand alone\u201d section of the statute dealing with a separate issue. Instead, it is an integral part of the waiver provision, delineating an exception to \u00a7 7-106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Most importantly, the majority\u2019s argument overlooks the facts that the State was the appellant in the Court of Special Appeals and is the petitioner in this Court. It was not incumbent upon Adams, as appellee and respondent, to raise any particular issues. Under Maryland Rule 8-131(b), the State\u2019s certiorari petition determines the issues in this Court. The State\u2019s petition raised the overall \"waiver\u201d question and specifically addressed \u00a7 7-106(c), arguing that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion was \"simply wrong\u201d in relying upon \u00a7 7-106(c). (Petition for certiorari at 8, 11, 13 <em>etseq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s procedural argument is inconsistent with the settled \" \u2018principle that a judgment will ordinarily be affirmed on any ground adequately shown by the record, whether or not relied on by the trial court or raised by a party,\u2019 \u201d <em>Abrams v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 146, 161 n. 19, 919 A.2d 1223, 1231 n. 19 (2007). <em>See, e.g., Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 103, 939 A.2d 689, 709 (2008); <em>YIVO Institute v. Zaleski, </em>386 Md. 654, 663, 874 A.2d 411 (2005); <em>Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E. Church, </em>375 Md. 59, 68-69, 825 A.2d 388, 393 (2003); <em>Robeson v.

While <em>Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679 (4th Cir.2000), may have played a major role in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination of a new standard, the principle applied is the same one embodied in \u00a7 7-106(c) and in opinions of this Court such as <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 362 A.2d 629 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\">. Contrary to the above quotation from <em>Stevenson, </em>neither the <em>Wheeler </em>case nor the <em>Beard </em>case held that the jury is \"limited\u201d to deciding these matters. Neither opinion used the word \"limited.\u201d <em>Wheeler </em>merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>stated that the jury is entitled to decide the \"law of the crime.\u201d The only \"exception\u201d to the jury\u2019s authority to decide the law in criminal cases, mentioned by the Court in <em>Wheeler, </em>related to the admissibility of evidence. The <em>Beard, </em>opinion, after pointing out that the jury is entitled to decide the legal effect of evidence, continued by stating that the trial judge \"can <em>only </em>bind and conclude the jury as to what evidence\u201d shall be admitted, 71 Md. at 280, 17 A. at 1045 (emphasis added). The opinions in both <em>Wheeler </em>and <em>Beard </em>took the position that the jury\u2019s right to decide the law in criminal cases was broad, with the only exception being the rulings on admissibility of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">. This Court has never explained what legal issues precisely fall within the phrases \"law of the crime\u201d and \"legal effect of the evidence.\u201d Literally, the phrases could encompass a broad range of legal issues. The <em>Stevenson </em>opinion, 289 Md. at 177-181, 423 A.2d at 563-566, largely defined its view regarding the scope of Article 23 by listing particular legal issues which fell outside of the jury\u2019s authority. <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>implied, however, that the scope of Article 23 is very narrow. Whatever the phrases \"law of the crime\u201d and \"legal effect of the evidence\u201d may encompass, I shall assume that the scope of Article 23, as a result of the <em>Stevenson </em>re-draft, is narrow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\">.

In the Constitution of 1867, however, which is still in effect, the words \"Justice\u201d and \u201cAssociate\u201d were abandoned, and the Judges of this Court were referred to simply as \u201cJudges.\u201d The only Maryland Judges who are constitutionally designated as \u201cAssociate Judges\u201d are Judges of the Circuit Courts other than the Chief Judges of each circuit. <em>See </em>Article IV, \u00a7 21(c), of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b370-5\">. <em>See Dillon v.

This statement by the majority is inaccurate. The exception recognized by these cases was the constitutionality of a statute enacted by Congress or by the Maryland General Assembly. No <em>pre-Stevenson </em>case made an exception for other types of constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\"><em>Hitchcock, </em>written by Judge (later Chief Judge) Hammond for the Court, took the position, inter alia, that the voters\u2019 ratifications of the Constitutions of 1864 and 1867, containing the same language that was construed in <em>Franklin, </em>in effect constitutionalized the dicta in <em>Franklin. </em>Judge Hammond explained (213 Md. at 283-284, 131 A.2d at 719):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_S\">\u201cThe very words that now appear, first appeared in the Constitution of 1851, and were proposed to the people and ratified by them as part of the Constitutions of 1864 and of 1867.

Cases recognizing the admissibility of evidence as the only exception include <em>Lewis v.

In a sense, the admissibility of evidence is not really an \"exception\u201d to the jury being the judge of the law.
