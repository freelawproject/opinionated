That no receipt, or copy of any receipt, for the payment of ground rent as reserved by said deed,'has at any time been recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds of Philadelphia county. That by reason of the premises the principal sum and all arrears of ground rent as aforesaid, are, in law, presumed to be paid. That by reason of tbe premises said suit could not lawfully be maintained for the collection of any arrears of ground rent, as reserved by said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-5\">\u201c 7. Your orator further avers that in the said suit of the said J. Dickinson Sergeant against Daniel McClelland, in C. P. No. 1, Sept. T., 1892, No. 512, the said plaintiff\u2019s attorney of record in said suit is Joseph M. Pile, Esq., who bought in said premises at said sheriff\u2019s sale on March 6, 1893, and the name of the said Joseph M.

Pile, at the time of said sheriff\u2019s sale, well knew that no ground rent had been paid, as aforesaid, for a period of over twenty-one years, prior to the commencement of said suit, and he participated in said fraudulent sale as aforesaid. That the said Charles H. Pile has no real or pecuniary interest in said premises, and has allowed the use of his name as said purchaser, and in the bringing of said ejectment proceedings, only for the sole use, benefit and accommodation of the said J. Dickinson Sergeant, who is the real and only party in interest therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-6\">The pikers were : (1) to declare void the judgment for arrears of ground rent; (2) to set aside the sheriff\u2019s sale ; (3) to cancel the sheriff\u2019s deed ; (4) to restrain the prosecution of the ejectment suit; (5) to restrain an3' attempt to obtain posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>sion ; (6) to restrain incumbering the premises; and (7) to restrain proceedings to collect ground rent.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AkCc\">May 21, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">Defendants demurred for the\u2019 following reasons : (1) Res adjudicata. That it appears by said bill that the premises in question were sold by legal process issued out of this court. That the sale was confirmed and deed made to the purchaser. That the plaintiff has already moved the court to set aside the sale and judgment, and the rule to show cause was, after full hearing, discharged by the court. (2) The plaintiff has shown no title. What is called a deed of May 10, 1893, in the bill, has-been neither copied nor referred to by place of record.

(1) to set aside as fraudulent and void the judgment entered by the court below, at No. 512 of September term 1892, and all proceedings thereunder, including the sheriff\u2019s'sale of the premises in question, deed to the sheriff\u2019s vendee, etc.; (2) to-perpetually enjoin the said vendee from prosecuting the action of ejectment brought to recover possession of said premises so purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale under execution on said judgment;: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and to restrain said vendee from incumbering said premises ; and (3) to perpetually enjoin the ground rent landlord from causing to be brought any proceeding at law for the collection of ground rent, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">To this sweeping bill, the defendants demurred, and assigned as causes thereof: (1) Res adjudicata ; (2) plaintiff has shown no title ; and (3) he has not shown any ground for the intervention of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">For these causes, each of which is more fully set forth in the \u2022demurrer, we think the court was clearly right in sustaining it. As to the first, it appears by the bill that the premises in question were sold on legal process based upon the judgment entered in the court below; that the sale was made, deed acknowledged \u25a0and delivered to the sheriff\u2019s vendee; that the plaintiff has heretofore invoked the equity power of the court to set aside \u2022the judgment, sale thereunder, etc., and after full hearing the rule to show cause, granted at his instance, was discharged by the court; and the decree discharging sai'd rule does not appear to have been appealed from. He has thus had his day in court on matters which constitute the gravamen of his present \u2022complaint. The matters on which the controlling averments of the bill are grounded have already been adjudicated, and he has no right to be again heard on the same subjects. The principle of res adjudicata applies with full force in all such cases: Gordinier\u2019s Ap., 89 Pa. 528 ; Frauenthal\u2019s Ap., 100 Pa. 290 ; Given\u2019s Ap., 121 Pa. 260. The doctrine of these and kindred cases .is that where a party has been heard, or has had the opportunity of being heard, in a court of law, even though his claim or defence be an equitable one, he cannot be re-heard on a bill. Neither can he thus cure a mistake in the trial of an action at law, or a neglect to appeal in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The alleged deed of May 10,1893, referred to in the bill and which appears to be the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s title, is neither copied nor referred to by place of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The ejectment now pending is an equitable action; and, if the matters set out in the bill have not already been adjudicated, they may be available as a defence in that case, so far as they are relevant and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid \u2022by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
