Stephenson, a married woman, was the owner of the land in dispute. On Sept. 17,1873, she joined her husband in executing a mortgage on the land, but her separate acknowledgment was not taken. On March 1, 1876, a sci. fa. (121 April T., 1876) was issued on the mortgage, and both Mrs. Stephenson and her husband were personally served. The return was: \u201c Served personally on the within named defendants by true and attested copy.\u201d Judgment was duly obtained and a writ of levari facias was issued. The land was sold by the sheriff to John Benninghoff, to whom a sheriff\u2019s deed was subsequently delivered. Benninghoff went into possession of the premises, from which he was ejected by Mrs. Stephenson by virtue of a writ of habere possessionem under a judgment in ejectment which she had obtained against him. Both Mrs. Stephenson and Benninghoff subsequently died. Plaintiffs were Benninghoff\u2019s heirs and defendants were Mrs. Stephenson\u2019s heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 points were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">\u201c1. That if the jury should find from the evidence that the land in dispute was the property of Mrs. Cordelia A. Stephenson and by her mortgaged to John Benninghoff, and that, after said mortgage fell due, proceedings by sci. fa. were had to foreclose the same and judgment obtained thereon, that said judgment was conclusive of the validity of the mortgage.\u201d Affirmed.

That if the jury, shall find from the evidence a judgment upon scire facias sur mortgage was obtained by John Benninghoff against John M. Stephenson and Cordelia Stephenson, and a sheriff\u2019s sale thereunder of the premises in question, and a deed duly acknowledged and delivered to the said John Benninghoff in pursuance thereof, that such sale conveyed a good title to all the defendants\u2019 interests in the land in question.\u201d Affirmed.

That the defendants are concluded, on a mortgage, on a sci. fa. sur mortgage, a sheriff\u2019s sale on a levari facias thereunder and the acknowledgment and delivery of a deed to the purchaser, from attacking the regularity of the acknowledgment on the mortgage, or the regularity of proceedings prior to the delivery of the sheriff\u2019s deed.\u201d Affirmed.

The mortgage given in evidence in this case as against Mrs. Cordelia Stephenson, a married woman, is void for want of the proper statutory acknowledgment and the judgments and execution, sheriff\u2019s sale and deed are also void, and the sheriff\u2019s vendee took no title to the property of the mortgagor as embraced and described therein.\u201d Refused. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">\u201c 2. The record of the proceedings to judgment and subsequent thereto showing no process and judgment against the alleged mortgagor as a married woman, such as she is stated to be in the mortgage, does not estop her and those claiming under her from setting up the invalidity of the acknowledgment of the mortgage, and defeats the claim of the sheriff\u2019s vendee, and the plaintiffs in this action claiming under him, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">\u201c 3. The verdict and judgment in the common pleas, No. 187, May term, 1879, was founded upon an equitable title and is conclusive of the rights of the plaintiff in said suit, the defendant in this suit, and the plaintiff here claiming under him and under the same title cannot maintain this second ejectment, and the verdict here must be for the defendants.\u201d Refused. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">\u201c 5. The service of the scire facias upon the mortgage given by the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor is not such a service as would warrant the entry of judgment in the suit, if the defendants did not appear in the same, and the judgment and subsequent proceedings thereon are void as against the alleged mortgagor, and these defendants can set these facts up in this action, and therefore they are entitled to a verdict.\u201d Refused.

There was no proper entry of judgment in this case as appears by the record in No. 121, April term, 1876, and the court had no jurisdiction over Cordelia Stephenson nor did the court exercise jurisdiction, if any it had, in the proper manner.\u201d Refused.

In the case first cited it is said : \u201c The mortgage of a married woman is invalid unless properly acknowledged. If such be the fact it may be successfully interposed against a recovery on the mortgage. If however judgment be recovered on scire facias issued on the mortgage, the judgment is conclusive that it was properly executed.\u201d The acknowledgment of a mortgage is no part of its execution, but only evidence of it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The action of the court in taking acknowledgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>sheriff\u2019s deed, followed by delivery thereof to the purchaser, had the effect of a judicial decree, curing \u201cdefects, if any, in process and execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">There is no error in the learned judge\u2019s answers to plaintiffs\u2019 first to fifth points inclusive ; nor in his answers to defendants\u2019 points recited in the sixth to tenth specifications of error, or in directing the jury to find for plaintiffs.
