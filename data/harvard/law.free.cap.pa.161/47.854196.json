J. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">\u201c Conclusions of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">\u201c 1. In construing the lease upon which the plaintiff relies as evidence of its title, the purpose of the lease must be kept in view, and no construction should be given thereto which would thwart that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">\u201c 2. The defendant\u2019s land was leased for \u2018 the purpose of drilling and operating for petroleum oil and gas.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">\u201c 3. The lessee\u2019s covenant to commence a well in thirty days and complete it in ninety days is a principal covenant, and the covenant to pay the annual rental, if there is further delay in commencing and completing the first well, is secondary and is intended as a spur to compel the performance of the principal covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">\u201c 4. To hold that the lessee can have and hold the premises for and during the term of two years and as much longer as the sixty dollars annual rental is paid thereon, is to convert the lease into a perpetual option to drill for oil and gas, when the apparent purpose of the lessor was to compel the development of his land within the period of two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-11\">\u201c 5. The words \u2018 or rental paid thereon \u2019 in the habendum clause of the lease apply to the tiiue during which the lessee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>could hold the lease (by payment of the rentals) without drilling, and that time, by the terms of the lease, is fixed at two years.^ If we ask the question, how much longer than two years shall the lessee hold the premises, we find the answer in the words \u2018 and as much longer as oil and gas is found in paying quantities.\u2019 Stated negatively the lessee shall not have and hold the premises longer than two years unless oil and gas is found within two years in paying quantities, and he cannot hold it even two years withqut operating unless \u2018 the rentals are paid thereon.\u2019 In other words, the lessee can hold the premises two years without oil and gas, if he commences a well in thirty days and finishes it in ninety days, \u2018 or the rental is paid thereon.\u2019 But if oil or gas is found within the two years, he can hold it not only for the two years but as much longer as oil or gas continue to be found or produced in paying quantities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">\u201c 6. [Neither the lessee nor his assignee, the plaintiff, having entered upon the leased premises for the purpose of drilling for oil and gas during the term of two years, which ended on July 16, 1892, the l\u00e9ase by its own terms terminated and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action. And if no exceptions are filed to this decision, as provided by the act of April 27, 1874, P. L. 109, judgment will be entered ag.ainst the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant for the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s preecipe, and costs.] \u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">Exceptions dismissed and judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-7\"><em>A.

Ridgway, 86 Pa. 529; Cromwell v. Selden, 3 N. Y. 256; Tourtellot v. Phelps, 4 Gray, 374; White v.

Such leases have been sustained by this court heretofore and are recognized as.binding on the lessor: Lewis v. Effinger, 30 Pa. 251; Effinger v. Lewis, 32 Pa. 367; Com. v.

F. McFarland </em>and <em>John B. Chapman </em>with him, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD_\">The lease in this case is not a grant of property in the oil, but merely a grant of possession for the purpose of searching for and procuring oil; and the lessee holds his right subject to the obligation to make search, and also subject to the loss of his rights by abandonment: Barnhart v. Lockwood, 152 Pa. 82; Venture Oil Co. v. Fretts, 152 Pa. 451.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">The plaintiff had no title to a leasehold estate in the land for want of entry: Sen nett v. Bucher, 3 P. &amp; W. 392. The lease is of the same character with the lease in the case of Venture Oil Company v. Fretts, 152 Pa. 451, wherein an oil lease, before entry and successful search for oil, is distinguished from a vested legal title.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AFD\">Mr. Justice McCollum,</author>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The land described in the summons was leased for \u201cthe purpose of drilling and operating for petroleum, oil and gas.\u201d The lease was for a term of two years, and it contained a provision for its continuance for a longer period on certain conditions which will be hereinafter considered. The lessor, in consideration of the right granted to the lessee, was to receive from the latter one eighth of the oil produced from the premises, and five hundred dollars per annum for each well from which gas should be obtained in paying quantities, and so long as it should be sold therefrom. The lessee was to commence a well on the premises within thirty days and to complete it within ninety days from the date of the lease, and in case of his failure to do so, he was to pay to the lessor sixty dollars per annum quarterly in advance. This sum was called a rental, but it was in the nature of a penalty for the lessee\u2019s default in the performance of his covenant to commence and continue operations in execution of the purpose expressed in the lease. It was not a sum to be paid quarterly in advance to the lessor after the develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ment of the property and while he was receiving one eighth of the oil produced therefrom, or the rent from the gas wells drilled thereon. It was manifestly intended to hasten the performance of the lessee\u2019s covenant to drill the well, and whether it is called a rental, a penalty for the lessee\u2019s default, or compensation to the lessor for the delay occasioned by it, is of no consequence. The lessor could not exact it beyond the period covered by the lessee\u2019s default, because, after the covenants of the latter in respect to the development of the property were performed, there could be no accruing rental under this provision of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The appellant company has succeeded, by assignment, to the rights and obligations of the lessee, and its contention is that it may continue the lease in full force so long as it pays or tenders to the lessor quarterly in advance the sum of fifteen dollars. In other words it claims to have the right, on payment of this comparatively insignificant rental or penalty, to postpone indefinitely all operations for the development of the property, and thus defeat the expressed purpose of the parties and render inoperative the principal covenants of its assignor. This is an extraordinary claim, and it is based on a construction which makes the lease a mere option and the so-called rental the price of it. The five words relied on to accomplish this result are found in and conclude the habendum clause of the agreement. The learned judge of the common pleas thought these words did not warrant the construction contended for; and that they were applicable only to the definite term of two years within which it was manifestly intended by the parties that the property should be developed. He therefore held that the failure of the lessee and his successor to complete a well upon the premises within that term enabled the lessor to terminate the lease on the expiration of it, and in this conclusion we concur. A provision obviously designed to hasten the development of the property should not be allowed to prevent such development, if it admits of a construction which harmonizes with the other provisions of the agreement and gives effect to the controlling intention of the parties to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The continuance of the lease beyond the definite term was contingent upon the finding of oil or gas in paying quantities, and on the payment to the lessor in such case of his share of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the oil produced, or the stipulated sum for each well from which gas was obtained and sold. The primary and essential condition to any extension of the lease after the lapse of two years from its date was the finding of oil or gas in paying quantities within that time, aud the secondary condition was that the rent reserved for the oil or gas found should be paid in conformity with the covenants in relation thereto. If we were at liberty to substitute \u201c and \u201d for \u201c or \u201d in the concluding words of the habendum clause, as we might well do if we were construing a will or statute, there would be no room nor basis for the appellant\u2019s contention, because, on such substitution, the rental mentioned therein would plainly refer to that which the lessor would be entitled to receive after the development of the property and while oil or gas was found thereon in paying quantities. But fortunately the lease as written fairly admits of a construction which gives effect to all of its provisions and to the intention of the contracting parties. This construction was adopted by the learned judge of the common pleas and it referred the rental mentioned in the habendum clause to the definite term of two years, within which it was possible for the lessee to continue the lease, without commencing operations thereunder, by paying the rental or penalty prescribed for his delay in the performance of his covenant to drill a well on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We are satisfied that the construction placed on the lease in the court below was fully warranted by its provisions and the dominating purpose of the parties to it. We therefore overrule the specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
