Ryan, Esq., it appeared that, on Nov. 4,1885, decedent executed two promissory notes under seal, one to Annie Riland and the other to Emma Dietrich. They were the daughters of a deceased sister of decedent\u2019s first wife, and had resided with him as members of his family from their childhood till their marriage. On June 2, 1888, decedent executed three other promissory notes under seal, two of them to nephews, and the other to a niece of the obligor, the three notes being delivered to one of the nephews to be delivered to the other nephew and to the niece after decedent\u2019s death; and they were so delivered. The aggregate amount of these notes was $4,000, and all were made payable after his death. Decedent was twice married, but left no issue by either wife. His will, which was probated Oct. 5, 1890, devised to his wife a house \u201c as long as she lives, or as long as she shall bear my name,\u201d etc. The balance of his estate, which was nearly the whole of it, was not disposed of. His widow refused to accept the provisions of the will. She, together with two of the collateral heirs, contested the payment of these notes out of decedent\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-13\">The auditor found : (1) That the said promissory notes were given by the decedent to evade the payment of the collateral in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>heritance tax to the state, and to deprive the widow of her just share of his estate, \u201c and that none of the obligees were parties to or participated in his illegal purposes.\u201d (2) That said notes were founded on a \u201cgood \u201d as distinguished from a \u201c valuable\u201d consideration \u2014 \u201c what the law defines as voluntary deeds.\u201d (3) That there was a delivery of the notes to the several obligees ; and further that the estate of the obligor was liable for their payment after the widow, as against whom the auditor found the notes were void, was first paid her portion of the estate. The personal estate amounted to $4,933.80 ; from this the auditor deducted the costs, $256.83, leaving a balance of $4,676.97 ; deducted widow\u2019s share of one half, leaving a balance of personal estate of $2,338.48; added real estate fund, $3,057.90, making a balance for distribution, $5,386.39; deducted notes, $4,000, leaving balance for distribution among heirs of $1,386.39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were sustained in an opinion by Pershing, P. J., who directed payment of the notes out of the personal estate in preference to the widow, and distribution of the fund raised by sale of real estate to the heirs. The sale of the real estate had been made in partition proceedings, and was subject to the widow\u2019s dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in sustaining exceptions, and in not confirming the original report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-7\"><em>F.

It is strictly debitum in presenti solvendum in futuro, and as irrevocable as any other obligation under seal, which imports a consideration: Mack\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 231. It must, it is true, be postponed in distribution to creditors, but is good as against the maker, his heirs and legatees : Candor\u2019s Appeal, 27 Pa. 119; and if made in good faith, will conclude even his widow: Ross\u2019s Appeal, 127 Id. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">But fraud will render any transaction voidable at the instance of those who have been defrauded as against those who were parties or privies; and this should be especially true when the fraud is in violation of marital rights. The husband, standing as he does in a relation of contract and confidence, is bound to the exercise of the utmost good faith. He may give away or squander his property and thus reduce himself and wife to poverty, according to the authorities; but no ease has gone so far as to sustain a voluntary obligation given and received with intent to defraud the wife\u2019s rights. That she has an interest capable of being defrauded was settled in Mack\u2019s Appeal, supra. True, until her husband\u2019s death, her interest is contingent; but a creditor has only a contingent interest in his debtor\u2019s goods, and yet he may be defrauded in respect of that interest; and why not the wife ?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">It is conceded that the donees in this case were not parties nor privies to the fraud; and consequently the widow can have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>lio claim as against them ; but she stands in a different relation to the heirs of her deceased husband. These are but volunteers and can claim no advantage from their ancestor\u2019s fraud which he could not have claimed; while the widow, occupying as she does, in contemplation of law, the position of purchaser, Reed v. Reed, 9 Watts 263, Greiner\u2019s Appeal, 103 Pa. 89, has a \u201c higher equity,\u201d which gives her a right to compensation out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It follows, therefore, that the schedule of distribution reported bj the learned auditor is correct, and that the decree of the-court below should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Decree reversed, with costs to be paid by the appellees ; and it is now adjudged and decreed that the fund be distributed in accordance with the schedule of distribution recommended by the auditor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
