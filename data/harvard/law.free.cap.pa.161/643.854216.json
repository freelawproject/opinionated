T., 1894, by plaintiffs, Jeffries Hague and Sarah Jane, his wife, from decree of C. P. Fayette Co., No. 181 in equity, on bill in equity against Torrence L. Hague et al.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Aj3\">Before Green, Williams, Mc-Collum, Dean and Fell, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ajm\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-17\">Bill in equity .to quiet title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-18\">The bill averred that Sarah Jane Hague is the daughter of James Shoaf, Sr., late of George township, Fayette county, Pennsylvania, deceased; that James Shoaf, Sr., by his last will and testament, dated June 14, 1881, which was duly proved and recorded, directed his executors therein named to deliver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to Sarah Jane Hague \u201ca deed of conveyance for thirty-three acres and one hundred and thirteen perches of land, immediately after the death of his wife, or at any time she may cease to be his widow;\u201d that the deed was dated June 15, 1881, and was in the possession of the testator from its date until his death, which occurred July 3, 1881 ; and James Shoaf, Sr., in and by this deed, granted and conveyed unto \u201c Sarah Jane Hague and her children\u201d -in fee the land in controversy, and which is particularly described therein; that, at the time the deed was executed and acknowledged, Torrence L., Mary M. and Snyder R. Hague were in esse, and that William B., Edward W., Leanna D. and Faith Hague were each born after testator\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-4\">The prayers of the bill were: (1) For a construction of said will and deed and a definition' of the rights and interests thereunder of the parties to the bill. (2) A decree quieting title in said Sarah Jane Hague, Torrence L., Mary M., and Snyder R., and declaring that the said William B., Edward W., Leanna D., and Faith have no interest in said real estate or title to the same. (3) That the said William B., Edward W., Leanna D., and Faith may by injunction be restrained from asserting am^ title to or interest in said laud. (4) Further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">The answer admitted the facts set forth in the bill and alleged that, under the will and deed of James Shoaf, Sr., Sarah Jane Hague took but a life estate in the tract of land in controversy, subject to the life estate of her mother, Malinda Shoaf, and that the fee passed to all of the defendants and any children which may hereafter be born to Sarah Jane Hague, share and share alike. Plaintiffs filed a general replication and Wm. H. Hogg, Esq., was appointed master to take testimony and report the form of a decree. The master recommended that a decree be made, \u201c that the deed and will of James Shoaf, Sr., convey a life estate in the land in controversy to Sarah Jane Hague, with remainder in fee to the children which are now or may at any future time be born of said Sarah Jane Hague, all of said estate to be subject to the estate granted by the will of the decedent to Malinda Shoaf.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\">Exceptions by plaintiffs were overruled by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was to the decree, quoting it.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>May 21, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b673-2\"><em>W. G. </em>Guiler, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT7H\">In Chew\u2019s Ap., 87 Pa. 28, it was held that where there was an immediate gift to children only those living at the testator\u2019s death would take, but where a particular estate is carved out, with a gift over to the children, the rule is otherwise. The court below, in its construction of the conve3'-ance in question, held that the case of Wolford v. Morgenthal, 91 Pa. 80, was not materially different from this. The rule which this court applied in that case does not apply here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-3\">The deed has not the slightest semblance of a testamentary instrument, neither can it be considered as a part of the will. It-is a separate, independent writing, and-must be construed by its own terms. It has all the requisites of a deed, an absolute conveyance of the land in controversy, and in order to establish the identity of the persons who are intended to be included as the grantees we have only to look to the deed itself, aided by admissions of defendants as to the names of children who were in esse at its execution and acknowledgment: 2 Bl. Com. 296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-4\">If the construction placed on this conveyance by the court below is to prevail, then there will be included as grantees persons who were not in existence at the time the deed was executed or even at the time of its delivery, to wit, at the death of the grantor. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b673-5\">Shirlock v. Shirlock, 5 Pa. 367; Miller\u2019s Admrs. v. Duncan\u2019s Exrs., 2 Pearson, 22; Hamilton v. Pitcher, 53 Mo. 334; Devlin on Deeds, \u00a7 184, note 3, rule this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b673-6\"><em>Samuel </em>Ewing, for appellee, filed no paper-book.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A4A\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Although the grantees in the deed are designated as \u201c Sarah Jane Hague and her children,\u201d which .if the children were strangers would constitute them all tenants in common, it must be admitted that the weight of authority holds the mother to be only a tenant for life. Shirlock v. Shirlock, 5 Pa. 367, which held the mother and children to be tenants in common, has never been followed, and has been several times questioned and departed from in subsequent cases, and cannot now be regarded as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In Coursey v. Davis, 46 Pa. 25, the subject was fully con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>sidered in an elaborate and exhaustive opinion by Mr. Justice Read, in which the ruling in Shirlock v. Shirlock was distinctly repudiated. The words of the grant in Coursey v. Davis were, \u201c to the said Mildred Ann Davis and her children exclusively, and their heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the premises to the said Mildred Ann Davis and to her children exclusively and their heirs and assigns,\u201d and we held that these words vested in Mildred Ann Davis a life estate only, with remainder in fee to her children as a class, so that those in being at the date of the deed, as well as those subsequently born, would be entitled to take in the distribution, on the termination of the life estate at her death. We can see no material difference between the words of the grant in that case and in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In White v. Williamson, 2 Grant\u2019s Gases, 249, we held that a deed to A \u201c for the use of the wife and children of B,\u201d conveys a life estate to the wife of B with remainder to her children; and the children take as a class, and not individually, embracing children in esse and those thereafter born. Mr. Justice Strong, in the course of'the opinion, referring to the declaration of trust, said : \u201c Under that declaration what interest did she take ? Was it a life estate, with remainder to her children, or was it a tenancy in common with them? The court below thought it was the former and so instructed the jury. We incline to concur in that opinion. Under that declaration the children take as a class, not individually. The grant is not to the children then in esse, but it embraced those after born. It was the gift of a father for the benefit of his descendants. If the time of the distribution was the date of the gift, then after-born children must have been excluded; for where a gift is to a class, the rule is, that the time of distribution defines the individuals who constitute the class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In Wolford v. Morgenthal, 91 Pa. 30, the words of the grant were, to trustees' named, \u201c in trust for the use and benefit of Margaret Morgenthal and her heirs forever, that is the children, if any, begotten by Frederick Morgenthal; and her daughter, Elizabeth Wire, is to be made equal, to be for them and their heirs forever, after the decease of Frederick Morgenthal, her present husband.\u201d Elizabeth Wire was a daughter of Margaret by a former marriage. Mr. Justice Mercur, deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ering the opinion, said : \u201c The same estate vested in Elizabeth as if she had been begotten in lawful wedlock by Frederick upon the body of Margaret. It therefore follows that the word children is not a word of limitation but a word of purchase : Melsheimer v. Gross, 8 P. F. Smith, 412. What then is the estate taken by Margaret, and by the children respectively, including Elizabeth ? The answer is, the mother took a life estate with remainder in fee to the children as a class. It was a vested remainder in fee in Elizabeth, who was living at the time of the execution of the deed, and opened to let in the after-born children as their births respectively took place.\u201d Citing many authorities. In Coursey v. Davis, supra, also, we decided that after-born children were let in until the death of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\">It will be perceived that in all the foregoing cases it was held that the mother took only an estate for life and that the children took the fee. And, in determining what children were embraced in these several grants, we held, in all, that the time of distribution was the death of the mother, and that all after-born children up to that time were entitled to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The same rule was held in Haskins v. Tate, 25 Pa. 249, where a testator devised as follows : \u201c I further will that the plantation I bought of my son Robert lying near Hills Mill shall be equally divided amongst my son Robert\u2019s children he and them enjoying the benefits of it whilst he lives.\u201d We held that children born after the death of testator, and living at the death of Robert, participated equally with those born before. Lowrie, J., said: \u201cWe think this case falls within the rule that on a limitation to a class, which may include persons not yet born, the time of the distribution defines the members that are to constitute the class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">To the same effect is Gernet v. Lynn, 81 Pa. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The foregoing authorities indicate clearly that the decree recommended by the master and adopted by the court below was entirely correct and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
