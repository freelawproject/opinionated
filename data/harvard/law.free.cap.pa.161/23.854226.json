Before Arnold, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-7\">At the trial it appeared that defendant company manufactures and purchases camphor or napthaline balls. These balls are in commercial use for the purpose of protecting clothing and furs from destruction by moths. The balls are about a half inch in diameter, and as a merchantable article should be pure white; but they easily become discolored by waiting for a market, and, when in this shop-worn condition, in order to fit them for the market, they are melted down, and either again molded in balls, or the vapor from the liquid is permitted to escape into a chilled chamber called the sublime-house where it falls on the floor in pure white flakes, all the impurities remaining in the pan, and it is then ready for the market in the form of white flakes. On Aug. 3, 1892, plaintiff and four other men were engaged in pouring camphor balls out of barrels in the customary manner. They had emptied one barrel, and had about half emptied a second barrel, when, about three minutes after the first barrel had been dumped, there was an explosion, and flames burst out of the aperture into which the contents of the second barrel were being emptied, and the plaintiff was injured by the flame. The barrels of camphor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>balls which were being emptied had been bought from another chemical company, and were in such good condition that defendants at first hesitated about melting them, but subsequently made up their minds to do so. The evidence further showed that napthaline as customarily used is absolutely nonexplosive. There was no proof as to what actually caused the explosion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit, and subsequently refused to take it off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>Frror assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-6\">No bill of exceptions was filed. All that appeared on the record was a transcript of the stenographer\u2019s notes of evidence which was filed under a standing order of court, and on which the trial judge had written, \u201c approved,\u201d followed by his signature. The record showed that all the evidence was received without objection. The record also showed the following: \u201c And now, Dec. 7, 1893, the plaintiff excepts to the refusal of the court to take off the nonsuit entered in the above case. Exception allowed. M.

That transcript has been approved by the trial judge, and filed in court in obedience to a rule of the court. Under the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 199, which provides that the transcript shall be filed and made a part of the records of the case, and \u201c shall be used by the parties to a cause in any further proceedings,\u201d a certiorari brings up the evidence on an appeal to the Supreme Court. This is all that is necessary according to the decisions in Ros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>enthal v. Ehrlicher, 154 Pa. 396; Connell v. O\u2019Neil, 154 Pa. 582, and Com. v. Arnold, recently decided. The cases cited by defendant are based on the decision in Miller v.

Oliver, 136 Pa. 156, this court decided that the filing of the notes of evidence does not bring it into the body of the record, because they were not filed in obedience to any law. The mere direction of the trial judge to have a paper filed does not make it a part of the record, unless the law declares thatit shall become so upon such filing: Finch v. Conrade\u2019s Exr., 154 Pa. 326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">Under the decision lately rendered, there should be a bill signed in this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b53-6\">Pee Cueiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Conceding as we must that, on this appeal from refusal of the court below to take off the judgment of nonsuit, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of every fact and inference of fact which might be fairly found by a jury or drawn by them from the testimony adduced to sustain his claim, we are unable to discover anything in the evidence to justify a finding that the injury complained of resulted from any negligence of the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Without reviewing the testimony relied on, it is sufficient to say that it is not such as any trial judge would be warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>in submitting to a jury on tbe controlling question of defendant\u2019s negligence as the cause of said injury; and hence there was no error in refusing to take off the nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
