It appears by the affidavit of Mr. Perot, president of the library company, to be found in the answer of the defendants, that the meeting room on the first floor is rented to the board of trade at $1,000 per annum. On this state of facts we think the board of revision was right in subjecting the building to taxation upon so much thereof as is rented and produces a revenue. The other reason assigned by the defendants, that the library company charges a price for the use of its books when they are taken out, and annual dues for its members, is not a legal reason for taxing the property: Donohugh v. The Phila. Library Co., 86 Pa. 306. But as long as any part is rented for profit, that part is subject to taxation. The case is the same as that of the Young Men\u2019s Christian Assn. v. Donohugh, 7 W. N. 208, in which it was held that such portions of a building owned and occupied by a charitable association as are occupied by lessees paying rent, are not exempt from taxation. Injunction dissolved and plaintiff\u2019s bill dismissed with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>F.
