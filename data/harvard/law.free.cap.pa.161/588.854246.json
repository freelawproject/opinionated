Before Arnold, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\">At the trial, it appeared that on Dec. 4, 1892, plaintiff was a passenger in one of the Traction Company\u2019s cars going east along Columbia avenue. As the street car was crossing American street, a car pushed by an engine of the Reading Railroad Company ran into the street car and injured plaintiff. The driver of the street car admitted that he did not stop before going upon the tracks. He described the accident as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">\u201c As I came down Columbia avenue, before I got to American street I kind of slackened up a little, and looked to my right and saw everything was clear. I looked to my left, but the cabooses on the west track hid my view, and when I got in the center of the track this engine came down without tolling of the bell, without any headlight on the back of the tender, .... but the west gate was up, and when I got in the center the east gate was down, and I was shut off completely from all possibility of escape, was cut off from any chance to get away at all.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">The Reading Railroad Company offered no testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">Binding instruction for the Traction Co. was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-8\">The Railroad Co.\u2019s points were, among others, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-9\">\u201c4. If the jury believe that the traction driver did not come to a stop before crossing the railroad, he was guilty of negligence, and your verdict can be against the Traction Company alone.\u201d Refused. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-10\">\u201c 5. If you find, from the evidence, that if the traction car-driver had performed his duty, to stop, look and listen, no accident would have occurred, and by reason of neglecting to stop, look and listen the accident did occur, that relieves the Reading Company, and your verdict must be against the Traction Company alone.\u201d Refused.

It tended to prove that both companies defendant were guilty of negligence which resulted in the injury complained of. The case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>fairly submitted to the jury with instructions which appear to be adequate and free from any error of which either defendant has any just reason to complain. A discussion of the testimony would consume time and serve no useful purpose. There is nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining either of the specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">PHILADELPHIA TRACTION CO.\u2019S APPEAL.</p>\n<author id=\"b619-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"A4h3\">May 21, 1894:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">There was sufficient evidence of negligence to carry this ease to the jury, and justify them in finding that both companies defendant were guilty of negligence that resulted in the injuries complained of by the plaintiff. There was a verdict and judgment against both, and each took a separate appeal. For reasons briefly stated in the appeal of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, No. 229 Jan. T., 1894, we think there is nothing in the record that would warrant a reversal of the judgment. The case involved questions of fact which were exclusively for the consideration of the jury, and it was fairly submitted to them with instructions in which we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
