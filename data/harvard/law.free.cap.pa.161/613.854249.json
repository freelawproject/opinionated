That on or prior to May 1, 1878, Frederick Jarecki was the owner of letters patent of the United States, and of the inventions covered thereby, to wit, letters patent No. 181,349, dated August 22, 1876, and reissue thereof No. 7440, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>December 19,1876, for \u2018improvements in cases of shut-off rods and stopcocks for gas and water pipes,\u2019 which are in evidence marked exhibit C, and letters patent No. 190,868, for \u2018 improvements in cut-off for gas and water pipes,\u2019 exhibit D, and that an application for letters patent was pending and afterward granted August 20, 1878, No. 207,185, for \u2018 improvements in hydrants,\u2019 exhibit E.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">\u201c 2. That on May 1,1878, a contract or agreement was made between Frederick Jarecki, of the one part, and John W. Hays, Wm. B. Hays and Stephen J. Law, of the other part, whereby Frederick Jarecki, in consideration of the sum of one dollar and the reservation of certain royalties, granted and sold unto the firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co. and unto the heirs and assigns of each of the members composing said firm, an equal one fourth interest, the sole and exclusive right to manufacture, use and vend as well the said patented articles as the said articles for which applications for patents were pending, and <em>any </em>extension and reissue of same, and any improvements upon said articles which might be made by Frederick Jarecki during the existence of the firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">\u201c 3.

That on or about June 8, 1885, the firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co. was dissolved by the retiring therefrom of Stephen J. Law; John W. Hays and Wm. B.

That on June 8,1885, Frederick Jarecki, John W. Hays and Wm. B. Hays entered into a copartnership by the name of the Jarecki-Hays Co., which was to continue until the 31st day of December, 1886, and so much longer as all the partners should be agreed; the capital stock was the property, estate and effects of the then late firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co., and was subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>to the debts of said firm. Of such capital stock Frederick Jarecki was the owner of an undivided one fo.urth, and John W. -Hays and Wm. B.

That by the terms of the contract of May 1, 1878, the royalties were due and payable on the first day of each month on all articles made, sold and paid for during the preceding month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-13\">\u201c 15. That there was no contract made between Frederick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Jarecki and the Hays Mfg. Co., concerning any royalties upon any of these patented articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-5\">\u201c The master finds as matter of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-6\">\u201c1. [That the contract of May 1, 1878, is an absolute assignment] [5] by Frederick Jarecki of three fourths of all his interest in the described inventions covered by letters patent and application then pending, specified in the said contract, in equal undivided one fourth interest to John W. Haj^s, Wm. JB. Hays and Stephen J. Law, the heirs and assigns of each of them \u2014 the consideration therefor being the sum of one dollar and the payment of certain royalties upon the articles made and sold and for which pay was collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-7\">\u201c The instrument conveyed to these parties an undivided portion of the entire interest in the patented invention and the monopoly as to every part of the United States; it placed the alienees upon an equality .with the alienor and vested in them complete but not exclusive rights and powers as to the invention and monopoly; it is therefore an assignment: Robinson on Patents, vol. 2, page 517 et seq.; Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wal. 205. The consideration for the assignment of a patent may be in the form of periodic royalties to be paid by the assignee : Littlefield v. Perry, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-8\">\u201c The construction of this part of the contract is a comparatively simple matter; the intention of the parties being manifested by the insertion of the words \u2018 and unto the heirs and .assigns of each of the parties composing said firm in equal \u25a0undivided one fourth interest.\u2019 Of course that part of the \u2022contract by which Frederick Jarecki conveys to himself an undivided one fourth interest is surplusage. It is in the matter of the contractual obligation to pay royalties that difficulty is first \u25a0experienced. The contract says: \u2018The firm of Jarecki, Hays \u25a0&amp; Co., their executors, administrators and assigns, shall pay unto Frederick Jarecki, his legal representatives,\u2019 etc. There ds no express individual liability to account for royalties. The \u00a1firm could not have executors or administrators; it might have \u25a0assigns. The expression is ambiguous, but it must be construed Ly the preceding context, the grant to \u2018 the firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co., and unto the heirs and assigns of each of the members composing said firm; \u2019 and it will be seen that the (firm name is used for the individual names collectively and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>expression is perfect, \u2018 the firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co.,\u2019 that is \u2018 Frederick Jarecki, John W. Hays, Wm. B. Hays and Stephen J. Law, their executors, administrators and assigns shall pay,\u2019 etc. The plural pronoun aids this construction also. This is the legal as well as the equitable rule, to so construe the contract, one part by the other, that the meaning which the parties intended shall be carried into effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">\u201cEquity will put this construction upon it too, because otherwise Frederick Jarecki will be without a remedy either in law or in equity, for I cannot agree with the learned counsel for the respondents that Frederick Jarecki has a complete and adequate remedy at law. It is entirely clear that the respondents are in no sense of the word infringers, and without a discovery on their part [the complainant could not maintain an action at law to recover these rojalties.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">\u201c [Having thus reasoned that the liability to pa; these royalties is an individual liability, resultant from the individual conveyance, it follows that the obligation to \u2018keep accurate accounts of the number of articles made and sold,\u2019 etc., is also a personal and individual obligation.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-7\">\u201c The loose and apparently careless manner in which this contract is drawn may be accounted for by the fact that the parties to it are all men of the highest personal character and integrity; enjoying in its fullest degree the implicit confidence of each other, understanding at the time the exact obligations they were assuming, they observed not the strict attention to detail they would have in the case of a stranger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-8\">\u201c The respondents set up as part of their defence that the patent under which these eases are made is invalid and attempted to support it with evidence. The position, however, is untenable; all the authorities are unequivocally to the effect that until a patent is annulled or adjudged invalid, a licensee receiving its benefits must pay the license fees: White v. Lee, 14 Fed. R. 789; Hilsen v. Libby, 44 (S. C.) N. Y. 12; Marat\u00f3n v. Swett, 82 N. Y. 526; Angier v. Eaton, Cole &amp; Burnham Co., 98 Pa. 594.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-9\">\u201c Until the United States courts have declared the patent invalid, evidence of its invalidity is not admissible in an action for the price : Elmer v. Pennel, 40 Me. 430. And even though the patent be invalid, royalties on sales are due and collectible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>since benefit has accrued to the licensee: White v. Lee; Mars-ten v. Sweet, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\">\u201c Had this position been sound, the evidence offered to support it was clearly incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">\u201c They also set up that Frederick Jarecki, after withdrawing from the firm of Jarecki-Hays Co., licensed the Jarecki Manufacturing Co., a rival concern in the city of Erie, to make these cases under his patent, and assisted in making and selling them, thereby violating the contract on his part and releasing them from liability for royalties ; that he served notice on them to cease the manufacture and sale of this article, as the Jarecki Manufacturing Co. was sole licensee under his patent; that other concerns in the United States were making them; that thej' asked the complainant to protect them, and when he declined they made them under a public right, as other concerns were doing. The notice from Mr. Jarecki to the Hays Mfg. Co. above referred to, proved on exhibition to be a letter from his counsel notifying the Hays Mfg. Co. to cease the manufacture and sale of another article, made under letters patent granted to Frederick Jarecki, dated March 29, 1881, and not under any one of the patents described in the contract of May 1, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-7\">\u201c The respondents have failed to establish the invalidity of the patent and the rights of the public in the invention \u2014 but under date of Jan. 6,1887, they advertised themselves as \u2018successors to Jarecki-Hays Co., manufacturing as specialties,\u2019 \u2018 Jarecki\u2019s patent extension shut-off box for gas and water,\u2019 which is the article described in letters patent, exhibit C, and other articles patented by Jarecki.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">\u201c It is not clear when they claim to have begun the manufacture of this article under claim of public right. They deny that they have made any under the contract of May 1, 1878, since Mr. Jarecki Avithdrew from the firm. Mr. John Hays testified: \u2018I have spoken to Mr. Jarecki to have him protect us, and he declined to do it, so we continued to do it right along as public property.\u2019 This testimony has much the appearance of a recognition of the existence of the contract, else Avhy if it was no longer in force should the respondents ask the complainant to protect them ? It strengthens the reasoning as to the individual liability to account for and pay the said royalties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201c There remains, then, of the defence to be considered, only the alleged violation of the contract on the part of Jareeki in licensing the Jareeki Manufacturing Co. to make and sell this article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\">\u201c The maxim that \u2018 he who seeks equity must do equity \u2019 is invoked by the respondents, but it cannot go to the length they ask. There may be a question whether or not the exclusive rights granted by Jareeki were to continue longer than during the existence of the firm of Jareeki, Says &amp; Co.; but, waiving that question, this act of Jarecki\u2019s, if it be a violation of the contract, will not enure solely to the benefit of the respondents and permit or enable them to enjoy the fruits of the complainants invention without accounting for the royalties. Unquestionably this act, if it were a violation of the contract, would justify the respondents in treating it as at an end; it would relieve them of their implied contract to prosecute the manufacture and sale of the articles, or, as it is called, \u2018practice the invention; \u2019 but it will not relieve them from the payment of royalties, if they continue the manufacture and sale of the articles : Oil Well Packer Co.\u2019s Appeal, 128 Pa. 421; Marston v. Swett, supra; Jackson v. Allen, 120 Mass. 64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">\u201c There remains, however, another equitable principle in this case, which was not raised by counsel, but which the master believes should be considered. Of the original royalties reserved by and payable to Frederick Jareeki, his interest in the copartnership was charged with and paid one quarter; his interest in the Jareeki-Hays Co. being one fourth, still paid one quarter of the royalties \u2014 now it seems but equitable that the respondents should pay no more after the withdrawal of Mr. Jareeki than they did while he was a copartner with them, which was three fourths of the royalties reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">\u201c The master having found as a matter of fact that the respondents have net since Jan. 1, 1887, manufactured and sold any articles charged with a royalty payable to the complainant, except the service boxes or cases made under letters patent, exhibit C, upon which the royalty is two and one half cents each for all manufactured, sold and for which pay was collected; the accounting therefore is for them at the rate of one and seven eighths cents each upon the number admitted by the respondents to have been made, sold and paid for since Jan. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>1877, and to Sept. 30, 1893, which is 55,495, and 1500 for which pay has not yet been collected. As the respondents failed to show during which months the 1500 unpaid for were made, and as it was incumbent upon them to do so, the master has deducted from those last made and sold the number for which pay has not yet been collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">\u201cThere has been no discussion of the contract of June 8, 1885; it is proper therefore to remark that, aside from the specific reduction of the royalty upon the article known as \u2018 service box,\u2019 which is made under letters patent, exhibit C, it has no effect upon the contract of May 1, 1878, except that by inference it recognized it as being in full force and effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">\u201c The master finds also, as a matter of law, that the periodic royalties being due and payable on the first day of each month, the amounts so due are entitled to draw interest from their dates. For the purpose of having even months in the computation of time to facilitate the calculation of interest, the first of February, 1893, is selected as the date to which interest shall be computed, it being the nearest date to the expected and intended filing of this report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">\u201c Computing the royalties at the rate of three fourths of two and one half cents, which is one and seven eighths cents each upon the articles manufactured and sold and for which pay has been collected from the 1st of January, 1887, to the 30th of September, 1892, and the interest on the sums due on the first day of each month to the 1st of February, 1893, the master states the account between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\">\u201c In conclusion the master respectfully recommends to the court the following decree: \u2018That the respondents, John W. Hays and William B. Hays, account to the complainant, Frederick Jarecki, for all articles manufactured by them under letters patent described in the contract of May 1, 1878, for which pay has been received, and that they pay over to him the sum of 11,256.20, with interest thereon from the first day of February, 1893, and that the respondents pay the costs of this suit.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-8\">The contract referred to in the bill was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-9\">\u201c Articles of agreement made and concluded the first day of May, A.

His entire report is a compact, forcible and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>convincing presentation and treatment of the various matters of contention, and any opinion we might write would be a mere repetition of his findings and his reasoning. Upon the question of the individual operation of both of the contracts of 1878 and 1885 we think there can be no doubt. The parties are named as individuals, they sign as individuals, the heirs and assigns of each of the individual members of the firm are designated as successors to the rights of each of them, the interests of each member of the firm are precisely and individually stated, and while the firm name is occasionally used in its collective sense, the immediate context clearly shows that it was only as a convenient mode of expression. Thus when it is said, \u201c That the firm of Jarecki, Hays &amp; Co., their executors, administrators and assigns, shall pay unto the said Frederick Jarecki,\u201d etc., it is inevitable that the representatives of each individual were intended to be obligated, because a firm, as such, cannot have any such representatives. The continuance by the present defendants in the manufacture and sale of the patented articles is a sufficient reason for their liability to account, whether the patent was invalid or not, and whether the plaintiff had granted the same privilege to another company or not. The reasoning of the master on this subject and the authorities he cites are conclusive. We are clearly of opinion that the decree of the learned court below should be affirmed upon the findings and conclusions so well and lucidly expressed in the report of the master, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
