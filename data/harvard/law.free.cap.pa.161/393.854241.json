Martin </em>with him, for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARv\">cited, among others, the cases cited in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ADok\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The single question presented by this record is whether or not an executor is a \u201cdisinterested\u201d witness within the meaning of the act of April 26, 1855, relating to the execution of wills containing bequests to charity. Competency was made by the terms of that act to depend upon the fact that the required witnesses were \u201c disinterested \u201d at the time of attestation ; but it furnished no test as to what should constitute interest, and therefore left it to the definition of existing law. \u201c The true test of the interest of a witness,\u201d says Greenleaf, vol. 1, sec. 390, \u201c is that he will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment, or that the record will be legal evidence for or against him in some other action. It must be a present, certain and vested interest, and not an interest uncertain, remote or contingent.\u201d Substantially the same definition was given by this court, in Combs\u2019s Appeal, 105 Pa. 155, as a test of competency of witnesses in the construction of this very act. \u201c By all authority,\u201d said Mr. Justice Trunkey, \u201c a witness is not incompetent, on the score of interest, unless he has a certain, not a possible, benefit in the event of the suit, or in the matter in controversy; and an agent, servant or employee is a competent witness for, as well as against, his employer. Within the meaning of the statute, a disinterested witness is one who has no legal interest;\u201d and it was accordingly held that an employee of the corporation, which was the sole object of testator\u2019s bounty, was competent. Tested by this rule, the executor in the present case was cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tainly a \u201c disinterested \u201d witness. He could have no possible interest in the event of the bequest to charity. It was immaterial to him whether it should be sustained or fail, for he could neither gain nor lose. \u201c Granting that the office of executor is a beneficial one, he was not executor though nominated; for no one living has an executor. But he might eventually become one ? True, but he might not. He might die in the lifetime of the testator, or his nomination might be revoked, or he might not find it convenient to accept: \u201d Snyder v. Bull, 17 Pa. 54. When the attestation takes place, it is altogether uncertain and contingent whether he will ever be called upon to perform the duties of executor. But, even in the event of his assumption of the duties, he can receive no more than compensation for the services which he may have rendered; and there is no pretence in the present case that this compensation will be to any extent affected by the result of the charitable bequest. He could have had no conceivable motive in unduly influencing the action of the testator nor interest in the subject-matter of future controversy; and had, therefore, no \u201clegal interest\u201d which could have disqualified him as an attesting witness. Prior to the passage of the act of 1855 his competency as a witness to the execution of wills was the rule in this state: Snyder v. Bull, 17 Pa. 54; Loomis v. Kellogg, Id. 60; and that act, as already seen, made no change in the test: Combs\u2019s Ap., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\">It is therefore clear, both upon reason and authority, that the executpr is a \u201c disinterested \u201d witness within the meaning of the act of 1855, and the decree of the court below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
