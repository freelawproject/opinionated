Ten other notes of like amount, each one falling due one month later than the preceding note, and the twelfth falling due twelve months after date for $3,400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">The agreement further witnessed that: \u201c For and in consideration of Joseph Koenigsberg\u2019s releasing all right of lien upon the building and the machinery so to be erected, under the said contract with the Philadelphia Packing and Provision Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ny, we, the undersigned, directors and stockholders of the said Philadelphia Packing and Provision Company, do each of us severally guarantee a ratable part of the payment of the above-recited notes upon the dates upon which the same shall respectively become due; that is to -say, we do hereby severally covenant to protect and keep harmless the said Joseph Koenigsberg from the nonpayment of the said notes upon the times- and dates above specified; Provided, and it is hereby expressly understood, that each of us shall only be bound for the payment of a pro rata part of such of the said notes as remain unpaid by the said Philadelphia Packing and Provision Company. And it is further understood and agreed that no extension of' the said notes shall in any way affect or release the liability under this guarantee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">The original agreement, recited in the guaranty agreement,, provided that the first note for $1,600 was to be payable one month after date, and the second for $1,600 two months after date. One note for $3,200, falling due two months after date,, was taken, instead of two notes, each for $1,600, one falling at one month and the other at two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">The suit was upon this $3,200 note, and upon two other-notes, each for $1,600, one at three and the other at four months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">The affidavit of defence set up that plaintiff continued as a director of the company until Jan. 20, 1893, owning one tenth of the shares of its capital <em>stock; </em>that plaintiff was continuously a director up to the time of suit, and had also been continuously an owner of a large quantity of the company\u2019s-capital stock; that when the guaranty agreement was entered into it was believed by defendant that the company was indebted to plaintiff in $21,000, for which the latter had a right to file a lien against the company\u2019s property.. The affidavit denied any request or knowledge on part of defendant of the fact of delivery of one note at two months in place of two notes, one at one, and the other at two months. It denied any request, subsequent to the agreement by defendant to plaintiff, to release his lien. It claimed that defendant was never notified in any way, after signing of the guaranty agreement, that the latter had signed it, or had accepted it, or had released his lien. It denied all knowledge of any such acceptance or sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sequent release of lien. It denied, the averment in plaintiff\u2019s statement of a request to release.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">In a supplement to the affidavit it was set out that, after his execution of his guaranty agreement, defendant had learned that prior thereto there had been a release of lien executed and delivered by plaintiff, of which fact he was ignorant at the time of such execution. It was claimed further that by the original agreement, of whose terms he was ignorant, between plaintiff and the company, it was provided that defendant should \u201c Preserve the premises aforesaid free and clear of and from all liens and incumbrances arising out of claims for work done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-7\"><em>John G.

The consideration for the contract of guaranty was the releasing by the plaintiff of all right of lien upon the building and machinery of the Packing and Provision Company. At the very moment therefore when the defendant signed the guaranty he had received the consideration for which he gave the guaranty. We cannot see why he should not perform his contract. There was no occasion for any notice of acceptance. The circumstance that one note for \u00a73,200 at two months was given in the place of two notes for \u00a71,600 each, one at one month and the other at two months, is of no importance. The liability was precisely the same in amount, and an advantage of a month in the time of payment of one of the notes given by the Packing' and Provision Company was no disadvantage to the defendant as guarantor. The contract of guaranty distinctly provided that no extension of the notes should in any way affect or release the liability of the guarantors. The enlargement of the time of payment of one of the \u00a71,600 notes for one month was nothing more than an extension of that note.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
