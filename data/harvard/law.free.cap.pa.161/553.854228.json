Upon appeal to the court of common pleas, plaintiff filed a statement claiming three hundred dollars damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-9\">At the trial, before Clayton, P. J., it appeared that, on March 1,1872, Price I. Patton bought a tract of land at Fern-wood, in Delaware county. He cut and laid streets through it, divided it into building lots, planted trees in front of the different lots along the curb line, and made a plan of the ground showing the lots and streets, and had it recorded in the office for recording deeds in Delaware county. Plaintiff purchased one of the lots, in front of which on the curb line were two large trees. Defendant owned and lived on a lot adjoining plaintiff\u2019s property, and had charge of the work for a neighboring cemetery company. The two trees of plaintiff and one of defendant obstructed the view from his work to his house. The evidence tended to show that while the trees were in full foliage, defendant, without the permission or knowledge of plaintiff, and while he was away from home, trimmed these trees and one of his own, which obstructed his view, so closely that they soon afterward died. A- witness for defendant, John Brown, testified that defendant asked him to so trim the trees as to kill them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Defendant claimed that the Fern wood Land Association had title to the streets, and that he had been authorized by W. J. Kelly, the representative of the land company, to trim the trees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s wife was asked: \u201c Q. What loss are those trees to your property ? \u201d Objected to. By the Court: I suppose she is competent to show what damage the property has suffered; you can examine her as to her means of knowledge. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">The witness testified: \u201c I should suppose about $300.\u201d Cross-examination: \u201cI claim it will be that much damage to our property on account of the shade if nothing else. They shaded the yard nicely.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The witness was cross-examined as to her sources of information, but no motion was made to strike out her testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-8\">\u201c Defendant asked permission from the man he supposed had authority, and, not being objected to by the owner, we may take it for granted that he thought he had the right to trim the trees. Now the great question after all is did he kill the trees by his careless and unskillful trimming? That is the great question in the case. If he did, he must pay for them. If he did not, then I say you may excuse the trespass of cutting the trees without the owner\u2019s consent; if it was done innocently and with good faith, jmu may excuse him. But only because the owner did not protest. If the owner had protested, I am inclined to think the plaintiff would be entitled to recover for cutting his trees, whether he did good or harm \u2014 a man must be his own judge how he shall trim his own trees \u2014 but not having protested and it seeming to have been the general opinion of the community that this land company had some authority over these trees and over this street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-9\">\u201c The main question in the case is, did he undertake to do what he had not skill enough to perform ? If he did, he is liable for the consequences. That will be the first question. The next question is, did he wantonly trim those trees? Was his object to kill them ? If it was, it will make a very great difference in the damages. In the first instance they must be compensatory. In the second instance they may be measured by the highest rule, wherever there is wanton trespass and wanton and malicious injury. By the words wanton and malicious, I mean intentional. Did he intend to trim these trees in such a man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ner that by the act the trees should die ? If he did, then he should be made to pay the highest damages, not the lowest, \u2014 the highest compensatory damages measured by the severest rule. If you find that his intention was proper, that he acted under supposed authority, and, the plaintiff not having protested, he was led to believe he had a right to trim the trees and did it according to his best judgment, with no intention to injure these or their owner, then the damages should be measured by another rule; that is to say, how much will it cost to repair the damage and what will pay for the time the plaintiff has been deprived of the shade of his trees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">\u201cNow gentlemen you understand the two points in the case. You need not worry yourselves about the property or whether the plaintiff owns to the middle of the street or whether he owns up to the line of the street. I charge you under all the evidence he had property enough in these trees to entitle him to damage for their wanton or careless destruction. That covers the whole question. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\">\u201c If you should come to the conclusion that the trees were destroyed b} the defendant\u2019s unskillful trimming without the intention to kill them or to injure them, then the damages will merely be compensatory \u2014 reasonable\u2014what will make the plaintiff reasonably whole; [some of the witnesses say $5.00 or $6.00 a tree to replace them. Others say $50.00 a tree, and it would be years before the shade would be as good as before.] [6] .... [If you come to the conclusion that there was an intention to injure these trees, and that it was done without due regard to care or to the consequences that might follow, and that the intention of the defendant was to destroy these trees, then you should give the plaintiff the fullest damages, the fullest damages the testimony would warrant you in giving, because that was a willful wrong. The other would be a mere accidental wrong,' and there is a great difference when you come to the measure of damages between a willful and accidental wrong.] \u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-7\">Defendant\u2019s points were, among others, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-8\">\u201c 2. The property lines of the plaintiff only calling for the side of Williams street and the grant only giving to him the use of the said Williams street as a free passageway and watercourse, the original grantors could exercise control over it until accepted by the public authorities as a public highway, and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the defendant obtained their permission to trim the trees, he would not be responsible to the plaintiff in damages. <em>Answer: </em>That is affirmed, gentlemen, unless you find the work was negligently and carelessly done, or unless you should find wanton injury. If you find either of these it is negatived.\u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">\u201c 3. If the jury find that Williams street has never been accepted by the public authorities as a public highway, that it is a street laid out upon a town plot and that the original <em>owners </em>of the property have continued to exercise a supervision and control over the streets, and that Mr. Kelly, the superintendent, gave to Henderson permission to trim the trees, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. <em>Answer: </em>I cannot affirm that point because the question is not so much one of authority as one of negligence. It could be affirmed, as I stated in my answer to the other points, if the work was done in a careful, skillful manner without intention to do wrong, then the point would be affirmed ; but if the work were unskillfully done and the trees injured because of carelessness or want of skill by the party who voluntarily undertook to do it, then the plaintiff can recover. I stated to you, in the judgment of the court, the plaintiff here has enough property in the trees to entitle him to damages if' they were wantonly injured or unskillfully destroyed without his consent.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">\u201c4. If the jury find that by common consent in the neighborhood the original owners of the property have been looked to and called upon to keep the streets in condition, and the. defendant, acting upon this, procured from the superintendent permission to trim the trees, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. <em>Answer : </em>I must give to that the same answer I did to the other, I must qualify it if you find the trees were not skillfully trimmed, that they were injured because of the careless or unskillful trimming by the defendant, then he can recover, although he supposed he had a right to trim them.\u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">\u201c 7. If the jury find that the defendant unlawfully trimmed the trees, and that in consequence of such trimming they died, the measure of damages would be the cost of replacing them. <em>Answer: </em>That is affirmed, unless you find there was an intention at the time to destroy the trees.\u201d [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-9\">Verdict for $150. Plaintiff remitted $50.00, and judgment was entered for $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-6) instructions ; (7) ruling on evidence, quoting bill of exceptions, evidence and instructions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-4\"><em>V.

Mullison, 34 Pa. 54; Good v. Mylin, 8 Pa. 51; Forsyth v. Wells, 41 Pa. 294. The testimony in the case showed an ownership to the side of the street, and the trees, instead of being on the property, as set forth in the statement of claim, were in the street and outside of plaintiff\u2019s property lines as set forth in his statement.

Alden, 61 Pa. 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-7\">The wife knew better than any one else the amount of damages which should be allowed for the diminished enjoyment of the property, and she stated the reason. Plaintiff, without objection, testified to the same amount of damages.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AY-P\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The learned judge put before the jury very clearly three views of the case for their consideration. First, that if the defendant trimmed the trees with the permission of the person who he thought had authority, and the plaintiff saw him doing it and made no objection, the jury might find in defendant\u2019s favor, unless he killed the trees by carelessness and want of skill. Defendant certainly has no right to complain of this, it was more favorable to him than he was entitled to ask. If Kelly had in fact no authority, permission from him did not excuse the trespass, no matter what defendant thought. Secondly, if the defendant by careless and unskillful trimming killed the trees, he was responsible for such sum as would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>make compensation ; and, thirdly, if however he willfully and intentionally killed them, then the jury mig'ht give the fullest damages warranted by the evidence, \u201c the highest compensatory damages, measured by the severest rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The law as thus laid down is not only correct but substantially unchallenged. The general rule is compensation, but exemplary or vindictive damages may be given for wanton and intentional violation of rights, or circumstances of aggravation or outrage: McCarthy v. De Armit, 99 Pa. 63; R. R. Co. v. Rosenzweig, 113 Pa. 519, 544; R. R. Co. v. Lyon, 123 Pa. 140. The assignments of error do not realty question the correctness of the charge as matter of law, but only its applicability to the evidence in the case. But of this there cannot be any doubt. Even on the defendant\u2019s theory that he was authorized by Kelly as representative of the Fernwood Land Association he was nevertheless liable for any injury resulting from his negligent performance of a self-imposed task. One who undertakes any work impliedly assumes that he will do it with ordinary-skill and care, and becomes liable to make compensation for not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The third view put by thedearned judge to the jury, is however the pinch of the case. Appellant\u2019s counsel has argued with great earnestness that the evidence did not warrant the submission to the jury of the question of exemplary damages. A detailed review would not be profitable. The evidence tended to show that the trees were trimmed very severely, and at an improper season, and that of all those trimmed, only those died that were in the way of defendant\u2019s view, and which he may therefore have had a motive in killing. It may be conceded that these facts, although perhaps suspicious, would not of themselves make out a case of wanton or willful destruction, but when they were followed by the testimony of Brown that defendant asked him to so trim the trees as to kill them, all the preceding evidence became susceptible of a different construction, and we cannot say that the jury might not properly view defendant\u2019s acts as willful and their consequence as intended. Certainly the learned judge was justified in submitting that matter to them. If any injustice has been done to defendant it was by the jury, not by the court, and is not for us to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The learned judge also instructed the jury that the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s title was immaterial, as it was sufficient to maintain the action. We find nothing on the record to show that this was error. Plaintiff bought his land by metes and bounds referable to a town plot calling for a street. Prima facie his title extended to the middle of the street, and there is nothing in the very meager evidence before us to show that as against his grantors he did not have such an interest in the soil on which the trees stood as would sustain his action, even though the borough authorities never accepted the streets on the town plot as public highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We do not find any misstatement of the evidence in the sixth assignment. The learned judge stated the extremes of the cost of replacing the trees as testified to by the witnesses, the highest and the lowest.- Whether the witness who gave the highest estimate was to be relied on or not was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The objection to the receipt of the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s wife as to the extent of the damage was very general, and when the learned judge suggested that she could be cross-examined as to her means of knowledge, the suggestion- appears to have been accepted, and no motion was afterwards made to strike out her testimony. As the plaintiff himself had been allowed to estimate the damage at the same sum, the error even if clearer than it is, would not be sufficient to justify a reversal, in a case where the verdict shows that the jury were not governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Judgment- affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
