McMichael, Henry S. Sullivan, Sallie S. Hess, and himself, being children of John Sullivan, deceased, under whose will the grantors claimed title. It appeared that John Sullivan had also another son John Russell Sullivan, and seven minor grandchildren who were children of three of the grantors in the deed. Defendant claimed that the deed was insufficient, as title remained in John Russell Sullivan and the grandchildren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-11\">The will of John Sullivan was as follows, the portions in brackets being the printed form used by testator:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-12\">\u201c [Be it remembered, that I, John Sullivan, being of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding, and considering the uncertainty of life, do therefore make, publish and declare this to be my last Will and Testament, in manner and form following, that is to say:]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201c [Item :] When it is the Almighties will to take me to himself I wish my estate to be divided amongst my children as follows, my daughter Mary to have the house 88 East 65th street New York if herself and family wish to come and live in this City then the house in New York is to be sold and the twenty thousand Dollars advanced by me is to be put in a house here for her in addition to above she is to receive five thousand dollars per year from first Mortgage R.

The premises described form part of the residuary estate devised to testator\u2019s children, whereas John Russell Sullivan and children do not join in the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-15\">Where the language of a will is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction: Geisinger\u2019s Ap., 1 Mona. 600; Still v. Spear, 45 Pa. 168. Words can never be supplied to create an intent: 1 Jarman on Wills, p. 486; Varner\u2019s Ap., 87 Pa. 422.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>A testamentary clause disposing of \u201c all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate \u201d will, in the absence of an apparent contrary intent, pass residuary realty as well as personalty: Hackett v. Com., 102 Pa. 505.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-4\">The fact that testator has, prior to the residuary clause, assigned John\u2019s disobedience to his wishes as a reason for depriving him of an interest in the profit or principal of his estate, does not control an interpretation of the residuary clause, the last declaration of his wishes: 1 Jarman on Wills, p. 484; Cole v. Wade, 16 Ves. 27; Sheetz\u2019s Ap., 82 Pa. 213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">The subject-matter of the disinheriting clause cannot be the residuary estate: (1) Because it is the last disposition coptained in a series of legacies, and (2) because a proper residuary clause immediately follows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\">It is against the inclination of the courts to reject any part of a will as repugnant, if any fair and reasonable construction can be given to the whole will which will render every part effective : Finney\u2019s Ap., 113 Pa. 11; McDevitt\u2019s Ap., 113 Pa. 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\">The rule in Pennsylvania is that a devise to a man and his children without any additional words must be regarded in the same manner as though made to any other class or number of persons ; the devisees are tenants in common : Mitchell v. McConahey, 34 Leg. Int. 48 ; Oates &amp; Hatterley v. Jackson, <em>2 </em>Str. 1172 ; Newill v. Newill, L. R. 7 Ch. Ap. 253; Utz\u2019 Est., 29 Cal. 200 ; Freeman on Cotenancy, \u00a7 26 ; McKee\u2019s Ap., 104 Pa. 571.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">The whole estate is given to the children and grandchildren as one class, and though there are no words creating a fee simple, nor is the word \u201c fee simple \u201d used, yet the rule is that in such cases an estate in fee passes : Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">The provision that in the event of the death of any of his children without issue the deceased child\u2019s share of his estate should go back to the testator\u2019s children and their children \u201c that are living,\u201d must be interpreted to mean the testator\u2019s children and grandchildren living at the time of the death, under the rule laid down in Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Watts, 447 ; Ray v. Alexander, 146 Pa. 242 ; Hoff\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 636.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-10\">Negative words have no testamentary virtue, and they are not sufficient to exclude the title of an heir unless there be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>actual gift to some other definite object: Bender v. Dietrick, 7 W. &amp; S. 287 ; Hancock\u2019s Ap., 112 Pa. 532 ; Faulstich\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 188.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-4\"><em>J. B. </em>Townsend, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Athq\">The only thing on the face of the will which, on the first reading, militates against the exclusion of John from participating in any property that he might leave, are the words which follow immediately thereafter in the residuary clause, where he says that it is to be understood \u201c that all my estate belongs to my children and grandchildren.\u201d We assume here that the word \u201c other \u201d ought to be introduced before the word \u201c children.\u201d If the testator intended to alter, revoke, or modify the exclusion of John, which he had accomplished by the words immediately preceding this residuary clause, he surely would have introduced something to manifest an intention to change the emphatic exclusion he had just accomplished. It is quite within the power of the court to supply a word where it is necessary to carry out a defective expressed intent: McKeehan v. Wilson, 53 Pa. 74 ; Graham v. Graham, 3 Clark, 212. No violence would be caused, but simply elucidation, by the introduction of the word \u201c other\u201d before children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-5\">In Pennsylvania the adherence to the rule about carrying out the manifest intention of the testator, notwithstanding some apparent repugnance or contradiction, has gone very far : Ferry\u2019s Ap., 102 Pa. 207 ; Finney\u2019s Ap., 113 Pa. 11; Fahrney v. Holsinger, 65 Pa. 388 ; Newbold v. Boone, 52 Pa. 167 ; Sheetz\u2019s Ap., 82 Pa. 213 ; Jones v. Strong, 142 Pa. 498 ; Miller\u2019s Est., 38 Pa. 314.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">The rule which sacrifices the former of several contradictory clauses is never applied but on the failure of every attempt to give the whole will such a construction as renders every part effective: 1 Jarman on Wills, 439; Redfield on Wills, 451; Jenks v. Jackson, 127 Ill. 341.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\">It is a well settled rule that where there is any obscurity or difficulty in determining the parties who take under a will, and the gift is susceptible of two meanings, the court requires the adoption of that one which conforms most closely to the ordinary and usual rule of inheritance : Minter\u2019s Ap., 40 Pa. Ill; Horwitz v. Norris, 60 Pa. 261; Stehman\u2019s Ap., 45 Pa. 398 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>France\u2019s Est., 75 Pa. 220; McKee\u2019s Ap., 104 Pa. 571; Herr\u2019s Est., 28 Pa. 467.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A5F\">April 16, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"APTu\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The testator did not content himself with a mere omission of his son John as a legatee under his will, but he particularly and especially excluded him, by express words, from any participation in his estate. His words are, \u201cI now come to the most unpleasant part of my work, that is the disinheriting of my youngest son John Russell Sullivan in consequence of his disobeying my wishes. I wish him to have no interest in profit or principal of any part of my estate whatever if he should be employed by my sons my son James who has charge of all my estate will do right by him, he shall have no claim whatever on anything which I leave.\u201d Of course if this clause of the will had followed the residuary clause there would not have been the slightest question that John would have taken nothing under the will. It is only because the residuary clause follows the clause of disinheritance that there is any occasion for an}r question as to the intent of the testator. But it is the intent of the testator which must prevail, and if that be clearly apparent, the order of the testamentary clauses is of little moment. What then was the testator\u2019s intent as to his son John? The language of the will above quoted excludes John from any, even the slightest, participation in the testator\u2019s estate. It was so intended; the testator says it was so intended. He calls it \u201c the most unpleasant part of my work.\u201d What was it that was so very unpleasant? He explains it himself in immediate sequence, thus, \u201c that is, the disinheriting of my youngest son John Russell Sullivan in consequence of his disobeying my wishes. ... he shall have no claim whatever on anything which I leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">After this language it is altogether impossible to hold that the testator intended, or was even willing, that John should take any part of his estate. Of course if after that, he had expressly given a legacy to this son by name, he would take the gift because it was expressed subsequent to the exclusion. But it cannot be done by a mere implication even when the subsequent gift is to a class which would include John. We therefore hold that when the testator said in the very next sentence of the will, \u201c It must be perfectly well understood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>all of my estate belongs to my children and grandchildren \u201d he did not mean to include John or his children within the designated class. \u25a0 Any other construction of this residuary clause would simply nullify the immediately preceding clause of the will which expressly excluded him. We do not see any occasion for any refinement of reasoning upon the subject. The testator has said in unmistakable language that John is to have no part of his estate, and these words can only be enforced by holding that in the succeeding clause he meant his children other than John.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
