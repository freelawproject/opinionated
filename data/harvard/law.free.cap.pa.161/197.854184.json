Willcox for 116,666.67. He then caused a cemetery company to be incorporated under the name of the Mount Auburn Cemetery Company, and conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the land to the corporation, subject to the mortgage. In 1890 Mr. Willcox brought suit on his mortgage, C. P. No. 1, Dec. T., 1890, No. 70; recovered judgment for $17,947,23 (including interest in arrear), and sold the cemetery.

While the Mount Auburn Company was the owner of the cemetery, a burial lot was inclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>by a stone curbing and a monument was erected on tbe ground, consisting of a stone foundation extending down below the frost line, and upon this foundation a marble base was placed surmounted by a marble shaft, and upon the shaft the statue in question was erected. The whole of the structure was cemented together and constituted a solid mass. The entire work, including the curbing, was built by the cemetery company for the ornamentation of the grounds and manifestly was intended to be a permanent part of the cemetery property. In no sense can it be regarded as a trade fixture. As this subject was the controlling feature of the contest its determination ends the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
