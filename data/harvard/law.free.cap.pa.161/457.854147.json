James W. Bosler died in 1883, leaving a will which was proven Dee. 22, 1883. A widow and four children, Frank, Mary, Clinton and Helen, survived him and are still alive. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-17\">\u201c 2. After making certain bequests and devises, and, of the residue of the estate, giving one third to the widow, this will, in its 5th paragraph reads: \u2018 The remaining two thirds I give, bequeath and devise in equal shares to my four children, Frank, Mary, Clinton and Plelen, upon the following terms and conditions, and payable as follows; to-wit: one-half of each share as they personally attain their legal majority, the other half I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>order and direct to be paid to to be held by him in trust for my said children respectively, and to pay the annual interest accruing thereon, to them severally for and during their natural lives, and, at their and each of hheir deaths, the principal of each share to the person or persons legally entitled to the same, giving to each of my said children the power and authority to dispose of by last will and testament said fund so held in trust for each of them.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">\u201c3.

Bosler have since attained their majority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">\u201c 5. On Sept. 9, 1891, the Commonwealth Guarantee Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Company, trustee, filed its first account. In this account, the trustee charges itself with $379,940.23, prin: cipal, and $58,831.57 income, of which last sum, $486.64 was derived from real estate, the rest from securities. The $379,940.23 contains the amount of $27,301.06 \u2018 cash from undivided securities.\u2019 This $27,301.06 was a part of one third of the amount of undivided securities amounting at par to $32,673.04 that were in the hands of the executors of the will of James W. Bosler, and that none of the parties in interest would accept in specie from the executors, agreeing that they should be placed with the Commonwealth Guarantee, etc., Company for collection and distribution. The whole amount of these undivided securities, $98,019.12, was divisible into three parts, one third payable to Mrs. Helen Bosler, widow; one third to the guardian of the children, and one third to the trustee. The company collected $81,903.18 of them as agent, paying to itself, as trustee, the share coming to it in that capacity, and handing the other shares over to the parties thereto entitled. For services as agent, the company charged five per cent on the amount collected. The remainder of the corpus of the estate with which the accountant charges itself was made up of $234,000 U. S. registered bonds at 4 per cent, becoming due in 1907, a judgment of $1,000 against D. S. Craighead, another of $6,000 against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Jacob Thudium, another of $1,000 against David H. Coble, another of $1,000 against George H. Miller, a mortgage of $1,000 against John A. Filbert, bonds of the Carlisle borough, amounting to $13,500, bonds of the Northern Central Railroad Co., whose par was $20,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-3\">\u201c 6. The Craighead, Miller and Coble judgments and the Carlisle bonds remain unconverted in the trustee\u2019s hands. Of the $234,000 U. S. bonds, $70,000 were sold by Drexel &amp; Co. for $87,837.50, $164,000 for $202,080, in all $289,917.50. The sale of the $164,000 was made in two parcels, $40,000 on October 3, 1889, for $50,800, and $124,000 on March 19, 1890, for $151,280. The sale of the $70,000 was also made in two parcels, $40,000 on April 21, 1888, for $49,850, and $30,000 on June 16,1888, for $37,987.50. The Northern Central Railroad' bonds were sold on Jan. 18,1889, for $23,500. These sales did not take place by order of the court. Whether any commissions were paid for any of these sales does not distinctly appear. (Col. Jennings says, \u2018 Can\u2019t say, now, whether Drexel, the agent for selling the securities, remitted the whole amount, or deducted his commission as agent.\u2019 In a paper marked N, subsequently sent to the auditor, it is said, \u2018 No brokerage commissions were paid.\u2019)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-4\">\u201c 7. The sale of the U. S. bonds was justified by the fact that they were losing value, the premium at which they were selling declining. The Northern Central Bonds also declined in value .after the sale, not being worth on Jan. 16, 1892, when Col. Jennings,, president of the Commonwealth Guarantee, etc. Company, testified, what was obtained for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">\u201c 8. The reinvestment of the proceeds of these sales took place promptly; on the average within 30 days. No. fault is found in regard to the expeditiousness of the trustee in discovering places for, and in making these reinvestments. The rein-vestments are in bonds and mortgages ranging from small sums, e. g., $46.23, $87.71, $200 to $10,000, and, though about 150 in number, average about $2,400. We have no evidence of the labor involved, except the statement that the trustee by its president inspected every property in Harrisburg and vicinity and inquired of others, the property with only a few exceptions lying in the county in which the trustee is established, and indeed in the city of Harrisburg. The times during which these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>loans are to run do not appear. It is hence impossible to foretell how many changes of investment will be made during the course of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-4\">\u201c 9. The trustee claims, in his account, sundry credits, amounting to $59,219.72, which included three per centum of the principal sum in cash and securities, amounting to $10,309.18, and five per centum on the income, diminished by $486.64 obtained from real estate; that is, 5 per centum on $58,344.93 ; amounting to $2,917.25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">\u201c 10. Exceptions to this report were filed on Sept. 29, 1891, by the Fidelity Insurance, Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Company, as guardian of Mary, Clinton, and Helen B osier, and by Frank Bosler, now of age, objecting, (1) that the principal and the income therefrom were not distinguished in the account; (2) that the account did not specify from which of the several \u2018 undivided securities \u2019 the cash amounting to $27,301.06 was received; (3) that the attorney\u2019s fees, $1,088.05, were excessive; (4) that the charge of 3 per centum on the principal was not authorized by law; (5) that if any commissions on the corpus were allowable, three per centum on $343,639.17 was grossly excessive; (6) that the charge of five per centum commissions on the income, to wit, $2,917.25, was excessive, and should be reduced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">\u201c 11.

Permissibleness of commissions on principal: It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>necessary to educe authorities for the familiar principle that the allowance of commissions is simply by way of compensation to the trustee for his services: Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 230; Slifer\u2019s Estate, 4 Phila. 225. The rate of commission may vary according to the volume of the estate, or the risk, labor and responsibility involved. Sometimes, one rate would be ample, at others, a higher or a lower would be legitimate. Cf. Cox\u2019s Estate, 5 W. N. 474; Dunlap\u2019s Estate, 9 <em>W. </em>N. 349; Heckert\u2019s Appeal, 24 Pa. 482; Duval\u2019s Appeal, 38 Pa. 112; Carrier\u2019s Appeal, 79 Pa. 230. A difference exists between trusts which exist in order to convert and distribute a fund as quickly as expedient and those which exist -for the administration of a fund through a term of years for the benefit, meantime, of designated cestuis que trust who are to receive the annual interest. Cf. McElhenny\u2019s Appeal, 46 Pa. 347.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\">\u201c In the former case the trustee, e. g., an executor, administrator, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, etc., collects the assets, converts them, and is allowed, when he settles his account, a commission upon the corpus with which he has dealt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">\u201c In the case of a continuous trust, one duty of which is to preserve the fund, as a source of periodic interest, dividends, rents, etc., the authorities do not recognize a right in the trustee, except in extraordinary circumstances, or when the' instrument by which the trust is created so indicates, to diminish the fund which is to create the income during the life of the trust. For services rendered by way of collecting and paying over the income, the compensation is a fit charge upon the income and is properly deducted from it. But the labor, care and responsibility pertaining to the conservation of the capital itself are properly a charge on it, and are to be deducted from it when the trust expires, or the particular trustee\u2019s relation to it ends. * The rule which may be safely deduced from the cases \u2019 is \u2018 that commissions upon the corpus of a trust estate are never allowable except when the fund is in the course of distribution. The reason is inherent in the nature of a trust. Its purpose is to preserve, and it may be of unlimited duration, while that of administration is to divide, and implies dispatch. Hence, if commissions upon the capital are awarded to the successive trustees who may be called to its management, the fund, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>instead of being intact, may be absorbed in the payment of its custodians: \u2019 Mintzer\u2019s Estate, 43 Leg. Int. 292, affirmed 9 Atl. R. 66. In Butterbaugh\u2019s Appeal, 39 Leg. Int. 180, Paxson, J., says, the interest and not the principal of a trust must bear the expense of managing it. \u2018Were it otherwise, the entire principal might be absorbed in paying the trustees commissions upon income. A trustee is entitled to a reasonable compensation for his services as they are rendered, and, unless a contrary intention appear, the compensation must come out of the income of the fund, in the administration of which it is earned.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-4\">\u201c Hemphill\u2019s Appeal, 18 Pa. 303, was a trust during the life of A, remainder to her children. During A\u2019s life, an account was filed by the trustee. Commissions upon the reinvestments of principal, beyond the commissions upon the income, were disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">\u201c During the life of the trust, the trustee is entitled to a percentage on the income of the trust property. He cannot be compelled to wait till the conclusion of the trust, and claim his compensation out of the corpus: Spangler\u2019s Appeal, 21 Pa. 335.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">\u201c So far as we have been able to discover, by a somewhat extended examination of cases, the commission on the corpus is never allowed until the trust has ended, or, at least, the particular trustee has ceased to be such. Thus, in Perkins\u2019s Appeal, 108 Pa. 314, where there was a trust for life, at the end of which the fund was to be distributed, at the conclusion of the trust by the death of the life tenant, the trustee was allowed a percentage on income, and also on the corpus, consisting of stocks and other securities, which the trustee would have to sell in order to effect distribution. In Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 340, on the death of the life tenant, the trustee was allowed commissions on income, but also three per cent on the purchase money of land (a part of the capital) sold, and a lump compensation of $2,000 additional. The trust had lasted nineteen years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">\u201c In Beck\u2019s Estate, 5 W. N. 274, a trust for the minority of X. had come to an end by his attainment of age. Even then it was held that a commission would not be allowed for investment or reinvestment, unless there had been extraordinary trouble.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201c In O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Estate, 4 W. N. 91, affirmed in Sharkey\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. N. 534, executors had been appointed by will to hold one share of the estate during the life of A., one of the testator\u2019s children, to pay to him and his children the income, one fourth to him and three fourths to his children, and at his death to pay the principal over to the children. After settling their account as executors, in which they were allowed five per cent on $274,558.43, nine years later the account as trustees was settled. They were held entitled to five per centum on the income of the share held by them in trust, but not to any commission on the corpus, because the same individual is not entitled to two commissions out of the corpus in several capacities as executor and trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">\u201c The principle of this last decision is that of the act of March 17, 1864, 1 Purd. 551, pi. 213, P. L. 53, which forbids the same persons from receiving double commissions on the corpus, by the following words : \u2018 In all cases where the same person shall, under a will, fulfill the duties of executor and trustee, it shall not be lawful for such person to receive or charge more than one commission upon any sum of money coming into or passing through his hands, or held by him for the benefit of other parties, and such single commission shall be deemed a full compensation for his services in the double ca-. pacity of executor and trustee: Provided, that any such trustee shall be allowed to retain a reasonable commission on the interest he may receive from any sum held by him in trust as aforesaid.\u2019 Cf. Shiver\u2019s Estate, 12 W. N. 463 ; Pedrick\u2019s Estate, 5 Pliila. 478.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">\u201c In Wister\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 160, a trustee for the life of A., himself being entitled to the estate in remainder, after accounting, extra curiam, for five years, for the full income, was permitted, the life tenant A. dying, to deduct from the income in his hands commissions for the antecedent five years. Of course, as the trustee was to take the corpus, the attempt was not made to claim commissions upon it. In Culbertson\u2019s Appeal, 84 Pa. 303, the trust, which had lasted for nearly twenty years, ended, and the trustee was then allowed commissions on the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">\u201c In Pedrick\u2019s Estate, 5 Phila. 478, the trustees had also been executors. As executors they had, on settling their account, received a commission on the principal. They subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>acted as trustees for a portion of this estate, received as trustees from themselves as executors, for the lifetime of Mrs. Pedrick. At her death, i. e., at the conclusion of the trust, they filed an account, asking for commissions upon the principal, as well as upon the income ; five per cent was allowed on the income, one per cent on reinvestments, and, in addition, the gross sum of $90.00, the court declining to follow the auditor, who had allowed three per cent on the corpus. It is to be noted that the trust had terminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">\u201c In Shiver\u2019s Estate, 12 W. N. 462, the \u25a0 final account of a trustee for the lives of certain persons was filed at the expiration of a period of sixteen or seventeen years, and a commission of five per centum on the income and three' per centum on the principal was allowed, together with $32.00 for traveling expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">\u201c In Bell\u2019s Estate, 1 W. N. 20, an executor had also acted; b3r consent, as committee of an insane legatee. He had.been compelled on four occasions to extinguish ground rents which formed a part of the estate, and to give security for the amounts received therefor. He claimed ten per cent commissions on the principal for his double service as executor and committee, and for his trouble in making reinvestments, besides five per cent commissions on the income. He was allowed five per cent commissions upon the income, and 3], per cent upon the principal. Evidentty, in this case, the account was final, concluding the double trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">\u201c Caley\u2019s Appeal, 47 Pa. 356, was a ease in which a trustee was to have the care and management of a bequest, until the legatee reached majority, and meantime to apply the same to his use and benefit, filed an account at the close of the trust, and was allowed 1-1- per cent commission upon the principal, a mortgage not converted. In McElhenny\u2019s Appeal, 46 Pa. 347, a guardian after nine years\u2019 service, and at the death of the ward, was allowed a compensation additional to percentage on annual proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">\u201c We are, we think, justified in accepting the language of Judge Ashman in Mentzer\u2019s Estate, supra, that \u2018commissions upon the corpus of a trust estate are never allowable'except when the fund is in course of distribution,\u2019 with the possible qualification that when there is a change of trustee there may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>possibly be commission on the corpus in favor of the retiring trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">\u201c The allowance of a commission on the corpus earlier than the conclusion of the trust would lead to grave difficulties. In estimating the commissions, the duration of the trust must be considered, but it cannot be anticipated. More labor, responsibility, etc., will be incurred during a long administration than during a short one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">\u201c The present trustee had been trustee for three years when it filed the account, and it asks three per centum upon the corpus of the trust. It may cease to be trustee to-morrow, and a succession of trustees might become necessary to execute the testamentary trust, which may last for sixty years. If each of these trustees charged three per cent on the corpus, for services covering three years of the trust, 50 to 60 per cent of the corpus would be consumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">\u201cAgain, whai has the trustee done, which in its opinion merits 3 per centum of the corpus ? For maintaining the fecundity of the fund, it receives a benefit, it must be remembered, in the percentage on the income of the fund. But it has simply collected debts due by the United States and a half dozen other debtors, apparently without trouble, and has in turn lent the same out to about 150 persons. But the average life of these loans does hot appear. Many of them will doubtless fall in in a year or two. The money received will have to be reinvested. The fresh loans will be called in, and the moneys collected reinvested. For aught that appears, the Commonwealth Guarantee, Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company will earn, every three years, at least as much as it has earned during the first three. Is it then to be paid a triennial commission of three per cent on the corpus, making during the probable life of the trust 50 or 60 per cent, besides 5 per cent on the annual interest collected?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">\u201c The only sensible rule, it seems, is to wait until the complete performance of the trust, to examine it, and to reward it, according to the aggregate deserts. If the 3 per cent commission is supposed to be the reward for the entire service towards the capital, during the life of the trust, except such as is covered by the annual commissions on income, then the allowance of it now offends the principle that the commission is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>intended to compensate for work done, not for work which it is expected or hoped will be done: Walker\u2019s Estate, 9'S. &amp; R. 223; Adams\u2019s Appeal, 47 Pa. 94.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\">\u201c Besides, when a trust lasts for 30 or 40 years, the allowance of a given percentage on the corpus at the beginning is a very different award from that at the end. The difference, owing to the compounding of interest, would be enormous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">\u201c The trustee, in its management of the trust, has behaved with sagacity and prudence, qualities which are expected in every trustee, for the supposed existence of which he is employed, and for the continuous exertion of which, during the entire period of the trust, he is rewarded by a commission upon the income produced by the capital thus conserved, and, finally, by a commission on the capital itself, if other methods of full compensation have not been employed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">\u201c The principle of the act of March 17, 1864, supra, is not to be ignored. It seemed to the legislature improper that the same person should, in two capacities, mulct the corpus by two deductions in the form of commissions. It certainly could not be consistent with this principle, that the same trustee, in the same capacity, should subtract two or more commissions from the principal. Hence the necessity of waiting till the end of the present trust to determine whether the trustee is entitled to one commission. And, in determining that, doubtless, reference would be had to the incompleteness of the trust when the present trustee retires from it, and the possible compensation that may need to be paid to any successors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">\u201cWe think, then, that any charges for commissions upon the capital must be adjourned until the trust is closed so far as the .present accountant is concerned, and that the compensation then to be awarded will be decided by a review of the entire course of the administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-8\">\u201c 3. Commissions on income: The allowance of 5 per cent upon the income we do not consider excessive, in view of the decisions. The wisdom of the coyversion of the securities is not questioned. The reinvestments, so far as appears, are sound. At least no complaint is made of them on that score. No unreasonable delay in reinvestment occurred. The U. S. bonds and the bonds of the Northern Central R. R. Co. were disposed of at a premium. The trustee did not make this premium, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>of course deserves no credit for its existence. He realized it by a timely sale. His reinvestments average somewhat over $4,000 a piece. He has promptly collected the interest and is responsible for it and the principal. We have concluded that 5 per cent commission on the income is allowable. Five per cent on income is recognized as proper in King\u2019s Est., 11 Phila. 26; Wharton\u2019s Est., 11 Phila. 39 ; Skinner\u2019s Est., 4 Phila. 189; Eshleman\u2019s Ap., 74 Pa. 42; Wood\u2019s Ap., 86 Pa. 346; Cusack\u2019s Est., 3 Brewst. 325; Of. Bird\u2019s Est., 2 Pars. 170.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-4\">\u201c 4. The allowance to attorneys: The evidence is very slender upon the services of the attorneys. The estate however is large; much professional consultation, advice and labor may easily be conceived to be necessary. We have concluded that the allowance claimed for attorneys of $1,088.05 is not excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">\u201c 5. The interest on the excessive commission : The accountant, when he filed his account, appropriated to himself $9,921.03 which he ought then to have paid over to the cestuis que trust. As the trustee has had the use of this sum for two years, claiming it as his own, there can be no question that he is chargeable with interest upon it at the lawful rate for the space of two years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">Accountant filed exceptions (2-4) to conclusions of law as in brackets, and (1) in not finding facts as below. The auditor reported on the exceptions as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">\u201c 1st Exception. It is true that the accountant received U. S. 4 per cent bonds, when par was $234,000, at a valuation of $285,838.25 and sold them for'$289,917.50. What the present value of these bonds would be is not shown in the evidence. The Northern Central 11. R. bonds were received at the valuation of $20,000, and were sold for $22,500. The products of these conversions were reinvested in six per cent securities. These securities were, at the time of their conversion, however, actually worth more than the appraisement. The accountant did not create the increment which it realized. It acted prudently, carefully and properly in converting them when it did, and in gaining more than the par or the estimated value. But while the failure to so convert might have been negligent, and exposed to a surcharge, we cannot see that the faithfulness of the accountant, which is clear, entitles it to compensation entirely exceptional. . . . Exceptions overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3eb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>May 7, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-2\"><em>JErrors assigned </em>were (1-4) dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-3\"><em>M.
