Diehl, a real estate broker, presented a claim for $1,150 commissions on the sale of the property No. 813 Chestnut street, which decedent in his lifetime sold to the Commonwealth Trust Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">The auditing judge found the facts to be as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">\u201cIn the spring of 1888 the claimant called upon the president of the Commonwealth Trust Company (which company afterwards became the purchaser) and informed that officer that he had in his hands, as agent of the \u2019decedent, a property, 813 Chestnut street, which he offered for sale at $125,000. In reply the president of the company suggested that he should submit the proposition in the fall, when the board of directors would hold their next meeting. The claimant accordingly, on September 21,1888, addressed a letter to the president embodying the terms of his original proposal. This letter was submitted to the board of directors, and the board, on October 5, 1888, appointed a committee to consider generally the question of the purchase of a suitable property for the purposes of the corporation. After the appointment of this committee the president of the company, with the consent of the claimant, saw the decedent in person. At this interview he informed the decedent of the offer which had been made by the claimant as decedent\u2019s agent, and he objected to the price as too high. The decedent refused to recede therefrom. On January 18, 1889, the board authorized the committee to offer the decedent $100,000 for the property, and on February 9,1889, the committee reported that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the decedent would accept no sum below $120,000. On June 14, 1889, the committee made another and elaborate report to the board, in which they discussed the merits and demerits of various properties, and finally recommended the purchase of the premises in question at the price named by the decedent, viz., $120,000. On June 28, 1889, Mr. Sylvester, a member of the committee, reported on behalf of the committee to the board a proposal by the decedent that the Commonwealth Trust Company should execute a lease for the premises, with an option to purchase for $120,000; and finally, July 24, 1889, he reported for the committee an offer from the decedent to sell the premises for $115,000. Upon this offer the bargain was finally consummated, and the premises passed into the ownership of the Commonwealth Title Insurance and Trust Company. On these facts, standing by themselves, no doubt can well be entertained that the sale was effected through the instrumentality of the claimant. He first brought the property to the notice of the president of the purchasing corporation, and the corporation formally acted upon the proposition. The fact that the offer had been so made by the claimant as the agent of the decedent was distinctly made known to the decedent by the president of the Commonwealth Company, who had called upon the decedent in consequence of the offer, and the agency was never repudiated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">\u201cIt was shown, however, that in December, 1888, the decedent put the property into the hands of the Real Estate Trust Company, in which he was a large shareholder, for sale. That company placed a bill or poster on the premises, offering them for sale, and some negotiations were afterwards had between the trust officer of the company and Mr. Sylvester. Mr. Sylvester appears to have been regarded by the trust officer as a real estate agent, who was acting for the proposed purchaser, because after the sale was effected he divided with Mr. Sylvester the commissions which were paid by the decedent to the Real Estate Trust Company. But the part which was taken by that company in the transaction can have no possible bearing upon the claim as presented by Mr. Diehl. The proof is complete that when the decedent applied to the Real Estate Trust Company the agency of the claimant was in full force, and was not terminated by any act of the decedent. Certainly his constituting without notice to the claimant another party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>as agent did not annul the first contract. He could not escape from one obligation simply because he entered into another obligation, although he might be liable upon both. The initial action of the committee and board of directors of the corporation buyer was based upon the written proposal which the claimant made as agent of the decedent, and their whole after-course, as shown by the minutes of the board, followed as a regular sequence from that letter.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APh\">April 16, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-4\">\u201c The claim is allowed and payment is decreed to be made out of the balance remaining for distribution, $4,981, and the balance is awarded to the accountants for further accounting.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Exceptions dismissed in opinion by Ferguson, J., 8 Dist.

It is clear upon the testimony of Mr. Dechert, and it was so found by the auditing judge, and confirmed by the orphans\u2019 court, that the appellee was the person who first brought the buyer and seller together. It is also clearly proved by Mr. Dechert that when he had his first interview with Mr. Gibson he told Mr. Gibson that the property had been submitted to him by Mr. Diehl, and stated the price which Diehl said was asked by Mr. Gibson, $125,000. To this Mr. Gibson made no demur or disclaimer of Mr. Diehl\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>authority to act for him. The negotiation after that seems to have been conducted by Mr. Dechert and Mr. Gibson, but that, under our well-settled cases, does not deprive the broker of his commissions: Keys v. Johnson, 68 Pa. 43; Reed\u2019s Estate, 82 Pa. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
