On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she intended to kill the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>victim; (2) the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) the trial court improperly overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the introduction into evidence of two tape-recorded conversations between the state\u2019s chief witness and the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On September 14, 1981, the defendant lived in Stratford with her husband, the victim, and her daughter, Suzette Meyer. The defendant and the victim shared a history of marital strife. On the night of the murder, the defendant and the victim were arguing because the victim had been arrested for driving an unregistered motor vehicle, and the victim had accused the defendant of having informed the police. In the course of the argument, the defendant threw a beer bottle at the victim, who had been drinking. Meyer, who was sitting at the kitchen table across from the victim, was looking down when she heard a loud noise. When Meyer looked up, she saw that the defendant was standing near the doorway holding a small handgun, and that the victim was slumped in his seat at the kitchen table. The victim died from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Although Meyer did not actually see the defendant pull the trigger, she testified that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>been moving around during the course of the argument and, at one point, had entered Meyer\u2019s bedroom. Meyer and the victim\u2019s son both testified that the defendant customarily carried the handgun in her pocketbook, which she normally kept in Meyer\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">After the shooting, the defendant held the gun to Meyer\u2019s head and told her to help clean up the blood from the floor. While Meyer was cleaning the floor, the defendant dragged the victim\u2019s body out the back door and into the yard. Meyer then assisted the defendant in lifting the victim\u2019s body into a pickup truck. Thereafter, the defendant, with Meyer as a passenger, began driving the pickup truck through Stratford. Because the truck developed mechanical problems, the defendant drove the truck to the house of her brother, Ellsworth Hull, where the engine stopped running. Hull, who never noticed the victim\u2019s body in the bed of the truck, was unable to jump start the vehicle. Hull then drove Meyer and the defendant home. Meyer never saw the victim\u2019s body again. One week later, Meyer learned that the victim\u2019s body had been found floating in Long Island Sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Because Meyer feared for her life as a result of the defendant\u2019s threats, she did not tell the police about the incident until 1992. On September 2, 1992, after reading an article in the local newspaper about the unsolved murder, Meyer told Hull, in whose home she was then living, about the murder. Meyer contacted the police that same day and implicated the defendant. After an investigation in which Meyer assisted the police, the defendant was arrested and charged in a one count information with murder. Additional facts will be presented as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly denied her motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she had had the specific intent to cause the death of the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency [of the evidence] claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). The specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 120, 622 A.2d 519 (1993). Intent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 77. Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct; id., 76; and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>supra, 119.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>233 Conn. 215, 223, 658 A.2d 571 (1995). \u201cFurthermore, [i]ntent to cause death may be inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>supra, 120.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>supra, 224. \u201cThis does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 244, 627 A.2d 877 (1993). Nevertheless, because intent to cause the death of a person is an element of the crime; <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>supra, 120; that intent must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 204, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>supra, 223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u201cWe do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991). This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>198 Conn. 424, 427, 503 A.2d 588 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that she had intended to kill the victim. Meyer testified that the defendant and the victim had had a history of marital conflicts. On the night of the shooting, the victim had accused the defendant of telling the police that he had been operating an unregistered vehicle. An argument ensued and the defendant threw a beer bottle at the victim. Although Meyer did not see the defendant leave the kitchen, she did testify that the defendant customarily carried her gun in her pocketbook, which she normally left in Meyer\u2019s bedroom. Therefore, the jury could have inferred that the defendant had left the kitchen to retrieve her gun before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>shooting the victim in the back of the head. We conclude, moreover, that this evidence was sufficient for the jury also to infer that the defendant possessed an intent to kill, stemming from the permissible inference that the defendant had left the room to retrieve her gun and then returned to shoot the victim. \u201cWe have stated that [o]ne who uses a deadly weapon upon a vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such a circumstance a proper inference may be drawn in some cases that there was an intent to kill. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>174 Conn. 22, 26, 381 A.2d 539 (1977).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 680, 613 A.2d 788 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Likewise, the jury was free to infer an intent to kill from the defendant\u2019s failure to assist the victim after the shooting. We have previously noted that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s failure to summon medical assistance for [her] victim [is] part of the evidence from which the jury could have inferred an intent to kill.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 129, 646 A.2d 169 (1994). Instead of seeking medical assistance for the victim, the defendant threatened Meyer not to tell anyone about the incident and immediately began the process of hiding the body. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant, when she shot the victim, had the requisite intent to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied her request to charge the jury on criminally negligent homicide as a lesser included offense of murder. In addition to charging murder, the trial court gave jury instructions on manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, however, concluded that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on criminally negligent homicide because there was no evidence justifying conviction of the lesser offense. The state argues that the defendant failed to request an appropriate instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cThere is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 583, 427 A.2d 414 (1980); rather, the right to such an instruction is purely a matter of our common law. \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser [included] offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d Id., 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>179 Conn. 588, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 22-23, 592 A.2d 149 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 106, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). \u2018[T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested. . . . Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 68, 621 A.2d 728 (1993). On appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if \u2018we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility\u2019 that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 30, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>235 Conn. 67, 73-74, 663 A.2d 972 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Under the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588, we must determine whether the request to charge constituted an appropriate instruction. \u201cA proposed instruction on a lesser included offense constitutes an appropriate instruction for purposes of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>if it complies with Practice Book \u00a7 854. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 591, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>[201 Conn. 534, 556-58, 518 A.2d 915 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>[199 Conn. 155, 158-61, 506 A.2d 104 (1986)]. Section 854 provides in relevant part: \u2018When there are several requests, they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, <em>and the evidence to which the proposition would apply . </em>. . .\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 75. \u201cWe have held that, in the context of a written request to charge on a lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>included offense, this requirement of \u00a7 854 is met only if the proposed request contains such a complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 591, 569 A.2d 534 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u201c \u2018While this court does not favor unyielding adherence to rules of procedure where the interests of justice are thereby disserved . . . the ever increasing refinement of our lawjustifi.es cooperation of counsel in stating requests for jury instruction. The minor burden of cooperation imposed by [Practice Book \u00a7 854] is neither unreasonable nor novel.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 593.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58 provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, <em>with criminal negligence, </em>he causes the death of another person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cA person acts with \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14). Accordingly, to comply with the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588, and Practice Book \u00a7 854, the defendant\u2019s request to charge must enumerate the essential facts to justify the court\u2019s instruction to the jury pertaining to the defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cperceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s request to charge did not set forth the essential facts to warrant the court\u2019s instruction on criminally negligent homicide. The defendant\u2019s request included the following facts: \u201cYou heard testimony that the victim was shot. However, the State\u2019s witness Suzette Meyer testified that she did not actually see the defendant pull the trigger. She testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that she was seated with her head down when the shot was fired. Suzette Meyer did not testify as to what caused the gun to be fired.\u201d The request does not enumerate any essential facts demonstrating the defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cperceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d of the victim\u2019s death. We find unpersuasive the fact that Meyer did not actually see the defendant pull the trigger because that circumstance \u201cis as applicable to the offenses of murder, manslaughter in the first degree, and manslaughter in the second degree as to criminally negligent homicide.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 592. In our view, the defendant\u2019s written request to charge constitutes \u201c[a] mere general statement of the entire incident at issue [which] does not comply with our rules of practice.\u201d Id., 591-92. Accordingly, the trial court did not improperly refuse the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on the offense of criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence two tape-recorded conversations between the defendant and Meyer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. In September, 1992, after reading a newspaper article about the unsolved death of the victim, Meyer approached the local police and gave a statement implicating the defendant. In exchange for immunity, Meyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>agreed with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to wear a recording device and to attempt to elicit an admission of guilt from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On September 11,1992, Meyer and the defendant met at a local supermarket. The police had informed Meyer that the defendant would be at the supermarket at the designated time. Meyer, who was wearing a microphone in her baseball hat, met with the defendant and attempted to obtain an admission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>On September 15, 1992, the police tape-recorded a telephone conversation between Meyer and the defendant. Meyer telephoned the defendant from a police car, accompanied by police officers, and asked the defendant to call her back at a pay telephone. The telephone number that Meyer gave the defendant was actually that of the telephone she was then using in the police car. When the defendant returned Meyer\u2019s telephone call, Meyer again attempted to elicit an admission.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>At trial, the state offered the cassette tapes and transcripts of the conversations into evidence. The defendant objected, arguing that because Meyer was acting as an agent of the state, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, determining that there had been no custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant argues that: (1) both recordings were improperly admitted because they were the product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of custodial interrogation and, consequently, <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been required; and (2) the recorded telephone conversation was improperly admitted because it constituted an intercepted wire communication in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-41/,.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree with each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The defendant argues that, because the tape-recorded conversations occurred in a \u201cpolice dominated environment,\u201d <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201cTwo threshold conditions must be satisfied in order to invoke the warnings constitutionally required by <em>Miranda: </em>(1) the defendant must have been in custody; and (2) the defendant must have been subjected to police inteirogation. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966)]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>227 Conn. 101, 112, 629 A.2d 402 (1993); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>230 Conn. 572, 576, 646 A.2d 108 (1994). As stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>[463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983)], [although the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>[Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1977)]. See also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 655, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L.

Further, the United States Supreme Court has adopted an objective, reasonable person test for determining whether a defendant is in custody. . . . Thus, in determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights are required, <em>the only relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would believe that he or she was in police custody of the degree associated with a formal arrest. . . . State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>supra, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cFurthermore, we note that [n]o definitive list of factors governs a determination of whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have believed that he or she was in custody. Because, however, the <em>Miranda </em>court expressed concern with protecting defendants against interrogations that take place in a \u2018police-dominated atmosphere\u2019 containing inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. [467]; circumstances relating to those kinds of concerns are highly relevant on the custody issue.

The trial court\u2019s determination of the historical circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation are findings of fact; id.; which will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 652, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 292, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982); see Practice Book \u00a7 4061. In order to determine the ultimate issue of custody, however, we will conduct a scrupulous examination of the record; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 267-68, 533 A.2d 545 (1987); in order to ascertain whether, in light of the totality of circumstances, the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>supra, 606; <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 580, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>197 Conn. 180, 185, 496 A.2d 486 (1985).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 757-59, 670 A.2d 276 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant failed to prove that she was in custody during the course of either the September 11, 1992 meeting or the September 15, 1992 telephone conversation. At all times during the meeting in the supermarket, the defendant was free to leave. Meyer neither used, nor threatened to use, force to detain the defendant. Further', during the September 15,1992 telephone conversation, the defendant was not obligated to return Meyer\u2019s telephone call. Indeed, the defendant could have terminated the conversation at any time by simply hanging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>up the receiver. Accordingly, because a review of the facts in the record reveals that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have believed that she was in custody, during either the supermarket meeting or the telephone conversation, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the tape-recorded September 15,1992 telephone conversation in violation of \u00a7 54-41\u00cd.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See footnote 12. In particular, the defendant argues that, because she was not served with a copy of the court order authorizing the intercepted wire communication, a new trial is warranted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u201cIn general terms, our wiretap act [General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a et seq.] provides that, based upon certain specified findings, a panel of three Superior Court judges may issue an order authorizing \u2018the interception of wire communications within the state of Connecticut. . . .\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 54-41d. For these purposes, \u2018 \u201c\u00a1intercept\u201d means the intentional overhearing or recording of a wire communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a <em>(Z).\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> State v. McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 604-605, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>620 A.2d 133 (1993). Section 54-41l prohibits the contents of intercepted wire communications from being admitted into evidence unless the \u201caggrieved person\u201d has been served with a copy of the court order at least thirty days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We have held, however, that the protections of the wiretap act are inapplicable to wiretaps in which one party consents to the recording. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 211, 562 A.2d 481 (1989). In <em>Grullon, </em>we emphasized that \u201c \u2018[t]he competing interests of the community in effective law enforcement and of the individual in his privacy are, in a unique way, drawn into question by police wiretapping. Clearly, our statutes are aimed at balancing these competing interests.\u2019 \u201d Id., 210-11, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>194 Conn. 447, 458, 481 A.2d 730 (1984). Accordingly, if one of the parties to a telephone conversation consents to wiretapping, the provisions of the wiretap act, including \u00a7 54-417, do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In this case, it is undisputed that Meyer consented to the wiretapping of the September 15, 1992 telephone conversation with the defendant. We conclude that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>because the wiretap act does not apply to consensual wiretaps, the state was under no statutory obligation to obtain a court order authorizing the wiretap or to give the defendant a copy of that order and the accompanying application.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

We note that this argument, which is totally inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s trial testimony in which she denied shooting the victim, was not specified in the requested jury charge and, consequently, could not constitute the essential facts required to satisfy the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> The transcript of the September 11, 1992 meeting provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201c[Meyer]: I gotta stay at home.
