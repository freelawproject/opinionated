J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">The public elementary and high school</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">students in Hartford suffer daily from the devastating effects that racial and ethnic isolation, as well as poverty, have had on their education. Federal constitutional law provides no remedy for their plight. The principal issue in this appeal is whether, under the unique provisions of our state constitution, the state, which already plays an active role in managing public schools, must take further measures to relieve the severe handicaps that burden these children\u2019s education. The issue is as controversial as the stakes are high. We hold today that the needy schoolchildren of Hartford have waited long enough. The constitutional imperatives contained in article eighth, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>state constitution entitle the plaintiffs to relief. At the same time, the constitutional imperative of separation of powers persuades us to afford the legislature, with the assistance of the executive branch, the opportunity, in the first instance, to fashion the remedy that will most appropriately respond to the constitutional violations that we have identified. The judgment of the trial court must, accordingly, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">THE HISTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THIS LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">In their action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, the eighteen plaintiffs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed a four count complaint in which they claimed that the defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had a constitutional obligation, under article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, to remedy alleged educational inequities in the Hartford public schools. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motions to strike the complaint and for summary judgment. After an evidentiary hearing, the court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that \u201cstate action exists under the facts and circumstances of this case,\u201d and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 revised four count complaint alleges that students in the Hartford public schools are burdened by severe educational disadvantages arising out of their racial and ethnic isolation and their socioeconomic deprivation. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, each count of their complaint is grounded on the proposition that the defendants have failed to fulfill their state constitutional responsibility to remedy these severe educational disadvantages. Count one alleges that the defendants bear responsibility for the de facto racial and ethnic segregation between Hartford and the surrounding suburban public school districts and thus have deprived the plaintiffs of an equal opportunity to a free public education as required by article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1. Count two alleges that the defendants have perpetuated the racial and ethnic segregation that exists between Hartford and the surrounding suburban public school districts, and thus have discriminated against the plaintiffs and have failed to provide them with an equal opportunity to a free public education as required by article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1. Count three alleges that the defendants have failed to provide the plaintiffs with an equal opportunity to a free public education as required by article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1, because the defendants have maintained in Hartford a public school district that, by comparison with surrounding suburban public school districts: (1) is severely educationally disadvantaged; (2) fails to provide equal educational opportunities for Hartford schoolchildren; and (3) fails to provide a minimally adequate education for Hartford schoolchildren. Count four alleges that the defendants have failed to provide the plaintiffs with a substantially equal educational opportunity as required by Connecticut law, including General Statutes \u00a7 10-4a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to due process under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">The defendants not only denied the underlying factual and legal premises of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, but also raised seven special defenses. These defenses alleged that the defendants were not liable because of: (1) sovereign immunity; (2) stare decisis; (3) separation of powers; (4) the lack of a justiciable controversy; (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to join necessary parties, including the city of Hartford; (6) the absence of state action; and (7) the unavailability of court-ordered remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">The trial court initially denied the defendants\u2019 motions to strike and for summary judgment that were premised on these special defenses. After an evidentiary hearing, however, the court ruled in favor of the defendants on their sixth special defense. Relying heavily on principles drawn from federal constitutional law, the court determined that the plaintiffs could not prevail without establishing that state action was the \u201cdirect and sufficient cause of the conditions\u201d alleged in their complaint, and concluded that they had failed to prove such causation. Finding no such state action, the court rendered judgment for the defendants without addressing the merits of the constitutional claims asserted by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Because of the importance of the novel and controversial questions of constitutional law raised in this litigation, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred to this court the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the judgment of the trial court. Noting that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had been pending since 1989, we held a special hearing, shortly after the appeal had been filed, to order supplementation of the trial record. We directed the parties to prepare a joint stipulation of all relevant undisputed facts and to assist the trial court in making findings of fact on matters upon which the parties could not agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our resolution of this appeal has proceeded on the basis of this supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>mented record, which the parties and the court promptly prepared in accordance with our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The stipulation of the parties and the trial court\u2019s findings establish the following relevant facts. Statewide, in the 1991-92 school year, children from minority groups constituted 25.7 percent of the public school population. In the Hartford public school system in that same period, 92.4 percent of the students were members of minority groups, including, predominantly, students who were either African-American or Latino.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Fourteen of Hartford\u2019s twenty-five elementary schools had a white student enrollment of less than 2 percent. The Hartford public school system currently enrolls the highest percentage of minority students in the state. In the future, if current conditions continue, the percentage of minority students in the Hartford public school system is likely to increase rather than decrease. Since 1980, the percentage of African-Americans in the Hartford student population has decreased, while the percentage of Latinos has increased. Although enrollment of African-American students in the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns has increased by more than 60 percent from 1980 to 1992, only seven of these school districts had a minority student enrollment in excess of 10 percent in 1992. Because of the negative consequences of racial and ethnic isolation, a more integrated public school system would likely be beneficial to all schoolchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">A majority of the children who constitute the public school population in Hartford come from homes that are economically disadvantaged, that are headed by a single parent and in which a language other than English is spoken. The percentage of Hartford schoolchildren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>at the elementary level who return to the same school that they attended the previous year is the lowest such percentage in the state. Such socioeconomic factors impair a child\u2019s orientation toward and skill in learning and adversely affect a child\u2019s performance on standardized tests. The gap in the socioeconomic status between Hartford schoolchildren and schoolchildren from the surrounding twenty-one suburban towns has been increasing. The performance of Hartford schoolchildren on standardized tests falls significantly below that of schoolchildren from the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Directly or indirectly, the state has always controlled public elementary and secondary education in Connecticut. The legislature directs many aspects of local school programs, including courses of study and curricula, standardized testing, bilingual education, graduation requirements and school attendance. Since 1941, as a result of a state statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 10-240;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the public school district boundaries in Hartford have been coterminous with the boundaries of the city of Hartford. Since at least 1909, as a result of another state statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 10-184;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> schoolchildren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>have been assigned.to the public school district in which they reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The legislature provides substantial support to communities throughout the state to finance public school operations. State financial aid is distributed so that the neediest school districts receive the most aid. Accordingly, in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years, overall per pupil state expenditures in Hartford exceeded the average amount spent per pupil in the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns. The state reimburses Hartford for its school renovation projects at a rate that is considerably higher than the reimbursement rate for the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The state has not intentionally segregated racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. Except for a brief period in 1868, no students in Connecticut have intentionally been assigned to a public school or to a public school district on the basis of race or ethnicity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There has never been any other manifestation of de jure segregation either at the state or the local level. In addition to various civil rights initiatives undertaken by the legislature from 1905 to 1961 to combat racial discrimination, the state board of education was reorganized, during the 1980s, to concentrate on the needs of urban schoolchildren and to promote diversity in the public schools. Since 1970, the state has supported and encouraged voluntary plans for increasing, interdistrict diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The state has nonetheless played a significant role in the present concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>intended to improve the quality of education and not racially or ethnically motivated, the districting statute that the legislature enacted in 1909, now codified at \u00a7 10-240,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is the <em>single most important factor </em>contributing to the present concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. The districting statute and the resultant school district boundaries have remained virtually unchanged since 1909. The districting statute is of critical importance because it establishes town boundaries as the dividing line between all school districts in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Nonetheless, according to the findings of the trial court, poverty, and not race or ethnicity, is the principal causal factor in the lower educational achievement of Hartford students. The court also found that the Hartford public school system provides its students with a minimally adequate education under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1, because, regardless of the comparative levels of achievement between Hartford students and students from the twenty-one suburban towns, the education provided to Hartford students gives them a chance to lead successful lives. It further found that the Hartford public school system provides its students with an equal educational opportunity because they receive resources, educational programs and curricula similar to those received by students in other communities in the state. It then found that school district lines would have to be redrawn in order to remedy effectively the severe racial, ethnic and socioeconomic isolation that exists in the Hartford public school system. In addition to these findings addressed to the plaintiffs\u2019 specific legal claims, the court also found that any form of mandatory intervention would have to rely on coercive measures that would not assure educationally desirable outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal challenges the validity of many of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and all of its conclusions of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendants ask us to affirm the judgment of the trial court, by reversing its conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is justiciable or by upholding its conclusion that the complaint is barred by an absence of the requisite state action. If we reject these affirmative defenses, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to establish their claims of law in light of the findings of the trial court. We are unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses and, on the merits, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The defendants renew two affirmative defenses that they raised at trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They argue that the text of article eighth, \u00a7 1, deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to consider whether the plaintiffs are entitled to relief by way of an order to the legislature to provide a remedy for their impaired educational opportunities. They also argue that, even if the trial court had jurisdiction, the plaintiffs cannot recover because they have not alleged that their educational impairment results from intentional state misconduct. We are not persuaded by either of these affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The defendants maintain that the trial court should have dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are nonjusticiable. Granting the plaintiffs the relief they seek would, according to the defendants, require this court to respond to a political question that our constitution has expressly and exclusively entrusted to the legislature. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Existing precedents descxibe the uneasy line that distinguishes between cases that are justiciable and cases that are not. Because of the doctrine of separation of powers, courts do not have jurisdiction to decide cases that involve matters that textually have been resexved to the legislature, such as the implementation of a constitutional spending cap; <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Conn. 1, 9-10, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996); or the appointment of additional judges. <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 683, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984); see also <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Kezer, </em>232 Conn. 65, 74, 652 A.2d 1013 (1995). In the absence of such a textual reservation, however, it is the role and the duty of the judiciary to determine whether the legislature has fulfilled its affirmative obligations within constitutional principles. <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>13 Conn. 119, 132 (1839); see <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 344, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 2557 (1985); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 625, 649-50, 376 A.2d 359 (1977) <em>(Horton I); Preveslin </em>v. <em>Derby &amp; Ansonia Developing Co., </em>112 Conn. 129, 145, 151 A. 518 (1930). \u201cDeciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>preter of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 211, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962); <em>see Massameno v. Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 552, 663 A.2d 317 (1995); <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Kezer, </em>supra, 74-75; see also L. Henkin, \u201cIs There a \u2018Political Question\u2019 Doctrine?,\u201d 85 Yale L.J. 597, 599-600 (1976); M. Redish, \u201cJudicial Review and the \u2018Political Question,\u2019\u201d 79 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1031, 1051-60 (1984-85).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In the context of judicial enforcement of the right to a substantially equal educational opportunity arising under article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, justiciability is not a matter of first impression for this court. In <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 615, and <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>195 Conn. 24, 486 A.2d 1099 (1985) <em>(Horton III),</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we reviewed, in plenary fashion,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the actions taken by the legislature to fulfill its constitutional obligation to public elementary and secondary schoolchildren. Judicial authority to render these decisions was expressly reaffirmed in <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 9-10, and in <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The defendants do not challenge the continued validity of <em>Horton I </em>and <em>Horton III, </em>but argue that their claim of nonjusticiability differs. That argument is unavailing. The plaintiff schoolchildren in the present case invoke the same constitutional provisions to challenge the constitutionality of state action that the plaintiff school<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>children invoked in <em>Horton I </em>and <em>Horton III. </em>The text of article eighth, \u00a7 1, has not changed. Furthermore, although prudential cautions may shed light on the proper definition of constitutional rights and remedies; see <em>Fonfara </em>v. <em>Reapportionment Commission, </em>222 Conn. 166, 184-85, 610 A.2d 153 (1992); such cautions do not deprive a court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">In light of these precedents, we are persuaded that the phrase \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d in article eighth, \u00a7 1, does not deprive the courts of the authority to determine what is \u201cappropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Just as the legislature has a constitutional duty to fulfill its affirmative obligation to the children who attend the state\u2019s public elementary and secondary schools, so the judiciary has a constitutional duty to review whether the legislature has fulfilled its obligation,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Considerations of justiciability must be balanced against the principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of subject matter jurisdiction. See, <em>e.g., Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>233 Conn. 153, 163, 659 A.2d 138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>(1995); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 614, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Tolly </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Resources, </em>225 Conn. 13, 29, 621 A.2d 719 (1993); see also <em>United States Dept. of Commerce </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>503 U.S. 442, 459, 112 S. Ct. 1415, 118 L. Ed. 2d 87 (1992). In this case, our precedents compel the conclusion that the balance must be struck in favor of the justiciability of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The defendants maintain that even if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are justiciable, the plaintiffs are not entitled to judicial relief because the educational disparities of which they complain do not result from the requisite state action. The plaintiffs claim that the state bears responsibility to correct the constitutional violations alleged in their complaint because of the state\u2019s failure to \u201ctake corrective measures to [e]nsure that its Hartford public schoolchildren receive an equal educational opportunity.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That failure is actionable, according to the plaintiffs, because of the state\u2019s knowledge of the racial and ethnic isolation in the Hartford schools, combined with the state\u2019s extensive involvement in the operations of Connecticut\u2019s public schools and the impact of state statutes mandating school attendance within statutorily defined school districts. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-184 and 10-240.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendants maintain, to the contrary, that the state\u2019s constitutional duty to provide for the elementary and secondary education of Connecticut schoolchildren is triggered only by state action that is alleged to be intentional state misconduct. The trial court relied on the absence of such intentional state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>action in denying relief to the plaintiffs. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The defendants\u2019 argument, derived largely from principles of federal constitutional law, founders on the fact that article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, impose on the legislature an <em>affirmative </em>constitutional obligation to provide schoolchildren throughout the state with a substantially equal educational opportunity. <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 648-49. It follows that, if the legislature fails, for whatever reason, to take action to remedy substantial inequalities in the educational opportunities that such children are being afforded, its actions and its omissions constitute state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The affirmative constitutional obligation that we recognized in <em>Horton I </em>and <em>Horton III, </em>and reaffirmed recently in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>233 Conn. 557, 595-96, 660 A.2d 742 (1995), was not premised on a showing that the legislature had played an active role in <em>creating </em>the inequalities that the constitution requires it to redress. In <em>Horton I, </em>we determined that the state\u2019s educational financing scheme was unconstitutional even though it was facially nondiscriminatory and even though the disparities resulting therefrom had not been created intentionally by the legislature. These constitutionally unacceptable disparities developed, instead, \u201cfrom the circumstance that over the years there [had] arisen a great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education,\u201d and from the legislature\u2019s failure to consider \u201cthe financial capability of [each] municipality . . . .\u201d <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 648. In declaring this statutory scheme unconstitutional in <em>Horton I, </em>and in requiring further remedial action in <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 38, 43-44, we necessarily determined that the state\u2019s failure adequately to address school funding inequalities constituted the state action that is the constitutional prerequisite for affording judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The claims now before us likewise implicate the legislature\u2019s affirmative constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity to all of the state\u2019s schoolchildren. The plaintiffs document the existence of an extensive statutory system developed in response to the legislature\u2019s plenary authority over state public elementary and secondary schools.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As a general matter, the plaintiffs challenge the failure of the legislature to address continuing unconstitutional inequities resulting, de facto, from that scheme. In addition, and more specifically, they point to two statutes that directly impact on their claims of constitutional deprivation. State law sets the borders of school districts to coincide with town boundaries; General Statutes \u00a7 10-240;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and requires all children to attend public school within the district in which they reside. General Statutes \u00a7 10-184.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The trial court expressly found that the enforcement of these statutes constitutes the \u201csingle most important factor\u201d creating the present racial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ethnic imbalance in the Hartford public school system.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The failure adequately to address the racial and ethnic disparities that exist among the state\u2019s public school districts is not different in kind from the legislature\u2019s failure adequately to address the \u201cgreat disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education\u201d that made the statutory scheme at issue in <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 648, unconstitutional in its application.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendants maintain, however, that the logic of this inference is undermined by certain other precedents of this court. The defendants rely particularly on <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>214 Conn. 256, 571 A.2d 696 (1990), in which we concluded that the state\u2019s failure to provide emergency housing to recipients of federal welfare benefits did not constitute state action. Although we recognized that the absence of emergency housing might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>have a deleterious impact on the opportunity of children to attend school, we held that this secondary effect was not a sufficient basis for imposing constitutional liability upon the state. See id., 286-87. <em>Savage, </em>however, sheds no light on the state action requirement in this case because, as we explained in <em>Savage; </em>see id., 284-86; the state has no affirmative constitutional obligation to provide emergency housing, while it does have an affirmative constitutional obligation with respect to public elementary and secondary education.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The defendants also invoke two cases in which this court declined to find state action because the pertinent actors were <em>private parties </em>rather than the <em>state itself. </em>In <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Killian, </em>172 Conn. 496, 504-505, 375 A.2d 998 (1977), we concluded that private discrimination by the testator of a scholarship fund who had restricted its beneficiaries on the basis of religion did not constitute state action. In <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 64-66, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984), we concluded that the governmental regulation and public use of a private shopping mall did not transform the mall owners\u2019 refusal to allow political speech within the mall into state action. Although this aspect of the state action doctrine arguably is related to the question before us; see <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>513 U.S. 374, 378-79, 115 S. Ct. 961, 130 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1995); it cannot be controlling in a case in which action or inaction by the state is directly implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In addition to these state cases, the defendants urge us to follow federal precedents that concededly require, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that claimants seeking judicial relief for educational disparities pursuant to the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution must prove intentional governmental discrimination against a suspect class. See, e.g., <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Pitts, </em>503 U.S. 467, 494, 112 S. Ct. 1430, 118 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1992) (\u201c[o]nce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors\u201d); <em>Pasadena City Board of Education </em>v. <em>Spangler, </em>427 U.S. 424, 434, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 49 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1976) (United States constitution is not violated in absence of segregative efforts by state); <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>418 U.S. 717, 746-47, 747 n.22, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (1974) (\u201c[t]he suggestion . . . that schools which have a majority of [African-American] students are not \u2018desegregated\u2019 . . . however neutrally the district lines have been drawn and administered, finds no support in our prior cases\u201d); cf. <em>Arlington Heights </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 264-65, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976). According to the defendants, because the plaintiffs raise claims of unconstitutional disparities in educational opportunities on the basis of severe racial and ethnic imbalances among school districts, the plaintiffs, too, must prove intentional state action.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">For two reasons, we are not persuaded that we should adopt these precedents as a matter of state constitutional law. First and foremost, the federal cases start from the premise that there is no right to education under the United States constitution. <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 35, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973). Our Connecticut constitution, by contrast, contains a fundamental right to education and a corresponding affirmative state obligation to implement and maintain that right. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 595-96; <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Education, 229 Conn. 1, 6, 639 A.2d 502 (1994); <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 645. Second, the federal cases are guided by principles of federalism as \u201ca foremost consideration in interpreting any of the pertinent constitutional provisions under which [a court] examines state action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 44; see generally L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 18-2, p. 1691. As the United States Supreme Court noted, \u201cit would be difficult to imagine a case having a greater potential impact on our federal system than the one now before us, in which we are urged to abrogate systems of financing public education presently in existence in virtually every State.\u201d <em>San Antonio Independent School District </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 44. Principles of federalism, however, do not restrict <em>our </em>constitutional authority to enforce the constitutional mandates contained in article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Federal constitutional law, furthermore, has not invariably required intentional state action as a requisite foundation for constitutional remedies. In cases involving the fundamental right to vote, the United States Supreme Court has held state action to be implicated by the legislature\u2019s failure to take the proper steps to implement its affirmative constitutional duty. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 561-63, 568, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964); see also <em>Board of Estimate </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>489 U.S. 688, 692-93, 109 S. Ct. 1433, 103 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1989); <em>Tashjian </em>v. <em>Republican Party of Connecticut, </em>479 U.S. 208, 227, 107 S. Ct. 544, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1986); <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Mundt, </em>403 U.S. 182, 185-86, 91 S. Ct. 1904, 29 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1971); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ogilvie, </em>394 U.S. 814, 818, 89 S. Ct. 1493, 23 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1969); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Classic, </em>313 U.S. 299, 318-19, 61 S. Ct. 1031, 85 L. Ed. 1368 (1941).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We can perceive no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>principled distinction between judicial intervention to require legislative action to protect the fundamental right to vote and judicial intervention to require legislative action to protect the fundamental right to a substantially equal educational opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In summary, under our law, which imposes an affirmative constitutional obligation on the legislature to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity for all public schoolchildren, the state action doctrine is not a defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of constitutional deprivation. The state had ample notice of ongoing trends toward racial and ethnic isolation in its public schools, and indeed undertook a number of laudable remedial efforts<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that unfortunately have not achieved their desired end. The fact that the legislature did not affirmatively create or intend to create the conditions that have led to the racial and ethnic isolation in the Hartford public school system does not, in and of itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>relieve the defendants of their affirmative obligation to provide the plaintiffs with a more effective remedy for their constitutional grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We turn now to the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. No statute, no common law precedent, no federal constitutional principle provides this state\u2019s schoolchildren with a right to a public education that is not burdened by de facto racial and ethnic segregation. The plaintiffs make no such claim. The issue that they raise is whether they have stated a case for relief under our state constitution, which was amended in 1965 to provide both a right to a free public elementary and secondary education; Conn. Const., art. VIII, \u00a7 1; and a right to protection from segregation. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 20. This issue raises questions that are difficult; the answers that we give are controversial. We are, however, persuaded that a fair reading of the text and the history of these amendments demonstrates a deep and abiding constitutional commitment to a public school system that, in fact and in law, provides Connecticut schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. A significant component of that substantially equal educational opportunity is access to a public school education that is not substantially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Our analysis of this issue has three parts. First, what are the constituent elements of the affirmative constitutional mandate to provide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity in the context of alleged racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities? Second, does the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint encompass these elements? Third, have the plaintiffs proven their claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Since <em>Horton I, </em>it is common ground that the state has an affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 648-49; see also <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>234 Conn. 455, 461-62, 662 A.2d 1226 (1995); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 699, 707-708, 638 A.2d 589 (1994); <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 34-35. Any infringement of that right must be strictly scrutinized. <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The issue presented by this case is whether the state has fully satisfied its affirmative constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity if the state demonstrates that it has substantially equalized school funding and resources. The defendants urge us to adopt such a limited construction of our constitution. The plaintiffs, to the contrary, urge us to adopt a broader formulation. They argue that the combination of \u201cracial segregation, the concentration of poor children in the schools, and disparities in educational resources . . . deprive [Hartford schoolchildren] of substantially equal educational opportunities.\u201d We agree with the plaintiffs in part. We need not decide, in this case, the extent to which substantial socioeconomic disparities or disparities in educational resources would themselves be sufficient to require the state to intervene in order to equalize educational opportunities. For the purposes of the present litigation, we decide only that the scope of the constitutional obligation expressly imposed on the state by article eighth, \u00a7 1, is informed by the constitutional prohibition against segregation contained in article first, \u00a7 20. Reading these constitutional provisions conjointly, we conclude that the existence of extreme racial and ethnic isolation in the public school system deprives schoolchildren of a substantially equal educational opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>nity and requires the state to take further remedial measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Two factors persuade us that it is appropriate to undertake a conjoint reading of these provisions of our state constitution. One is the special nature of the affirmative constitutional right embodied in article eighth, \u00a7 1. The other is the explicit prohibition of segregation contained in article first, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The affirmative constitutional obligation of the state to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity, which is embodied in article eighth, \u00a7 1, differs in kind from most constitutional obligations. Organic documents only rarely contain provisions that explicitly require the state to act rather than to refrain from acting. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 557. As we observed, however, in <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 645, \u201ceducational equalization cases are \u2018in significant aspects sui generis\u2019 and not subject to analysis by accepted conventional tests or the application of mechanical standards. The wealth discrimination found among school districts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class suffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute.\u201d See also <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 35. Nothing in the description of the relevant legal landscape in any of our cases suggests that the constitutional right that we articulated in <em>Horton I </em>was limited to school financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">For Connecticut schoolchildren, the scope of the state\u2019s constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity is informed and amplified by the highly unusual<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> provision in article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>first, \u00a7 20, that prohibits segregation not only indirectly, by forbidding discrimination, but directly, by the use of the term \u201csegregation.\u201d The section provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law <em>nor be subjected to segregation </em>or discrimination . . . because of . . . race [or] . . . ancestry . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The express inclusion of the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, has independent constitutional significance. The addition of this term to the text of our equal protection clause distinguishes this case from others in which we have found a substantial equivalence between our equal protection clause and that contained in the United States constitution.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 8 n.15; <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 594 n.5, 560 A.2d 444 (1989); <em>Keogh </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 66, 444 A.2d 225 (1982). Fundamental principles of constitutional interpretation require that \u201c[e]ffect must be given to every part of and each word in our constitution . . . .\u201d <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Leopold, </em>141 Conn. 1, 21, 103 A.2d 818 (1954); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 386, 497 A.2d 408 (1985); <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>175 Conn. 586, 597-98, 402 A.2d 763 (1978), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>454 U.S. 958, 102 S. Ct. 496, 70 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1981). In other cases, we have held that, insofar as article first, \u00a7 20, differs textually from its federal counterpart, its judicial construction must reflect such a textual distinction. See <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 681, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>234 Conn. 217, 221 n.6, 661 A.2d 587 (1995) (per curiam); <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 513, 624 A.2d 876 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The issue before us, therefore, is what specific meaning to attach to the protection against segregation contained in article first, \u00a7 20, in a case in which that protection is invoked as part of the plaintiff schoolchildren\u2019s fundamental affirmative right to a substantially equal educational opportunity under article eighth, \u00a7 1. In concrete terms, this issue devolves into the question of whether the state has a constitutional duty to remedy the educational impairment that results from segregation in the Hartford public schools, even though the conditions of segregation that contribute to such impairment neither were caused nor are perpetuated by invidious intentional conduct on the part of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Linguistically, the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, which denotes \u201cseparation,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> is neutral about seg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>regative intent. The section prohibits segregation that occurs <em>\u201cbecause of </em>religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability\u201d; (emphasis added); without specifying the manner in which such a causal relationship must be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Whatever this language may portend in other contexts, we are persuaded that, in the context of public education, in which the state has an affirmative obligation to monitor and to equalize educational opportunity, the state\u2019s awareness of existing and increasing severe racial and ethnic isolation imposes upon the state the responsibility to remedy \u201csegregation . . . because of race [or] . . . ancestry . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We therefore hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that, textually, article eighth, \u00a7 1, as informed by article first, \u00a7 20, requires the legislature to take affirmative responsibility to remedy segregation in our public schools, regardless of whether that segregation has occurred de jure or de facto.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The history of the promulgation of article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7 20, supports our conclusion that these constitutional provisions include protection from de facto segregation, at least in public schools. That history includes not only the contemporaneous addition, in 1965, of these two provisions to our constitution, but also the strong commitment to ending discrimination and segregation that is evident in the remarks of the delegates to the 1965 constitutional convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">First, it is undisputed that the duty to provide a public education contained in article eighth, \u00a7 1, and the prohibition against segregation contained in article first, \u00a7 20, were proposed to and adopted by the voters of this state in response to the constitutional convention of 1965. When the convention delegates debated the desirability of both amendments to our state constitution, they recognized and endorsed the landmark decision in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), declaring the unconstitutionality of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d public school education. See 2 Proceedings of the Connecticut Constitutional Convention of 1965, p. 691, remarks of Chase G. Woodhouse.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The primary motivation for the addition of article eighth, \u00a7 1, to the constitution in 1965 appears to have been the realization that Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was the only state in the nation that did not provide any express right to public elementary and secondary education in its constitution. See 3 Proceedings, supra, pp. 1039-40, remarks of Simon J. Bernstein.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The delegates\u2019 expectation that the proposed amendments to the constitution would secure interrelated constitutional rights was underscored by Bernstein\u2019s remark that article first, \u00a7 20, was intended to be applied in the context of the \u201crights of freedom in education.\u201d 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Second, it is significant that the debate over the amendment of article first, \u00a7 20, manifested the intention of the convention delegates to extend broad protection to all persons from all forms of racial and ethnic discrimination and segregation. The debate over the express inclusion of the term \u201csegregation\u201d focused not on whether including such a term might reach too far, but rather on whether it might invite too narrow a construction of the prohibition against discrimination. It was for this reason that the rules committee felt that language regarding segregation was unnecessary. 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 692, remarks of Chief Justice Raymond E. Baldwin. The convention delegates\u2019 decision nonetheless to retain the term \u201csegregation\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>premised on the acknowledged importance of unequivocal opposition to all that is encompassed by this invidious philosophy and practice. See 2 Proceedings, supra, pp. 690-92, remarks <em>of </em>Chase G. Woodhouse and James J. Kennelly.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In effect, the convention delegates inserted into article first, \u00a7 20, constitutional language that was intended to prohibit not only discrimination, but also segregation on the basis of race or ethnicity.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Finally, the convention delegates\u2019 manifest intent that article first, \u00a7 20, by prohibiting segregation, should pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>vide \u201ctotal protection against discrimination\u201d; 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 692, remarks of James J. Kennedy; supports our conclusion that they intended to encompass de facto segregation in the circumstances presented by the present case. If significant racial and ethnic isolation continues to occur within the public schools, for which the legislature has an affirmative constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity, no special showing of an invidious segregative intent is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">It would be illogical not to prohibit all such segregation in light of the legislature\u2019s otherwise comprehensive assumption of responsibility for the education of Connecticut schoolchildren. The legislature has created the current school districts, has required students to attend school and has determined which students will attend a particular school district. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-184 and 10-240. The state cannot now avoid its responsibilities by invoking constitutional restraints articulated for different purposes under different constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Sound principles of public policy support our conclusion that the legislature\u2019s affirmative constitutional responsibility for the education of all public schoolchildren encompasses responsibility for segregation to which the legislature has contributed, even unintentionally. The parties agree, as the trial court expressly found, that racial and ethnic segregation is harmful, and that integration would likely have positive benefits for all children and for society as a whole. PYrther, as the trial court also expressly found, the racial and ethnic isolation of children in the Hartford schools is likely to worsen in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Racial and ethnic segregation has a pervasive and invidious impact on schools, whether the segregation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>results from intentional conduct or from unorchestrated demographic factors. \u201c[S]chools are an important socializing institution, imparting those shared values through which social order and stability are maintained.\u201d <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 222 n.20, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982). Schools bear central responsibility for \u201cinculcating [the] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system . . . .\u201d <em>Ambach </em>v. <em>Norwick, </em>441 U.S. 68, 77, 99 S. Ct. 1589, 60 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1979). When children attend racially and ethnically isolated schools, these \u201cshared values\u201d are jeopardized: \u201cIf children of different races and economic and social groups have no opportunity to know each other and to live together in school, they cannot be expected to gain the understanding and mutual respect necessary for the cohesion of our society.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Township of Morris School District, </em>58 N.J. 483, 498, 279 A.2d 619 (1971). \u201c[T]he elimination of racial isolation in the schools promotes the attainment of equal educational opportunity and is beneficial to all students, both black and white.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Nyquist, </em>318 F. Sup. 710, 714 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff'd without opinion, 402 U.S. 935, 91 S. Ct. 1618, 29 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1971). Our state constitution, as amended in 1965, imposes on the state an affirmative obligation to respond to such segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Having concluded that the provisions of article eighth, \u00a7 1, as informed by article first, \u00a7 20, permit a state constitutional challenge to substantial disparities in educational opportunities resulting from racially and ethnically segregated public schools, we turn now to an examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings to determine whether they fairly can be read to encompass such a challenge. Because the remedies sought by the plaintiffs in their complaint are not differentially tied to the vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ous substantive claims that they have alleged, the plaintiffs can succeed if any of their claims falls within the constitutional right as we have defined it. We are persuaded that the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings cross this threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In the first count of their complaint, the plaintiffs relied on article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1, for what they have characterized as a per se claim that they have suffered from unconstitutional segregation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In the second count, the plaintiffs alleged that disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of Hartford public schools as compared with schools in the surrounding school districts violated their constitutional rights under the same constitutional provisions.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> These two counts can reasonably be construed to state a constitutional claim of school segregation as we have defined it. Both counts allege a deprivation of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to a substantially equal educational opportunity expressly predicated upon the severe racial and ethnic isolation that exists in the Hartford public school system. The constitutional implications raised by these allegations were fully argued before the trial court, and were fully briefed by the parties before this court. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>these circumstances, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings, with respect to counts one and two, state a claim for the deprivation of a substantially equal educational opportunity. We would be remiss in the exercise of our constitutional obligation to provide \u201cremedy by due course of law . . . without . . . delay\u201d; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; if we were to deprive the plaintiffs of a remedy solely because, as a pleading matter, their claims were stated in two counts rather than combined in one.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In the third count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, they invoked article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1, for a different purpose. They alleged that the defendants have failed to provide schoolchildren in the Hartford public school system with the educational resources necessary to obtain a minimally adequate education. As pleaded in their complaint and as argued before the trial court, this claim was not expressly predicated upon the severe racial and ethnic isolation that exists in the Hartford public school system. Moreover, at oral argument, the plaintiffs conceded that they had never claimed, either at trial or in their appellate brief, that the opportunity to participate in a racially and ethnically diverse education is a constitutionally required component of a minimally adequate education. Accordingly, we conclude that the third count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not implicate the constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity as defined in part III A. Because, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 remedial claims do not depend upon the validity of the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>count of their complaint, we need not reach the merits of this claim.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The final issue before us is whether, in light of the findings of the trial court, some of which the plaintiffs deem erroneous, the plaintiffs have proven a violation of their fundamental right, under the state constitution, to a substantially equal educational opportunity that is free from substantial racial and ethnic isolation. We conclude that they have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201c[I]n Connecticut the right to education is so basic and fundamental that any infringement of that right must be strictly scrutinized.\u201d <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 646; <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 35. Proper evaluation of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims is best pursued in accordance with the methodology that we adopted and applied in <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 38-39. This methodology requires us to balance the legislature\u2019s affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all of the state\u2019s schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity against the legislature\u2019s recognized significant discretion in matters of public elementary and secondary education.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The analysis that we adopted in <em>Horton III </em>to scrutinize legislation that allegedly infringes upon the fundamental right to education requires a three-step process: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cFirst, the plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing that the disparities . . . are more than de minimis in that the disparities continue to jeopardize the plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental right to education. If they make that showing, the burden then shifts to the state to justify these disparities as incident to the advancement of a legitimate state policy. If the state\u2019s justification is acceptable, the state must further demonstrate that the continuing disparities are nevertheless not so great as to be unconstitutional.\u201d Id., 38; see also id., 45, 45 n.25. Applying the parties\u2019 stipulated facts and the trial court\u2019s factual findings to this analytical framework, we are persuaded that the current school assignment scheme, principally embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 10-184 and 10-240, violates the plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental right to a substantially equal educational opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The plaintiffs have shown, and the defendants do not contest, that the disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of public schools in Hartford and the surrounding communities are more than de minimis. While children from minority groups constituted 25.7 percent of the statewide public school population in the 1991-92 school year, 92.4 percent of the children in the Hartford public school system were members of minority groups, including, predominantly, students who were either African-American or Latino. The percentage of minority students enrolled in Hartford\u2019s public schools has since increased. In the 1994-95 school year, 94.5 percent of the children in the Hartford public school system were members of minority groups.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Moreover, the Hartford public school system currently enrolls the highest percentage of minority students in the state, and this per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>centage is likely to become even higher in the future, if current conditions continue. These disparities jeopardize the plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental right to education.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The defendants stress that the trial court also made extensive findings about the significant role that adverse socioeconomic conditions play in the difficulties encountered by Hartford schoolchildren. Although the findings of the trial court are supported by credible evidence, they do not undermine the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. It is well established, under prevailing principles governing the law of equal protection, that poverty is not a suspect classification. <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 130, 440 A.2d 848 (1981); see <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 323, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 65 L. Ed. 2d 784 (1980). The plaintiffs have not brought an equal protection claim challenging these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The trial court\u2019s findings simply demonstrate that Hartford\u2019s schoolchildren labor under a dual burden: their poverty <em>and </em>their racial and ethnic isolation. These findings regarding the causal relationship between the poverty suffered by Hartford schoolchildren and their poor academic performance cannot be read in isolation. They do not diminish the significance of the stipulations and undisputed findings that the Hartford public school system suffers from severe and increasing racial and ethnic isolation, that such isolation is harmful to students of all races, and that the districting statute codified at \u00a7 10-240 is the single most important factor contributing to the concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. The fact that, as pleaded, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not provide them a constitutional remedy for one of their afflictions, namely, their poverty, is not a ground for depriving them of a remedy for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The uncontested evidence of the severe racial and ethnic isolation of Hartford\u2019s schoolchildren demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>strates that the state has failed to fulfill its affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all of the state\u2019s schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. Much like the substantially unequal access to fiscal resources that we found constitutionally unacceptable in <em>Horton I, </em>the disparity in access to an unsegregated'educational environment in this case arises out of state action and inaction that, prima facie, violates the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, although that segregation has occurred de facto rather than de jure. Thus, because the plaintiffs have made the requisite prima facie showing that their fundamental right to a substantially equal educational opportunity has been jeopardized, the burden of justification shifts to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We next consider whether the defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that the disparities in the plaintiffs\u2019 educational opportunities are \u201cincident to the advancement of a legitimate state policy.\u201d <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 38. The defendants emphasize the uncontested fact that, although the state has created and maintained the public elementary and secondary school system, including the districting and the attendance statutes; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-184 and 10-240; the state bears no de jure responsibility for the racial and ethnic isolation that the plaintiffs have encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The statutes enacted by the legislature and the educational strategies adopted by the state demonstrate that the state has acted to further policies that are both legitimate and facially neutral with respect to racial and ethnic isolation. The General Assembly has enacted no legislation that was intended to cause either de jure or de facto segregation. It enacted the districting statute, not to impose or to foster racial or ethnic isolation, but to improve educational quality for all Connecticut schoolchildren by increasing state involvement in all aspects of public elementary and secondary education. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Moreover, the districting scheme presently furthers the legitimate nonracial interests of permitting considerable local control and accountability in educational matters. Furthermore, in recognition of its moral obligation to address the adverse consequences of racial and ethnic discrimination, the state reorganized the board of education, during the 1980s, to concentrate on the needs of urban schoolchildren and to promote diversity in the public schools. Under General Statutes \u00a7 10-226a et seq., which the legislature enacted to remedy racial imbalances <em>within </em>public school districts, all schools within a district must maintain, within specified tolerances, a student population that reflects the student population in the district as a whole. In addition, the state has supported and encouraged voluntary plans for increasing interdistrict diversity. It has provided financial support to interdistrict magnet programs and has enacted legislation to promote <em>voluntary </em>interdistrict solutions to racial and ethnic isolation. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-264a et seq. In all these respects, the state has furthered agendas that are legitimate. Accordingly, the defendants have sustained their initial burden of justifying the legitimacy of the state\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In light of the defendants\u2019 affirmative showing, we now consider the third part of the <em>Horton III </em>test. Once the state\u2019s justification for its official actions has been shown to be acceptable, \u201cthe state must further demonstrate that the continuing disparities are nevertheless not so great as to be unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 38. In the context of the present claims, the state must demonstrate that, in light of its recognized discretion in matters of public elementary and secondary education, and taking into account the measures that it has taken to remedy racial and ethnic disparities in the public schools, the disparities are not so significant as to rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation. In our assessment of whether the state has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>met its burden, we again emphasize that, much like the substantially unequal fiscal resources that we found constitutionally unacceptable in <em>Horton I </em>and <em>Horton III, </em>the disparity in access to an unsegregated educational environment in this case arises out of discrimination that is de facto rather than de jure.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We conclude that the defendants have failed to satisfy their difficult burden. Despite the initiatives undertaken by the defendants to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among school districts, and despite the fact that the defendants did not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the disparities that continue to burden the education of the plaintiffs infringe upon their fundamental state constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Our conclusion finds uncontested factual support in the stipulations of the parties, which provide dramatic documentation of the wide disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of the student populations in the public schools in Hartford and those in the twenty-one surrounding communities. Although we have discussed these statistics previously in this opinion, they bear repeating. The percentage of minorities who attend Hartford public schools is significantly higher than the percentage of minorities who attend schools in the surrounding school districts. In the 1991-92 school year, over 92 percent of the students in the Hartford public school system were members of minority groups. In stark contrast, in that same period, only seven of the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns had a student minority enrollment above 10 percent. We rely also on the findings made by the trial court, which have not been contested by any of the parties, that despite efforts by the state to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic isolation that exists in the Hartford public school system, \u201c[s]tudents in the Hartford schools are racially isolated <em>and are likely to become more isolated in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>future\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and that <em>\u201c[t]he single most important factor that contribute[s\\ to the present concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in Hartford </em>[is] <em>the town-school district system </em>[codified at \u00a7 10-240] which has existed since 1909, when the legislature consolidated most of the school districts in the state so that thereafter town boundaries became the dividing lines between all school districts in the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This record compels the conclusion that the present state regulation of public elementary and secondary education \u201cemasculate[s] the goal of substantial equality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Horton III, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 38. We conclude, therefore, that the school districting scheme, as codified at \u00a7\u00a7 10-184 and 10-240 and as enforced with regard to these plaintiffs, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">It is crucial for a democratic society to provide all of its schoolchildren with fair access to an unsegregated education. As the United States Supreme Court has eloquently observed, a sound education \u201cis the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 347 U.S. 493. \u201cThe American people have always regarded education and [the] acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance. . . . We have recognized the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a demo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>cratic system of government . . . and as the primary vehicle for transmitting the values on which our society rests. . . . And these historic perceptions of the public schools as inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system have been confirmed by the observations of social scientists. . . . [Education provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive hves to the benefit of us all. In sum, education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society. We cannot ignore the significant social costs borne by our Nation when select groups are denied the means to absorb the values and skills upon which our social order rests.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 457 U.S. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Although the constitutional basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims is the deprivation that they themselves are suffering, that deprivation potentially has an impact on \u201cthe entire state and its economy \u2014 not only on its social and cultural fabric, but on its material well-being, on its jobs, industry, and business. Economists and business leaders say that our state\u2019s economic well-being is dependent on more skilled workers, technically proficient workers, literate and well-educated citizens. And they point to the urban poor as an integral part of our future economic strength. . . . So it is not just that their future depends on the State, the state\u2019s future depends on them.\u201d <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>119 N.J. 287, 392, 575 A.2d 359 (1990). Finding a way to cross the racial and ethnic divide has never been more important than it is today.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Our decision to reverse the judgment of the trial court, and to direct that judgment be rendered on behalf of the plaintiffs on the merits of their constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>claims in the first and second counts of their complaint, requires us to consider what relief may properly be afforded to the plaintiffs. We recognize that the fashioning of appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief requires careful consideration in order to weigh the benefits and costs of various remedial measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In their appeal to this court, the plaintiffs have not focused their attention on the remedial consequences of a substantive decision in their behalf. Their prayer for relief asks us to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case with direction to render a declaratory judgment and \u201cfor further equitable relief not inconsistent with [our] decision.\u201d The defendants urge this court not to assume direct control of the educational system in Connecticut and to eschew \u201cacting as a super-legislature and glorified [b]oard of [education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Because the parties have not had the opportunity to present evidence directed to the remedial consequences that follow from our decision on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, we could remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings to address remedies. Alternatively, if no further evidentiary inquiries would be required, we could invite further briefing in this court and attempt to resolve the issues ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We have decided not to follow either of these avenues but to employ the methodology used in <em>Horton I. </em>In that case, the trial court, after having found for the plaintiffs, limited its judgment by granting only declaratory relief but retained jurisdiction to grant consequential relief, if needed, at some future time. <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 650. In light of the complexities of developing a legislative program that would respond to the constitutional deprivation that the plaintiffs had established, we concluded, in <em>Horton I, </em>that further judicial intervention should be stayed \u201cto afford the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>General Assembly an opportunity to take appropriate legislative action.\u201d Id., 653. Prudence and sensitivity to the constitutional authority of coordinate branches of government counsel the same caution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In staying our hand, we do not wish to be misunderstood about the urgency of finding an appropriate remedy for the plight of Hartford\u2019s public schoolchildren. Eveiy passing day denies these children their constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. Every passing day shortchanges these children in their ability to learn to contribute to their own well-being and to that of this state and nation. We direct the legislature and the executive branch to put the search for appropriate remedial measures at the top of their respective agendas. We are confident that with energy and good will, appropriate remedies can be found and implemented in time to make a difference before another generation of children suffers the consequences of a segregated public school education.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The defendants counsel us, however, to stay our hand entirely. They claim that no judicial mandate can properly take into account the daunting, if not intractable, difficulties of crafting a remedial solution to the problem of de facto racial and ethnic segregation in the public schools of Hartford. When a similar question was raised about judicial authority to mandate the reform of state electoral systems, the claim was given short shrift by the United States Supreme Court. The court stated, in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>supra, 377 U.S. 566: \u201cWe are told that the matter of apportioning representation in a state legislature is a complex and many-faceted one. We are advised that States can rationally consider factors other than population in apportioning legislative representation. We are admonished not to restrict the power of the States to impose differing views as to political philosophy on their citizens. We are cautioned about the dangers of entering into political thickets and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>mathematical quagmires. <em>Our answer is this: a denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection; our oath and our office require no less of us.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Our oath, our office and the constitutional rights of the schoolchildren of Hartford, require no less of us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render a declaratory judgment for the plaintiffs; the Superior Court is directed to retain jurisdiction in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In this opinion BERDON, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b19-10\"> The constitution of Connecticut, article eighth, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cThere shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state.

It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him [or her] for later professional training, and in helping him [or her] to adjust normally to his [or her] environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he [or she] is denied [an equal educational opportunity].\u201d Twenty-three years later, Justice Bogdanski, in his concurrence in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 654-55, 376 A.2d 359 (1977), reaffirmed that thought: \u201c[T]he right of our children to an education is a matter of right not only because our state constitution declares it as such, but because education is the very essence and foundation of a civilized culture: it is the cohesive element that binds the fabric of society together. In a real sense, it is as necessary to a civilized society as food and shelter are to an individual. It is our fundamental legacy to the youth of our state to enable them to acquire knowledge and possess the ability to reason: for it is the ability to reason that separates [men and women] from all other forms of life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Unlike the federal constitution, the constitution of Connecticut, article eighth, \u00a7 1, provides that <em>education is a fundamental right </em>of every child regardless of his or her race or ethnicity. Id., 648-49 (\u201cin Connecticut, elementary and secondary education is a fundamental right, [and] pupils in the public schools are entitled to the equal enjoyment of that right\u201d). Accordingly, it logically follows that the education guaranteed in the state constitution must be, at the very least, within the context of its contemporary meaning, an adequate education. Even Justice Loiselle, in his dissent in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 658-59, conceded that the provision of an adequate education was constitutionally required and, in discussing the need to interpret that requirement in a reasonable manner, stated \u201c[a] town may not herd children in an open field to hear lectures by illiterates.\u201d Indeed, long before <em>the formal </em>incorporation of this right into our present constitution, this court recognized the state\u2019s \u201cduty to provide for <em>the proper </em>education of the young.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel.

Indeed, the trial court found that \u201c[s]tudents in the Hartford schools are racially isolated and are likely to become more isolated in the future.\u201d In the 1987-88 academic year, 90.5 per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>cent of Hartford\u2019s schoolchildren were of minority races or ethnicities. Yet, Hartford, like many of Connecticut\u2019s urban centers, is encircled by school districts whose student populations include only a small percentage of minority children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s forecast that racial and ethnic isolation would increase has unfortunately proven to be accurate.

The United States Supreme Court recognized that segregation \u201cgenerates a feeling of inferiority [within the students] as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. . . . Segregation of white and [African-American] children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon [the African-American] children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the [African-American], A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>[African-American] children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 347 U.S. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In order to provide an adequate or \u201cproper\u201d education, our children must be educated in a nonsegregated environment. The trial court found, \u201c[education in its fullest sense for both white and minority school children involves interracial and multiethnic exposure to each other and interaction between them, because racial and ethnic isolation [have] negative effects on both groups.\u201d Indeed, a study commissioned by the state department of education in 1989, concluded that \u201cdesegregation has had some positive effect on the reading skills of black youngsters. . . . [T]here is some evidence that desegregation may help to break what can be thought of as a generational cycle of segregation and racial isolation.\u201d J. Schofield, \u201cReview of Research on School Desegregation\u2019s Impact on Elementary and Secondary School Students,\u201d Commissioned by the Connecticut Department of Education (1989) p. 35. The study further concluded that \u201cthere are indications that desegregated schooling can provide students with valuable behavioral experience which prepares them to function in a pluralistic society. . . . [T]here is some evidence that school desegregation may have long-term positive consequences on adult social relationships, housing patterns, and the like.\u201d Id., p. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The poor academic achievement of Hartford\u2019s students is insightful into the devastating effects of racial isolation on the students\u2019 education. For example, in 1991-92, 94 percent of the sixth graders in Hartford\u2019s public schools failed to meet the state\u2019s goal for mathematics; 80 percent failed to achieve the state\u2019s goal for reading; and 97 percent failed to obtain the state\u2019s goal for writing. Equally disturbing is the knowledge that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>in that same year, 62 percent of Hartford\u2019s sixth graders failed to achieve even the state\u2019s remedial standards for reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Scholastic achievement scores, are but one effect of segregation on education. Children of every race and ethnic background suffer when an educational system is administered on a segregated basis. Education entails not only the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, but today, in our multicultural world, it also includes the development of social understanding and racial tolerance. If the mission of education is to prepare our children to survive and succeed in today\u2019s world, then they must be taught how to live together as one people. Anything less will surely result in a segregated society with one racial and ethnic community pitted against another. Instead of fostering social division, we must build an integrated society, commencing with educating our children in a nonsegregated environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Accordingly, I conclude that, in addition to the state\u2019s failure to provide Hartford schoolchildren with a \u201csubstantially equal educational opportunity,\u201d these children are also being deprived of an adequate education because of their racial and ethnic isolation. It matters little with respect to the quality of the education that the segregation was unintentional. The fact that segregation exists as a result of the school districting statute requires the state to take remedial action to eliminate the constitutional violation of not providing these schoolchildren with an adequate education.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Time is precious, especially when we are confronted with a constitutional violation that impacts the lives of our children and the future of our society. Every day that goes by is one more day that the schoolchildren who reside in Hartford and other urban centers in Connecticut are deprived of an adequate education. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>plaintiff Milo Sheff was ten years old and in fourth grade when this litigation commenced more than seven years ago. We cannot recover what has been lost for him and others, but for those children who are presently enrolled in our public schools and for those who will enter in the future, we must eliminate the current segregation that exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">I agree, however, with the Chief Justice that the executive and legislative branches of the state government should be given an opportunity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to remedy what is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>a terrible wrong. <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Conn. 1, 17, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring). Nevertheless, in the words of United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren, the state must act \u201cwith all deliberate speed.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S.

In this case, as in <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Conn. 1, 13-14, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring), and <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 650-51, 376 A.2d 359 (1977), \u201cthe constitution directs the legislature to act in order to implement the respective constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 13-14. As this court, recognized in <em>Horton, </em>we have jurisdiction to compel the legislature to act in those situations in which it fails to carry out its constitutional mandate. \u201cWe have a constitutional obligation to keep the doors of this court open in order to enforce our laws. . . . We cannot excuse the legislature\u2019s default by merely labeling it a political question and thereby rendering the issue nonjustic.iable. Nor is it appropriate for us to conclude that the only remedy available to the people is at the polling booth by \u2018kicking the rascals out.\u2019 Our democracy depends in part on the willingness of the courts to enforce uniformly our constitutional law. We cannot be selective and choose to enforce some provisions, while turning our backs on others. Indeed, as Chief Justice Peters wrote in dissent, \u2018[w]hat-ever the reasons may be, legislative inaction does not, to my mind, relieve this court of its independent duty to vindicate the const ituUonal rights of those who appear before us. <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 695, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L.

The state did not deliberately establish a segregated school system. The state, however, chose to discharge its constitutional obligation of providing public education by establishing school districts according to town boundaries; General Statutes \u00a7 10-240; and by requiring schoolchildren to attend the public schools located within the district wherein they reside. General Statutes \u00a7 10-184. Moreover, the state is aware that such a statutory scheme is producing segregated school systems. Indeed, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he single most important factor that contributed to the present concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in Hartford was the town-school district system which has existed since 1909 . . . .\u201d Even in the face of federalism, legislative inaction amounts to state action. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 570, 84 S.

Ed. 2d 76 (1964) (\u201c[IJegisIative inaction coupled with the unavailability of any political or judicial remedy, had resulted, with the passage of years, in the perpetuated scheme becoming little more than an irrational anachronism\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\"> It is correct that at oral argument, as the Chief Justice notes, the plaintiffs acknowledged that their argument before the trial court did not focus on the claim that racial and ethnic segregation deprives schoolchildren of a constitutionally mandated adequate education. Paragraph three of the third count of the complaint, however, expressly alleges: \u201c[T]he State of Connecticut, by tolerating school districts sharply separated along racial, ethnic, and economic lines, has deprived the plaintiffs and other Hartford children of their rights to an equal educational opportunity, <em>and to a minimally adequate education.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Further, in that portion of the third count of the complaint captioned \u201cLegal Claims,\u201d the plaintiffs claim that the Hartford school district maintained by the state \u201cfails to provide a majority of Hartford schoolchildren with <em>a minimally adequate education </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Although the trial court found that the schoolchildren are receiving a minimally adequate education, I would conclude, on the basis of the entire record in this case, that that conclusion was clearly erroneous. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>court specifically found, and as I hereinafter set forth in this concurrence: \u201cEducation in its fullest sense for both white and minority school children involves interracial and multiethnic exposure to each other and interaction between them, because racial and ethnic isolation has negative effects on both groups.\u201d Furthermore, any finding that the children of Hartford are receiving an adequate academic education is belied by their test scores. But equally important, as I have indicated in this concurrence, education is more than what can be measured by mastery test results in reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">Whether viewed as a separate constitutional ground for requiring the state to remedy the present segregated educational system or as the product of the current segregation that deprives Hartford\u2019s schoolchildren of an equal educational opportunity, the impact of racial and ethnic segregation on the quality of education is an important factor to consider in deciding this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> \u201cIt is a duty not imposed by constitutional provision, but has always been assumed by the State; not only because the education of youth is a matter of great public utility, but also and chiefly because it is one of great public necessity for the protection and welfare of the State itself.

The majority has reached a result driven conclusion based on a theory of constitutional liability that was never presented to the trial court or to this court, is ungrounded in the text and history of Connecticut\u2019s constitutional provisions regarding the rights to public education and equal protection of the laws and is wholly at odds with the factual record in this case. The majority\u2019s conclusion, moreover, is contrary to the teaching of <em>Horton v.

In its zeal to reach a result that, it envisions, will eliminate racial and ethnic concentration in the public school districts of this state, the majority has \u201c[renounced] this Court\u2019s historical commitment to a conception of the judiciaiy as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 844, 111 S.

In essence, \u201c[p]ower, not reason, is the new currency of this Court\u2019s [state constitutional] decisionmaking.\u201d Id. I therefore dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">More specifically, in reaching a result that is unprecedented in American jurisprudence the majority has created a constitutional theory of equal educational opportunity that: (1) in the long history of this case, has never been presented to the trial court or to this court, and is, therefore, a theory to which the defendants have never had an opportunity to respond; (2) misapplies our precedent on the meaning of an equal educational opportunity as expressed in <em>Horton I, </em>and is contrary to the voluminous factual findings of the trial court; (3) distorts the meaning of the term \u201csegregation\u201d in our state constitution; and (4) misrepresents the record regarding the question of a remedy for the constitutional violation that the majority has found.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In addition, the majority sends to the legislature and the executive branch a mandate to fashion a remedy for de facto racial and ethnic concentration in our public schools, a task that those branches of government will inevitably find to be extraordinarily difficult or perhaps even impossible, because the majority articulates no principle upon which to structure such a remedy. The necessary implication of the majority\u2019s reasoning is that virtually every school district in the state is now either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>unconstitutional or constitutionally suspect. Without explicitly saying so, the majority has effectively struck down, not just for the greater Hartford area but for the entire state, the municipality based school system that has been in effect in this state since 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">It is significant, moreover, that the majority does not respond to the major substantive flaws in its analysis that this dissent identifies. Nor does it take issue with what I identify as the necessary implications of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Before analyzing the majority\u2019s reasoning and the constitutional claims that the plaintiffs did present in this case, I state the extent of my agreement with the majority. First, I agree that the case is justiciable, and that there is state action. Moreover, and most importantly, I agree with the majority on the desirability \u2014 as a matter of public and educational policy \u2014 of eliminating from our public schools the type of racial and ethnic concentration demonstrated by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">I also agree that racial and ethnic isolation in our public schools is harmful \u2014 both to those races and ethnic groups that are so isolated and to the other races and ethnic groups from whom they are isolated. I also agree with the majority\u2019s statement, based upon the trial court\u2019s finding, that the racial and ethnic isolation of Hartford\u2019s schoolchildren is likely to worsen in the future. I agree, furthermore, that racial and ethnic integration of our public schools would be beneficial for all children and society in general. These points of agreement rest on the notions that, as the majority recognizes, schools are important socializing institutions that bear a central responsibility for imparting our shared democratic values to our children, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the opportunity for children of different races, ethnic backgrounds, economic levels and social groups to get to know each other in school is important if they are to understand and respect each other. Finally, I agree with the majority that the health of the economy of our state requires an educated workforce, which includes \u201cthe urban poor as an integral part of our future economic strength.\u201d <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>119 N.J. 287, 392, 575 A.2d 359 (1990). Thus, I agree with the majority on the importance in our state \u2014 indeed, in our nation \u2014 of finding a way to cross the racial divide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The majority, however, has transformed a laudable educational philosophy into a constitutional mandate. That philosophy is that racially and ethnically integrated schools are socially and educationally preferable to racially and ethnically concentrated schools, because they confer certain significant social benefits on their students that such concentrated schools cannot, and they avoid certain significant social burdens that such concentrated schools are likely to impose. That belief, however, is utterly without basis as a constitutional claim of deprivation of an equal educational opportunity. Neither the record in this case, the text or history of the Connecticut constitution, nor our case law supports such a claim. A similar example of judicial overreaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>comes to mind. Ninety-one years ago the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 U.S. 45, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905), declared unconstitutional, as violative of the liberty of contract perceived to be implicit in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, New York\u2019s labor law imposing a daily limit of ten hours of work in the bakery industry. Justice Holmes dissented, stating that \u201c[t]he Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer\u2019s Social Statics,\u201d and that \u201ca constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez faire.\u201d Id., 75. This decision ushered into our constitutional jurisprudence what came to be known as the <em>\u201cLochner </em>era,\u201d during which the Supreme Court undertook to strike down legislation that did not comport with the particular economic theories held by a majority of the justices. See <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Tigard, </em>512 U.S. 374, 409, 114 S. Ct. 2309, 129 L. Ed. 2d 304 (1994) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (identifying the \u201csuperlegislative power the Court exercised during the <em>Lochner </em>era\u201d); 2 R. Rotunda &amp; J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1992) \u00a7 15.4, pp. 403-404 (\u201cindependent review of legislation during <em>[Lochner] </em>era resulted in unprincipled control of social and economic legislation\u201d); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The majority opinion in this case does much the same. Just as the justices of the United States Supreme Court <em>\u201cLochne\u00f1zed\u201d </em>the federal due process clause by reading laissez faire economic theory into it, the majority of this court has \u201cLoc/merized\u201d our education and equal protection clauses by reading into them an educational theory that mandates racially and ethnically integrated schools. There is no more basis today in our constitution for judicial intervention to impose such a manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tory educational theory than there was in the <em>Lochner </em>era for the judiciary to impose laissez faire economics.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Thus, the majority has used this court\u2019s power to interpret the constitution in order to mandate a vast and unprecedented social experiment, using the state\u2019s schools and schoolchildren as test data, and thereby to construct what the majority perceives to be the necessary bridge over the racial divide.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority has done so, however, without the bricks and mortar necessary to that construction \u2014 the facts, and sound constitutional principles. Indeed, had the factual findings by the trial court been those unsuccessfully sought by the plaintiffs, this case would have been very different on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>appeal. For example, had the trial court found, as the plaintiffs claimed, that racial and ethnic concentration, rather than poverty, results in different, educational outcomes and achievements, and that the measurements of those outcomes and achievements are valid for inter-district purposes, the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity, as they presented it, would have been powerful and might have legitimately prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">As this record overwhelmingly demonstrates, however, the trial court found the facts, not in accordance with the plaintiffs\u2019 version of the evidence on that claim, but in accordance with the defendants\u2019 version of the evidence. The trial court found that it is poverty, not racial or ethnic concentration, that accounts for the differences in educational outcomes and achievements between the children of the Hartford schools and those of the surrounding districts. The trial court also found, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 factual claims but in accordance with the defendants\u2019 factual claims, that the measurements regarding those differences, although valid for certain intradistrict purposes, are not valid for measuring educational differences between different school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Thus, there are no facts in the record to support what the majority asserts, in an opinion long on rhetoric and short on reasoning, are the \u201cdevastating effects that racial and ethnic isolation . . . have had on [the plaintiffs\u2019] education.\u201d Indeed, the facts found by the trial court contradict that assertion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the facts found by the trial court, all of the adverse effects on the educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tion of the plaintiffs result, not from their racial or ethnic isolation \u2014 either in whole or in part \u2014 but from their poverty. The majority, nonetheless, compensates for these factual shortcomings and for the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are squarely contrary to the result the majority seeks to achieve, by ignoring those discomforting facts, and constructing a hitherto unknown constitutional theory \u2014 hitherto unknown in the long history of this litigation, and hitherto unknown in our even longer state constitutional history \u2014 that disregards all facts but those that are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Thus, the majority opinion is, like the characters in Pirandello\u2019s play, a result in search of a rationale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This case was litigated in the trial court for six years. The trial court heard evidence for eleven weeks. After a remand by this court to the trial court for the purpose of supplementing the factual record, the parties stipulated to 256 facts that are undisputed. Moreover, pursuant to our remand, the parties presented to the trial court for resolution a total of 676 disputed issues of fact \u2014 551 by the plaintiffs and 125 by the defendants. With respect to these disputed issues of fact, the parties had presented extensive and conflicting evidence during the eleven weeks of trial. As a result, the trial court made 161 factual findings, in addition to the 256 stipulated facts. Those 417 factual findings constitute the factual basis for the constitutional claims advanced by the plaintiffs in the trial court and renewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Those findings, however, particularly the 161 facts found by the trial court that had been disputed, are critically and fundamentally adverse to the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, as those claims were presented both to the trial court and to this court. Precisely because of that critical and fundamental factual adversity, however, the majority has, in an exercise of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>revisionism, recast the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims so that the trial court\u2019s critical factual findings have become irrelevant. Moreover, the assertion of the majority to the contrary notwithstanding, it cannot be tenably maintained that the constitutional theory created by the majority was ever presented to the trial court or to this court. The defendants, therefore, have never had the opportunity to respond to that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">There is no question, therefore, that everyone involved in this case shares the same goal: the ehmination of racial and ethnic isolation in the public schools of this state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Every desirable or wise policy, even every noble goal, however, is not necessarily embodied in the constitution. The debate, therefore, is over whether that goal is constitutionally mandated under the facts of this case. The majority, by an act of judicial will, without fidelity to the facts of the case or the claims of the parties, has imposed a constitutional mandate and has usurped a policy function that legitimately belongs to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CLAIMS AS DISCLOSED BY THE RECORD IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The majority opinion<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conceals the constitutional claims presented by the plaintiffs and responded to by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the defendants in the trial court, and on appeal in this court. In addition, the majority has cobbled together, from disparate parts of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, a constitutional theory that is wholly without support in the text, history and purpose of the constitutional provisions at issue in this case, or in the facts as found by the trial court. In order to appreciate these criticisms of the majority opinion, it is necessary to summarize the plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity, as disclosed by this record rather than as expounded by the majority, and then to compare the majority\u2019s analysis to the record. Only then is it possible to subject the facts found by the trial court and the constitutional provisions at issue to a reasoned and dispassionate analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The plaintiffs presented three constitutional claims to the trial court: (1) the plaintiffs have been denied their constitutional right to an equal educational opportunity by virtue of their racial and ethnic concentration, and by the concentration of poverty in the Hartford school district, <em>coupled with certain disparities in educational resources and outcomes as compared to the suburban </em>districts; (2) the racial and ethnic concentration of the plaintiffs in the Hartford school district constitutes a per se violation of the education and equal protection clauses of the constitution, based solely on the undisputed demographic facts of that concentration; and (3) the inadequacy of certain educational resources in the Hartford school system constitute a denial to the plaintiffs of their constitutional right to a minimally adequate education.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">It is the plaintiffs\u2019 first claim \u2014 that of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity \u2014 (hat concerns us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>here, because that is the claim that the majority sustains on the basis of the undisputed demographic facts. It is indisputable, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity was based, not solely on the demographic facts of racial and ethnic isolation and concentration of poverty, but on those facts <em>coupled with </em>other facts claimed by the plaintiffs to demonstrate disparities, in terms of educational resources and outcomes, between the Hartford and suburban districts. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of the deprivation of an equal educational opportunity was premised on a factual showing that, <em>because of </em>\u2014 in <em>a cause and effect sense </em>\u2014 their <em>racial and ethnic isolation, the concentration of poverty in which they live, and the disparities between the educational resources available in the Hartford schools and those available in the suburban schools, the quality of their education, as measured by educational outcomes, is significantly less than that of their suburban neighbors. </em>Put another way, the plaintiffs undertook to persuade the trial court that, as a factual matter, all three of these factors \u2014 racial and ethnic isolation, concentration of poverty, and disparities in educational <em>resources </em>\u2014 have <em>caused </em>the quality of their education, as measured by the standards articulated by this court in <em>Horton I, </em>to be inferior to that of the surrounding suburban districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Thus, it was critical to the plaintiffs\u2019 equal educational opportunity claim that they prove the following facts: (1) they are racially and ethnically concentrated \u2014 an undisputed fact; (2) they suffer from the effects of a concentration of poverty \u2014 also undisputed; (3) the educational resources of the Hartford district are less than those of the surrounding districts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>- \u2014 a disputed fact; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and (4) the combination of the first three cause lesser educational outcomes in Hartford when compared to the suburban districts \u2014 also a disputed fact. One cannot read this record \u2014 both the trial court record and the appellate record \u2014 any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Thus, at a minimum, proof of lesser educational outcomes as a result of racial and ethnic isolation was essential to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, because their constitutional theory of deprivation of an equal educational opportunity is based on the provisions of article first, \u00a7 20, of the state constitution, regarding race and ethnicity. In other words, without either race or ethnicity, or both, as a causative factor in lesser educational outcomes, the plaintiffs\u2019 case under article first, \u00a7 20, would fall, because those are the two protected categories under that article that the plaintiffs invoke as the basis of their constitutional theory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, it was essential for the plaintiffs to establish in the trial court that their racial and ethnic isolation, either alone or in combination with the concentration of poverty, caused diminished educational outcomes relative to those of the surrounding communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">It is also clear that the plaintiffs, the defendants and the trial court considered these issues as questions of fact to be established by evidence \u2014 both documentary and by way of experts\u2019 opinions \u2014 and not questions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>law. It is equally clear that these <em>are </em>questions of fact and not of law. Moreover, the plaintiffs, the defendants and the trial court all understood that the plaintiffs were required to prove the existence of a diminished educational opportunity caused by the plaintiffs\u2019 racial and ethnic isolation, in addition to the more generalized benefits of an integrated educational system and burdens imposed by a racially and ethnically isolated system.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In other words, the plaintiffs never claimed that the general social benefits of racial and ethnic integration and the burdens of racial and ethnic concentration were sufficient to establish the factual foundation of their equal educational opportunity claim. The plaintiffs, the defendants and the trial court all understood that the plaintiffs were required, in order to come within the reasoning of <em>Horton I, </em>to establish the specific facts of diminished educational outcomes, relative to the suburban districts, as a result of their racial and ethnic and concentration. To corroborate this summary of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, I now turn to a discussion of the factual background of this appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims as Presented to the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The plaintiffs had presented their claims in a tripartite structure.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Before presenting their evidence, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tiffs made an opening oral argument to the court explaining their claims and relating those claims to the specific counts of their complaint. The plaintiffs specifically drew a sharp distinction between the first and second counts of their complaint. As they explained their case to the trial court, the first count depended solely on the legal claim that the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, of the state constitution encompassed de facto as well as de jure segregation, and that no evidence or facts regarding the effects of that segregation was necessary to prove the allegations of that count.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They explained that the second count was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>unlike the first count, based on a combination of facts: racial isolation; concentration of poverty; and inadequate educational resources; all combining to cause a quality of education inferior to that of the surrounding suburban districts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In the posttrial proceedings \u2014 both by way of their briefs and their oral arguments \u2014 the plaintiffs reiter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ated that their claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity was premised on a factual inquiry into the actual quality of the education provided to them, relative to that provided to the students of the suburban districts. They repeatedly emphasized that they had proven that their racial and ethnic isolation, coupled with their inadequate educational resources and their concentration of poverty, caused the quality of their education to be inferior to that provided to their suburban counterparts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In those proceedings, moreover, they repeatedly contrasted their equal educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tional opportunity claim with their claim that de facto segregation was per se unconstitutional, making clear that the per se segregation claim was not an equal educational opportunity claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The Remand Proceedings in the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Upon our remand, the parties entered into a stipulation of 256 facts. Each side also presented to the trial court those disputed facts that it claimed to have proven. From the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed factual findings, it is clear that they sought to persuade the court to find facts that supported their claim that the quality of the education provided the Hartford schoolchildren was inferior to that of the suburban districts, and that this inferiority was caused by their racial and ethnic isolation combined with the concentration of poverty in the district.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 proposed findings, by con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>trast, reflected their view that the evidence proved that it was the plaintiffs\u2019 poverty, and not their racial and ethnic concentration, that caused the educational deficiencies of which the plaintiffs complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The Findings of Fact Regarding Equal Educational Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Thereafter, the trial court issued its \u201cFinding,\u201d which constituted its factual determinations \u201con the disputed facts disclosed in the proposed findings of fact submitted by the parties . . . .\u201d These findings indicate that the trial court was persuaded by the defendants\u2019 factual claims, and not by the those of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Many of the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are directly pertinent to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity. The trial court found as follows. Historically, racial or ethnic minority group membership has been associated with being educationally disadvantaged because members of those groups have failed to succeed in schools at the same levels as most members of the majority group. The generally poorer academic performance of black and Hispanic youngsters is explained for the most part by the social and economic conditions under which they and their families live.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The court found further as follows: \u201cIt is poverty and not race that is a principal causal factor in lower educational achievement.\u201d The problems of the Hartford schools are compounded by the fact that minorities in the inner cities are disproportionately poor, and the \u201creal correlation with academic achievement is socioeconomic class rather than race . . . .\u201d The fact that the students come from poor families \u201cin and of itself is a significant problem in the schools. . . . The reason that children who live in poverty do not do well in statewide academic testing is because they are poor and disadvantaged and not because they are an ethnic or facial minority, because poor minority children exhibit the same patterns as those of their poor white counterparts, and poverty is the strongest predictor of poor academic achievement.\u201d Moreover, the concentration of poverty may adversely affect academic achievement over and above the effect of family poverty. The socioeconomic status of schoolchildren dictates their academic performance. Thus, the improvement in the socioeconomic status of blacks explains the reduction by almost one half of the achievement gap between black and white students nationally between 1970 and 1990. The trial court also specifically found that \u201c[v]irtually all of the differences in performance between Hartford students and those in other towns, as well as differences in college attendance, can be explained by differences in socioeconomic status and the background factors that socioeconomic status represents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The trial court also found that a higher concentration of students \u201cat risk\u201d may affect the achievement level of students in a particular school district. Thus, given two groups of students equal in all respects except the incidence of students with \u201cat risk\u201d factors such as low <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>birth weight and mothers on drugs at birth, the group with the higher incidence of those \u201cat risk\u201d factors will perform more poorly in school than the other group.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The trial court further found that the level of achievement that should be attained by the students in a particular district cannot be assessed without considering the conditions that exist in the district that hinder academic achievement. Examples of those conditions are: the \u201cmobility\u201d of the students, namely, the frequency of their moving from school to school during a school year or from one year to the next; limited English proficiency of certain students; and the students\u2019 socioeconomic status. The court found that, in order to understand the quality or effectiveness of a particular educational program, it is necessary to separate the disadvantages that students bring to school with them from the effects of the program itself. Moreover, it is necessaiy to separate the effects of poverty from the effects of racial isolation. Based on expert testimony, the court found that there are ways in which the separate effects of racial isolation and poverty can be measured statistically. The plaintiffs\u2019 experts did not employ these statistical techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The trial court also made certain findings regarding the state mastery test scores. The court found that the scores serve two purposes: (1) to inform districts so that they can improve their programs, correct deficiencies and plan for the future; and (2) to provide a basis for funding to districts that perform below remedial standards. This testing program was not designed for interdistrict comparison, but to provide information about individual students and programs within particular districts, and to trigger remedial services to students in need of them. Moreover, the trial court found, it would be an abuse of the purposes of the testing program to use the scores as the basis for comparing the quality of the education between schools or school sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>terns. The test results should not be seen as primarily caused by racial isolation in the schools because the results could be related to many other factors. Thus, it is inappropriate to use the mastery test data as a basis for drawing conclusions about the quality of education in Hartford without taking into account the effects of other important variables, such as socioeconomic status, early environmental deprivations, and diminished motivation to succeed academically. Other variables that contribute to depressed test scores of Hartford schoolchildren that must be considered are the number of students with limited English proficiency and the extraordinary mobility of the student population.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The trial court also found that Hartford students and those in the surrounding towns are scoring at the level to be expected if the dramatic differences between them in poverty levels are taken into account. The disparity in test scores does not indicate that Hartford is doing an inadequate job of educating its students or that its schools are failing, because the test scores, based on the relevant socioeconomic factors, are at the approximate projected level when adjustments are made for those factors. Teachers and administrators have no control over where their students live or the conditions under which they live. They are not in a position to remedy the disadvantages that their students bring with them when they enter the educational system. Thus, the court found that there are no educational strategies or initiatives that can fully deal with the complex social issues that produce inequality of performance and undermine education, because hunger, parental neglect, crowded and substandard housing, and inadequate employment opportunities disproportionately attack minority children in our state and divert them from educational opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">This, then, is the factual record upon which this case was presented to and decided by the trial court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>upon which the appeal came to this court. I turn, next, to this appeal as presented to us by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Case as Presented to This Court on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">In their initial and reply briefs in this court, the plaintiffs made crystal clear that the three constitutional claims that they were presenting to us for our adjudication coincided perfectly with the three claims that they had presented to the trial court. For ease of reference, and more importantly for fidelity to the plaintiffs\u2019 own understanding and characterization of their claims, I refer to the three claims as: (1) an equal educational opportunity; (2) per se segregation; and (3) a minimally adequate education. The plaintiffs\u2019 briefs make equally clear that the first and third of these claims, namely, an equal educational opportunity and a minimally adequate education, are based on <em>factual </em>claims regarding, not only the undisputed facts of the degree of racial and ethnic concentration in the Hartford schools but, critically and essentially, the plaintiffs\u2019 version of the disputed facts regarding the differences in educational outcomes and achievements in the Hartford schools relative to the surrounding suburban school districts, and the causes of those differences. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 equal educational opportunity claim is squarely based on a <em>combination </em>of factual matrixes: the facts that demonstrate the racial and ethnic isolation of the Hartford schools, <em>combined with </em>what the plaintiffs claim to have established in the trial court as the <em>educational deficiencies </em>that are <em>caused by that </em>isolation,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The plaintiffs set out the nature of their claims definitively at the very beginning of their appellate brief: \u201cHartford children attend schools that are the most racially, ethnically, and economically isolated in the state. <em>These schools have the least educational resources and suffer from the worst academic performance. The cumulative effects of these inequities deprive Hartford\u2019s children of the preparation necessary to join the mainstream of society.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">With this introduction in mind, I turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 own more detailed explication of their claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>as presented in their two briefs in this court. This explication is derived directly from, and is identical to, that claim as ultimately presented to the trial court for adjudication. The plaintiffs correctly point out that the right to an equal educational opportunity was recognized by this court in <em>Horton I. </em>The plaintiffs then accurately pose the question under this claim: \u201cAs a legal matter, this case falls squarely under <em>[Horton I],</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the question before this Court is whether the undisputed condition of racial and economic isolation of the public schools, <em>coupled with the undisputed and extreme disparities in educational resources afforded Hartford's schoolchildren, </em>violate plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to an equal educational opportunity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The plaintiffs then explain precisely why they maintain that their right to such an opportunity has been violated. Under the heading, \u201cThe Segregated, Economically Isolated <em>and Unequal Conditions in Hartford Metropolitan Area Public Schools </em>Violate Plaintiffs\u2019 Right to an Equal Educational Opportunity\u201d; (emphasis added); the plaintiffs, quoting from <em>Horton I, </em>state: \u201cEquality of educational opportunity is ascertained by comparing the quality of education provided in the school districts. In <em>Horton I, </em>this court identified criteria for measuring the quality of education, including: \u2018(a) size of classes; (b) training, experience and background of teaching staff; (c) materials, books and supplies; (d) school philosophy and objectives; (e) type of local control; (f) test scores as measured against ability; (g) degree of motivation and application of the students; (h) course offerings and extracurricular activities.\u2019 <em>Horton I, </em>[supra, 172 Conn. 634].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>With this legal, and appropriate, standard in place for the evaluation of a claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity, the plaintiffs then attempt to persuade us that, as demonstrated by the evidence presented in the trial court, they should prevail on this claim. They attempt to do so, however, not by relying on the general harms associated with a racially and ethnically isolated school system or on the general benefits of an integrated school system, but by arguing that the trial court\u2019s adverse factual findings were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In their reply brief in this court, the plaintiffs reinforce this understanding of the basis of their equal educational opportunity claim.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>that we not be confused about their claims, reiterated the three claims that they had presented in this case, and the doctrinal differences between them. \u201cFirst, plaintiffs claim that the extreme levels of racial segregation and the concentration of poor children in the Hartford schools, along with well-documented deficiencies and disparities in educational resources and reflected by the vast gulf in outcomes, violates plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental right to an equal educational opportunity. Second, plaintiffs claim that the extreme levels of racial segregation in the Hartford area constitute a per se violation of Connecticut\u2019s constitution. Third, plaintiffs claim that the conditions in the Hartford schools violate plaintiffs\u2019 right to a minimally adequate education, pursuant to Article Eighth, \u00a7 1 and plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">To summarize: the plaintiffs\u2019 first claim is their claim of a deprivation of equal educational opportunity as articulated in <em>Horton I. </em>As a factual matter, this claim rests on a complex factual matrix: the undisputed facts regarding the racial and ethnic concentration, and the concentration of poverty, in the Hartford district; the disputed facts regarding the claimed inadequate educational resources in the Hartford district; and the disputed causal effect of that combination of factors on the educational outcomes claimed to be prevalent in the Llartford district.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim is based entirely on the legal theory that the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u00a7 20, means de facto segregation. As a factual matter, this claim rests on only the undisputed facts regarding the racial and ethnic concentration in the Hartford schools, to the exclusion of the disputed facts regarding the claimed disparities between the educational resources and outcomes of the Hartford school district, on one hand, and the resources and outcomes of the suburban school districts, on the other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 third claim is their claim of a deprivation of a minimally adequate education under article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution as articulated in <em>Horton I. </em>This claim rests on disputed facts regarding certain claimed inadequacies in the Hartford school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Having summarized the plaintiffs\u2019 claims as disclosed by this voluminous record, I will next analyze the majority opinion in light of the record in this case. I turn, therefore, to that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN THE MAJORITY OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The Majority\u2019s Adjudicative Process</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The first flaw in the majority opinion involves the adjudicative process by which the opinion was created. As the record demonstrates, the constitutional theory conceived by the majority bears only a passing resemblance to the claims of the plaintiffs as disclosed by the record. The majority\u2019s theory is a combination of the legal theories presented in the plaintiffs\u2019 first and second claims, completely shorn of the facts that the trial court found after six years of litigation. The theory upon which the majority opinion is based, therefore, is brand new and was never advocated by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The majority asserts, nonetheless, that \u201c[t]he constitutional implications raised by these allegations were fully argued before the trial court, and were fully briefed by the parties before this court.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This is like saying that water is the same thing as hydrogen and oxygen because water is the result when the two gases are combined in a certain proportion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The majority\u2019s theory of alack of an equal educational opportunity is a hybrid of two disparate parts of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, as argued to and litigated in the trial court and as argued and briefed in this court. One part of the hybrid is the legal theory of the plaintiffs\u2019 first claim, namely, that under <em>Horton </em>/, they have been deprived of an equal educational opportunity, but <em>without </em>the factual matrix that the plaintiffs themselves presented to support that theory. The second part of the hybrid is the theory of the plaintiffs\u2019 second claim, namely, that \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, means de facto as well as de jure segregation when applied to education. That theory, however, does <em>'riot </em>constitute an equal educational opportunity claim, as understood and presented by the plaintiffs throughout this case, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>understood and responded to by the defendants throughout this case, and as briefed and argued in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Moreover, I confess that, having read the briefs carefully and having participated in the oral argument with great concentration, the majority\u2019s theory of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity was a complete surprise to me. I can only wonder about the reaction of the defendants, who for the past six years have been defending this case on the basis that the record demonstrates, rather than the basis on which the majority has decided the case. In fact, I suspect that even the plaintiffs are surprised that they have prevailed on a theory of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity that they did not present, and that renders wholly immaterial the entire factual matrix that they did present, appropriately albeit unsuccessfully, under that doctrine as articulated in <em>Horton I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The newness of the majority\u2019s constitutional theory is not only demonstrated by comparing the record to the majority opinion, it is demonstrated by certain language in the majority opinion itself. When the majority asks, at the beginning of its analysis, whether \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 complaint encompass[es] [the constituent elements of the affirmative constitutional mandate to provide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity]\u201d, it asks a question that no one else has ever asked us to answer, namely, whether the plaintiff's\u2019 complaint is legally sufficient.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In elaborating on that question, moreover, the majority\u2019s language is curiously but revealingly qualified: it refers to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim \u201cas we have defined it.\u201d This question and qualification are necessitated solely by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the fact that the majority\u2019s, rather than the plaintiffs\u2019, theory of the equal educational opportunity claim has now become dispositive, and that this theory was never in this case until the majority issued its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Although prior to trial the defendants challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, they lost that challenge and, except for the arguments regarding justiciability and state action, did not renew it on appeal. Moreover, at no time in this appeal was the question raised of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings stated a cognizable claim. At no time in this appeal was the question raised whether the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings could be read to support their constitutional challenge. The sole reason that these questions and these qualifications became necessary is that the majority has recast the essential nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, as presented by the plaintiffs at trial and on appeal, in order to fit the majority\u2019s predetermined outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">This method of adjudication is fundamentally flawed for several reasons that call into question the integrity of the majority decision. First, it is egregiously unfair to the defendants. Having defended this case for six years in the trial court, and having responded to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the legal and factual bases presented by the plaintiffs, the defendants have not had the opportunity to respond to the new theory of equal educational opportunity fashioned by the majority either by evidence or argument in the trial court, or by briefs and oral argument in this court. Indeed, we will all have to wonder what evidence or arguments the defendants would have produced in the trial court and this court had they known that this hybrid theory was the basis of the equal educational opportunity claim to which they were required to respond.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Second, the majority\u2019s treatment of the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings in this case turns our traditional treatment of pleadings on its head, and adds to the unfairness to the defendants. It is true that, under our modem jurisprudence, we read pleadings \u201cbroadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically. . . . <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Town Oil Co., </em>207 Conn. 575, 587-88, 542 A.2d 1124 (1988); <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 150-51, 487 A.2d 514 (1985). As long as the pleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or prejudice the opposing party, we will not conclude that the complaint is insufficient to allow recovery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 496, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The application of that principle cannot, however, save what the majority has done here. That principle generally applies before trial to the construction of a complaint when it is challenged for legal sufficiency; see, e.g., <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>202 Conn. 206, 220-21, 520 A.2d 217 (1987); during trial, to a determination of whether certain evidence should be admitted as within, or excluded as beyond, the fair boundaries of the complaint; see, e.g., <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>203 Conn. 554, 557-58, 525 A.2d 954 (1987); and posttrial, where the parties have in fact litigated the case in a posture that includes the challenged theory, and there has been no prejudice or surprise. See, e.g., <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 497-98. The principle does not apply in this case, however, where the majority has, after the trial and after appellate briefs and arguments, altered the theory of the complaint on which all of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>have relied, and then, without notice to anyone, has determined that the complaint supports the altered theory. That process violates the fundamental principle that \u201cthe pleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or prejudice the opposing party . . . .\u201d Id., 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The third flaw in the process by which the majority reached its decision is that, having decided to consider a new theory of the case, the court has not afforded the parties the opportunity to file supplemental briefs or to present further oral argument. In recent years, we have engaged in the practice of requesting supplemental briefs when, after oral argument, we have determined that the parties have not sufficiently addressed an issue or potentially dispositive theory of the case that surfaced either in the oral argument or in the process of our deliberations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 286-87 n.4, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (continued viability of constancy of accusation doctrine); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Best Cleaners, Inc., </em>235 Conn. 778, 784, 670 A.2d 294 (1996) (definition of disability under General Statutes \u00a7 31-349), superseded, 237 Conn. 490, 677 A.2d 1356 (1996); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>227 Conn. 124, 130, 629 A.2d 413 (1993) (appropriate standard in habeas proceeding by which to determine effect of prior failure to raise constitutional claim); <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 657, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992) (whether denial of motion to suppress can be sustained under abandonment doctrine). Indeed, we have reversed the Appellate Court for disposing of an appeal on the basis of a plain error analysis that neither party had raised, without first giving the parties the opportunity to brief the perceived plain error claim. See, e.g., <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Granby Holdings, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 95, 98-99, 644 A.2d 325 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">There are two reasons for this postargument appellate procedure: (1) fairness to the parties suggests that they be confronted with a potentially dispositive theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that they had not had the prior opportunity to discuss; and (2) we are more likely to be correct in our judgments if they follow adequate briefing. I acknowledge that we have not uniformly followed this procedure, and that there is no rule that requires that we do so. Indeed, there are cases in which, for various reasons, it is appropriate that we not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">This case, however, is the paradigm of when supplemental briefing and argument would have been appropriate. This case may be the most significant ruling of this court in this century. I can think of no other case decided by this court that will have more impact on the daily lives of our citizenry than this case. Having ordered supplemental briefing and argument in cases involving issues of the continued viability of an evidentiary doctrine, the proper construction of second injury fund terminology, preservation of an issue for habeas review and the relevance of abandonment to the reasonable expectation of privacy, we should have done so in this case, the enormous public importance of which demands the highest degree of both fairness to the parties and confidence in the correctness of the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The use of that prudent appellate procedure would have been particularly appropriate in this case. In a case in which we exercise the judicial power to interpret a statute or explicate the common law, if we are incorrect, the General Assembly is free to enact legislation correcting our error. In a case such as this, however, in which this court incorrectly interprets our constitution, the only remedy of the people is the painful process of constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Although, in my view, these flaws in the majority\u2019s process of decision-making seriously undermine the integrity of its opinion, the more fundamental question is whether, nonetheless, the reasoning of the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>opinion is sound. It is not. I turn next, therefore, to the substantive flaws in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Misapplication of <em>Horton I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The first substantive flaw in the majority opinion is that it misapplies the principal precedent upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 equal educational opportunity claim is based, namely, <em>Horton I. </em>It does so by disregarding the factual underpinning of <em>Horton </em>J, thereby rendering irrelevant the critical factual differences between this case and <em>Horton I. </em>Thus, the majority demonstrates its lack of fidelity to <em>Horton I </em>by severing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim from its jurisprudential roots and by shedding its essential factual underpinnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\"><em>In Horton I, </em>this court held that the education clause; article eighth, \u00a7 1; and the equal protection clauses; article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20; require \u201cthat the state provide a substantially equal educational opportunity to its youth in its free public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 649; see also <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>195 Conn. 24, 34-35, 486 A.2d 1099 (1985) <em>(Horton III) </em>(characterizing <em>Horton I </em>as resting on article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20). We also held that the system of funding public education then prevailing, under which each town raised its own funds for education via property taxes, supplemented by a flat grant from the state according to the average daily number of students attending school in the town; <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 628; violated that requirement. Id., 648-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">These conclusions rested on two sets of factual findings of the trial court in that case, which we determined were supported by the evidence. Id., 649. The first set of findings was that the existing system of school financing resulted in significant disparities between the amounts spent on education by property-rich towns and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>amounts spent by property-poor towns. Id., 633. The court stated: \u201c[T]he present system of financing education in Connecticut ensures that, regardless of the educational needs or wants of children, more educational dollars will be allotted to children who live in property-rich towns than to children who live in property-poor towns.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The second set of findings concerned the effect of these financial disparities on the children. That set of findings established that the per pupil spending disparities resulted in a lower quality of education in the property-poor towns than in the property-rich towns. Id. The court stated: \u201cThe criteria for evaluating the \u2018quality of education\u2019 in a town include the following: (a) size of classes; (b) training, experience and background of teaching staff; (c) materials, books and supplies; (d) school philosophy and objectives; (e) type of local control; <em>(f) </em>test scores as measured against ability; (g) degree of motivation and application of the students; (h) course offerings and extracurricular activities. In most cases, the optimal version of these criteria is achieved by higher per pupil operating expenditures, and because many of the elements of a quality education require higher per pupil operating expenditures, there is a direct relationship between per pupil school expenditures and the breadth and quality of educational programs.\u201d Id., 634-35.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> All of these factual assertions by this court were based on the factual findings of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>court in <em>Horton I, </em>findings that had been vigorously contested by the state.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The critical difference between <em>Horton I </em>and this case involves that second set of factual findings. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Horton I, </em>the trial court found that, because of \u2014 in a cause and effect sense \u2014 the disparities in educational funding between the property-poor towns and the property-rich towns, the quality of the educational opportunity available to students in the property-poor towns was not substantially equal to the quality of the educational opportunity available to students in the property-rich towns. Id., 637-38. In <em>Horton I, </em>the plaintiffs undertook to prove that factual assertion, the trial court found that they had proven it, and this court sustained the trial court\u2019s finding as supported by the evidence. Id., 648-49. Based on that finding, we concluded that the state\u2019s flat grant system of funding education violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. Id., 649-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 equal educational opportunity claim precisely parallels the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in <em>Horton I. </em>In this case, the plaintiffs claim that, because of \u2014 in a cause and effect sense \u2014 their racial and ethnic isolation, coupled with the concentration of poverty and lack of material resources in Hartford, the quality of the educational opportunity available to them, measured by the same standards articulated by this court in <em>Horton I, </em>was not substantially equal to the quality of educational opportunity available to their suburban counterparts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Put another way, the plaintiffs claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>their racial and ethnic isolation and the concentration of poverty in the city <em>causes </em>the quality of their education to be inferior, as measured by the <em>Horton I </em>standards, than that provided in the suburbs. As in <em>Horton </em>I, the plaintiffs undertook to prove that factual assertion in the trial court. Unlike <em>Horton I, </em>however, in this case, the plaintiffs failed to persuade the trial court of that factual assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In this case, the trial court found that, contrary to the factual assertions of the plaintiffs, it is poverty, and not race or ethnicity, that accounts for any discrepancies between the quality of education provided to the plaintiffs and the quality of education provided to their suburban counterparts. In addition, the trial court found that the principal standard of measure that the plaintiffs sought to use to demonstrate that difference in quality of education, the statewide mastery test scores, is not a valid tool for measuring interdistrict differences in the quality of education. As I indicate later in this dissent, the trial court\u2019s factual findings are fully supported by the evidence. Thus, the analogues in this case to the factual underpinnings that supported our conclusion in <em>Horton I </em>are not only missing here; the factual analogues in this case are squarely contrary to the conclusion reached by the majority.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Consequently, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Horton I </em>is unfounded. In <em>Horton I, </em>we did not conclude that the plaintiffs had been deprived of an equal educational opportunity solely because of the disparities in educational funding between property-poor and property-rich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>towns, unconnected to the educational effects of those disparities. The majority concludes, however, that the plaintiffs have been so deprived solely because of their racial and ethnic isolation. The majority reaches that conclusion, however, not only unconnected to but squarely contrary to those factual findings. Thus, the majority\u2019s analysis is contrary to the analysis that we employed in <em>Horton I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Indeed, the only attempt by the majority to link the facts of this case to <em>Horton I </em>occurs when the majority states: \u201cAs we observed, however, in <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 645, educational equalization cases are in significant aspects sui generis and not subject to analysis by accepted conventional tests or the application of mechanical standards. The wealth discrimination found among school districts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class suffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute. See also <em>Horton </em>III, supra, 195 Conn. 35. Nothing in the description of the relevant legal landscape in any of our cases suggests that the constitutional right that we articulated in <em>Horton I </em>was limited to school financing.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The first part of this brief analysis is nothing more than a truism. The second part merely sets up the proverbial straw man.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">No one disputes that educational equalization cases, whether based on claims of funding or race, are sui <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>generis. That truism is, however, the beginning of the inquiry, not the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Although the constitutional right articulated in <em>Horton I </em>may not have been limited to school financing, there was a factual basis in that case that is lacking here. Moreover, the argument that <em>Horton I </em>is limited to school financing is but one of several arguments offered by the defendants.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> They also argue that, assuming that <em>Horton I </em>is appropriately extended to race and ethnicity, the plaintiffs have failed to prove that they are deprived of an equal educational opportunity by reason of race or ethnicity because the factual findings of the trial court are to the contrary and are supported by the evidence. By pretending that the defendants\u2019 only response to the extension of <em>Horton I </em>to race and ethnicity is that <em>Horton I </em>is confined to financing, the majority dismantles the straw man, answering the easy question posed by this appeal and ignoring the difficult ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The Meaning of \u201cSegregation\u201d in Article First, \u00a7 20</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The next substantive flaw in the majority opinion is the meaning that the majority attributes to the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20. The majority somehow concludes that \u201csegregation\u201d means de facto, as well as de jure, segregation, on the basis of the text of article first, \u00a7 20, and the history in the 1965 constitutional convention of the adoption of article eighth, \u00a7 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and article first, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The text provides no support for the majority\u2019s conclusion, and the history of the 1965 convention squarely contradicts it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The Text of Article First, \u00a7 20</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 20, as amended by articles fifth and twenty-first of the amendments, provides: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that we are limited in constitutional adjudication by the text of the particular constitutional provision at issue. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>233 Conn. 557, 581, 660 A.2d 742 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 380-81, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 77-78, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984). That text does not support the majority\u2019s reading of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Critical to the majority\u2019s analysis is its conclusion that the phrase \u201cbecause of\u2019 and the term \u201csegregation\u201d do not require a showing of an intent by the state to segregate or discriminate when those terms are applied to the right to public education guaranteed under article eighth, \u00a7 1. Thus, the major, albeit unstated, premise of the majority opinion is that, although \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d may require a showing of an intent by the state to segregate when applied to all other \u201ccivil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>or political rights\u201d covered by article first, \u00a7 20, that same language does not require such an intent when applied to public education under article eighth, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It is true that the majority does not explicitly say that the terms, \u201csegregation\u201d and \u201cbecause of,\u201d do require a state intent to segregate when applied to other rights guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 20. Instead, the majority states: \u201cWhatever this language may portend in other contexts, we are persuaded that, in the context of public education, in which the state has an affirmative obligation to monitor and equalize educational opportunity, the state\u2019s awareness of existing and increasing severe racial and ethnic isolation imposes upon the state the responsibility to remedy \u2018segregation . . . because of race [or] . . . ancestry ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Despite the majority\u2019s futile attempt to avoid the necessary implications of its rationale, it is clear that one such necessary implication is that the language at issue either does or does not require a segregative intent when applied in other contexts. Thus, I can read this passage from the majority opinion in only two possible ways: (1) \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d do not require a state intent to segregate, irrespective of the particular legal context; or (2) \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d do require a state intent to segregate when applied to other legal contexts, but not when applied to public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The majority cannot mean that these terms do not require such an intent irrespective of the legal context. That would necessarily mean that, with respect to the exercise of all civil and political rights, the state would be required to take affirmative steps to assure that these rights are not exercised by racially or ethnically concentrated groups, regardless of any state intent to segregate. This would mean, in turn, that any electoral district that is religiously, racially or ethnically concentrated is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>unconstitutional and has been such since 1965, and that such was the intent of the delegates to that convention. It would also mean that presently existing public housing projects in Hartford and other cities whose tenants are racially or ethnically concentrated, not by design but as a result of demographic and economic factors over which the state has no control, are unconstitutional and have been such because the 1965 convention delegates meant them to be. It is not hyperbole to say that the delegates would be astonished to have such an intent attributed to them. Nor is it hyperbole to say that such an interpretation would be so bizarre and unworkable as to be ludicrous.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Although I disagree with the majority, I am not willing to attribute that meaning to it. It must be, therefore, that the majority means to say that, although segregative intent is required when \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d are applied to other civil and political rights, it is not required when applied to public education. This, of course also necessarily means that the same language has opposite meanings when applied to different rights \u2014 an interpretation that, in my view, is also utterly implausible. Under the majority\u2019s view, therefore, the phrase \u201cbecause of\u2019 and the term \u201csegregation\u201d have one meaning when applied to public elementary and secondary education, namely, that racial concentration need not be intentional on the part of the state, and the opposite meaning when applied to all other political and civil rights, namely, that racial concentration must be intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">This tortures the text of article first, \u00a7 20, and turns the process of constitutional adjudication upside down. I acknowledge that it is an accepted, necessary and appropriate part of the judicial process to stretch the meaning of language in order to render a statutory scheme constitutional. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 805, 640 A.2d 986 (1994); <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>Will</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>iam Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 692, 705, 553 A.2d 596 (1989). That does not justify, however, as the majority would have it, breaking constitutional language in two so that the same words in the same sentence have two opposite meanings when applied to different sets of rights, in order to render a statutory scheme unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In my view, this position is untenable. First, there is nothing in the language, history or purpose of article first, \u00a7 20, to support such a bizarre interpretation. We do not ordinarily read the same word or phrase in the same sentence to have opposite meanings depending on the subject matter to which the word or phrase is applied. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending </em>Co., 223 Conn. 336, 343, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 116, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991). There is no reason to do so here. Article first, \u00a7 20, was not drafted or approved by Lewis Carroll, whose character in Through the Looking-Glass, Humpty Dumpty, said, \u201cwhen I use a word ... it means just what I choose it to mean \u2014 neither more nor less.\u201d L. Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass (Messner Ed. 1982) p. 198. If the phrase \u201cbecause of\u2019 and the term \u201csegregation\u201d mean that there is no intent requirement in the context of public education, but that there is such a requirement in the context of all other political and civil rights, it is only because the majority, like Humpty Dumpty, says so.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Second, the majority\u2019s rationale for saying so in this instance, namely, that the state has an obligation to monitor and equalize educational opportunity, both assumes the answer to the question posed by this case and proves too much. It assumes the answer because the question is <em>whether </em>the obligation to \u201cequalize\u201d extends to racial and ethnic concentration not intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>by the state. It proves too much because the state also has a constitutional obligation to monitor and equalize the electoral districts of the General Assembly. See Conn. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Certainly, the right to vote, and to have one\u2019s vote given its appropriate constitutional weight, is at least as fundamental under our constitution as the right to a public education. See Conn. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 1. Therefore, because the right to vote is, like the right to attend a free public elementary and secondary school, a fundamental right that the state has a continuing obligation to monitor and equalize, under the majority\u2019s rationale every general assembly district that is not racially, ethnically and religiously integrated is now unconstitutional. It is impossible rationally to conclude that the language adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the 1965 convention was intended to have this result. In short, the language of article first, \u00a7 20, simply cannot be cabined as the majority seeks to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Moreover, the term \u201csegregation\u201d cannot, the suggestion of the majority to the contrary notwithstanding,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> be read to mean something different from \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the context of article first, \u00a7 20. The nouns in this one sentence provision should not be read as having meanings that are mutually exclusive of, and unrelated to, the meanings of the other nouns that surround them. Consequently, the majority\u2019s reliance on the general inteipretive guideline that ordinarily no word or phrase is to be regarded as superfluous is misplaced in this context. This broad, constitutional equal protection provision was not intended to be interpreted as if it were the Uniform Commercial Code, with each term having a neatly compartmentalized definition. Within the bounds of the language used, the terms are to be read as taking their meaning from and sharing their meaning with each other, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">This approach to article first, \u00a7 20, is consistent with our precedents, which have generally treated both article first, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7 20, as expressing the same principle, namely, equal protection of the law. See, e.g., <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>229 Conn. 1, 8-10, 639 A.2d 502 (1994); <em>Mario </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>217 Conn. 164, 173-77, 585 A.2d 87 (1991); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 504-505, 542 A.2d 700 (1988); <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 638-39, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985); <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>133 Conn. 511, 515, 52 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>702 (1947); <em>New Haven Metal &amp; Heating Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>128 Conn. 213, 219, 21 A.2d 383 (1941). The majority\u2019s interpretive method of insisting that \u201csegregation\u201d must include de facto segregation because otherwise it would be superfluous, is inconsistent with the general approach of these precedents. By that reasoning, article first, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7 20, themselves must also have meanings independent of each other, otherwise one would be superfluous. We have never read these constitutional provisions in that fashion, and there is no justification for doing so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Thus, the reference in article first, \u00a7 20, to both \u201cequal protection of the law\u201d and \u201csegregation\u201d does not suggest that \u201csegregation\u201d has some broader meaning than \u201cequal protection of the law.\u201d They both express the same principle, as does the word \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d and the fact that the framers of this provision used, and the electorate approved, the term \u201csegregation\u201d does not support the conclusion that it was intended to include de facto, as opposed to de jure, racial and ethnic isolation. When interpreting a constitution, \u201c \u2018the intent to be arrived at is that of the people [who ratified it], and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Similarly, the reference to \u201cthe exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights\u201d further indicates that article first, \u00a7 20, is not meant to be read with the kind of categorical nicety that the majority employs. This phrase refers to a generally broad, inclusive category of rights, the particulars of which will have to be explicated on a case-by-case basis. The textual point is that there is no obvious, sharp distinction that leaps to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>mind when considering whether rights are \u201ccivil\u201d or \u201cpolitical\u201d or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The appropriateness of this textual approach is further demonstrated by the references to \u201creligion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\u201d Although arguably the reference to \u201creligion\u201d can be read to mean something different from the other listed categories, it cannot be disputed that the categories of race, color, ancestry and national origin blend into one another.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Moreover, the use of the phrase \u201cbecause of,\u201d followed by the list of protected categories, strongly suggests a requirement of state intent to segregate or discriminate, or intentionally to maintain such segregation. This reading of the phrase would be consistent with our precedents that, except where our text clearly departs from that of the federal equal protection clause, the two clauses have the same meaning and limitations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Leary, </em>217 Conn. 404, 409, 587 A.2d 85 (1991); <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 237, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 577, 512 A.2d 893 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Under federal precedent, only state created or intentionally maintained racial segregation is unconstitutional, and the state is not constitutionally obligated to remedy interdistrict racial division that is caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>primarily by economic and geographical factors. <em>Keyes </em>v. <em>School District No. </em>1, 413 U.S. 189, 198, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973); <em>Columbus Board of Education </em>v. <em>Penick, </em>443 U.S. 449, 464, 99 S. Ct. 2941, 61 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1979); <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>418 U.S. 717, 744-45, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (1974). Indeed, the majority\u2019s analysis implicitly concedes that \u201cbecause of\u2019 carries a requirement of intentionality when applied to all civil and political rights except the right to free public elementary and secondary schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Furthermore, that \u201csegregation,\u201d as used in article first, \u00a7 20, does not include de facto racial and ethnic concentration is demonstrated by simply reading the text as the simple sentence that it is, shorn of the majority\u2019s fiction that the words have opposite meanings when applied to public education and all other rights. This constitutional provision is not an education provision. It does not mention education specifically at all. This provision relates to.education because the right to attend a public school comes within the phrase \u201cin the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">If, as the majority concludes, \u201csegregation\u201d includes racial and ethnic concentration resulting, not from intentional state conduct but from demographic factors over which the state has no control, and if we are not willing to indulge in the fiction that the same words, used in the same sentence, nonetheless have opposite meanings when applied to different rights, then other areas of public life that are covered by the phrase \u201cin the exercise of . . . political or civil rights\u201d must also be subject to the same proscription. Thus, for example, a local electoral district that, by virtue of the religious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>racial or ethnic make-up of its constituents, is heavily Roman Catholic, African-American, Puerto Rican or Polish-American, is \u201csegregated\u201d under the majority\u2019s understanding of that term, and all voters within that district are being \u201csegregated] or discriminat[ed] in the exercise or enjoyment of [their] civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national origin,\u201d in violation of article first, \u00a7 20. In short, under the majority\u2019s reading of \u201csegregation,\u201d the 1965 constitutional amendments rendered all such electoral districts unconstitutional. It is not only implausible that this is what the language used in 1965 was intended to mean, it is impossible rationally to reach such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The Record of the 1965 Constitutional Convention</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The history of the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, in the 1965 convention makes even clearer than its text that the members of the convention did not intend it to mean de facto racial or ethnic concentration. It is inconceivable \u2014 except that the majority conceives it \u2014 and it is untenable to hold \u2014 except that the majority holds it \u2014 that the delegates to the 1965 constitutional convention intended the term \u201csegregation\u201d in that article to include de facto racial and ethnic concentration in the public schools irrespective of any state intent to bring about or to perpetuate such concentration. This question is not even close.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">I begin this part of my analysis with another factual finding of the trial court that the majority ignores. The trial court found that \u201cthe 1965 constitutional convention was a very conservative body that made only those changes that had to be made in order to comply with the legislative reapportionment mandates of the federal courts and it was extremely reluctant to change any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>thing that did not have to be changed.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, the 1965 convention was not called for the purpose of a general overhaul of the 1818 constitution. It was called primarily for the purpose of bringing the Connecticut constitution into compliance with the then recently decided cases of <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, </em>377 U.S. 713, 84 S. Ct. 1472, 12 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1964), <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964), <em>Wesberry </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>376 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 526, 11 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1964), and <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>372 U.S. 368, 83 S. Ct. 801, 9 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1963), and the delegates acted accordingly. The principal agenda of a constitutional convention is a useful tool in construing its actions. See E. Peters, \u201cState Constitutional Law: Federalism in the Common Law Tradition,\u201d 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 586 (1986) (\u201ccourts must look to the agenda of the constitution as a whole in the context of the historical and sociological issues that occupied center stage at the time of ratification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">One cannot square this unchallenged characterization of the 1965 convention with the notion that, when in the course of accomplishing its principal objective of legislative apportionment it also adopted article first, \u00a7 20, this \u201cvery conservative\u201d convention also intended to accomplish results that would at that time have rendered unconstitutional \u2014 or, at the very least, would have called into serious constitutional question \u2014 many school districts and general assembly districts in the state. Yet, despite what the majority may say, these are the necessary implications of its decision and rationale.'</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In attempting to divine the intent of the framers of article first, \u00a7 20, we are not faced with the difficult task of peering back through the mists of more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>century to a sparse historical record, in order to determine the intent of persons of whom we have limited knowledge, as is often the case when we attempt to inteipret the language used in the 1818 state constitution. The 1965 convention took place but thirty-one years ago. The names and careers of the delegates are well known to anyone reasonably cognizant of Connecticut government and politics and there is a complete printed record.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Among the delegates were former and future governors of this state,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> former and future United States Senators and Representatives,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> former and future state legislators,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> former members of this court, including two former chief justices,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and many other delegates with distinguished pedigrees in government and politics. These were men and women with long and distinguished careers in public life, who had practiced the arts of government and politics and who, presumably, knew the limits of both. They also knew that their effort would be placed before the electorate in order for the constitution to be amended. They knew, furthermore, that throughout Connecticut there were local, intradistrict neighborhood school boundaries and schools that were, because of the housing patterns then prevalent, heavily concentrated by religion, race and ethnic background. They knew, moreover, that, because of housing patterns, there would be local general assembly districts throughout Connecticut, created by the General Assembly in accordance with the constitutionally required reapportionment provisions that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>fashioning, that would also be heavily concentrated by the same factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It is simply inconceivable that the convention delegates, with that knowledge, intended by the language they used in article first, \u00a7 20, to render unconstitutional or to call into serious constitutional question, every one of those school boundaries, schools and electoral districts. In order to reach such a conclusion, one must posit the following line of hypothetical reasoning, or something similar, to the delegates regarding the meaning of \u201csegregation\u201d: (1) \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d mean intentional or de jure, rather than de facto, segregation, because otherwise the General Assembly would be prevented from drawing mathematically equal but religiously, racially or ethnically concentrated districts; and, although districts must now be substantially equal in population, it would be a radical change also to require them to be integrated on the basis of religion, race and ethnicity, a change far beyond the principal charge in this convention;<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> (2) in fact, intentional segregation is probably what the United States Supreme Court was addressing in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), when it outlawed the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine, although that is not absolutely clear from the available federal decisions to date; (3) nonetheless, when the words \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d come to be applied to interdistrict, but maybe not intradistrict, elementary and secondary school lines under the right to a free public education \u2014 which, by the way, will not be adopted until five days from now and, of course, has never been interpreted \u2014 those words mean the oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>site, namely, de facto segregation; and (4) we entertain this dual intent without (a) clearly \u2014 or even unclearly\u2014suggesting it by the language we use, and (b) disclosing it on the record of this convention or to the voters who will have to ratify our work. This scenario, I suggest, does no more than dramatize the reasoning behind the majority\u2019s tortuous and selective reading of the record of the 1965 convention. In my view, to attribute such a thought process to the delegates is not only implausible, it would have been irresponsible on the part of the delegates to have engaged in such a process sub rosa, and it is untenable to suggest that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">My view of the intent of the convention delegates is buttressed by the fact that, as even the plaintiffs emphasized in their posttrial brief to the trial court and in their appellate brief to this court, \u201c[t]he documentation of racial and economic isolation in Connecticut schools in the 1960s was thorough and comprehensive. In addition to the state\u2019s own official annual documentation, the University of Connecticut Institute of Urban Research and the University\u2019s Educational Resources and Development Center conducted a series of highly detailed reports on school segregation in Connecticut\u2019s major cities.\u201d In constitutionalizing the right of Connecticut\u2019s children to a free public education, however, the politically seasoned delegates to the 1965 convention uttered not one word even suggesting that this well documented problem would be addressed by the constitutional amendments that they had gathered to draft. In fact, the idea that the new education clause would create any sort of fundamental change in the state\u2019s education system was squarely rejected by Simon Bernstein, a delegate whom the majority ironically cites in support of its result. In reference to the proposed education clause, Bernstein stated, \u201c[T]his again is not anything revolutionary, it is something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>which we have . ...\u201d 3 Proceedings of the Connecticut Constitutional Convention of 1965, p. 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Moreover, just one year before the convention, the New Haven board of education had adopted a junior high school pairing plan for the purpose of reducing unintended racial imbalance in its school system and in the interest of promoting equality of educational opportunity. That plan, which generated considerable public controversy, was the subject of several public hearings at which it was vigorously defended and assailed, and resulted in an action for an injunction against the plan.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> On July 8,1965, while the convention was in session, the Superior Court decided in favor of the board. See <em>Guida </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>26 Conn. Sup. 121, 213 A.2d 843 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">There can be little doubt that, if the delegates intended the word \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, to mean de facto segregation when applied to public education, the statutory authority that the Superior Court concluded the board had in <em>Guida </em>would have been transformed into a constitutional obligation. It is fair to presume that the delegates who came from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>New Haven area,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> men and women cognizant of the public affairs of their district, were aware of this controversial case, which was decided only two months earlier. Indeed, one of those delegates, former Chief Justice Patrick B. O\u2019Sullivan, was one of the drafters of article first, and the chairman of the convention that adopted it, and another, Mary B. Griswold, spoke in favor of it. I cannot believe that, if it were the intent of the convention in adopting the word \u201csegregation\u201d to constitutionalize the New Haven board\u2019s plan, not one of the fourteen delegates from the district that included New Haven would have even mentioned its potential effect on the New Haven case. The record of the convention, however, is bereft of any such mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">That record, moreover, affirmatively demonstrates that the delegates did not intend \u201csegregation,\u201d as used in article first, \u00a7 20, to include de facto segregation. To the contrary, the history of the article and the debate over the term \u201csegregation\u201d in the 1965 convention compel the conclusion that the delegates intended the term specifically to preclude, under our state constitution, the doctrine of state-created \u201cseparate but equal\u201d educational and other public facilities that the United States Supreme Court had expressly overruled, as a matter of fourteenth amendment jurisprudence, in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 347 U.S. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In February, 1950, the commission on state government organization issued its report to the General Assembly and to then Governor Chester Bowles. Among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>its recommendations was a revision of the constitution, which included a new article first, our Declaration of Rights, including the following proposed article first, \u00a7 20: \u201cNo person shall be denied the enjoyment of, nor be discriminated against in, nor be segregated in, any right or employment, nor be so treated in the militia, or in the public schools or in any public place, because of religious principles, race, color, ancestry or national origin.\u201d The commission\u2019s recommendation to revise the constitution was not acted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">During the 1965 convention, on July 28, 1965, Chase Going Woodhouse introduced Resolution No. 168, which contained several recommendations for changes in our Declaration of Rights, article first. Among these were two proposals that are relevant to this case. First, the resolution proposed that article first, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> be amended to add the provision that all men are \u201centitled to the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Second, it proposed that article first, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> be amended exactly as had been proposed by the commission to the General Assembly and the governor in 1950.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This resolution was referred to the Committee on Resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Ultimately, the committee reported to the floor of the convention its Rules Committee Substitute for Constitutional Convention Resolution No. 168 (committee resolution 168). This resolution proposed a number of changes in the provisions of article first. Included within committee resolution 168 was the proposal that both article first, \u00a7 1, and then article first, \u00a7 20; see footnote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>49; remain unchanged, and that there be a new article first, \u00a7 22,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> providing as follows: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law, nor the enjoyment of his civil or political rights, nor be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national origin.\u201d This draft of article first, \u00a7 22, therefore, incorporated the explicit references to equal protection of the law and discrimination that had been in original Resolution No. 168, but omitted the specific references to segregation, employment, the militia and the public schools that had also been in the original resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">This proposal prompted a letter to the convention by the Connecticut Council of Churches that committee resolution 168 was not specific enough. The council stated that \u201c \u2018segregation constitutes such a core area of discrimination as it affects the pattern of relationship among persons and groups and needs thereby to be specifically guarded against through constitutional provision.\u2019 \u201d J. Zaiman, \u201cAnti-Separation Clause Urged for Bill of Rights,\u201d The Hartford Courant, Oct. 14, 1965, pp. 1 and 11. The council also expressed the thoughts that, because \u201c \u2018civil or political rights\u2019 \u201d was not defined in the proposal, that language was \u201c \u2018so broad as to be specifically excepted against in any controversial test of rights,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018[o]ur history seems to show that platitudinous phrases have not helped many of our citizens to enjoy specific rights that could not be pointed to implicitly in constitutional authority.\u2019 \u201d Id., p. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In addition, according to a contemporary account in The Hartford Courant, certain civil rights groups also thought that the proposal was not specific enough, and suggested reinserting the \u201cantisegregation\u201d clause. Id., p. 1. This prompted caucuses by both the Democrats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>and Republicans, as a result of which there was bipartisan agreement on reinserting language referring to segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Accordingly, on October 14, Woodhouse brought to the floor an amendment reinserting the reference to \u201csegregation,\u201d which resulted in the following language that ultimately became article first, \u00a7 20: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In proposing this amendment, Woodhouse reminded the convention that the word segregation had appeared in the original resolution, and that the only question was one of the appropriate wording to be used.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> 2 Proceedings, supra, pp. 690-91. Former Chief Justice Baldwin, one of the drafters of committee resolution 168 that was being amended, and another delegate, James J. Kennelly, both rose to stress the symbolic, as opposed to substantive, nature of the amendment.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Id., pp. 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The only reference to education in the entire debate over committee resolution 168 was by Bernstein, and that reference was made in the context of his delineating more specifically the \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d to which the proposal referred. Bernstein stated: \u201cI just want to comment that in this section which states that there will be enjoyment of civil and political rights, for the record, perhaps we might spell out a few of them so that courts and historians in the future may not fail to understand what we are talking about. <em>These are rights which we have always assumed we have had anyway and these rights include rights of freedom from discrimination in travel, rights of freedom in education, public accommodations, and employment and housing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">O\u2019Sullivan put the amendment to a voice vote, and ruled it adopted. O\u2019Sullivan then ruled <em>\u201cthat this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>amendment is not a substantive change and therefore we can act upon the entire bill today.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Reading this record in an objective, dispassionate manner leads inescapably to the conclusions that the use of the term \u201csegregation\u201d in what ultimately became article first, \u00a7 20: (1) was intended to emphasize that the entire section prohibited intentional segregation in the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d sense; (2) was not intended to add substance to the provision, but was intended only to make the general principles more specific; (3) was not intended to affect rights to education in a way different from other civil and political rights; and (4) cannot be read to mean one thing when applied to all such rights except education, but the opposite when applied to the right to public education under article eighth, \u00a7 1. Several reasons compel these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">First, the historical source of the term was the 1950 recommendation to the General Assembly and governor for a constitutional provision. In 1950, the term \u201csegregation,\u201d in the constitutional sense, referred to the widespread system of laws in other parts of the nation, mandating the separation of the races, the constitutionality of which was then maintained under the infamous \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine. There is no evidence, either in this case or historically in general, to suggest that in 1950 this term was understood to mean racial or ethnic concentration that was not the product of state intent. Moreover, this historical source was specifically noted as the source of original Resolution No. 168, introduced to the 1965 convention by Woodhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Second, after committee resolution 168 was reported out without the term \u201csegregation,\u201d the principal motive to reinsert it was to respond to the concern of civil rights groups and the Council of Churches, which was, not that the new resolution was not broad enough, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that it was not specific enough. Certainly, in 1965, eleven years after <em>Brown </em>and while the civil rights movement was taking hold in the land and extending the principle of <em>Brown </em>to all areas of public life, the Council\u2019s reference to segregation as a \u201ccore area of discrimination\u201d could only have referred to segregation in its constitutional sense of legally mandated or sanctioned segregation, and cannot be plausibly read as referring to what we later have come to describe as de facto segregation.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Third, Woodhouse\u2019s remarks when she introduced the amendment, reinforced the conclusion that the substance of what she sought to have enacted was already embodied in the provision, and that the reinsertion of the term was only to make the equal protection principle more specific, not to add something of substance that was not already included therein. See footnote 52. Read in the context of 1965, her reference to the \u201cphilosophy and the practice of segregation\u201d could only have meant that philosophy and practice as a legal concept. See 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 691. Indeed, one wonders what the reference to \u201cphilosophy\u201d could have meant in the context of racial and ethnic concentration that occurs as a result of demographic factors without any planning, intent, idea or doctrine behind it. Woodhouse\u2019s final remarks, namely, that the amendment \u201cin no way limits the rights of anyone,\u201d and that it \u201cstrengthens the wording\u201d of committee resolution 168; id.; were an assurance to the Council of Churches and others that their concern for specificity was being met. Her assurance that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>insertion of \u201csegregation\u201d makes the general more specific cannot be read, as the majority reads it, however, to make the general something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Fourth, the drafters of committee resolution 168, Baldwin, O\u2019Sullivan and Bordon,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> three former members of this court, including two former Chief Justices, chose to exclude the term. One of them, Baldwin, acknowledged that they had discussed in the Committee on Resolutions the question of whether to include the term \u201csegregation,\u201d and had concluded that \u201cit was unnecessary to put in there.\u201d Id., p. 692. Baldwin, and presumably O\u2019Sullivan and Bordon, the other distinguished members of the drafting subcommittee, was nonetheless agreeable to the amendment \u201cif it will please people.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In addition, Baldwin disclosed that the subcommittee had canvassed the state\u2019s legislation \u201cprotecting political and civil rights,\u201d and had found that our state led the nation in that respect. Id., pp. 695-96. He expressed his pride in that legislative record, and noted that, if other states had legislation like ours, \u201cwe would not be having the trouble that we are having in some places today.\u201d Id., p, 696. Among that legislation was General Statutes \u00a7 10-15c, which requires that public schools be open to all children without discrimination on account of race, creed or color, and which had been in effect since 1868.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The most plausible inference from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>statement is that he was referring, in part at least, to the still extant resistance, in other parts of the nation, to elimination of the separate but equal doctrine, in education as well as other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Had there been any intent in reinserting the term \u201csegregation\u201d that it have one meaning when applied to education and an opposite meaning when applied to all the other political and civil rights, the drafting subcommittee, who obviously commanded the respect of their colleagues, would have said so and would not have misled the delegates by assuring them that there was no change in substance intended by reinsertion. This is particularly true because if, as the majority posits, there <em>are </em>dual and opposite meanings lurking in the language, (1) that duality is certainly not apparent on the face of article first, \u00a7 20, (2) it is inconceivable that the draftsmen of the article would have left that duality unexpressed, and (3) this unexpressed duality would have opened the entire article to an even more bizarre inteipretation, namely, that intention does not apply to, and is not required to constitute a violation of, any of the civil or political rights encompassed by the article. In sum, the majority\u2019s interpretation of article first, \u00a7 20, cannot rationally or responsibly be attributed to the people who drafted it or to their colleagues with whom they discussed and adopted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Fifth, with one exception discussed immediately below, the debate on article first, \u00a7 20, is bereft of references to education. Thus, the majority\u2019s attempt to link the two, and to establish that the reference to \u201csegregation\u201d in the section was intended to mean de facto segregation, but solely when applied to article eighth, \u00a7 1, has no support in this record. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine how the debate over \u201csegregation\u201d could indicate such an intent, because when the debate took place, consideration of article eighth, \u00a7 1, the education clause, was five days in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The only reference to the subject of education in the entire debate on the amendment occurred in remarks by Bernstein. 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 694. Those remarks are significant for several reasons that have more to do with what they do not establish than what they do establish. As noted, Bernstein made his remarks five days before the convention considered the resolution that ultimately became the education provision, article eighth, \u00a7 1. Thus, they could have had no conceivable relevance to the interpretation of that provision. In addition, his reference to education was intended to do nothing more than to indicate that education was one of those \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d along with, in his view, travel, public accommodations, employment and housing, that would be covered by article first, \u00a7 20. Id. As discussed previously, when Bernstein did specifically address the reach of the education clause five days after the adoption of the segregation clause, he made clear that the education clause was intended only to constitutionalize the then existing system of free public education \u2014 a municipality based system that included well documented instances of racial isolation. 3 Proceedings, supra, p. 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Thus, when the majority asserts that \u201c[t]he delegates\u2019 expectation that the proposed amendments to the constitution would secure interrelated constitutional rights was underscored by Bernstein\u2019s remark that article first, \u00a7 20, was intended to be applied in the context of the \u2018rights of freedom in education,\u2019 \u201d the majority merely states the obvious. Of course article first, \u00a7 20, was intended to apply to education, as one of the \u201ccivil or political rights\u201d referred to in that article. To the extent, however, that the majority suggests that Bernstein\u2019s remarks imply some connection between that obvious application and a specific and different meaning of \u201csegregation\u201d in that article when applied to article eighth, \u00a7 1, the suggestion is utterly without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Sixth, O\u2019Sullivan, another member of the drafting subcommittee, presiding as the chairman of the convention ruled the amendment to be technical and not substantive. 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 696. Such a ruling cannot be squared with the notion that the amendment had the intended effect of transforming the resolution from a straightforward equal protection provision, which specifically incorporated into our constitution principles that had already been held to be there by the established interpretations of article first, \u00a7 1, into a provision that maintained those principles generally, but altered them radically with respect only to public education. If such a transformation is anything, it is certainly substantive and not technical, and O\u2019Sullivan would have called that fact to his colleagues\u2019 attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Seventh, although we have on occasion interpreted article first, \u00a7 20, to have a broader meaning than its federal counterpart, based on differing language between the two; see, e.g., <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 513, 624 A.2d 876 (1993) (protecting from discrimination those with physical and mental disabilities based on explicit language of article first, \u00a7 20); the record in this case demonstrates that the linguistic difference, namely, the specific reference to \u201csegregation,\u201d was not intended to have a meaning different from that of the federal equal protection clause. Contrary to the assertion of the majority, this record demonstrates that it was intended only to constitute a more specific application of the same principle of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Eighth, even if one somehow were able to read the record as not clearly establishing the meaning of \u201csegregation\u201d to require intent, at the least it cannot be disputed that the record does not clearly indicate that \u201csegregation\u201d has no requirement of intent. Moreover, it cannot be disputed that reading the record as the majority reads it works a radical change in our constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tional equal protection jurisprudence. We do not read our constitutional text to make radical changes without clear evidence of an intent to do so. <em>Fonfara </em>v. <em>Reapportionment Commission, </em>222 Conn. 166, 172-73, 610 A.2d 153 (1992). The majority\u2019s approach violates this sound principle of constitutional interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Thus, there is no basis for the suggestion by the majority of relevance to the issues in this case that when both article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7 20, were debated by the convention delegates, \u201cthey recognized and endorsed the landmark decision in <em>Brown . . . </em>declaring the unconstitutionality of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 public school education.\u201d First, there is no mention whatsoever of <em>Brown, </em>or of the question of segregation of schools, in the debate over article eighth, \u00a7 1. The entire debate concerned the fact that Connecticut was one of few states that did not mention education in its constitution, and the desirability of doing so.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> 3 Proceedings, supra, pp. 1038-41. If anything, the fact that the delegates obviously were aware of <em>Brown </em>contradicts the inference that the majority seeks to draw. The debate over article first, \u00a7 20, referred to the separate but equal doctrine declared <em>invaJM. in Brown. </em>That was a doctrine of state intended segregation, and there is no suggestion in this debate that the framers intended the references to segregation to include the notion of de facto concentration of races or ethnic groups.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Finally, the available historical evidence does not end with the printed record of the convention. There are postconvention documents that shed light on the question involved in this case, principally by the absence of any suggestion that comports with the majority\u2019s analysis. These documents are: (1) a resume by the secretary of the state of the proposals passed by the convention; (2) an annotated copy of the proposed revised constitution, with marginal notes, published by the convention itself \u201cas a guide to the people of the state\u201d; and (3) an account published in The Hartford Courant, December 5, 1965, p. 36, of an interview with Baldwin in which he explained the work of the convention. Each of these discusses article first, \u00a7 20, in brief and summary fashion. None of them, however, even suggests that it could have opposite meanings when applied to education and other rights. If the majority\u2019s startling textual and historical conclusions are correct, it is curious that no one at the time understood what the convention had done, not even the delegates themselves.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The final fundamental flaw in the majority opinion involves its discussion of a remedy for the constitutional violation that it has found. In what must surely be one of the great understatements in this court\u2019s history, the majority recognizes \u201cthat the fashioning of appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief requires careful consideration in order to weigh the benefits and costs of various remedial measures.\u201d The majority considers remanding the case to the trial court for the fashioning of a remedy because, in its view of the record, \u201cthe parties have not had the opportunity to present evidence directed to the remedial consequences that follow from our decision on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint,\u201d and because in this court the plaintiffs \u201chave not focused their attention on the remedial consequences of a substantive decision in their behalf.\u201d The majority eschews this course of action, as well as the notion of inviting further briefing in this court, however, in favor of \u201cthe methodology used in <em>Horton </em>I,\u201d namely, staying further judicial intervention to afford the General Assembly an opportunity to take appropriate action. In what must surely be one of the most ironic statements in this court\u2019s history, given the majority\u2019s judicial overreaching in this case, the majority offers as its rationale for this methodology \u201c[pjrudence and sensitivity to the constitutional authority of coordinate branches of government . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">This flaw has two parts. First, it misrepresents the record in this case. Second, it imposes on the General Assembly a mandate to enact a remedial regime without an articulation of principle to guide it in its endeavors.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Record Regarding Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe parties have not had the opportunity to present evidence directed to the remedial consequences that follow from our decision on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\u201d is contrary to the record. The question of a potential remedy was extensively litigated and briefed in the trial court, which specifically noted that \u201cthis is not a bifurcated hearing.\u201d The parties presented several witnesses on the subject of a remedy.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In their posttrial brief, the plaintiffs spent twelve pages discussing the question of a remedy, and the defendants responded in kind, devoting thirty pages to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In addition, on remand the trial court made numerous findings regarding a potential remedy. The plaintiffs do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>not challenge these findings in this appeal. The court found that no state in the country has a racial imbalance law that requires interdistrict balancing. Under the heading, \u201cThe Nature and Scope of the Remedy,\u201d the court made seventeen additional specific findings. Among those findings were the following. The plaintiffs seek to have the court direct the Hartford school districts and the twenty-one suburban districts to address the claimed inequities jointly, to reconfigure district lines, and to take other steps sufficient to eliminate those inequities. The court also found that the \u201cpresent racial, ethnic and socioeconomic concentration and isolation of the schoolchildren in the Hartford public school system on the basis of their residence is principally the result of social and demographic patterns of change that have occurred over the past thirty years in the Hartford metropolitan area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The trial court found further that the relief sought by the plaintiffs includes the integration of the public schools in the region for the purpose of eliminating economic, as well as racial and ethnic, isolation. The court noted that, although William Gordon, an expert witness for the plaintiffs, was of the opinion that the federal courts\u2019 method of eliminating de jure segregation could be effectively applied to this case, the remedial planning in this case would be more complicated because the remedy sought by the plaintiffs includes interdistrict economic integration. The court also noted the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses\u2019 opinions that problems of poverty can be appropriately addressed by the public schools. The court rejected these opinions, however, as inconsistent with the \u201cgeneral agreement that conventional educational approaches are inadequate to address the special problems of the urban poor,\u201d and with the \u201cunanimous and apparently undisputed finding of the governor\u2019s commission on quality and integrated education that there [are] no educational strategies or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>initiatives that could fully deal with the larger issues of poverty, unemployment, housing, health, substance abuse, hunger, parental neglect, and crowded and substandard housing\u201d that are associated with the concentration of poverty.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The trial court specifically found that there \u201care no existing standards or guidelines that educators, social scientists or desegregation planners can offer or recommend to achieve the proper racial, ethnic and socioeconomic balance in the school districts of the Hartford metropolitan area.\u201d The court further found that \u201c[mandatory student reassignment plans to achieve racial balance, whether intradistrict or interdistrict, are ineffective methods of achieving integration, whether they are mandated by racial imbalance laws or by court order.\u201d In this connection, the court also found that \u201c[proposed solutions to the problems of racial, ethnic and economic isolation which rely on coercion and which fail to offer choices and options either do not work or have unacceptable consequences.\u201d Finally, the court found that \u201c [integration in its fullest and most meaningful sense can only be achieved by building affordable housing in suburban areas in order to break up the inner city ghettos, and by making urban schools more attractive for those who live outside the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">These facts, like the facts regarding the educational effects of poverty rather than of race or ethnicity, were drawn from the testimony of the witnesses whom the parties had presented at trial. The competing factual claims were vigorously litigated at trial and briefed in the trial court, and both sides had a full and fair opportunity to brief them in this court. If, as the majority suggests, that opportunity was not adequately afforded here, it can only be attributed to the fact that the majority precludes it by sending the case directly to the General Assembly and the executive branch. This brings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>me to the task that the majority has thrust upon those branches of government by its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The Lack of a Recognizable Principle or Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">I confess that, if I were a member of either the executive or legislative branch of our government, I would have but the slightest glimmering of what kind of legislation would comport with the majority\u2019s mandate, because the opinion articulates no principle or standard upon which to base such legislation. Confining my discussion here to the Hartford metropolitan area, I can find no principle or standard in the majority opinion by which to measure the level of racial and ethnic integration of the African-American and Hispanic schoolchildren that will be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The closest thing to such a principle are three statements by the majority. The first is that \u201cthe existence of <em>extreme racial and ethnic </em>isolation\u201d in the public schools violates the constitution. (Emphasis added.) The second is that if <em>\u201csignificant </em>racial and ethnic isolation continues to <em>occur,\u201d no </em>intent to bring about or maintain that isolation is required in order to establish a constitutional violation. (Emphasis added.) The third is that a \u201csignificant component of [a] substantially equal educational opportunity is access to a public school education that is not substantially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Assuming that these elliptical references constitute the majority\u2019s guidance to the General Assembly, is the lack of significant isolation, or the presence of substantial impairment, the same as \u201csubstantial equality?\u201d Does significant isolation or \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d mean that, with respect to the Hartford metropolitan area, the legislature must start with the last census figures, and redraw the district lines so that each munic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ipality has a substantially equal percentage of African-American and Hispanic schoolchildren? Or does the reference to \u201cextreme racial and ethnic isolation\u201d mean that, so long as the concentration is not massive \u2014 something less than the current 92 or 95 percent figure,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> for example \u2014 the constitution will not be violated? Or is the measure a statewide, rather than a district-wide figure? That is, must each municipality have a percentage of African-American and Hispanic schoolchildren substantially equal to the percentage of such children in the state? Education is, after all, a state responsibility that has only been delegated to the municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Further, why is the municipality the appropriate measuring unit, rather than the individual school? After all, if a student\u2019s constitutional right to an integrated education is violated by being required to be educated in a racially or ethnically concentrated setting, thereby, according to the majority, missing out on the social benefits of an integrated education and incurring the social burdens of a segregated education upon which the majority\u2019s analysis rests, then is it not appropriate that we look at the actual setting in which each child\u2019s education takes place? After all, a student who attends a racially and ethnically concentrated school, albeit in a racially and ethnically integrated school district, will not have those benefits and will carry those burdens. If so, then it seems that each school must, constitutionally, have the appropriate racial and ethnic makeup. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>These are just some of the questions that are raised, but not addressed, by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The task of the state will be complicated, moreover, by the findings of the trial court in this case regarding remedy. The majority does not address these findings, but my examination of the record discloses that they are based on sufficient evidence to withstand appellate scrutiny. Among those findings are the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The trial court found that there are no educational strategies or initiatives that could fully deal with the larger issues of poverty, unemployment, housing, health, substance abuse, parental neglect, and crowded and substandard housing that are associated with the concentration of poverty under which the plaintiffs suffer. Thus, it is these factors, not the plaintiffs\u2019 racial and ethnic concentration, that account for the educational deficiencies of which the plaintiffs complain. Furthermore, the court found that there are no existing standards or guidelines that educators, social scientists or desegregation planners can offer or recommend to achieve the proper racial, ethnic and socioeconomic basis in the school districts of the Hartford metropolitan area. The majority\u2019s mandate, therefore, will require the state to devise a strategy to compel integration that, the trial court found after six years of litigation, will not significantly ameliorate the underlying educational deficiencies of which the plaintiffs complain, and with respect to which educators, social scientists and desegregation planners could not offer standards or guidance. Thus, the majority thrusts on our state government the truly awesome task of devising a remedy for educational deficiencies in Hartford \u2014 a remedy that will necessarily require drastic statewide changes \u2014 without an intelligible guiding principle, and with no indication that the true source of Hartford\u2019s educational deficiencies will be addressed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In this respect, also, this case differs markedly from <em>Horton I. </em>In that case, like this case, the question of the availability of an appropriate remedy or remedies had been litigated. In that case, however, unlike this case, the trial court had found, and we affirmed based on that finding, that there were feasible remedies available to achieve the substantial equality of educational opportunity that was not being afforded by the flat grant funding system. <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 635-36. Furthermore, in that case, unlike this case, there were successful methods in use in many other states for remedying the inequality of educational opportunity resulting from financial inequities. Id., 651. According to the trial court\u2019s findings here, by contrast, there are no strategies available, or in successful use elsewhere, for remedying differences in educational opportunities that result from concentrations of poverty. In sum, whereas the remedy in <em>Horton I </em>involved moving dollars around and thereby ameliorating educational differences and deficiencies, the remedy here will involve moving schoolchildren around without ameliorating such differences or deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">THE NECESSARY IMPLICATIONS OF THE MAJORITY OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Despite the effort of the majority to cabin its conclusions, it is clear to me that the effort must fail and that, when the General Assembly attempts to enact legislation in order to meet the mandate of this case, there are several necessary \u2014 not possible, not probable but, in my view, necessary \u2014 implications of the majority opinion that it will be required to confront. I have already discussed what seems to me to be the most obvious implication, namely, that the majority\u2019s rationale applies, not just to interdistrict racial and ethnic concentrations, but to intradistrict and interschool con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>centrations as well. There are, however, other less obvious but equally necessary implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">These implications are compelled in part by the identity of the plaintiffs. Six of the eighteen plaintiffs are white students \u2014 four who reside in Hartford, and two who reside in West Hartford. Moreover, there is no showing that the two who live in West Hartford are burdened by a concentration of poverty. The majority opinion vindicates these white students\u2019 constitutional right to attend unsegregated schools, as well as the constitutional right of the African-American and Hispanic plaintiffs. Furthermore, the racial and ethnic concentration involved in the Hartford school district is more ethnic than racial. That is, a greater percentage of the students in Hartford are Hispanic than are African-American, and Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the school population. Thus, in terms of article first, \u00a7 20, this case is more about \u201cancestry\u201d and \u201cnational origin\u201d than it is about \u201crace\u201d or \u201ccolor.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The first of the necessary implications of the majority opinion is that every school district in the state that is primarily white and that does not have an appropriate percentage of African-American and Hispanic students, is in violation of article first, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> This conclusion, it seems clear to me, flows inexorably from the facts that (1) in this case, it is not only the constitutional rights to an unsegregated education of the African-American and Hispanic students, taken together, that are being violated, but the same rights of the white plaintiffs who live in Hartford and West Hartford, and (2) this violation is based on the general social benefits attributable to an integrated education, and the general social burdens attendant upon a racially and ethnically concentrated education. Certainly, every predominantly white school district lacks the general social benefits of an integrated education, and suffers from the general social burdens of a segregated education. Just as certainly, the constitutional rights of white students in other parts of the state cannot be less than those in the Hartford metropolitan area, and a student\u2019s constitutional right to attend school in an unsegregated public school district, or to attend an unsegregated school within such a district, cannot depend on where the student happens to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Indeed, the majority comes very close to making explicit this necessary implication of its decision. It states that the right of \u201cConnecticut schoolchildren\u201d to a substantially equal educational opportunity requires \u201caccess to a public school education that is not substantially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation.\u201d Thus, every rural and suburban school district, from Litchfield to Pomfret and from Greenwich to Granby, is now either clearly or probably unconstitutional; its boundaries, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the racial and ethnic makeup of its school population, or both, will have to be changed in order to remedy that unconstitutionality. This means the end of the traditional system of municipality based school districts.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Second, because ethnicity is a specifically protected class under article first, \u00a7 20, and because the facts of this case rest more on ethnicity than on race, not only must every school district in this state have an appropriate percentage of African-American and Hispanic students, taken together, but also an appropriate ethnic makeup, irrespective of race. Furthermore, I cannot see how such a makeup can be properly confined to counting Hispanic students. Certainly, other ethnic groups have no lesser status than Hispanic students. Just as certainly, moreover, the general benefits of an integrated education and the general burdens of a segregated education apply to ethnic, as well as racial, segregation. Therefore, if ethnicity is a protected class under article first, \u00a7 20, if \u201csegregation\u201d does not require intent, and if segregation prohibits ethnic as well as racial segregation, then in order for a school district to be nonsegregated it will have to contain an appropriate percentage of the various major ethnic groups in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Third, because \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, does not have an intentionality requirement, and because that article protects religion on a par with race and ethnicity, every school district, and probably every neighborhood school, that is heavily concentrated with students of one religion is segregated. Consequently, all of the students in that district or school are being subjected to segregation \u201cbecause of religion.\u201d There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>fore, the legislature will be required to address this necessary implication of the majority\u2019s mandate, so that each district, or school, will have an appropriate percentage of Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish students.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">As a result of these implications, the legislature, if it is to take seriously its responsibilities under the majority\u2019s mandate, will have few options, if any, other than a statewide realignment of school districts, accompanied by a statewide transportation system.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Such a system will be necessary to ensure that the constitutional rights of every schoolchild in the state are protected.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CLAIMS AS PRESENTED TO THIS COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">This discussion brings me, finally, to a consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims as they <em>were actually </em>presented to us for adjudication, not as reconstructed by the majority. The plaintiffs make three claims that, in my view of the case, must be addressed.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> These are, in general terms, that: (1) the defendants violated article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, and article eighth, \u00a7 1, by failing to provide public schoolchildren in the Hartford metropolitan area an equal educational opportunity; (2) the defendants violated article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, by providing education in the Hartford metropolitan area that is segregated on the basis of race and ethnicity; and (3) the defendants violated article eighth, \u00a7 1, by failing to provide Hartford schoolchildren a minimally adequate education. Although much of my prior discussion disposes of most of these claims, some further discussion is appropriate. None of these claims is persuasive, moreover, because none is supported by the record. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Equal Educational Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">As I indicated previously, the plaintiffs\u2019 equal educational opportunity claim is based on <em>Horton I, </em>and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>premised on the factual assertion that the racial and ethnic concentration in the district, coupled with their concentration of poverty and their lesser educational resources, as compared to the resources of the suburban districts, has caused educational outcomes in the Hartford school district that are inferior to those in the suburban districts. The claim also depends in significant part on the premise that, with respect to the relative educational outcomes of Hartford and the suburbs, the state mastery test scores are a valid tool for measuring differences in educational outcomes between Hartford and the suburbs. Consequently, they argue, just as in <em>Horton </em>/, in which unequal funding caused an inferior quality of education in the property-poor towns and violated the constitution, in this case the combination of factors listed earlier has caused the quality of education in the Hartford district to be inferior to that provided in the surrounding suburban districts and violates the constitution. Similarly, the plaintiffs argue that the relative quality of educational opportunities must be measured by the same or similar factors that this court deemed relevant in <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 634, namely: educational outcomes, as reflected by the state mastery test scores, state remedial goals, scholastic aptitude test (SAT) scores and college attendance rates; plants and facilities; equipment, supplies, textbooks and libraries; course offerings and curriculum; teaching and professional staff; bilingual education programs; and special needs programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">As I indicated previously, although this claim might well be persuasive if its factual underpinnings were sound, it founders on the factual findings of the trial court. It is not necessary to recount all of those findings in this regard. It is sufficient to repeat here several that are fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The trial court\u2019s findings are squarely contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Hartford suffers from diminished educational resources compared to its suburban neighbors. The court found that, since 1979, the state\u2019s method for financing public schools has taken into account the needs of urban school districts by including in the aid formula the number of children from low income families and, since 1989, a weighting factor that takes into account the number of students who score below the remedial standard on the state\u2019s mastery test scores. The court also found that the 1986 Educational Enhancement Act addressed cities\u2019 financial needs by raising teachers\u2019 salaries dramatically, so that Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport have been able to recruit and retain teachers at salaries comparable to, if not higher than, the salary levels offered in the suburbs, and that this has permitted urban class sizes to be reduced. The court found, in addition, that the priority school district program provides that the poorer communities, like Hartford, receive the greatest financial benefit, that the state factors the mastery test scores into the aid formula as a measurement of a school district\u2019s need, and that where students do not meet remedial standards additional funds are made available.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The trial court found, moreover, that Hartford\u2019s teachers are as qualified as their suburban counterparts, and that they are very committed and dedicated to providing a quality education for their students. Hartford\u2019s teacher training program is based on the \u201ceffective schools\u201d concept, which is specifically directed to the needs of urban and minority children. Finally, the court found that Hartford is not a negative educational setting, that there is \u201coutstanding education going on in its schools,\u201d that some \u201cof the best special education classes in the state can be found\u201d there, and that the \u201cHartford public schools offer academic programs that are sufficient to meet the basic educational needs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>all its students and also provide other programs that are required to meet the special needs of its economically disadvantaged students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As I indicated in great detail earlier, the trial court\u2019s findings are also squarely contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that there is a causal connection between their racial and ethnic concentration \u2014 whether considered alone or in conjunction with the concentration of poverty \u2014 and any educational deficiencies of which the plaintiffs complain. The gist of the trial court\u2019s findings in this regard is that it is not the racial and ethnic isolation of the plaintiffs, but their socioeconomic status \u2014 their poverty, its concentration, and all of the social pathologies that are closely associated with poverty and its concentration \u2014 that is the causative factor of those deficiencies.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> These \u201cdisadvantaging characteristics\u201d of poverty, which \u201cpoor children bring with them\u201d from home and neighborhood to school, include \u201cunemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ment . . . substance abuse, hunger, parental neglect . . . crowded and substandard housing,\u201d and such \u201cat risk\u201d factors as low birth weight and mothers on drugs at birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s findings are squarely contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they have established valid differences in the educational outcomes between the Hartford school district and the suburban districts. To the extent that the plaintiffs rely on the state mastery scores to measure these differences, which as I read their brief is a considerable extent, the trial court found that such scores are not a valid means for measuring interdistrict achievements. Moreover, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion to the contrary, the court\u2019s findings on this subject are not confined to the state mastery test scores.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The plaintiffs contend, nonetheless, that the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous, that many of the facts upon which they rely were undisputed in the trial court, and that the court was required to accept certain of the experts\u2019 opinions. Suffice it to say that neither the record nor the law bears out that contention. The court\u2019s findings are fully supported by the evidence. None of the facts in question was undisputed; on the contrary, they were hotly disputed in the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>originally and on our remand. Finally, it is axiomatic that a trial court is not required to accept an expert\u2019s opinion; <em>Drabik </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>234 Conn. 390, 396, 662 A.2d 118 (1995); and that is particularly true in this case, where the court indicated that some of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 opinions were flawed methodologically, and where there were contrary expert opinions that the trial court did credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Per Se Segregation Under Article Eighth, \u00a7 1, and Article First, \u00a7 20</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">This claim of the plaintiffs bears little additional discussion. As I indicated previously, it rests entirely on the proposition that \u201csegregation\u201d as used in article first, \u00a7 20, and applied to education under article eighth, \u00a7 1, means de facto racial and ethnic concentration, without a requirement of state intention. As I also indicated previously, this claim is simply untenable, and such a conclusion cannot rationally be drawn from the language or history of those constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">A Minimally Adequate Education</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that they have established that they are being deprived of their right, under article eighth, \u00a7 1, to a minimally adequate education. This claim requires some additional discussion, because the majority did not discuss it and, therefore, it was not involved in my analysis of the majority opinion. I conclude, nonetheless, that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">The plaintiffs argue, first, that, under both the majority opinion in <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 649 (referring to state\u2019s \u201cconstitutional duty to educate its children\u201d), and the dissenting opinion therein; id., 659 <em>(Lois</em>elle, <em>J., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>dissenting) (\u201c[w]hen the constitution says free education it must be interpreted in a reasonable way. A town may not herd children in an open field to hear lectures by illiterates.\u201d); article eighth, \u00a7 1, embodies a requirement of a minimally adequate education that the judiciary is empowered to enforce. The plaintiffs also point to precedents from other jurisdictions that, in then-view, have held accordingly. They next contend that the trial court employed an improper standard in defining a minimally adequate education and that, under the proper standard, the evidence established a violation thereof as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The defendants respond, first, that article eighth, \u00a7 1, does not embody any particular substantive level of education that the judiciary has power to enforce. They contend that, although they agree that the constitutional provision includes the right to an \u201cadequate education\u201d; id., 659; it \u201cdoes not authorize the judiciary to establish specific educational programs and goals or levels of educational achievement as a constitutional requirement.\u201d The defendants next argue that, assuming we do consider the issue, the trial court cannot be faulted for using a standard that the plaintiffs themselves proposed, that the standard now proposed by the plaintiffs is improper, and that, under any appropriate standard, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights have not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In my view, it is not necessary in this case to decide whether article eighth, \u00a7 1, embodies a requirement that the state provide a minimally adequate education or, if it does, the extent to which such a requirement is subject to judicial review. Nor is it necessary to define the specific contours of such an education. Assuming that there is such a requirement that is subject to judicial review, I conclude that the standard proposed by the plaintiffs is improper and that, gauged by any appropriate standard, the plaintiffs have not been deprived of such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Although it is difficult to ascertain precisely the standard that the plaintiffs propose, it appears to be geared in significant part to student achievement, as measured by certain performance goals set by the state, namely, the state mastery tests.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Thus, they assert that the trial court improperly rejected as irrelevant to this claim their \u201cevidence relating to whether Hartford children were succeeding in the goals set by the state . . . .\u201d They contend that this standard is not met in Hartford, which in their view is a \u201cschool system whose children cannot read or write, even if provided with significant resources,\u201d and that Hartford has not provided a minimally adequate education because it is not a system \u201cthat succeeds in teaching children to at least achieve a minimal level of reading, writing and arithmetic . ...\u201d As the defendants correctly point out, the plaintiffs base these characterizations of the Hartford school district on the state masteiy test scores for Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">I reject, as did the trial court, the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed standard for a constitutionally required minimally adequate education. Performance or achievement of the student population, taken generally, cannot in my view be the principle upon which any such requirement is based. There is nothing in either the language or the history of article eighth, \u00a7 1, to support such a standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Not only the trial court\u2019s findings in this case, but also common sense tells me that any appropriate standard by which to measure the state\u2019s assumed obligation to provide a minimally adequate education must be based generally, not on what level of achievement students reach, but on what the state reasonably attempts to make available to them, taking into account any special needs of a particular local school system. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Although schools are important socializing institutions in our democratic society, they cannot be constitutionally required to overcome every serious social and personal disadvantage that students bring with them to school, and that seriously hinder the academic achievement of those students. Thus, as the trial court found, achievement levels as measured by such tools as the state mastery tests are an inappropriate measurement of the quality of education. Those test scores do not take into account important variables that erect difficult barriers to achievement, such as socioeconomic status, early environmental deprivations, low birth weight, mothers on drugs at birth, diminished motivation to succeed academically, extraordinary mobility, limited English proficiency, and all of the other dismal factors associated with the concentration of poverty in the Hartford school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">This is not to say that, as part of its assumed constitutional obligation to provide a minimally adequate education, the state has no obligation to attempt, by reasonable means, to ameliorate these problems. It may well have such an obligation. It is to say, however, that this record fully establishes that the state has, through the programs, policies and funding mechanisms already described, met that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">It is a bedrock principle of our system of government that the legislative branch is the source of the fundamental public policy of the state, and that the courts may invalidate such a policy only where it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that it violates a constitutional right. <em>Morascini </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Safety, </em>236 Conn. 781, 789, 236 A.2d 1340 (1996). Not only does the majority fail even to give lip service to this principle, the majority violates it.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>With no justification other than its own view of the wiser course for the state to follow, the majority strikes down a legislative public policy determination \u2014 in effect since 1909, more than half a century prior to the 1965 constitutional convention \u2014 in favor of municipality based public school districts, and substitutes its own policy choice for that legislative determination. With the same absence of legitimate justification, the majority strikes down the legislative policy determination that more can be accomplished toward the goal of diversity in our public school systems by voluntary and incremental means, supplemented by state funding and incentives, than by a mandate that requires the abandonment of municipality based school districts and the institution of a statewide system of transportation of schoolchildren. Instead, the majority substitutes its policy choice and opts for a mandate that will require such a statewide system of transportation based solely on racial, ethnic and religious factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Although the majority may disagree with the legislature\u2019s choices and initiatives, it cannot be maintained that reasonable people may not differ regarding the best way to reach the goal of diversity in our public schools. Indeed, in states and communities across the nation people of goodwill of all races and ethnic groups are struggling to find acceptable and feasible ways to reach and maintain that goal and, at the same time, to reach the twin goal of improving the quality of their children\u2019s education. This case, in which there are such disagreements and in which the defendants are engaged in a good faith effort to reach those goals, is the quintessential case for deference to the policy choice of the legislative branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The majority concludes its opinion with a rhetorical invocation of its oath of office as a justification for its decision. That same oath of office, however, embraces the concept of judicial respect for the legitimate policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>choices of the legislative branch, even when judges disagree with those choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Only twelve years ago, we stated: \u201cThis court has never viewed constitutional language as newly descended from the firmament like fresh fallen snow upon which jurists may trace out their individual notions of public policy uninhibited by the history which attended the adoption of the particular phraseology at issue and the intentions of its authors. The faith which democratic societies repose in the written document as a shield against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power would be illusory if those vested with the responsibility for construing and applying disputed provisions were free to stray from the purposes of the originators.\u201d <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 62. In this case, that snow has now fallen, and the shield against the arbitrary exercise of power has been shattered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> I recognize the seriousness of these criticisms of the majority opinion, and it pains me to express them. I do so only because, in my view, the adjudicative process by which the majority\u2019s decision has been reached is so seriously flawed, because the opinion departs so radically from how this case was tried in the trial court and was briefed and argued on appeal, and because the resulting analysis so completely disregards the previously established principles governing the issues in the case, that I can come to no other conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> The trial court specifically found that education \u201cin its fullest sense\u201d for all schoolchildren involves interracial and multiethnic exposure to each other and interaction between them, because racial and ethnic isolation has negative effects on both groups. Our state constitution, however, guarantees students a substantially equal educational opportunity; <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 615; not education \u201cin its fullest sense,\u201d and neither the plaintiffs nor the majority claim otherwise. Moreover, as the trial court found and as the defendants note in their brief in this court, \u201cthe state has had and continues to have as a long-standing goal the reduction of racial and ethnic concentrations of students, and has implemented . . . numerous programs and initiatives . . . precisely to encourage this result. The defendants have always believed that all of our citizens benefit from integrated schools in an integrated society.\u201d This long-standing state commitment to, and effort to achieve, the racial and ethnic integration of our schools is demonstrated by a host of statutory, funding and administrative programs and policies, and is not disputed by the plaintiffs or the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The trial court specifically found, for instance, that Connecticut is one of only three states that has voluntarily adopted legislation designed to promote integration of the schools, and is one of only seven states that expend funds on programs to integrate the schools without a court order. In 1969, the state enacted No. 773 of the 1969 Public Acts entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools,\u201d now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 10-226a et seq., which requires school districts to maintain student populations that reflect the racial makeup of the student population in the district. The state department of education has consistently and vigorously enforced this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">On an interdistrict basis, the state has, for more than twenty-five years, helped to fund Project Concern, one of the nation\u2019s first voluntary interdistrict programs designed to promote the integration of the schools. In addition, the state supplies technical assistance and funds for constructing interdistrict magnet schools, and has established the Interdistrict Cooperative Grant Program, which encourages the interdistrict placement of students. General Statutes \u00a7 10-74d. In 1993, the state enacted No. 93-263 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the 1993 Public Acts entitled \u201cAn Act Improving Educational Quality and Diversity,\u201d now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 10-264a et seq. This act establishes regional advisory boards to plan for increased interdistrict diversity and provides grants to fund such plans.</p>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">Furthermore, since 1979, the state\u2019s educational funding formula has been weighted in favor of districts with high concentrations of poor students, and since 1989 the formula has provided additional funds for remedial educational programs. The purpose and effect of the formula is to provide the most state aid to the neediest school districts. Indeed, in the 1991-92 school year, 1 he state provided $4915 per pupil in educational aid to Hartford, representing more than two and one-half times the average per pupil aid provided to the twenty-one suburban towns with which the Hartford school district is compared in this case. In addition, the state provides funds, calculated according to the financial need of the recipient school districts, for school construction, student transportation and special education.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">Moreover, the department of education has established a Priority School District Program, which targets the eight largest cities in the state, including Hartford, for improvement of student achievement and enhancement of educational opportunities. In 1992, the department established an Office of Urban and Priority School Districts, the purpose of which is \u201c \u2018to concentrate the resources of the department on the problems of the cities, and more specifically to improve the achievement of students in the three largest urban districts,\u2019 \u201d including Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">I do not, by recounting these state policies and programs, suggest that the state is doing everything possible to solve the terribly difficult problem of racial and ethnic concentration in our public schools. There undoubtedly is more that can and should be done. I recount these steps only to underscore that the goal of achieving integrated schools is shared by the state, which neither the plaintiffs nor the majority dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> I am puzzled by the majority\u2019s facile and unexplained reference to the \u201cracial <em>and ethnic </em>divide.\u201d (Emphasis added.) I am certainly aware of the history of racial discrimination in this nation, although it must be said that, in this state, such discrimination has never been state sponsored or maintained, and that our state has a long tradition of legal hostility to private racial discrimination. I am also aware of the current, and past, pattern of difficulties between whites and blacks; no one who lives, works, reads and watches television could be unaware of that pattern in the nation at large and in this state as well. This pattern of difficulties is what I understand the term \u201cracial divide\u201d to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">I am unaware, however, of an \u201cethnic divide,\u201d at least in our state, that is analogous or similar to the racial divide between whites and blacks. I am unaware of any similar history of ethnic discrimination in this state \u2014 private or public \u2014 or of any pattern of difficulties between any particular ethnic groups. The majority assumes, apparently, although it does not appear in this record, that there is such a pattern, amounting to a divide, between Hispanics and \u2014 what? other ethnic groups? \u201cwhites\u201d of other ethnic groups? African-Americans? Asian-Americans?</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">It is true that, historically, various ethnic groups have, at various times, either sought to assimilate themselves into our state\u2019s culture, or to add to that culture in a different way, namely, by eschewing assimilation and maintaining their ethnic language and customs, or by a combination of both. I have not thought, however, that this process constituted an \u201cethnic divide\u201d that required a constitutional cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Thus, the majority apparently is aware of a social phenomenon that escapes both this record and me. The reference to \u201cethnic divide\u201d may sound politically correct \u2014 although I doubt even that, in today\u2019s climate that celebrates cultural diversity rather than ethnic assimilation \u2014 but its meaning is a mystery to me.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\"> Similarly, equally bereft of factual support in this record, and equally contradicted by the factual findings of the trial <em>court, are </em>the majority\u2019s references to \u201cthe severe handicaps that burden these children\u2019s education\u201d as a result of their racial and ethnic isolation; \u201cthe educational impairment that results from segregation in the Hartford public school's\u201d; and the \u201cpervasive and invidious impact on schools\u201d resulting from that isolation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> L. Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author (1922).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\"> Although this case involves only the school districts of the greater Hartford area, no one can pretend that the constitutional violation found by the majority does not also directly apply to the school districts of the greater New Haven and Bridgeport areas, and perhaps other urban school districts as well. Furthermore, although the majority does not address them, the necessary implications of the majority opinion must also apply to <em>every </em>school district in the state, as I discuss later in this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\"> Because I agree with the majority that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are justiciable and that there is state action, I do not address part II of the majority opinion. My discussion, therefore, is confined to part III of the majority opinion, which addresses the merits of the constitutional claim of a deprivation of equal educational opportunity, and part IV, which addresses the issue of a remedy for the deprivation that the majority finds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> For ease of reference throughout this opinion, the claims are listed in the order in which they were presented in the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to this court, which is not the same as the order in which they appeared in the complaint. Substantively, however, there is no difference between the two sets of claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\"> It is difficult for me to square the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Hartford school district suffers from a deprivation of educational resources, relative to those of the surrounding districts, with the plaintiffs\u2019 simultaneous and consistent insistence that this is not a school funding case, as was <em>Horton I. </em>Because resources are directly tied to funding, it is obvious to me that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>at least to the extent that their constitutional claim rests on a disparity in resources, it comes squarely within the rubric of <em>Horton I </em>and, therefore, would also be subject to the same requirements of proof as are required under that rubric, namely, that the quality of education is diminished because of the diminished resources made available. See <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 637-38. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that my difficulty is resolved because the trial court found as a matter of fact that the disparities in educational resources claimed by the plaintiffs do not exist, and that finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> I The plaintiffs have never claimed, either in the trial court or this court, that economic status \u2014 their concent ration of poverty \u2014 alone entities them to relief in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\"> I regret that my discussion of the trial court record is as lengthy and detailed as it is. It is because, however, the majority has so dramatically altered the nature of the claims presented to the trial court and to this court, and in doing so has so plainly ignored the voluminous trial court proceedings to the contrary, that the length and detail is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b84-11\"> The plaintiffs had brought this action in May, 1989. After the defendants had unsuccessfully challenged by motion certain aspects of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the case was tried for approximately eleven weeks in late 1992 and early 1993. Thereafter, in November, 1994, the plaintiffs filed their revised complaint, upon which the case was to be decided by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">In April, 1995, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision, the gravamen of which was that the plaintiffs had not established the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>state action as the cause of the conditions of which they complained. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs promptly appealed. Before any briefs were filed in this court, we held a special session in order to ensure that the record would contain all the factual findings necessary to a full consideration and determination of the appeal. Thereafter, on May 11,1995, we remanded the case to the trial court for supplemental findings of fact, based on the understandings that (1) there were considerable areas of factual agreement between the parties, and (2) there were also considerable areas of factual disagreement that had been litigated during the eleven weeks of trial. Thus, we ordered that: (1) to the extent that the parties agreed on certain facts, they present those facts by way of stipulation to the trial court for its approval; (2) to the extent that they disagreed on facts, each side present to the trial court a proposed finding of facts that it claimed to have proven; and (3) the trial court issue its finding of facts to resolve the disputed facts as disclosed by the parties\u2019 proposed findings of fact. As indicated later in this dissent, the parties and the trial court complied with our remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\"> The plaintiffs stated: \u201cArticle First, Section 20, which was adopted in 1965 . . . expressly prohibits both segregation as well as discrimination. And notice the Constitution does not say \u2018de jure segregation.\u2019 It says \u2018segregation.\u2019 This is a de facto segregation case . . . and de facto segregation is a form of segregation. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u201cThe complaint . . . has four counts. The first count basically says that de facto segregation is inherently unequal. And this draws on <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>[374 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954)], that separate but equal is inherently unequal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u201cNow ... we tend to forget, when we\u2019re just thinking about this first count, that slavery, even in Connecticut, was not completely abolished until the end of the Civil War. And I\u2019m saying Connecticut, not the South. In Connecticut it was legal until that time. So, to perpetuate \u2014 and for the state to say there\u2019s nothing wrong with a virtually all minority school system simply perpetuates this badge of inferiority, and it does so in two ways.</p>\n<p id=\"A_B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201cFirst of all, poor minorities have no opportunity to interact with the white population. And the other side is, the white population has no opportunity to interact with them, and so it just means more racial stereotypes and economic stereotypes on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag0\">\u201cMore fundamentally . . . because the Equal Protection Clause expressly prohibits segregation, what difference does it make what the evidence shows about its effects?

Integration is required as a matter of principle by the Connecticut Constitution, and that should be the end of that.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u201cSo, Your Honor, as we present evidence over the next few weeks, on the second through the fourth counts of the complaint about the ill effects of segregation, Your Honor should not lose sight of the first count, for the first count requires no evidence other than the fact of segregation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">It is true that, as this transcript indicates, the plaintiffs initially analogize the first count to the concept of inherent inequality derived from the principle of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d that the United States Supreme Court condemned in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 347 U.S. 495. It cannot be tenably maintained, however, that these few oral statements, taken in their immediate context and in the context of all of the subsequent instances in which the plaintiffs articulated their claims to the trial court and this court, support the reading of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of equal educational opportunity created by the majority. Indeed, I do not read even the majority opinion to rest on the extravagant claim \u2014 wholly unsupported by any evidence in this record \u2014 that the feelings of inferiority inflicted on the schoolchildren in <em>Brown </em>by the state mandated separation of the races is present in any of these plaintiffs as a result of demographic factors over which the state has no control. As I discuss later in this dissent, moreover, <em>Brown </em>is not pertinent here generally; and even the badge of inferiority rightfully condemned in <em>Brown </em>rested on evidence in and findings of the <em>Brown </em>trial court, both of which are significantly absent from this record.</p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">Moreover, and \u201cmore fundamentally,\u201d as the plaintiffs put it to the trial court, their claim under the first count rested, not on any such considerations, but on the meaning of \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20.1 also discuss the merits of that claim later in this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AM\"> The plaintiffs stated: \u201c[T]he second count has to do with whether or not segregation is unequal as a matter of fact, whether racial and economic isolation is unequal as a matter of fact.

In discussing (his claim, the plaintiffs referred to the testimony of many witnesses to buttress their position that they were not receiving an equal educational opportunity. They argued that the racial and ethnic isolation in the Hartford schools, combined with the inadequate and unequal educational conditions, deprived them of an equal educational opportunity. They stated: <em>\u201cIn light, of the severe educational inequities </em>imposed on a student population already suffering serious harms from extreme levels of racial and economic isolation, it cannot be claimed that plaintiffs and other Hartford students are receiving equal educational opportunity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In their posttrial reply brief, the plaintiffs identified \u201c[t]he central issue before this court [as] whether the most racially and economically isolated children in the state <em>who are performing the worst academically with the least amount of resources </em>are entitled to judicial protection to ensure that their constitutional right to [an] equal educational opportunity is realized.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">In their closing oral arguments to the trial court, the plaintiffs again made clear the factual basis of (heir equal educational opportunity claim. They argued that the effect of three factors, taken together \u2014 racial isolation, concentration of poverty and inadequate resources \u2014 deprives them of an equal educational opportunity. Later, they quoted from their posttrial brief: \u201cThe facts are (hat Hartford children go to school in poverty-concentrated and racially isolated schools <em>withmit resources. </em>Even for high-achieving students, the system\u2019s racial isolation <em>and the inadequate resources have harmful effects </em>....

They claimed that the insertion of the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, provided an \u201cindependent basis\u201d upon which they should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In their closing oral arguments, the plaintiffs again distinguished their equal educational opportunity claim from their per se segregation claim. Their counsel stated: \u201cI spent a lot of time on the term segregation and discrimination in article first, \u00a7 20, and I just want to make it clear that our primary argument is under <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill </em>[and the] equal protection clause in its traditional sense, plus article eight, \u00a7 1, namely every student in the state is entitled to an equal educational opportunity.\u201d Later, they reiterated that their per se segregation claim differed from their equal educational opportunity claim: \u201cUnder our first count, the racial segregation itself violates article first, \u00a7 20 of the Connecticut constitution in the exercise of the fundamental right to education.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b88-11\"> Our May 11, 1995 order directed the parties to \u201cidentify, by appropriate headings, those legal claims presented to the trial court. . . .\u201d The plaintiffs listed 121 disputed facts that they claimed to have proven in the trial court, under the heading, \u201cDoes the Racial, Ethnic and Economic Isolation and Poverty Concentration Coupled with Disparities in Resources and Outcomes Violate Plaintiffs Right to Equal Educational Opportunities Under Article Eighth, Section 1 and Article First, Sections 1 and 20?\u201d Those 121 claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>facts are grouped under subheadings that involve matters such as: the socioeconomic status of the Hartford metropolitan area students; the links between racial and economic isolation; the effects of integration; the disparities in educational resources between the Hartford and suburban districts, including staffing and curriculum, instructional services, supplies, library resources, equipment, and plants and facilities; and the disparities between the Hartford and suburban districts in educational outcomes, including mastery test scores, credits earned, scholastic aptitude test scores, graduation and drop-out rates, and patterns of postsecondary activities. These are the facts that the plaintiffs sought to have the trial court find in support of their constitutional claim that they have been deprived of an equal educational opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\"> The court also found that two other factors that generally explain any poorer performance of minority students, namely, the failure of a school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>system to offer culturally sensitive programs and patterns of institutional discrimination reflecting discrimination in society as a whole, are notpresent in and do <em>not apply to </em>the Hartford public schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\"> In contrast, the second claim, that of per se segregation, is a purely legal claim, resting solely on the meaning of the term \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20, as applied to the right to a free public education guaranteed by article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the state constitution. This claim, unlike the claims of a lack of an equal educational opportunity and a lack of a minimally adequate education, rests solely on the undisputed facts of racial and ethnic concentra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tion. Under this claim, and only under this claim, the plaintiffs argue that the term \u201csegregation\u201d as applied to education includes de facto racial and ethnic concentration to the degree present in the Hartford schools. Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 briefs make clear that this legal claim is separate and distinct from the claims of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity and of a deprivation of a minimally adequate education, and has nothing to do with such deprivations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> The plaintiffs follow this introduction with an explanatory footnote so that we would have no trouble understanding their argument, relating the counts of their complaint specifically to their issues raised on appeal. They state as follows in page 1, footnote 1, of their appellate brief: \u201cThe Complaint is in [three] counts: first, that because Hartford metropolitan area schools are segregated on the basis of race, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status, <em>and because the Hartford schools are educationally deficient when compared to the suburban schools, </em>defendants have failed to provide plaintiffs <em>an equal opportunity to a free public education </em>as required by Article First, \u00a7\u00a7 .1 and 20 and Article Eighth, \u00a7 1 of the Connecticut Constitution, (Issue II on appeal); second, that the sharp segregation on the basis of race and ethnic background in Hartford metropolitan area public schools, <em>by itself, </em>violates Article First, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20 and Article Eighth, \u00a7 1 of the Connecticut Constitution, (Issue III on appeal); third, that the Hartford public schools <em>are educationally deficient and fail to provide a majority of Hartford schoolchildren with a minimally adequate education, </em>measured by the state\u2019s own standards, and this violates Article First, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20 and Article Eighth, \u00a7 1, (now Issue IV) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> Because the majority did not address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a deprivation of a minimally adequate education, I do not address that claim in this part of this dissent, and do so later in my consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims as they are properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\"> In light, of the plaintiffs\u2019 repeated insistence that this is not a school funding case, however, this reference to <em>Horton I </em>can only be understood as an argument that the reasoning of <em>Horton I, </em>transplanted from the realm of financing inequities to the realm of racial and ethnic concentration, applies to this case. The plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent discussion bears out this understanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> The plaintiffs assert: \u201cThe court below erroneously found that students in the Hartford metropolitan area are provided equal educational opportunities.\u201d In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court \u201ccommitted error by completely bypassing analysis of disparities in the provision of materials, books and supplies and course offerings, <em>by similarly neglecting the wide disparity in test scores, and by disregarding the impact of racial and ethnic isolation and the concentration of poverty </em>in reaching [its] conclusion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, in the trial court the plaintiffs had presented expert testimony regarding the educational impact of racial and ethnic isolation, and the plaintiffs complain in this court that the trial court was required to find accordingly because, in the plaintiffs\u2019 view, there was \u201cno evidence in the record to show that all of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts were unworthy of belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In the same vein, the plaintiffs continue their attack on the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the quality of the education provided to the plaintiffs by referring back to a detailed summary of their evidence in the trial court. At pages 7 through 24 of their appellate brief, under the heading \u201cUnequal and Inadequate Education,\u201d the plaintiffs present a detailed summary of their trial court evidence that, they maintain, demonstrates as a factual matter that they are being deprived of an equal educational opportunity as a result of their racial and ethnic isolation. This factual recitation further demonstrates that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding an equal educational opportunity rests on a factual matrix that combines the racial and ethnic isolation of the Hartford district, the claimed economic plight of the district and the educational deficiencies claimed to result from that isolation and plight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\"> In their reply brief, the plaintiffs state: \u201cThe trial court . . . succumbed to [an] error of law by failing to consider the totality of circumstances facing Hartford schoolchildren and how <em>racial segregation, the concentration of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>poor children in the schools, and disparities in educational resources, including facilities and equipment, among other things, deprive children of substantially equal educational opportunities. </em>Notwithstanding defendants\u2019 portrayal, this case is not simply about the extreme racial isolation of the Hartford schools, although that, too, is a ground for relief. Neither is the case solely about the deficiencies in educational resources or the vast differences in educational outcomes. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of denial, of equal educational opportunity is about all of these harms together, just as they are experienced every day in the classroom.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\"> I can find nothing in this voluminous record to support this assertion of the majority, insofar as it purports to refer to the claim of equal educational opportunity. Indeed, the majority does not, because it cannot, quote or summarize any part of this record that supports the assertion. Moreover, 1he assertion is curious, to say the least, because the minority does not state that the theory of equal educational opportunity that it has created <em>was </em>briefed in the trial court or this court. Rather, the majority asserts that \u201c[t]he constitutional implications\u201d of that theory were addressed. I do not know what that means.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">It may refer to the fact that the parties fully briefed and argued the question of the meaning of \u201csegregation\u201d in article first, \u00a7 20. The parties addressed that issue, however, as part of the plaintiffs\u2019 per se segregation claim, which the plaintiffs themselves had separated from their equal educational opportunity claim. To the extent that this legal issue is in the case under that rubric, however, I acknowledge that it has been fully addressed by the parties. In my view, that does not substitute for giving the parties an opportunity to address its consequences for a claim, based on <em>Horton I, </em>that the plaintiffs have been deprived of an equal educational opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> The majority also asks whether the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings \u201cfairly can be read to encompass such a challenge.\u201d It concludes that \u201cthe plaintiffs can succeed if any of their claims falls within the constitutional right <em>as we have defined it. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> The majority asserts simply that \u201cas a pleading matter, [the plaintiffs\u2019] claims were stated in two counts rather than in one.\u201d On the contrary, the majority has taken two separate and independent claims, chopped them up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and recombined them into a third, and different, claim that no one \u2014 not even the plaintiffs \u2014 had ever made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b106-5\"> In numerous other passages, the court in <em>Horton I </em>emphasized the factual, causal connection between per pupil expenditure and quality of education. See <em>Horton I, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 638 (\u201cthat variations in money available to different towns produce variations in quality of instruction; that the financing system discriminates against pupils in Canton because the breadth and quality of the education they receive is to a substantial degree narrower and lower than that which pupils receive in comparable towns with larger tax bases and a greater ability to finance education\u201d); id., 645 (\u201cThe wealth discrimination found among school districts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class suffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>relative rather than absolute. Further, the children living in towns with relatively low assessable property values are afforded public education but, as the trial court; found, the education they receive is to a substantial degree narrower and lower in quality than that which pupils receive in comparable towns with a larger tax base and greater ability to finance education. True, the state has mandated local provision for a basic educational program with local option for a program of higher quality but, as the trial court\u2019s finding indicates, that option to a town which lacks the resources to implement the higher quality educational program which it desires and which is available to property-richer towns is highly illusory.\u201d); id., 648 (\u201cThe present-day problem arises from the circumstance that over the years there has arisen a great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education, which has given rise to a consequent significant disparity in the quality of education available to the youth of the state. It was well stated in the memorandum of decision of the trial court, which noted that the \u2018present method [of financing education in the state] is the result of legislation in which the state delegates to municipalities of disparate financial capability the state\u2019s duty of raising funds for operating public schools within that municipality. That legislation gives no consideration to the financial capability of the municipality to raise funds sufficient to discharge another duty delegated to the municipality by the state, that of educating the children within that municipality. The evidence in this case is that, as a result of this duty-delegating to Canton without regard to Canton\u2019s financial capabilities, pupils in Canton receive an education that is in a substantial degree lower in both breadth and quality than that received by pupils in municipalities with a greater financial capability, even though there is no difference between the constitutional duty of the state to the children in Canton and the constitutional duty of the state to the children in other towns.\u2019 \u201d); id., 652 (\u201cObviously, absolute equality or precisely equal advantages are not required and cannot be attained except in the most relative sense. Logically, the state may recognize differences in educational costs based on relevant economic and educational factors and on course offerings of special interest in diverse communities. None of the basic alternative plans to equalize the ability of various towns to finance education requires that all towns spend the same amount, for the education of each pupil. The very uncertainty of the extent of the nexus between dollar input, and quality of educational opportunity requires allowance for variances as do individual and group disadvantages and local conditions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> In <em>Horton I, </em>supra 172 Conn. 621-22, the defendants unsuccessfully challenged \u201cthe trial court\u2019s findings concerning the quality of education in Canton and the relation between expenditures and the quality of education.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> In this connection, I note that this case also differs markedly from <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954). I do so only because the majority, although not relying directly on <em>Brown, </em>invokes some of its language regarding the importance of education, with which all involved in this case agree. Although <em>Brown </em>involved intentionally segregated schools, which this case does not, and therefore differs in its legal posture, it also differs from this case in a significant factual respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In <em>Brown, </em>the decision rested in significant part on the trial court\u2019s finding that state-sponsored segregation inflicts feelings of inferiority and stigmatization on the African-American students. Id., 494. This was an important part of the foundation for the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that separate schools are inherently unequal. Id., 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">There is no such finding in the present case. Were there such a finding, this might well be a very different case before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> The plaintiffs recognize this essential factual underpinning of <em>Horton I. </em>They sought to persuade the trial court of their claimed factual analogues to that underpinning, and they seek to persuade us that the trial court\u2019s contrary findings are clearly erroneous. The defendants also recognize the critical nature of those factual underpinnings. Only the majority invokes <em>Horton I </em>while simultaneously discarding as irrelevant that essential factual basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> Thus, when the majority asserts that the state\u2019s constitutional obligation includes the \u201cduty to remedy <em>the educational impairment that results from </em>[de facto] <em>segregation\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added); the majority ignores the facts of this case. Those facts are that the \u201cinjuries\u201d of which the plaintiffs complain, namely, the diminished educational opportunities claimed to result from a combination of racial and ethnic concentration and concentration of poverty, do not result therefrom but result solely from poverty. Consequently, the majority is forced to resort to the general effects on education of racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and ethnic concentration, and to elevate those effects to the level of a constitutional mandate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\"> Even if this were the defendants\u2019 only argument on appeal, moreover, its weakness would not be a sufficient ground on which the plaintiffs should prevail.

This analysis also must mean, therefore, that \u201csegregation\u201d has some meaning independent of \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d because: (1) they are different words; and (2) during the convention, the word \u201csegregation\u201d was reinserted into the text, which already contained the word \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> This case demonstrates the point.

On the other hand, we have to realize that today <em>the philosophy of segregation </em>is something that is in the minds of all of us. It would be regrettable if it should be in any way suggested that this Constitution did not unequivocally oppose the <em>philosophy and, the practice of segregation. </em>So 1 move this amendment as reading veiy definitely that it in no way limits the rights of anyone.

I am proud to make that statement because this legislation has been the work of successive legislators through several different administrations.

As the trial court found in this case, some examples of this include: legislation outlawing racial discrimination in hotels, restaurants, transportation facilities and places ofpublic amusements, which had been in place since 1905, and had been significantly expanded in 1953 and 1961; legislation outlawing discrimination in public employment, which had been in place since 1936, and had been expanded to private employment in 1947, and to public housing in 1949; and legislation creating the nation\u2019s first civil rights commission in 1943.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> Indeed, Bernstein, who introduced the resolution for article eighth, \u00a7 1, and who was one of two speakers on the question, did not mention either <em>Brown </em>or article first, \u00a7 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, <em>moreover, to </em>the extent that the reach of <em>Brown </em>was unclear in 1965, the weight of the available authority, which was confirmed by the United States Supreme Court in 1971; <em>Swann v. Board of Education, </em>402 U.S. 1, 6, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L.

The two cases that the majority cites for such speculative reliance by the convention delegates do not support it. <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>45 N.J. 161, 177-78, 212 A.2d 1 (1965), holds that the New Jersey commissioner of education has authority to reduce de facto segregation on the basis of state law and policy. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Township of Morris School District, </em>58 N.J. 483, 497-98, 279 A.2d 619 (1971), while holding the same, collects cases from 1966, not 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b139-5\"> I recognize that my comments in this respect are premised on the notion that the majority\u2019s interpretation of article first, \u00a7 20, constitutes a significant change from preexisting interpretations of that article, even in the educational context, and even giving due regard to the difference in language between the federal equal protection provision and this article. This premise is valid, nonetheless, particularly because the majority\u2019s analysis rests on the concurrent proposition that \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201csegregation\u201d have dual meanings: one when applied to education under article eighth, \u00a7 1; and an opposite one when applied to all other civil and political rights. Given this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>premise, one would have expected some comment explicating the startling linguistic and jurisprudential path by which the majority has read the two provisions together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> For example, the plaintiffs presented William Gordon as an expert in, among other things, \u201cdesegregation planning, desegregation techniques and equity analysis.\u201d He testified that he had never \u201cseen an interdistrict remedy that was put into effect that didn\u2019t have some type of Court order.\u201d He also testified regarding the need for a planning process to develop an integration plan, the relative merits of different types of such plans, such as controlled choice, magnet schools and educational parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The plaintiffs also offered Gary Oldfield as \u201can expert in the analysis of desegregation remedies, and the relationships between segregation and desegregation and opportunity.\u201d He testified about the conditions under which implementation of a desegregation plan can succeed, the role of teacher involvement in desegregation plans, the role of transportation plans, the use of a housing component, and the role of the court in such remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The plaintiffs also introduced the depositions of two other witnesses that covered the question of remedies. John Mannix\u2019 deposition testimony covered the question of busing, scattered housing in the suburbs and magnet schools. Gerald Tirozzi\u2019s deposition testimony dealt with past efforts to remedy racial isolation and concentrations of poverty, and the relative merits of various approaches to integration plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">The defendants presented Christine Eossell as their primary witness on the question of remedy. She testified regarding: a comparison of the effectiveness of mandatory, as opposed to voluntary, desegregation plans; the merits of controlled choice plans; and the factors necessary to consider in bringing about stable integration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\"> Indeed, these figures constitute a combination of the percentages of African-American and Hispanic students in the Hartford schools. Thus, underlying the majority\u2019s entire thesis of the constitutional need to remedy racial and ethnic isolation in the schools of our state is the unfounded assumption that, for purposes of measuring diversity in those schools, these two groups constitute a monolithic cultural entity. In my view, such an assumption is insulting to both groups. In fact, viewed through a somewhat different prism \u2014 viewing these two groups not as culturally monolithic but as culturally different \u2014 a school system like Hartford\u2019s can be seen as more culturally diverse than an all white school system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> A second significant factor that compels the drastic implications of the majority\u2019s opinion is its definition of \u201csegregation\u201d as used in article first, \u00a7 20, when applied to education under article eighth, \u00a7 1. This definition does not require any state intent to bring about racial or ethnic concentration, and it appears to require that there be no significant disparities in the racial and ethnic makeup of various school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">A third such factor is the majority\u2019s rationale for that definition. That rationale is based on the recognition of the general social benefits of a racially and ethnically integrated educational setting and of the general social burdens of a racially and ethnically concentrated educational setting. It deems irrelevant, however, the specific factual findings in this case, which are that the educational deficiencies of the Hartford school district of which the plaintiffs in this case complain arise from the concentration of poverty in Hartford, and not from the racial and ethnic concentration in the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">A fourth factor is the language of article first, \u00a7 20, itself. That language prohibits discrimination or segregation, not only because of race or ethnicity, but also because of religion. There is nothing in the language or history of article first, \u00a7 20, to suggest that it embodies a hierarchy of protected classes. Indeed, it would be Orwellian, and antithetical to the entire equal protection premise of article first, \u00a7 20, to read it as embodying a principle that some classes are more equal than others. It follows, therefore, that religious concentration in public schools, not resulting from a state intent, must be treated the same as racial and ethnic concentration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> I do not address the implications of the majority opinion for other racial and ethnic groups, such as Asian-Americans, Polish-Americans and Italian-Americans, not because I do not think there are such implications, but because attempting to figure them out at this point is beyond my capability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"> In fact, there are vast areas of the state, such as Litchfield, Tolland and Windham counties, where it will be difficult if not impossible to find sufficient minority students to comply with the majority\u2019s mandate. In these areas, even broadly drawn regional school districts will be constitutionally deficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\"> I have only mentioned what I assume are, in terms ol' our population, the three major religions in the state. It may be that other religions, such as Islam, will also have to be taken into account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> Indeed, that is precisely the remedy that the plaintiffs sought in the trial court on an interdistrict basis. Moreover, the trial court also found that students who live in an environment of concentrated poverty bring with them to school the array of social disadvantages associated with poverty that seriously hinder academic achievement, and that it is those disadvantages, rather than racial and ethnic isolation, that are the primary causes of educational difficulties. These findings are supported by the evidence in this case. Furthermore, although the majority has deemed these findings to be irrelevant to its constitutional analysis, I do not read the majority opinion to reject them as unfounded. Thus, after the legislature has undertaken the process of realigning school district lines and transporting students so as to achieve the constitutionally mandated degree of racial, ethnic and religious integration, under the findings in this case the poverty stricken students of our urban areas will carry their educational disadvantages with them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\"> I recognize that these implications do not take into account the fact that the majority\u2019s conclusions rest in part on the fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 racial and ethnic isolation is also accompanied by a concentration of poverty. I nonetheless think that the implications are present and are necessary, because the constitutional underpinnings of the majority\u2019s conclusion that the existing district lines must be changed are that: (1) a racially and ethnically integrated educational system carries benefits that a concentrated system does not, and is free of burdens that a segregated system imposes; and (2) \u201csegregation\u201d under article first, \u00a7 20, means de facto racial and ethnic separation. Neither of these notions has anything to do with poverty or its effects. Indeed, the majority has deemed irrelevant to its constitutional analysis the findings in this case that all of the educational deficiencies that the plaintiffs attribute to the Hartford school system are attributable to the environment of poverty in which the families of the students live, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to their racial and ethnic isolation. Thus, under the majority\u2019s analysis, at the end of the day, the fact of the plaintiffs\u2019 concentration of poverty is constitutionally irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\"> There is a fourth claim, namely, that the defendants have failed \u201cto remedy the racial, ethnic and economic isolation and lack of educational resources despite their long-standing knowledge of the harmful effects of these conditions.\u201d Because this claim presupposes that the plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation that requires the defendants to have remedied, and because I conclude that the plaintiffs have not done so, it is not necessary to address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\"> Although I disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there is no state action involved, the facts found by the trial court and the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>legal principles compel a judgment for the defendants on the merits of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> Some of these specific findings are as follows. The generally poorer academic performance of African-American and Hispanic students is explained for the most part, not by their racial and ethnic isolation, but by the social and economic conditions under which their families live. Thus, it \"is poverty and not race that is a principal causal factor in lower educational achievement.\u201d The problems of the Hartford school district arise from the fact that the minorities in it are primarily poor, and the \u201creal correlation with academic achievement is socioeconomic class rather than race . . . .\u201d Children who live in poverty do not do well in statewide academic testing because they carry with them the social disadvantages of their poverty, and not because they are racially or ethnically isolated. This is demonstrated further by the fact that poor white children exhibit the same educational patterns as poor minority children, because poverty, and the concentration thereof, is the strongest predictor of diminished academic achievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Thus, the court specifically found that virtually \u201call of the differences in performance between Hartford students and those in other towns, as well as differences in college attendance, can be explained by differences in socioeconomic status and the background factors that socioeconomic status represents.\u201d Among these background factors are the heightened \u201cmobility\u201d of the Hartford students, and the limited English proficiency of many of them. In this connection, the court also found that it is possible statistically to separate the educational effects of poverty from those of racial isolation, which the plaintiffs\u2019 experts had not done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> Specifically, the trial court found that the scores serve purposes that are not related to measuring interdistrict performance, and that it would be an abuse of their purposes to use them for such a measurement. Moreover, the court found that the scores should not be seen to be caused by racial and ethnic isolation, because the results could be related to other factors that have not been considered in that context. The test scores cannot serve as abasis for interdistrict comparisons because they do not take into account other significant factors, such as socioeconomic status, environmental deprivations at home, diminished motivation to succeed, the number of students with limited English proficiency, and the extraordinary mobility of the Hartford student population. The court also found that, because school officials have no control over where their students live or the conditions under which they live, the officials are notin aposition to remedy the severe disadvantages that their students bring with them to school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"><em> </em>In this connection, the plaintiffs also refer to \u201cother measures of achievement such as drop-out rate, graduation rate, SAT scores and college attendance.\u201d Although these do not involve any goals or standards set by the state, the plaintiffs link them with the mastery test scores.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
