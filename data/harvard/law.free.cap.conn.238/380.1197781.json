We answer this question in the affirmative and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The facts of this case are set forth in the majority opinion of the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>39 Conn. App. 550, 665 A.2d 152 (1995). \u201cOn January 6, 1993, an application for a search warrant, including a supporting affidavit, was submitted to and signed by a judge of the Superior Court. The information in the affidavit may be summarized as follows. On <em>January 6, 1992, </em>Anthony Battistone and Arvid Leftwich, detectives with the Hartford police department (affiants), met with a confidential informant who told them that the defendant was selling drugs and that the defendant lived in the first floor apartment at 57 Benton Street in Hartford. The informant stated that he had been in the defendant\u2019s apartment when another man came in and asked for a \u2018package.\u2019 \u2018Package\u2019 is the street term for 100 single packets of heroin. The man then handed the defendant money. The defendant took the money and told the informant to follow him to the basement. Once in the basement, the defendant told the informant to open the icebox and to remove a red plastic bag containing heroin. The defendant then opened a gray safe on the floor of the basement that contained more heroin and money. The defendant brought the heroin to the man and the informant then left the apartment and contacted the affiants.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe informant worked with the affiants to conduct a controlled purchase of narcotics from the defendant\u2019s residence. Information about the controlled purchase formed the basis for a search warrant that, according to the affidavit, was executed on <em>January 6,1992. </em>The affidavit does not describe the controlled purchase but provides the following: \u2018See Hartford Police Case Number 93-922 for information concerning the controlled purchase.\u2019 The affidavit also provides that when the affiants executed the first of two search warrants on <em>January 6, 1992, </em>a woman named Alida Nieves, who lived with the defendant, said that the drugs were in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the basement. On the basis of that information, the affiants obtained a second search warrant for the basement area of 57 Benton Street. The affidavit was signed and dated <em>January 6, 1993, </em>by the affiants and the issuing judge. The warrant was also signed and dated <em>January 6,1993. </em>The search yielded $11,761 in cash, a clear- plastic bag containing a white powdery substance, 414 yellow glassine bags containing a white powdery substance, a scale, a grinder, a bottle of white lactose powder, and other drug paraphernalia. The defendant was arrested and charged with possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependentin violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> conspiracy to distribute narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 2 la-278 (b) and 53a-48,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(a).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 551-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the second warrant on the ground that the information contained in the supporting affidavit was stale. In support of his motion he noted that the affidavit supporting the second warrant was signed on January 6,1995, but referred to information allegedly obtained on January 6, 1995. The state responded that the references to 1992 in the challenged affidavit were obvious scrivener\u2019s errors that did not invalidate the warrant. Id., 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On January 5,1994, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, in an oral decision from the bench, holding that it found no reasonable grounds to infer that the challenged dates were scrivener\u2019s errors and that, accordingly, there was no \u201ctimely probable cause.\u201d Id., 553-54. Thereafter, on January 26,1994, the state represented that it was unable to proceed with its prosecution against the defendant without the suppressed evidence, and, on the basis of that representation, the trial court dismissed the charges against the defendant. Id., 554. The trial court then granted the state permission to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The Appellate Court, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Applying the \u201cfour comers\u201d rule strictly, it concluded that there was no basis within the four comers of the affidavit to infer that the references to the year 1992 were scrivener\u2019s errors and, therefore, that the challenged search warrant was based on stale information when it was executed. Id., 559. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The standards for upholding a search warrant are well established. We uphold \u201cthe validity of [the] warrant . . . [if] the affidavit at issue presented a substantial factual basis for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 215, 613 A.2d 224 (1992). \u201c[T]he magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented. When a magistrate has determined that the warrant affidavit presents sufficient objective indicia of reliability to justify a search and has issued a warrant, a court reviewing that warrant at a subsequent suppression hearing should defer to the reasonable inferences drawn by the magistrate. Where the circumstances for finding probable cause are detailed, where a substantial basis for crediting the source of information is apparent, and when a magistrate has in fact found probable cause, the reviewing court should not invalidate the warrant by application of rigid analytical categories.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 544-45, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). We are also reminded that \u201c[i]n a doubtful or marginal case . . . our constitutional preference for a judicial determination of probable cause leads us to afford deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>219 Conn. 557, 565, 594 A.2d 933 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 642, 620 A.2d 746 (1993). Lastly, it is well established that, in reviewing a search warrant affidavit, \u201c[t]he reviewing court may consider only the information that was actually before the issuing judge at the time he or she signed the warrant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflett, </em>199 Conn. 718, 746, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). In the absence of a showing that the information contained in the warrant is false or misleading or that there is a material omission from the affidavit; see <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978); a hearing on a motion to suppress is limited to a review of the four comers of the affidavit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 543-44 n.16, 628 A.2d 567 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The question in this case is whether the issuing magistrate could have reasonably inferred from the information contained in the affidavit dated January 6, 1993, that the internal dates of January 6, 1992, rather than January 6, 1993, were mere scrivener\u2019s errors that did not invalidate the search warrant. We conclude that the information contained in the affidavit was sufficient to support the issuing magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause and that, consequently, the trial court should have deferred to the magistrate\u2019s issuance of the warrant based upon the record. Specifically, that record clearly supports the inference that the 1992 dates in the affidavit were scrivener\u2019s error and, therefore, did not undermine the magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause existed for the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Not every discrepancy in an affidavit supporting a search warrant is fatal. \u201c [Reference to a year other than the current year will not invalidate the warrant if the circumstances fairly indicate that the intended reference was to the current year.\u201d 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (3d Ed. 1996) \u00a7 3.7 (b), p. 362. Indeed, other jurisdictions have held in cases similar to the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>one that a commonsense reading of the affidavit justified the conclusion that a misstated date was mere scrivener\u2019s error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>368 So. 2d 1000, 1001 (La. 1979) (although affidavit stated that underlying information was obtained on January 12,1977, commonsense reading justified conclusion that proper date was January 12, 1978, when warrant was issued); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquardt, </em>43 Or. App. 515, 517, 603 P.2d 1198 (1979) (where affidavit stated that certain observations occurred on February 3, 1978, and search warrant was obtained on February 3, 1979, it was proper to assume that there was scrivener\u2019s error because it \u201chardly seems likely that the affiant would wait exactly one year from the date he obtained his information and then seek a warrant at 11 p.m.\u201d); <em>Green </em>v. <em>State, </em>799 S.W.2d 756, 759 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Further, a hypertechnical application of the \u201cfour corners\u201d rule that governs the judicial review of the adequacy of search warrant affidavits should not preclude the application of common sense to conclude that probable cause supports the warrant. \u201cThe purpose of the affidavit ... is to \u2018enable the issuing authority to weigh the persuasiveness of the facts relied upon by the affiant or complainant, and, from them, to determine whether the necessary probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>155 Conn. 385, 391, 232 A.2d 315 (1967).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>230 Conn. 24, 34, 644 A.2d 877 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In the present case, our review of the four corners of the challenged affidavit reveals that there exists strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>evidence that the insertion of the 1992 date was a scrivener\u2019s error. The affidavit refers to a controlled purchase of narcotics that the affiants used as a basis for obtaining a prior search warrant. The affidavit states that this warrant was executed on January 6, 1992, but refers to a 1993 Hartford police case number for information concerning the controlled purchase.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is illogical to conclude that a 1992 controlled purchase would carry a 1993 case number. Further, this case involves two search warrants for the same dwelling. The first warrant, executed on January 6, did not result in the seizure of any narcotics. The second warrant affidavit, which is the subject of this appeal, restated the events detailed in the first affidavit but indicated that they had occurred on January 6, 1992, instead of 1993. We are persuaded that both the police case number and the obviously misdated reference to the first warrant can be incorporated by reference into the challenged affidavits. On the basis of this cross-reference, an issuing magistrate reasonably could have inferred that an inadvertent scrivener\u2019s error was at play and, accordingly, have upheld the validity of the affidavit and issued the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>case to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> This court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: \u201c1. Did the Appellate Court improperly conclude that the issuing magistrate could not have inferred that the references in the search warrant affidavit to \u2018January 6, 1992,\u2019 rather than \u2018January 6, 1993,\u2019 were scrivener\u2019s errors?\u201d and \u201c2. If the answer to the first question is no, should the Appellate Court have remanded the case for a hearing on whether those references were scrivener\u2019s errors?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>235 Conn. 932, 667 A.2d 1270 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.
