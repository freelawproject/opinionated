J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether, pursuantto General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>parents qualify as \u201cemployees\u201d of the state and are, therefore, eligible for defense and indemnification in a wrongful death action brought by the estate of a foster child. The plaintiffs, Alan and Dawne Hunte, brought an action against the defendants, the state of Connecticut and the attorney general for the state of Connecticut,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking a declaratory judgment to determine their statutory rights to defense and indemnification. On the basis of stipulated facts, the trial court held that the plaintiffs did not qualify as state \u201cemployees\u201d and therefore were not entitled to relief. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The underlying facts are undisputed. At all times relevant to this case, the plaintiffs were foster parents licensed by the state. On October 15, 1990, the department of children and youth services (department)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>placed with the plaintiffs Lisa Sledgeski, a minor under the protection of the department pursuant to an order of temporary custody. On July 7, 1991, Lisa drowned in a swimming pool accident at the plaintiffs\u2019 home. Subsequently, Lisa\u2019s estate brought a wrongful death action against the plaintiffs. That action is now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The plaintiffs sought to have the state provide defense and indemnification in the wrongful death action. Their claim is predicated on \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d. The state denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request on the ground that they were independent contractors rather than \u201cemployees\u201d as required under the statutes. Opinions, Conn. Atty. Gen. No. 93-013 (June 14, 1993). The plaintiffs then brought the present action for declaratory relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court ruled for the state, holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to protection under \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d because they were not state \u201cemployees\u201d as that term is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 4-141.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the trial court. They claim that, because the department retained the right to exercise broad control over their actions as foster parents, the state had effectively entered into an employer-employee relationship with them. The state, to the contrary, contends that the plaintiffs enjoyed a great degree of autonomy and independent judgment and, therefore, were properly characterized as independent contractors and not employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>agree with the plaintiffs that, at the time of Lisa\u2019s death,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> they were \u201cemployees\u201d of the state as that term is used in \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d and thus are entitled to defense and indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In so deciding, we are mindful of the difficult choices that confront the state when it removes a child from an unhealthy environment and places that child in a foster home. The state has the double onus of taking a child from his or her natural parents, and of ensuring that the chosen foster parents provide adequate attention, support and guidance. We also recognize that insofar as our decision increases the state\u2019s financial responsibility to foster parents, it may tend also to increase the state\u2019s burden in providing this invaluable service. We further recognize that the state may find it reasonably advantageous to promulgate extensive foster care regulations rather than to engage in more expensive monitoring techniques. Sensitivity to the beneficence of the foster care program and the necessity of detailed regulations, however, does not permit us to ignore well established legal principles regarding the employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Our review of the judgment of the trial court in favor of the state is, under the circumstances of this case, plenary. The trial court rendered its judgment on the basis of the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts, and that stipulation informs the issue on appeal as well. <em>Rich-Taubman Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>236 Conn. 613, 618, 674 A.2d 805 (1996). The determination of legal principles that govern the uncontested facts of a party\u2019s employment status is a question of law. See <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 574, 362 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>871 (1975); <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Burrone Bros., Inc., </em>162 Conn. 187, 195, 292 A.2d 912 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">To decide whether foster parents are \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d, we must begin with the language of the statutes. <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996). Section 4-165 provides in relevant part that <em>u[n]o state officer or employee </em>shall be personally liable for damage or injury, not wanton, reckless or malicious, caused in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 5-141d provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he state shall save harmless and indemnify <em>any state officer or employee . . . </em>from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of his alleged negligence ... if the officer [or] employee ... is found to have been acting in the discharge of his duties or within the scope of his employment and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Construed together, these two statutes protect state employees acting within the legitimate scope of their employment from personal liability for negligence. \u201cThe manifest legislative intent expressed by chapter 53 [of which \u00a7 4-165 is a part] is that an employee is immune where and because the state may be sued, and that the state may be sued in instances where a private person would be liable. See [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-160 (a). This would include the vicarious liability of a private person for the acts of his employees arising out of the scope of their employment under the doctrine of agency or respondeat superior.\u201d <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 571. Section 5-141d similarly evinces the legislature\u2019s intent that the state indemnify and defend any officer or employee sued for negligent conduct occurring in the course of his or her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Although the plaintiffs are not \u201cofficers\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 or 5-141d, they contend that they are entitled to protection under these statutes as \u201cemployees.\u201d Both \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d refer to \u00a7 4-141 for the definition of the term \u201cemployees.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 4-141, in turn, provides that the term \u201cemployees\u201d includes \u201cevery person elected or appointed to or employed in any office, position or post in the state government, whatever his title, classification or function and whether he serves with or without remuneration or compensation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Whether foster parents are entitled to defense and indemnification as state \u201cemployees\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d depends, therefore, on a proper interpretation of \u00a7 4-141. We are guided by settled principles of statutory construction that assist us in ascertaining the intent of the legislature. <em>Petco Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 315, 321, 649 A.2d 790 (1994). \u201cThe legislative intent is to be discerned by reference to the language of the statute, its legislative history and surrounding circumstances, the policy the [statute] was designed to implement, and the statute\u2019s relationship to the existing legislation and common law principles governing the same subject matter. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993).\u201d <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 854, 633 A.2d 305 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Neither the language of \u00a7 4-141 nor the legislative histories of \u00a7\u00a7 4-141, 4-165 or 5-141d illuminate the definitional boundaries of the term \u201cemployees.\u201d We are mindful that \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d are in derogation of sovereign immunity and therefore must be strictly construed. <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 570. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Strict construction does not, however, abrogate the manifest policy motivating these statutes, namely, the protection of state employees from liability for negligent acts that occur in the course of employment. Id., 571. Strict construction does not preclude us from recognizing groups or persons who, in accordance with recognized tenets of statutory construction, legitimately fall within the definition of the term \u201cemployees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u201cIn the absence of guidance from the language of the statute or the legislative history, we look to common law principles . . . . It is assumed that all legislation is interpreted in light of the common law at the time of its enactment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>237 Conn. 135, 162, 676 A.2d 795 (1996); cf. <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Cacciapuoti, </em>138 Conn. 317, 320, 84 A.2d 122 (1951) (\u201c[w]e have, in [workers\u2019] compensation cases, uniformly given to the term [\u2018employee\u2019] its common-law definition\u201d). The trial court applied the common law \u201cright to control\u201d test and concluded that because the state\u2019s control did not extend to \u201cthe social, emotional, educational, and parental relationship\u201d between foster parent and child, the \u201c[plaintiffs [had] not proven that they [were] employees.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the state that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>invoked the proper test. We conclude, however, that the trial court applied the right to control test improperly, because, under all the circumstances, the plaintiffs qualify as employees of the state and axe not independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The legal incidents of the employer-employee relationship, on the one hand, and the employer-independent contractor relationship, on the other, are well established. \u201cIn <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>R. A. Sherman\u2019s Sons Co., </em>86 Conn. 292, 297, 85 A. 514 [1912], we adopted the definition that [an] independent contractor is one who, exercising an independent employment, contracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods and without being subject to the control of his employer, except as to the result of his work. This definition has been amplified in subsequent cases but at no time has the basic principle been altered. . . . The fundamental distinction between an employee and an independent contractor depends upon the existence or nonexistence of the <em>right to control </em>the means and methods of work. <em>Beaverdale Memorial Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>127 Conn. 175, 179, 15 A.2d 17 [1940] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 632, 639, 573 A.2d 724 (1990); see also 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 409, comment (b) (1965) (an \u201cemployer has no power of control over the manner in which work is to be done by the [independent] contractor\u201d). The issue before us is whether the state, through the department, has reserved the right to control foster parents in the discharge of their duties so as to render foster parents \u201cemployees\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 4-165 and 5-141d. We conclude that the department has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The fountainhead of the state\u2019s right to control foster parents is the statutory scheme requiring the department to guarantee the welfare of foster children. It is the commissioner of the department, not the foster parent, who is designated as the guardian of children placed in foster care. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d) (\u201c [t]he commissioner shall be the guardian of such child or youth for the duration of the commitment\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the guardian of foster children, the commissioner has the <em>\u201cobligation of care and control, </em>the right to custody and the duty and authority to make major decisions affecting [the] minor\u2019s welfare . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-93 (d). The commissioner, or his agent, <em>\u201cshall exercise careful supervision of each child </em>under his guardianship or care and shall maintain such contact with the child and his foster parents as is necessary to promote the child\u2019s safety and his physical, educational, moral and emotional development. lie shall [also] maintain such records and accounts as may be necessary for the proper supervision of all children under his guardianship or care.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-98; see <em>In re Barbara J., </em>215 Conn. 31, 41-42, 574 A.2d 203 (1990) (discussing duty of department to receive reports pertaining to supervision of foster children).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">A necessary corollary of the department\u2019s \u201cobligation of care and control\u201d over foster children is its authority to exercise that control. It is true, as the state points out, that foster parents currently decide \u201cwhen the child goes to bed at night, when enough television time has been had, or when the child may go swimming.\u201d Foster parents have this discretion, however, only because the department has chosen not to take it away. Nothing prevents the department from enacting regulations, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>suant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-90 (c),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that specify the hour at which a child must go to bed, that limit the amount of television a child may watch or that restrict the hours a child may spend in the pool. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the state conceded that the department has the <em>authority </em>to make day-to-day decisions concerning the activities of the foster child.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Furthermore, it is immaterial that the department may not, at all times, exercise the full extent of its power. \u201cAn employer-employee relationship does not depend upon the actual exercise of the right to control. The right to control is sufficient.\u201d <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>216 Conn. 237, 248, 579 A.2d 497 (1990) (construing part A of \u201cABC\u201d test for determining employer-employee relationship under Unemployment Compensation Act); see <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Cacciapuoti, </em>supra, 138 Conn. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The state contends that the department\u2019s obligation is \u201cmerely to monitor\u201d the daily care provided to foster children. We are unpersuaded. The statutes place an affirmative duty on the department to ensure that foster placement redounds to the benefit of the child. Moreover, the right to monitor necessarily \u201cembodies the logical inference that the . . . monitoring had a purpose and that, if the care given the [foster children were] unsatisfactory, [the department] could, and would, intervene and take corrective measures. That right of intervention, which we believe clearly exists under the facts, evinces a right to control and direct the [foster parents] . . . <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 251; see also <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Steele County, </em>322 N.W.2d 187, 189 (Minn. 1982) (Wahl, J., dissenting) (\u201c[s]uch close monitoring indicates that the foster-care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>parent is in a very different situation from that of the independent contractor\u201d). We are persuaded that this statutory scheme confers on the state, through the department, a right to control foster parents sufficient to satisfy the right to control test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The foster parent regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to \u00a7 17a-90 (c); see footnote 12; further support our conclusion that the state holds the right to control foster parents. Although the state, in its brief, contends that the department \u201cdoes not direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>foster parents in the details of their parenting,\u201d these regulations amply demonstrate that foster parents do not possess the autonomy and discretion normally associated with independent contracting.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Alexander </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>v. <em>R. A. Sherman\u2019s Sons Co., </em>supra, 86 Conn. 297. Pursuant to the regulations, foster parents are under an affirmative duty, among other things, to report immediately \u201c[unauthorized absences of a [foster] child ... to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>department followed by a written report within a reasonable period of time\u201d; Regs., Conn.

State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 (n); to provide each sleeping room with \u201ctwo approved means of egress\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-100 (b); to ensure that \u201c[s] leeping rooms for children shall be used only for sleeping purposes\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-100 (f); to ensure that \u201c[poster . . . children under the age of five shall sleep on the same floor and in close proximity to foster . . . parents . . . or a responsible adult\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-100 (g); and to provide \u201c[a] separate bed . . . for each child, but siblings of the same sex may sleep together in a double bed with the approval of the commissioner . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-100 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The department regulations also prohibit foster parents from engaging in certain activities or from arranging living accommodations in certain ways. Thus, foster parents \u201cshall not be employed outside of the home except by agreement with the placing agency\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 (h); \u201cshall not have roomers or boarders without the approval of the commissioner or his designee\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 (j); shall not permit a \u201cchild three years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>or older ... to share a bedroom with another child of the opposite sex or with any adult person except a child of the foster or adoptive parents\u201d who is of the same sex; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-100 (i); and shall not allow \u201cmore than four children, including the foster . . . parents\u2019 own children, [to] sleep in the same room.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-100 Q).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Finally, these regulations demand that foster parents \u201cbe capable of providing,\u201d among other things, \u201c[adequate opportunities for recreational, cultural and educational activities both within the family and in the community\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 (0 (3); \u201cthe opportunity for religious training appropriate to the child\u2019s religious denomination\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 <em>(l) </em>(4); \u201ca balanced schedule of rest, active play, indoor and outdoor activity appropriate to the age of the child in care\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 (/,) (7); and \u201c[assigned work duties ... on the basis of [the child\u2019s] age and abilities and ... a daily routine to promote good work habits.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 <em>(l) </em>(8). We conclude that, in the aggregate, these regulations embody the state\u2019s right to control the day-to-day activities of foster parents and demonstrate that foster parents are not independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The state makes two arguments to deemphasize the pervasive right to control manifested by these regulations. It first urges us to conclude, as the trial court found, that despite its regulations, the department has left many \u201csocial, emotional, educational, and parental\u201d decisions to the foster parent. We are unpersuaded. The very comprehensiveness of the regulations contradicts this view. See footnote 14. Moreover, the right to control test does not focus on the actual exercise of control. \u201cAs previously noted, it is not the actual exercise of the right to control that distinguishes an [employee] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>from an independent contractor, but rather the employer\u2019s possession of the right to control.\u201d <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 251. That foster parents are \u201cpermitted to perform their day-to-day duties without interference so long as those duties [are] performed in a satisfactory manner does not militate against a conclusion of control.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Furthermore, we disagree with the state\u2019s claim that, although the rights of foster parents are limited, foster parents occupy \u201ca status as near to natural parents as possible.\u201d The rights of foster parents are defined and restricted by statute. \u201cFoster families do not have the same rights as biological families or adoptive families. Rather, the expectations and entitlements of foster families can be limited by the state. ...\u201d (Citation omitted). <em>Nye </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>198 Conn. 138, 143, 502 A.2d 869 (1985); see <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 638-39, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S.

They may not intervene in proceedings to terminate the rights of natural parents; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 10718), </em>188 Conn. 259, 262-63, 449 A.2d 165 (1982); nor do they automatically have standing to serve as \u201cnext friend\u201d of a removed foster child. <em>Orsi </em>v. <em>Senatore, </em>230 Conn. 459, 468-69, 645 A.2d 986 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The restricted rights of foster parents and the impermanence of their relationship with foster children further militate against recognizing in the foster parent placement the type of \u201csocial, emotional, educational, and parental relationship\u201d that the state endorses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Indeed, foster parenting \u201cimplies a warning <em>against </em>any deep emotional involvement with the child . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) J. Goldstein, A. Freud &amp; A. Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1979) p. 24; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families, </em>431 U.S. 816, 861, 97 S. Ct. 2094, 53 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1977) (Stewart, J., concurring) (under New York foster care laws \u201cany case where the foster parents had assumed the emotional role of the child\u2019s natural parents would represent not a triumph of the system . . . but a failure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The state also contends that the foster parent regulations serve only as licensure requirements and not as affirmative or prohibitory directives. It relies on <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>305 S.C. 428, 430-31, 409 S.E.2d 381 (1991), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he mere granting of a license or permit to do an act which is not itself unlawful or dangerous . . . does not render\u201d the state liable for injuries incurred in the performance of the act. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We decline to follow <em>Simmons. </em>First, the mandates contained in the department\u2019s regulations applicable to foster parents in this state extend beyond the point of their initial licensing. See, e.g., Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 17a-145-100 (h) through (j), 17a-145-101 (b) through (d), (h) through (k), (m) through (n). As an obvious example, foster parents must \u201ccomply with the guardian\u2019s plan for the child\u201d without regard to when the department implements that plan. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-145-101 (i). Indeed, the statute that enables the department to issue regulations, \u00a7 17a-90 (c),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> requires only that the commissioner promulgate \u201csuch regulations as he may find necessary and proper to assure\u201d the welfare of foster children; it makes no reference at all to \u201clicensure requirements\u201d for foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>parents. The fact that the regulations themselves contemplate the possibility of license requirements does not persuade us that the regulations have no function other than to describe continued license eligibility. Reading the regulations in their entirety, we conclude that they are not simply licensure requirements, but serve instead to direct the manner in which foster parents care for foster children.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Moreover, even if these regulations were, in some sense, to serve as \u201clicensure requirements,\u201d we are disinclined to follow the holding in <em>Simmons. </em>The court in that case based its decision on the proposition that \u201c[t]he mere fact that the [South Carolina department of social services] has the right to control and direct foster parents <em>is not dispositive.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 305 S.C. 431. In this state, the right to control test <em>is </em>dispositive. Thus, our conclusion that the department had the right to control foster parents is determinative of the outcome in this case, regardless of whether the department considers its regulations as only \u201clicensure requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We recognize that the majority of courts in other states that have considered this issue have concluded that foster parents are not employees of the state. See, e.g., <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>666 A.2d 30, 38 (D.C. App. 1995); <em>Mitzner </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Kan. 258, 263, 891 P.2d 435 (1995); <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Steele County, </em>supra, 322 N.W.2d 189; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State Industries, Inc., </em>267 N.J. Super. 167, 172, 630 A.2d 1188 (1993); <em>New Jersey Property-Liability Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>195 N.J. Super. 4, 16, 477 A.2d 826, cert. denied, 99 N.J. 188, 491 A.2d 691 (1984); <em>Blanca C. </em>v. <em>County of Nassau, </em>103 App. Div. 2d 524, 529, 480 N.Y.S.2d 747 (1984), aff'd, 65 N.Y.2d 712, 481 N.E.2d 545, 492 N.Y.S.2d 5 (1985); <em>Kara B. </em>v. <em>Dane County, </em>198 Wis. 2d 24, 53, 542 N.W.2d <em>777 </em>(1995), rev. granted, 546 N.W.2d 468 (1996). We do not find these decisions persuasive. In none of these cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>did the court analyze a statutory scheme vesting in the state the type of open-ended power that is vested in the department. Further, in many of these cases, the operative test on which the courts relied was not the right to control test as it has been formulated in this state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, the out-of-state cases do not address the type of pervasive control over the conduct of foster parents that is manifested by the department\u2019s regulations in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under our well established \u201cright to control\u201d test, we conclude that the plaintiffs, in their role as foster parents, were \u201cemployees\u201d of the state as that term is used in \u00a7\u00a7 4-141, 4-165 and 5-141d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, BERDON, NORCOTT, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-165 provides in relevant part: \u201cImmunity of state officers and employees from personal liability.

Co., </em>supra, 214 Conn. 632, in support of its position that the department had not entered into an employer-employee relationship with the plaintiffs. Both cases are inapposite. In <em>Spring, </em>the issue was whether a public defender qualified for indemnity under \u00a7 4-165. We concluded that, although the state has the right to control public defenders prior to the time when the attorney-client relationship attaches, at that point, \u201cthe public defender is free to act in behalf of his client as if he had been employed and retained by the defendant whom he represents.\u201d <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>supra, 575. Once the attorney-client relationship attaches, the state has no right to interfere \u201cwith the control of that defense in any greater degree than with the conduct of a defense by a privately employed attorney.\u201d Id. Because the alleged malpractice that precipitated the suit against the public defender in <em>Spring </em>arose in the course of this attorney-client relationship, the public defender was not an employee of the state. Id., 575-76. Unlike the plaintiffs in the present case, the plaintiff in <em>Spring, </em>by the very nature of his job, could not have been both a servant of the state and a servant of his client, a defendant whom the state had been prosecuting. Id., 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\"><em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 214 Conn. 632, also involved the liability of a government entity for actions of an attorney. In that case, the city of Norwich brought a malpractice action against its assistant corporation counsel. An issue on appeal was whether the attorney qualified as an \u201cemployee\u201d pursuant to the city\u2019s liability insurance policy. Id., 633. In holding that the attorney did not qualify as an employee, we determined that \u201cwhile the result of the [attorney\u2019s] work may have been subject to the city\u2019s control, as with his other clients, the <em>means and methods </em>by which the [attorney] reached that result were not.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 640. Thus, contrary to lire state\u2019s view of <em>Silverberg, </em>we explicitly determined that the city had lacked the right and authority to exert control over the attorney\u2019s day-to-day activities. Because we conclude in the present case that the department <em>did </em>have the right and authority to exercise control over the plaintiffs, <em>Silverberg </em>is not controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> Sections 17a-145-99 through 17a-145-101 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (formerly \u00a7\u00a7 17-48-99 through 17-48-101) set forth the requirements for foster care.

The majority has determined that foster parents are state employees within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d and are therefore entitled to be defended and indemnified for negligent acts performed within the scope of their \u201cemployment\u201d as foster parents. I believe that it is a perversion of the term \u201cstate employee\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d to include foster parents within its ambit. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Both parties agree that this case boils down to a question of legislative intent. The dispositive issue is whether the legislature intended foster parents to be considered state employees who are entitled to defense and indemnification from the state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-141d in common law negligence actions. In the specific context of statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity, \u201c[w]here there is any doubt about [the] meaning or intent [of the statute, it is] given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity. . . . [T]he state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the legislature is disclosed, by the use of express terms . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. Burns, 213 Conn. 307, 312-13, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). I believe that the answer to the question of whether foster parents are properly characterized as state employees is, at best, ambiguous. Because we are bound to construe strictly statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity and to resolve any ambiguities in those statutes in favor of preserving the public fisc, I would conclude that foster parents are not state employees within the penumbra of \u00a7 5-141d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">One of the difficulties with the majority\u2019s opinion is the way in which it characterizes and addresses the issue, limiting its analysis to determining whether a foster parent is an employee or an independent contractor. \u201cThe foster parent\u2019s actual status is rather unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and does not actually fit within either term. A more apt description of a foster parent would be more of an expense-reimbursed volunteer who must be licensed and who operates within certain guidelines.\u201d <em>Mitzner </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Kan. 258, 262, 891 P.2d 435 (1995). Rather than attempting to pound a square peg into a round hole by restricting the potential classification of a foster parent to \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d I would determine only whether the legislature intended a foster parent to be a state employee within the meaning of \u00a7 5-141d when it enacted the statute. If a foster parent does not clearly fit within the intended meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d in the statute, the state must prevail under the required strict interpretation of sovereign immunity. <em>White v. Burns, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 312-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">If the \u201cright to control\u201d test relied on by the majority is appropriately used to distinguish employees from independent contractors, how well can we expect it to function when we consider foster parents, who fill a role that fits neither category upon which the \u201cright to control\u201d test is premised? In addition to foster parents, what other functionaries who the state licenses and regulates, not generally thought of as employees, might now fit under the heading of state employees?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The right to control of the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) manifests itself predominantly in the licensing requirements and in the regulation of foster parents and their homes. In other words, the right to control exists in the licensing mechanism of the state and in the promulgation of regulations, and not in the day-to-day oversight that traditionally evidences the right to control in employer-employee relations. In the present case, the plaintiffs had numerous specifications with which they had to comply, but how they parented, the means and method of their parenting, was beyond the actual control of the commissioner. While the commissioner may have a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>control the nuts and bolts of providing for a child\u2019s health and safety, in reality the commissioner cannot regulate the true parenting aspects of the foster parent-foster child relationship. In fact, the only reason foster parents exist is to provide the children with something the state itself cannot provide. To say then that the state has a right to control that part of the foster parent function that cannot be performed by the state belittles the subtle and personal nature of parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The ambiguity pertaining to the issue of whether a foster parent is properly characterized as a state employee is highlighted by the decisions of our sister states. As the majority concedes, \u201cthe majority of courts in other states that have considered this issue have concluded that foster parents are not employees of the state.\u201d Although the majority seeks to distinguish some of these cases, the fact remains that there are several cases that are strikingly similar to the case before us and that reach the opposite result. See <em>Mitzner </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 257 Kan. 263 (\u201can individual does not become a state employee by becoming a licensed foster parent\u201d); <em>New Jersey Property-Liability Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>195 N.J. Super. 4, 16, 477 A.2d 826 (1984) (foster parents not state employees for purposes of New Jersey Tort Claims Act); <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Steele County, </em>322 N.W.2d 187, 189 (Minn. 1982) (considering five factors, including right to control manner of performance, control of premises and right of discharge, and concluding that foster parents are not state employees).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Another indication that foster parents were not clearly intended to be included within the defense and indemnification provisions of \u00a7 5-141d was provided by the legislature when it enacted No. 94-216 of the 1994 Public Acts subsequent to the death of the plaintiffs\u2019 foster child. The relevant portion of that public act provides: \u201cA person licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 of the general statutes shall be liable for any act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>or omission resulting in personal injury to a child placed in his care by the commissioner of children and families to the same extent as a biological parent is liable for any act or omission resulting in personal injury to a biological child in his care.\u201d Representative John Thompson, speaking in support of the public act, stated that its purpose was \u201c[to] provide liability coverage for foster parents at the same level as natural parents when caring for a child placed in their custody.\u201d 37 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1994 Sess., p. 5884. When the possibility of making foster parents state employees was raised on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1994, Representative Thompson responded, \u201cI believe that this bill has been endorsed by the Foster Parents Association and I do not believe there has ever been any discussion by them that they would seek employment status with the state. On the contrary, this bill is to protect their interest and allow them to remain private people and I think that is in the best interests of the children. . . . [A]t this point, I know of no interest on the part of the foster parents or on the part of the state to give them that status.\u201d Id., p. 5887. The fact that the 1994 legislature, a group presumably familiar with the existing state of the law, articulated its understanding that foster parents were not state employees within the meaning of \u00a7 5-141d suggests further that the intent of the legislature concerning whether foster parents are to be treated as state employees is, to say the least, open to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In short, I would not find a waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity in this case where the meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d in the context of the statutory scheme waiving sovereign immunity is uncertain at best. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
