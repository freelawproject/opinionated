(CIGNA). After medical treatment had begun, and although the plaintiff patients had been provided with various assurances that their physicians, who met CIGNA\u2019s credentialing standards, would continue to participate in their health care plans, the plaintiff physicians were unilaterally terminated from the network.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Specifically, the nine plaintiffs in <em>Hollis </em>filed a thirty-six count complaint. F. Barrett Hollis, typical of the eight other plaintiffs,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleged that he had commenced medical treatment with a physician who participated in CIGNA\u2019s health care providers network and who was subsequently unilaterally removed by CIGNA from its list of participating physicians. Specifically, Hollis alleged that several months after his treatment for cancer had begun, CIGNA sent him a letter announcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>changes to its network that CIGNA said would help it to achieve its goal of establishing a \u201ccomprehensive network of quality doctors who meet [its] credentialing standards . . . .\u201d Because his doctor satisfied CIGNA\u2019s criteria but was nevertheless removed from its list, Hollis alleged that this letter misrepresented the credentialing standards. Three months later, CIGNA sent Hollis a second letter stating that should his doctor choose not to reenroll in its plan, Hollis\u2019 care would be transferred to another participating provider. According to Hollis, because his physician\u2019s removal from the network had been unilateral, this letter was also false. CIGNA then placed an advertisement in the Hartford Courant misrepresenting which physicians had been allowed to file applications to reenroll in CIGNA\u2019s network. The advertisement contained the name of Hollis\u2019 physician. Additionally, CIGNA sent Hollis a directory of providers, which included his physician, but failed to inform enrollees in its plan that participating physicians could be removed from the list without notice. On the basis of these alleged unfair and deceptive acts of misrepresentation and false advertising, Hollis alleged that CIGNA violated CUTPA and CUIPA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, Hollis alleged that CIGNA had violated P.A. 94-235 by removing his physician from its provider network without advising Hollis of its criteria for removal and despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>having listed his physician as a CIGNA provider with the commission on hospitals and health care (commission). Finally, Hollis alleged that CIGNA had committed acts of misrepresentation by removing Hollis\u2019 physician from its provider network even though, in the material it had filed with the commission, CIGNA had listed his physician\u2019s name and had failed to indicate that it could remove him without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In his demand for relief as to the alleged violations of CUTPA, CUIPA and the allegation of misrepresentation, Hollis sought \u201c[m]onetary damages in excess of $15,000.00 exclusive of interest and costs,\u201d \u201c[s]uch other equitable relief as the Court deems necessary and proper,\u201d and, with respect to the CUTPA and misrepresentation counts, punitive damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a) and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (d). As to the alleged violation of P.A. 94-235, Hollis sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether CIGNA had violated P.A. 94-235. He requested that his physician be reinstated as a participant in CIGNA\u2019s health care plan. Finally, Hollis sought such other equitable relief as the court deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The nine plaintiffs in <em>Napoletano </em>were the physicians who had treated the plaintiffs in Hollis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a forty-five count complaint, each plaintiff alleged that he was a physician licensed to practice in Connecticut, that he had been a participating physician in the CIGNA health care network, having contracted with CIGNA through Pro Care Independent Practice Association, Inc. (Pro Care),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but that, despite satisfying all of CIGNA\u2019s cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>dentialing standards, he had been unilaterally terminated without just cause. Each plaintiff also alleged that although he continues to be board certified in his area of specialty and continues to satisfy CIGNA\u2019s credentiaiing standards, he has been denied the opportunity to reenroll as a participating physician in the CIGNA network. Additionally, the complaint alleges that CIGNA had misrepresented to the plan beneficiaries, as well as to each plaintiff, that each plaintiff would remain in its directory of providers throughout the length of CIGNA\u2019s annual contract with the patient, that each plaintiff would have the choice whether to reenroll, and that it would be the decision of each plaintiff whether to reenroll. In light of this alleged conduct by CIGNA, the plaintiffs claim that CIGNA breached its contract with each plaintiff, breached its obligation to deal in a manner consistent with good faith and fair dealing, tortiously interfered with each plaintiffs business expectancies, and violated CUTPA. Finally, by removing each plaintiff from CIGNA\u2019s plan while being listed as a provider in CIGNA\u2019s filing with the commission as mandated by P.A. 94-235, by failing to include in that filing the name and address of the person to whom the physicians could apply for participation in the network, and by rejecting each plaintiff without advising him of the criteria employed, CIGNA allegedly violated P.A. 94-235.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In connection with the common law claims for breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing and tortious interference with business expectancies, each plaintiff sought \u201c[m]onetary damages in excess of $15,000.00 exclusive of interest and costs\u201d and \u201c[s]uch other equitable relief as the Court deems necessary and proper.\u201d For the CUTPA violation, each plaintiff requested monetary damages, punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a), reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-1 lOg (d) and such other equitable relief as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>appropriate. Each plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether CIGNA\u2019s actions constituted violations of P.A. 94-235, to compel CIGNA\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the act, to preclude each plaintiffs termination from the network based upon CIGNA\u2019s previous noncompliance with the act and such other equitable relief as is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">CIGNA moved to strike all counts of both the <em>Hollis </em>and <em>Napoletano </em>complaints, claiming that they were preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court, in a consolidated memorandum of decision, agreed and accordingly, granted CIGNA\u2019s motions to strike.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in both cases appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Following the filing of briefs in this appeal, sua sponte, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following question: \u201cDid all interested persons have reasonable notice of this action as required by Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d)? If not, did the trial court have jurisdiction to consider [CIGNA\u2019s] motions to strike?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Practice Book \u00a7 390 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court will not render declaratory judgments upon the complaint of any person . . . (d) unless all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof.\u201d This court has consistently required strict adherence to this rule. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>176 Conn. 318, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>319, 407 A.2d 979 (1978). Failure to comply with \u00a7 390 (d) deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment. <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 308, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u201cThis rule ... is not merely a procedural regulation. It is in recognition and implementation of the basic principle that due process of law requires that the rights of no man shall be judicially determined without affording him a day in court and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Kolenberg </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 113, 124, 536 A.2d 577, cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1236, 108 S. Ct. 2903, 101 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1988), quoting <em>Benz </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>154 Conn. 74, 77, 221 A.2d 841 (1966). It is the settled rule of this jurisdiction, if indeed it may not be called an established principle of general jurisprudence, that no court will proceed to the adjudication of a matter involving conflicting rights and interests, until all persons directly concerned in the event have been actually or constructively notified of the pendency of the proceeding, and given reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard. <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Raymark Corporation, </em>[215 Conn. 224, 229, 575 A.2d 693 (1990)], quoting <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>91 Conn. 500, 508, 100 A. 22 (1917).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 308, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 228 Conn. 487, 636 A.2d 840 (1994). Consequently, all persons who have a direct interest in the subject matter of the action are required to be made parties or to have reasonable notice of the action, even if their presence is not necessary to a decision of the issues between the parties of record.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Benz </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The arguments by all the parties urging this court to conclude that the trial court had jurisdiction and to reach the merits are persuasive. The parties first argue that the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the motion to strike without providing notice to any additional parties because the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) were never triggered. They contend that, because the court never reached the merits of the declaratory judgment claim, having concluded that the actions were preempted by ERISA, the court was not required to reach the question of whether all interested persons had been given notice. See <em>Bourdieu </em>v. <em>Pacific Western Oil Co., </em>299 U.S. 65, 70-71, 57 S. Ct. 51, 81 L. Ed. 42, reh. denied, 299 U.S. 622, 57 S. Ct. 228, 81 L. Ed. 458 (1936) (inquiry into status of absent parties where complaint fails to state cause of action unnecessary); <em>Calcote </em>v. <em>Texas Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>157 F.2d 216, 221 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 782, 67 S. Ct. 205, 91 L. Ed. 671 (1946) (inquiry into absence of indispensable parties wholly gratuitous where cause of action not stated in complaint). This distinction is significant because if we were to disagree with the trial court in this case on the issue of preemption, the plaintiffs could pursue further procedural efforts to cure any defect regarding the notice requirement on remand. See <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 36, 653 A.2d 168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(1995) (\u201c[u]nlike other jurisdictional delects implicating the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction . . . the bringing of a declaratory judgment action is not itself precluded by a failure to comply with the notice requirement\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">All parties also argue that, even if the trial court had been required to determine whether \u00a7 390 (d) had been complied with, all persons interested in the subject matter of the case at the time of the motions to strike were parties to the action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that all interested persons were parties to the action, and therefore find no jurisdictional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In <em>Hollis, </em>each plaintiff allegedly was insured by CIGNA and was the patient of a physician who had been removed from the provider network. Each alleged misrepresentation by CIGNA and claimed damages resulting from the interruption of a particular course of treatment with his or her physician. The record does not indicate that there are other patients who could claim damages based upon similar circumstances. Similarly, in <em>Napoletano, </em>there is no indication that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>are other physicians who treated patients enrolled in CIGNA\u2019s health care plan and who are no longer in the provider network. Accordingly, we agree that the actions in the present case are personal to the named parties and all persons with an interest in the subject matter have been named. Cf. <em>Mannweiler v. LaFlamme, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 33 (unnoticed lot owners were classic \u201cindispensable parties\u201d because resolution of issues regarding restrictive covenants and alleged common scheme of development was relevant to all deeds within development); <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Raymark Corp., </em>supra, 215 Conn. 228 (unnoticed persons with outstanding personal injury claims against named defendant or its predecessors were \u201cinterested parties\u201d where subject matter of complaint was insurance policy issued by insolvent insurer of named defendant).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We next consider CIGNA\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in both <em>Hollis </em>and <em>Napoletano </em>are moot. As to <em>Napoletano </em>, CIGNA contends that even were this court to reverse the judgment of the trial court as to the breach of contract and covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims, the trial court could not provide the plaintiffs with any practical relief. CIGNA structured its relationship with the plaintiff physicians through Pro Care, an independent practice association that contracted with CIGNA to provide services to employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>benefit plans that CIGNA administered and of which each of the plaintiff physicians was a member. See footnote 7. The plaintiff physicians, consequently, were third party beneficiaries of this contract, which provided that it could be terminated at any time and, in fact, was terminated by CIGNA on September 8, 1994. Because the contract has lawfully expired, CIGNA claims that \u201cit is impossible to judicially enforce rights to participate in a provider network under a contract that no longer exists.\u201d As to the alleged violations of P.A. 94-235, CIGNA asserts that the claims are moot because it has already complied with the act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Finally, in connection with the plaintiff physicians\u2019 tortious interference with business expectancies claim, CIGNA argues that the plaintiff physicians could not expect that a business relationship with a patient would exist beyond the expiration of the patient\u2019s health care benefits under CIGNA\u2019s health care coverage options. CIGNA claims that all of its health care options, through which employees receive health care benefits, are limited to twelve months and that CIGNA clearly had the right to change its provider network structure when it renewed its health care coverage options. Consequently, even if the plaintiff physicians were to prevail, the trial court could require CIGNA to include them in the provider network only for the remaining time that their patients had coverage benefits under the health care option chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">As to the plaintiffs in Hollis, CIGNA contends that the expiration of the annual health care coverage options for all the plaintiffs precludes the practical relief they seek. In specific, CIGNA argues that the court could not reinstate the plaintiffs\u2019 physicians in a health care plan that no longer exists. Additionally, CIGNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>argues that because it exercised its right to change the structure of the provider network upon the renewal of its contracts with the plaintiffs\u2019 employers, and that these new contracts do not include the plaintiff physicians as providers, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims have evaporated. We disagree that the plaintiffs in both cases are unable to obtain practical relief should they prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201cMootness implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. . . . It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. . . . An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>236 Conn. 89, 93-94, 671 A.2d 345 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We dispose of CIGNA\u2019s mootness claims summarily. CIGNA focuses solely on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in both cases for injunctive relief and all but ignores their claims for redress of injury for even the limited period it contends is in question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because each of the eighteen plaintiffs in the two cases sought far more than injunctive relief in the eighty-one counts and because each states a claim for redress for, among other things, fraudulent and deceptive behavior, which, if proven, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>entitle them to punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, their claims are not moot.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The next issue that we address, which is the central substantive issue in this case, involves whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in both <em>Hollis </em>and <em>Napoletano </em>are preempted by ERISA. Specifically, we consider whether ERISA preempts the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for misrepresentation and for violations of CUTPA, CUIPA and P.A. 94-235 in <em>Hollis, </em>and whether ERISA preempts the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of contract, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with business expectancies and violations of CUTPA and P.A. 94-235 in <em>Napoletano. </em>We conclude that because the claims raised by the plaintiffs do not affect or prescribe the establishment, administration, regulation or maintenance of an employee benefit plan, but, rather, merely seek to enforce the plan that CIGNA has chosen to create and administer, the claims do not \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA\u2019s preemption provision. Consequently, none of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the two cases is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In the present cases, the trial court, on motions to strike, concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims relate to an ERISA plan because they both refer to and are connected with such a plan.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The claims \u201crefer to\u201d an ERISA plan because \u201creferences to the plan abound in the . . . amended complaint.\u201d Also, the claims are \u201cconnectjed] with\u201d a plan \u201cbecause the plaintiffs chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>lenge the <em>administration </em>of the plan in question.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court explained that \u201c[t]he complaint . . . focuses on CIGNA\u2019s removal of certain physicians from its plan. This is, in essence, a complaint about plan <em>administration. </em>This is a core ERISA concern.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Furthermore, the court reasoned that \u201c[a]Uowing state law actions like the one[s] here would subject plans and plan sponsors to burdens not unlike those that the preemption clause seeks to foreclose. It is entirely foreseeable that different state courts, construing a wide array of state statutory provisions and common law principles, might develop different substantive standards governing the circumstances under which health plans could remove physicians from their lists. This would . . . require the tailoring of plans ... to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction. Such an outcome is fundamentally at odds with the goal of uniformity that Congress sought to implement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision is plenary. \u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 14, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). In this case, the trial court ruled on motions to strike. The function of a motion to strike is to test the legal sufficiency of a pleading; it admits all facts well pleaded. See Practice Book \u00a7 152. The role of the trial court was to examine the complaints, construed in favor of the plaintiffs, to determine whether the plaintiffs have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>stated a legally sufficient cause of action. See <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 472, 427 A.2d 385 (1980). Because the trial court drew conclusions of law, and did not make findings of fact, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s decisions leads us into the quagmire of ERISA law. ERISA is a \u201ccomprehensive regulation of employee welfare and pension benefit plans [that] extends to those that provide \u2018medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits\u2019 for plan participants or their beneficiaries \u2018through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.\u2019 [Section 3 (1) of ERISA], 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1). The federal statute does not go about protecting plan participants and their beneficiaries by requiring employers to provide any given set of minimum benefits, but instead controls the administration of benefit plans, see \u00a7 2 [of ERISA], 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (b), as by imposing reporting and disclosure mandates, \u00a7\u00a7 101-111 [of ERISA], 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1031, participation and vesting requirements, \u00a7\u00a7 201-211 [of ERISA], 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1061, funding standards, \u00a7\u00a7 301-308 [of ERISA], 29 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1081-1086, and fiduciary responsibilities for plan administrators, \u00a7\u00a7 401-414 [of ERISA], 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1114. It envisions administrative oversight, imposes criminal sanctions, and establishes a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme. [Sections 501-515 of ERISA], 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1131-1145.

Early Supreme Court cases provided an expansive inteipretation of this term.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In a 1983 case dealing with ERISA preemption, the court, viewing ERISA\u2019s preemption language to be clear and relying on a dictionary definition of the term \u201crelate,\u201d stated that \u201c[a] law \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has <em>a connection with or reference to </em>such a plan. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u201cIn fact . . . Congress used the words \u2018relate to\u2019 in \u00a7 514 (a) in their broad sense. To inteipret \u00a7 514 (a) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>[preempt] only state laws specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans would be to ignore the remainder of \u00a7 514. It would have been unnecessary to exempt generally applicable state criminal statutes from [preemption] in \u00a7 514 (b), for example, if \u00a7 514 (a) applied only to state laws dealing specifically with ERISA plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201cNor, given the legislative history, can \u00a7 514 (a) be interpreted to [preempt] only state laws dealing with the subject matters covered by ERISA \u2014 reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and the like. The bill that became ERISA originally contained a limited [preemption] clause, applicable only to state laws relating to the specific subjects covered by ERISA. The Conference Committee rejected these provisions in favor of the present language, and indicated that the section\u2019s [preemptive] scope was as broad as its language. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, p. 383 (1974); S. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1090, p. 383 (1974). Statements by the bill\u2019s sponsors during the subsequent debates stressed the breadth of federal [preemption]. Representative [John] Dent, for example, stated: \u2018Finally, I wish to make note of what is to many the crowning achievement of this legislation, the reservation to Federal authority the sole power to regulate the field of employee benefit plans. With the preemption of the field, we round out the protection afforded participants by ehminating the threat of conflicting and inconsistent State and local regulation.\u2019 120 Cong. Rec. 29197 (1974). Senator [Harrison A.] Williams echoed these sentiments: \u2018It should be stressed that with the narrow exceptions specified in the bill, the substantive and enforcement provisions of the conference substitute are intended to preempt the field for Federal regulations, thus eliminating the threat of conflicting or inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefit plans. This principle is intended to apply in its broadest sense to all actions of State or local governments, or any instrumentality thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>which have the force or effect of law.\u2019 Id., at 29933.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 96-99, 103 S.

Ed. 2d 490 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201cIt is thus clear that ERISA\u2019s [preemption] provision was prompted by recognition that employers establishing and maintaining employee benefit plans are faced with the task of coordinating complex administrative activities. A patchwork scheme of regulation would introduce considerable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which might lead those employers with existing plans to reduce benefits, and those without such plans to refrain from adopting them. [Preemption] ensures that the administrative practices of a benefit plan will be governed by only a single set of regulations. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 93-533, p. 12 (1973) (\u2018[A] fiduciary standard embodied in Federal legislation is considered desirable because it will bring a measure of uniformity in an area where decisions under the same set of facts may differ from state to state\u2019).\u201d <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 11, 107 S. Ct. 2211, 96 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Supreme Court has further concluded that \u201ca state law may \u2018relate to\u2019 a benefit plan, and thereby be [preempted], even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect.\u201d <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 139, 111 S. Ct. 478, 112 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1990). However, \u201c[s]ome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law \u2018relates to\u2019 the plan.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>supra, 463 U.S. 100 n.21. For example, many laws of general applicability that function irrespective of the existence of an employee benefit plan are not preempted because they are too remotely related to the plan. See <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>506 U.S. 125, 130 n.1, 113 S. Ct. 580, 121 L.

Lastly, in cases \u201cwhere federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation . . . [the court has] worked on the \u2018assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">With the exception of these limitations, the United States Supreme Court until recently has generally viewed ERISA\u2019s preemption provision broadly. In recent cases, however, the court has retreated from this expansive view.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>the court acknowledged that although \u201c[t]he governing text of ERISA is clearly expansive . . . [i]f \u2018relate to\u2019 were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes [preemption] would never run its course, for \u2018[r]eally, universally, relations stop nowhere,\u2019 H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York ed., World\u2019s Classics 1980). But that, of course, would be to read Congress\u2019s words of limitation as mere sham, and to read the presumption against [preemption] out of the law whenever Congress speaks to the matter with generality.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>described the types of cases that raise preemption concerns, focusing on those scenarios in which a state law imposes a substantive mandate on an employee benefit plan. Id., 657, 662; see <em>FMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>498 U.S. 52, 60, 111 S. Ct. 403, 112 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1990) (state law dictated structure of plan); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 739, 105 S.

The court then contrasted those cases with the case then before it in which a New York statute imposed surcharges on hospital rates for patients whose commercial insurance coverage had been purchased by employee health care plans governed by ERISA. The court stated that \u201c[a]n indirect economic influence . . . does not bind plan administrators to any particular choice and thus function as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself . . . .Nor does the indirect influence of the surcharges preclude uniform administrative practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit package if a plan wishes to provide one.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 659-60. The court summarized its conclusion as follows: \u201c[W]e do not hold today that ERISA [preempts] only direct regulation of ERISA plans, nor could we do that with fidelity to the views expressed in our prior opinions on the matter. See, e.g., <em>[Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 139]; <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 47-48, 107 S. Ct. [1549], 95 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1987); <em>Shaw </em>[v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>supra, 98]. We acknowledge that a state law might produce such acute, albeit indirect, economic effects, by intent or otherwise, as to force an ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers, and that such a state law might indeed be [preempted] under \u00a7 514. ... [A law, however, that affects] only indirectly the relative prices of insurance policies, a result no different from myriad state laws in areas traditionally subject to local regulation, [is one] which Congress could not possibly have intended to eliminate.\u201d <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Since <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>was decided, various courts of appeals, including the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have focused on the Supreme Court\u2019s primary concerns with respect to ERISA preemption and, consequently, have followed the lead of that court by limiting ERISA preemption to state action that demonstrably burdens ERISA plans. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated that \u201cCongress sought to [preempt] state laws [or state claims] that have a <em>burdensome effect </em>on ERISA plans. When a state law [or claim] has such an effect on a covered plan, it is [preempted]; when it does not, it is not [preempted] even if it actually refers to ERISA. Interpreting \u2018relates to\u2019 as being concerned with state laws\u2019 significant effects on covered plans serves Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting ERISA, [namely,] to avoid encouraging \u2018employers with existing plans to reduce benefits, [or] those without such plans to refrain from adopting them.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Thiokol Corp., Morton International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>76 F.3d 751, 757 (6th Cir. 1996). The court in <em>Roberts </em>noted that the <em>Shaw </em>court\u2019s definition of \u201crelate to\u201d \u2014 whether a law has a \u201cconnection with\u201d or a \u201creference to\u201d an ERISA plan \u2014 creates a formalistic analytical distinction. Id., 758. The court suggested, instead, that \u201cboth are simply approximations of the same test. Although in its ERISA [preemption] cases the Supreme Court analyzes state laws by first examining whether they refer to a covered plan and, if not, whether they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>still have some connection with a covered plan, the two categories are not analytically distinct; rather, they are two related methods of determining the fundamental question in ERISA analysis: <em>whether the state law has an impermissible effect on a covered plan.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained recently that a law or claim will interfere with the provisions or administration of ERISA plans if it <em>udictate[s] what benefits employers may offer their employees [or] </em>interfere[s] <em>with the manner in which those benefits are provided.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Safeco Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Musser, </em>65 F.3d 647, 653 (7th Cir. 1995). Additionally, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit examined a series of factors to determine whether ERISA preemption applies, including whether a law or claim involves the historic police powers of the state, whether a provision of the plan is negated, whether the relationships among the primary ERISA entities \u2014 the employer, the plan, the plan fiduciaries, and the beneficiaries \u2014 are altered such that the structure of the plan is changed, and whether there is more than a tenuous or peripheral economic impact. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>68 F.3d 1093, 1099, 1102-1105 (8th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, U.S. , 116 S. Ct. 1266, 134 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has also recently examined the ERISA preemption doctrine in light of <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>In five cases, the court has focused on the Supreme Court\u2019s concerns. Quoting from <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 656-57, the court in <em>O\u2019Shea </em>v. <em>First Manhattan Co. Thrift Plan &amp; Trust, </em>55 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir. 1995), focused on Congress\u2019 goal in enacting ERISA, namely, \u201cto ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a <em>uniform body of benefits law . . . [and to prevent] the potential for conflict in substantive law . . . </em>requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) The court determined that a New York statute requiring death beneficiary designations to be in writing was preempted by ERISA because the statute affected key plan documents and \u201c[h]ad Congress chosen to impose a signature requirement, it could have done so. To impose such a requirement in New York, but not elsewhere, would frustrate ERISA\u2019s goal of establishing a unified national system to safeguard retirement benefits.\u201d Id., 114; see <em>Greenblatt v. Delta Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>68 F.3d 561, 574 (2d Cir. 1995) (primary purpose of ERISA preemption is \u201c \u2018to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>NYS Health Maintenance Organization Conferences. Curiale, </em>64 F.3d 794,800 (2d Cir. 1995), the court focused first on whether the law in question makes \u201creference to\u201d ERISA, in specific, whether it \u201cmentions or alludes to ERISA plans, and if the law affects ERISA plans in some manner,\u201d such as by mandating or manipulating the contents of an insurer\u2019s benefits package. Accord <em>New England Health Care Employees Union </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>65 F.3d 1024, 1032 (2d Cir. 1995). The court also focused on whether the law was impermissibly connected<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> with an ERISA plan by having \u201c \u2018an effect on the primary administrative functions of benefit plans, such as determining an employee\u2019s eligibility for a benefit and the amount of that benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>NYS Health Maintenance Organization Conference v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Curiale, </em>supra, 801. For this to occur, the court stated that the effect must be \u201csufficiently disruptive to ERISA plans to merit preemption.\u201d Id., 800 n.17. Additionally, the court, reiterating <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>concluded that \u201cwithout evidence . . . [of] \u2018such acute, albeit indirect, economic effects ... as to force an ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or to effectively restrict its choice of insurers,\u2019 . . . ERISA does not preempt . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Weltman, </em>66 F.3d 413, 415 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">In the present cases, CIGNA argues that the claims asserted by the plaintiffs are preempted by ERISA because they \u201crelate to\u201d the health care plan that CIGNA administers in that they deal with the administration of the plan.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> CIGNA asserts that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA, CUIPA and common law claims are based upon CIGNA\u2019s decision to restructure the health care coverage that it offers such that certain physicians would no longer be a part of the new provider network, the plaintiffs are directly challenging the propriety of the administration of the plans. CIGNA claims that the connection between the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the ERISA plans is exemplified by the nature of the relief sought, namely, an injunction requiring CIGNA to include the physician plaintiffs in its provider network. Similarly, CIGNA argues that, with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising under P.A. 94-235, in seeking an order to require that CIGNA include the plaintiff physicians in its provider network, the claims relate directly to the administration of the plaintiffs\u2019 employee benefit plans. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not relate to the administration of employee benefit plans. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>claims and relief sought do not impermissibly affect the plans \u2014 they do not attempt to prescribe the substantive administrative aspects of a plan, such as a determination of an employee\u2019s eligibility, the nature and amount of employee benefits, the amount of an employer\u2019s contribution to a plan, and the rules and regulations under which the plan operates. See, e.g., <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 664-65; <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>supra, 506 U.S. 130-33; <em>FMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 60; <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>supra, 471 U.S. 739; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>supra, 463 U.S. 95-100; cf. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Weltman, </em>supra, 66 F.3d 415; <em>NYS Health Maintenance Organization Conference </em>v. <em>Curiale, </em>supra, 64 F.3d 800-801. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not require the administrators to operate the plans differently, they do not force a plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage, they do not tell CIGNA what type of plan to adopt, what coverage to offer, or whom to cover. As the Connecticut State Medical Society' and the American Medical Association argue in their amicus brief to this court, \u201c[u]nder the Act, an insurer, such as CIGNA, can structure its plan . . . and administer it any way it chooses; it simply must disclose, to a limited extent, what the structure of the [preferred provider network] is (by listing the providers) and how it is determined (by listing the criteria). This is not a <em>substantive </em>requirement, or the type which ERISA sought to [preempt].\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Rather than affecting or prescribing the establishment, administration, regulation or maintenance of an employee benefit plan, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims merely turn on requiring CIGNA to enforce the benefit plan that it has already established and is maintaining.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The <em>Hollis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 statutory and common law claims are based on CIGNA\u2019s alleged misrepresentations that their physicians chose not to continue as plan providers and that the physicians did not meet the requisite criteria. One of the alleged reasons that the <em>Hollis </em>plaintiffs became or remained members of this plan was because CIGNA had contracted with certain physicians, whose identities they knew based upon the filing that CIGNA was required to make under P.A. 94-235. The <em>Hollis </em>plaintiffs, therefore, could reasonably presume that as long as their physicians continued to meet the credentialing criteria and did not meet any of the reasons for discharge, that they would continue to be providers under the plan. Furthermore, even if P.A. 94-235 did not exist, the <em>Hollis </em>plaintiffs could reasonably expect that their physicians would continue to be providers under the plan for the duration of the physicians\u2019 contracts with CIGNA and would not be unilaterally terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Similarly, the <em>Napoletano </em>plaintiffs\u2019 claims simply assert that CIGNA has failed to enforce the employee benefit plan that it administers. The <em>Napoletano </em>plaintiffs reasonably believed that they would continue to be providers under the plan as long as they met the criteria that P.A. 94-235 required that CIGNA provide or for the duration of their contracts. The <em>Napoletano </em>plaintiffs are merely asking that their relationship with CIGNA be managed in accordance with a specific filing that CIGNA has made with the state in which CIGNA was required to indicate the criteria by which it would select and could discharge providers, as well as in accordance with their one year contracts with CIGNA. This is not a case in which the <em>Napoletano </em>plaintiffs seek to force themselves into CIGNA\u2019s plan. CIGNA removed the physicians from its list of providers before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>their contracts had expired and without following the requirements of P.A. 94-235 \u2014 it did not inform the plaintiff physicians of its criteria for discharge and did not give alternate reasons for discharging them. Neither class of plaintiffs is requesting that CIGNA change the method by which it determines which physicians will be providers under its plan \u2014 in other words, the plaintiffs are not claiming that CIGNA should change its list of criteria. Instead, the plaintiffs are merely asking that CIGNA disclose its criteria and, subsequently, adhere to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Significantly, CIGNA conceded during oral argument that P.A. 94-235 is not per se preempted by ERISA in that it does not directly affect plan administration and does not interfere with substantive decisions CIGNA makes with respect to structuring health benefit plans. Furthermore, at oral argument, CIGNA conceded that ERISA would not preempt a claim by the plaintiffs that CIGNA had failed to make the requisite filing with the commission pursuant to P.A. 94-235 (e) (l)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> because such a claim would be too remote to the administration of the plan. It follows logically from this concession that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that CIGNA failed to comply with another provision of P.A. 94-235, namely, subsection (e) (2), which provides that \u201c[i]f a network uses criteria that [have] not been filed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection to judge the quality and cost-effectiveness of a health care provider\u2019s practice under any specific program within the network, the network may not reject or terminate the provider participating in that program based upon such criteria until the provider has been informed of the criteria that his practice fails to meet,\u201d is likewise not preempted by ERISA. CIGNA argues, however, that the difference in the relief sought in the two circumstances \u2014 in the former, it is simply that CIGNA make the appropriate filing; in the latter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>it is that CIGNA pay monetary damages for the harm suffered by the plaintiffs \u2014 dictates that ERISA preempts the claim that a provider has been improperly discharged. Because the relief in the second scenario involves the payment of monetary damages, CIGNA argues, the administration of the plan is affected. We disagree with CIGNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The plaintiffs are not seeking monetary damages for their claim that CIGNA violated P.A. 94-235.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Rather, they are seeking a declaratory judgment requiring solely that CIGNA comply with the act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As we have previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>stated, by conceding that a claim that CIGNA failed to make the requisite filing under P.A. 94-235 (e) (1) would not be preempted, CIGNA has essentially conceded that ERISA does not preempt a claim under P.A. 94-235 (e) (2). Although a successful claim under P.A. 94-235 (e) (2) would in effect require that CIGNA continue to employ the plaintiff physicians, such a result would not have an impermissible or burdensome effect on the administration of the plan; see <em>Thiokol Corp., Morton International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 76 F.3d 757-58; <em>Greenblatt </em>v. <em>Delta Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>supra, 68 F.3d 574; because it would simply enforce CIGNA\u2019s plan as CIGNA created it. CIGNA is free to establish a health benefit plan as it chooses \u2014 the plaintiffs are not seeking to require that it adopt a plan with certain features. See <em>NYS Health Maintenance Organization Conference </em>v. <em>Curiale, </em>supra, 64 F.3d 801. Upon adopting such a plan, however, P.A. 94-235, which CIGNA concedes is not per se preempted, requires that CIGNA file with the commission \u201cthe general criteria for its selection or termination of health care providers\u201d and thereafter prohibits the use of criteria that have not been filed to terminate a provider.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Public Acts <em>1994, </em>No. 94-235 (e) (1) and (2). Consequently, no part of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under P.A. 94-235 relates to the administration of the plan and no part of their claim is preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Moreover, preemption of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims would not further the purpose of ERISA preemption, which is to permit the creation of a uniform body of employee benefit law and avoid multiple regulatory schemes. <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. </em>v. Coyne, supra, 482 U.S. 9-11; <em>Greenblatt </em>v. <em>Delta Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>supra, 68 F.3d 574; <em>O\u2019Shea </em>v. <em>First Manhattan Co. Thrift Plan &amp; Trust, </em>supra, 55 F.3d 113. Requiring CIGNA to enforce a plan that it has established according to law does not interfere with the adoption of uniform administrative practices.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Having concluded that ERISA does not preempt the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we must next determine whether P.A. 94-235 confers a private cause of action affording declaratory relief. The parties agree that the act does not expressly provide a private cause of action. The plaintiffs, however, claim that the availability of a private cause of action is implied. \u201cIn determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff one of the class for whose . . . benefit the statute was enacted . . . ? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? . . . Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We will examine the test as it relates to each class of plaintiffs. The act benefits the class of physician providers directly. The act benefits this class by mandating that a preferred provider network, such as that administered by CIGNA, file with the commission a list of participating physicians and a list of criteria for selecting or terminating health care providers. This filing benefits the <em>Napoletano </em>plaintiffs because they are able to determine whether they meet the criteria for selection and continued enrollment with CIGNA\u2019s health care network. Additionally, the act benefits a class of patients, such as the <em>Hollis </em>plaintiffs, by informing them which physicians are available if they take part in a particular plan and by informing them of the credentialing standards for these physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Second, we do not find any indication, explicit or implicit, in the legislative history that the legislature intended either to create or to deny a private cause of action. The history is silent in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Third, providing a private cause of action to the plaintiffs is consistent with the underlying purposes of P.A. 94-235. One purpose of the act is to give health care providers information by which they can determine whether they are eligible for participation in a network. See 37 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17,1994 Sess., p. 5951; id., p. 5956, remarks of Representative Joseph Courtney (\u201c[w]hat this amendment seeks to do is . . . address some of the disclosure and notification problems that providers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>have . . . complained about in terms of their ability to communicate with provider organizations\u201d). A second purpose is to provide information to the public to enable health care purchasers to make informed decisions regarding their choice of health plans and doctors. See id., p. 5980, remarks of Representative Patrick J. Flaherty (\u201cI hope that this legislation will allow all of us to go forward and make decisions based on more complete and accurate information\u201d); id., pp. 5981-82, remarks of Representative Christopher G. Donovan (\u201cThe consumer is not involved in the selection of the network providers as much as they could. There is no consumer report so to speak of the network providers which is given to the consumer, and I feel that if there is more consumer input in the choice of provider and more consumer input in the direction of health care, we can do better with our managed care networks in the state.\u201d). On balance, we are persuaded that, under the criteria set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 78, a private cause of action exists under P.A. 94-235 to enforce its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Additionally, where the legislature wishes to limit enforcement of a statute to an administrative body, it has expressly done so. See, e.g., Connecticut Environmental Protection Act (General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-5, 22a-6a and 22a-6b expressly vests enforcement power in commissioner); CUTPA (General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-1 lOd, 42-110k, 42-110m and 42-110o delineate procedure by which commission is to enforce act). Notably, the legislature has not expressly limited authority to enforce P.A. 94-235 in the commission although it has done so in other sections of chapter 368c of the General Statutes. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 19a-151 (commission has express power to regulate increased charges to patients); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 (commission has express authority to ensure proper application of provision regulating health care facility\u2019s transfer of owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ship); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 (commission must approve certain capital expenditures by health care agency); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-156 (commission has authority to approve, deny or modify hospital\u2019s proposed budget); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-167j (commission has authority to impose civil penalty upon health care facility that fails to file certain requested information, not including that information pursuant to P.A. 94-235). \u201c[T]he use of different words [or the absence of repeatedly used words in the context of] the same [subject matter] must indicate a difference in legislative intention.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988); see <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 694-95. The absence of similar express limitations in P.A. 94-235 supports our conclusion that the act permits a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Furthermore, we discern from the legislative history that to effectuate fully the purposes of P.A. 94-235 of providing health care providers with information so that they can determine whether they are eligible to join a network and of providing the public with information about their choice of health plans and physicians so that they can make informed decisions, \u201cprivate interests [would not be] amply served without private causes of action.\u201d <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 495, 642 A.2d 699 (1994). Because the act does not provide a mechanism enabling private individuals to file grievances, private persons would be denied all access to the administrative enforcement process in the absence of a private cause of action. Cf. Connecticut Environmental Protection Act (General Statutes \u00a7 22a-13 provides that council on environmental quality is empowered to receive citizen grievances alleging violation of any statute regarding environmental quality). Accordingly, we conclude that P.A. 94-235 confers a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>private cause of action for declaratory relief upon the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the cases to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b provides: \u201cUnfair trade practices prohibited.

Each received treatment from a physician who, at the time treatment commenced, participated in CIGNA\u2019s health care network. Thereafter, according to the allegations by each plaintiff, CIGNA removed the physicians treating each of the plaintiffs and engaged in a course of conduct that was substantially similar to what Hollis has alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The other plaintiffs in the <em>Hottis </em>case are Vinetta Hollis, Elaine Arnett, Ellen Gentile, Darlene Chiloyan, Margaret Cooper, Richard Johnson, Sharon Johnson and Don Ludwinowicz.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b237-5\"> Although it appears from the amended complaint in <em>Hollis </em>that the plaintiffs are bringing separate causes of action under CUTPA and CUIPA, they explain in their brief and in their reply brief to this court that their \u201cCUIPA [counts] ... are incorporated in [their] CUTPA counts.\u201d This is the same response they offered to CIGNA\u2019s motion to strike, in which CIGNA claimed that there is no private cause of action under CUIPA independent of CUTPA.

The administration of the plan is not affected in a greater way by mandating that a plan pay money damages for violating a law than by mandating that a plan make an appropriate filing according to law. In either situation, CIGNA is left \u201cright where [it] would be in any case, with the responsibility to choose the best overall coverage for the money.\u201d <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins.

Where a cause of action to enforce the filing requirements of P.A. 94-235 is admittedly not preempted, CIGNA cannot thereafter argue that just because the remedy of another type of enforcement would be monetary damages, preemption suddenly applies.
