Hickey (defendant), from the claims of the substitute plaintiff, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (plaintiff). The plaintiffs predecessor in interest, Central Bank, commenced this action seeking damages for the defendant\u2019s default on a promissory note and, thereafter, obtained a prejudgment garnishment of the defendant\u2019s IRAs. After the plaintiff had obtained a judgment against the defendant, the trial court, on motion of the defendant, dissolved the plaintiffs attachment for failure to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 52-328 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court further concluded that the defendant\u2019s IRAs were exempt from execution by the plaintiff under the express terms of P.A. 92-215. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The pertinent facts and procedural history are not in dispute. On May 3, 1988, the defendant was one of several signatories<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a promissory note executed by Central Bank for a loan. In July, 1991, Central Bank filed this action<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking damages for default on the promissory note and, on August 6, 1991, it secured a prejudgment garnishment of the defendant\u2019s IRAs pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 52-278f, as amended by Public Acts 1991, No. 91-315, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 5,1992, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was substituted as party plaintiff for Central Bank. Thereafter, on October 1, 1992, P.A. 92-215 took effect, extending to certain IRA funds the exemption from attachment and execution that the legislature had previously granted to other types of retirement accounts under P.A. 91-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">On July 25,1994, the trial court defaulted the defendant for failure to disclose a defense. After a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>on damages, the trial court, on September 27, 1994, rendered judgment against the defendant in the amount of $104,821.27. The plaintiff, however, failed to seek execution of its judgment against the defendant until February 1, 1995. The defendant moved to dissolve the prejudgment attachment on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 52-328 (a), which requires that a \u201cjudgment creditor, in order to perfect an attachment or garnishment made prior to judgment on [its] claim, must take out an execution and have it levied on the real or personal estate attached or have demand made on the garnishee within sixty days after final judgment.\u201d <em>Bradbury </em>v. <em>Wodjenski, </em>159 Conn. 366, 370, 269 A.2d 271 (1970). The defendant also claimed that his IRAs were exempt from execution under P.A. 92-215. The trial court, <em>Hon. Anthony V. DeMayo, </em>state trial referee, granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dissolve the attachment and, furthermore, concluded that the plaintiff, having failed properly to perfect its attachment before P.A. 92-215 went into effect, was barred by P.A. 92-215 from executing its judgment against the defendant\u2019s IRAs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The plaintiff makes two arguments in support of its claim that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant\u2019s IRAs are exempt from execution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, the plaintiff asserts that P.A. 92-215 should not be construed to protect the defendant\u2019s IRAs from execution because to do so would give P.A. 92-215 retroactive effect in violation of the plaintiffs right to execute against the defendant\u2019s assets to the same extent that it could have when its claim against the defendant arose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, the plaintiff contends that the retroactive appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>cation of P.A. 92-215 violates his rights under the contract clause of article one, \u00a7 10, of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Our reasons for rejecting the plaintiffs claims may be briefly stated. Because the plaintiff does not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dissolve the plaintiffs prejudgment garnishment for failure to comply with \u00a7 52-328 (a), we presume that the garnishment was properly dissolved. The plaintiff, therefore, having failed to perfect its attachment within the time period prescribed by \u00a7 52-328 (a), forfeited whatever rights that it may have had arising out of that attachment, including its security interest in the defendant\u2019s IRAs relating back to the date of the garnishment in August, 1991.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plaintiffs right to execute against the defendant\u2019s IRAs must be determined as of February 1,1995, the date on which he sought to execute against the IRAs, and not, as the plaintiff claims, as of the date it obtained the prejudgment garnishment. Because the exemption against execution granted to IRAs under P.A. 92-215 took effect on October 1, 1992, and the plaintiff did not seek to execute against the defendant\u2019s IRAs until February 1, 1995, P.A. 92-215, applied prospectively, bars the plaintiffs execution against those accounts. Thus, the plaintiffs claims regarding the retrospective application of P.A. 92-215 are inapposite.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The plaintiff, in light of its failure to comply with \u00a7 52-328 (a), does not seriously contend that its right to execute against the defendant\u2019s IRAs relates back to the date of attachment. It claims, rather, that it obtained a vested right to satisfy its judgment against the defendant\u2019s assets, including his IRAs, at the time the loan to the defendant was made and, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s application of P.A. 92-215 improperly extinguished those rights. The plaintiff has provided no support whatsoever for its bald assertion that an unsecured creditor has a vested interest in the pool of assets owned by the debtor at the time the debt is created.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the contrary, the very nature of an unsecured debt is that the creditor has no current legal interest in the assets of its debtor. The plaintiffs argument, therefore, is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> Public Act 92-215, which amended General Statutes \u00a7 52-321a (a), provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any interest in or amounts payable to a participant or beneficiary from (1) any trust, custodial account, annuity or insurance contract established as part of a Keogh plan or a retirement plan established by a corporation which is qualified under Section 401, 403, 404 or 409 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, (2) any individual retirement account which is qualified under Section 408 of said Internal Revenue Code to the extent funded, including income and appreciation, (A) as a rollover from a qualified retirement plan, as provided in subdivision (1) of this section, pursuant to Section 402(a)(5), 403(a) or 408(d)(3) of said Internal Revenue Code or (B) by annual contributions which do not exceed 1he maximum annual limits set forth in Section 219(b) of said Internal Revenue Code, determined without regard to any reduction or limitation for active participants required by Section 219(g) of said Internal Revenue Code or (3) any pension plan, annuity or insurance contract or similar arrangement not described in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, established by federal or state statute for federal, state or municipal employees for the primary purpose of providing benefits upon retirement by reason of age, health or length of service, shall be exempt from the claims of all creditors of such participant or beneficiary.
