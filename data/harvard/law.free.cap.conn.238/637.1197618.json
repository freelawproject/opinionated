The third party plaintiff, Universal Machine Company (Universal), the insured and defendant in the underlying negligence action, appeals from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the third party defendant, Seaco Insurance Company (Seaco), on the third party complaint. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The facts relevant to this case are set forth in the complaint filed by the plaintiff in the underlying action, Virginia A. Flint, and are undisputed. Universal is a machine shop engaged in the business of repairing industrial machinery. On various dates in October, 1990, Universal visited the site of Selmix-Alco Company (Selmix-Alco),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Flint\u2019s employer, to perform a retrofitting procedure on a fifty ton machine press used by Selmix-Alco in the manufacture of machine parts. Subsequent to these retrofitting procedures, the press malfunctioned, by repeating the operation cycle without warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The complaint further alleges that Universal made several failed attempts at correcting the problem. On December 5, 1990, while Flint was operating the press as part of her employment duties, the press once again malfunctioned, crushing several of her fingers in its mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Thereafter, Flint brought an action against Universal alleging negligence in repairing the press and in failing to warn her of the machine\u2019s dangerous condition. The negligence action resulted in a stipulated judgment against Universal in the amount of $43,000, and caused Universal to incur reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of $30,000 in defense of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Universal then brought a third party action against its insurer, Seaco, alleging that Seaco\u2019s failure to defend Universal in Flint\u2019s negligence action was a breach of the parties\u2019 insurance contract, and sought damages for the full amount of the judgment including defense costs. See <em>Missionaries of Co. of Mary, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>155 Conn. 104, 113-14, 230 A.2d 21 (1967) (breach of duty to defend requires insurer to reimburse insured for full amount of obligation reasonably incurred by such insured as result of breach).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The comprehensive general liability policy issued by Seaco that was in effect on the date the repair work was performed and on the date Flint was injured contained an exclusion entitled \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d According to the definition in the policy, a \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exclusion removes from coverage all occurrences of \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 . . . arising out of \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work.\u2019 \u201d Excepted from this exclusion is \u201c[w]ork that has not yet been completed or abandoned.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Seaco claims that if work has been com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>pleted the exclusion applies, and it is not obligated to defend an action alleging injuries arising out of such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Universal alleges in its third party complaint that Seaco, after conducting an investigation into the allegations of Flint\u2019s complaint, wrongly disclaimed coverage under the policy and wrongly declined both to defend and to indemnify Universal. Following a court trial, the trial court determined that the allegations set forth in Flint\u2019s complaint against Universal fell within the policy exclusion and, therefore, did not trigger Seaco\u2019s duty to defend Universal in that action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court rendered judgment for Seaco on the third party complaint. Universal appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">On appeal, Universal claims that the trial court improperly determined that Seaco had not been not required to defend Universal in the underlying action. Specifically, Universal argues that: (1) the policy exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>sion relied upon by Seaco is ambiguous and thus should be construed against Seaco; (2) alternatively, the allegations of Flint\u2019s complaint were sufficient for the trial court to conclude that Seaco\u2019s duty to defend was triggered; and (3) even if the exclusion applied, the complaint\u2019s allegation of a failure to warn of the negligent repair work did not fall within the exclusion. Seaco argues that it did not have a duty to defend Universal because it could be clearly determined from the face of Flint\u2019s complaint that the alleged negligent work performed by Universal had been completed when her injury occurred, thus bringing the work within the exclusion. We agree with Seaco that the allegations contained in Flint\u2019s complaint did not trigger a duty to defend and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We address at the outset Universal\u2019s claim that the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exclusion relied upon by Seaco in refusing to defend Flint\u2019s claim is ambiguous and, therefore, must be construed against the drafter of the policy. We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the terms of the policy, particularly the foregoing exclusion, are clear and unambiguous and, therefore, leave no room for construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the provisions of the contract of insurance.\u201d <em>Gottesman </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., 177 </em>Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979). Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision of this issue is de novo. \u201cUnlike certain other contracts . . . where . . . the intent of the parties and thus the meaning of the contract is a factual question subject to limited appellate review . . . construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 58, 588 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>A.2d 138 (1991). Although there have been cases in which the interpretation of an insurance contract has rested on factual questions; see, e.g., <em>Libero </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>141 Conn. 574, 580, 108 A.2d 533 (1954); this is not such a case. It is undisputed that Universal\u2019s repair work had been performed negligently, and that Flint\u2019s injuries occurred as a result of such negligence. The only questions raised in this case are whether the allegations set forth in Flint\u2019s complaint triggered Seaco\u2019s obligation to defend Universal, its insured in the underlying action, and whether the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exclusion is ambiguous. These issues present questions of law, which we review de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">It is axiomatic that a contract of insurance must be viewed in its entirety, and the intent of the parties for entering it derived from the four corners of the policy. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Peerless Ins. Co., </em>774 F. Sup. 83, 86 (D. Conn. 1991); see <em>Ceci </em>v. <em>National Indemnity Co., </em>225 Conn. 165, 175-76, 622 A.2d 545 (1993). Universal\u2019s contention that the exclusion is ambiguous focuses on the manner in which \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d is phrased. It argues that because the term \u201chazard\u201d is singular, and the terms \u201cproducts\u201d and \u201ccompleted operations\u201d are coordinated under the same hyphenated provision, an insured would reasonably assume that the exclusion only applies to situations involving the negligent manufacture or sale of a product, and not to Universal\u2019s day-to-day work, which is the off-premises repair of the equipment of others. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In <em>Smedley Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>143 Conn. 510, 123 A.2d 755 (1956), we addressed the issue of whether a claim of negligence arising solely out of the rendering of services fell within a \u201cproducts hazard\u201d exclusion, the definition of which contained, and thus excluded from coverage, completed opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tions. In <em>Smedley </em>Co., the insured owner of a warehouse sought to recover from the insurer attorney\u2019s fees that the insured had incurred in defending itself in an action brought against it for negligently delivering to a buyer goods other than those ordered. Id., 513. The insurer had refused to defend the action on the ground that the allegations of the underlying complaint fell within the \u201cproducts hazard\u201d exclusion of the comprehensive general liability policy. Id., 513-14. The term \u201cproducts hazard\u201d was defined in the policy to include: \u201c \u2018(2) operations, if the accident occurs after such operations have been completed or abandoned at the place of occurrence thereof and away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the insured ....\u2019\u201d Id., 514.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We considered the definition of \u201cproducts hazard\u201d to create some ambiguity in the policy and noted that \u201c[t]here might have been less awkwardness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>expressed intent had the policy before us, instead of utilizing the paragraph as an additional definition of \u2018products hazard,\u2019 segregated it in a \u2018completed operations\u2019 clause, and then excluded such operations.\u201d Id., 515-16. We concluded, nevertheless, that the definition was sufficiently clear to exclude from coverage liability arising out of the insured\u2019s operations. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Similarly in the present case, although the title \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d retains some of the same general flaws of expression that were at issue in the comprehensive general liability policy in <em>Smedley Co.; </em>see footnote 5; and thus might have been more artfully drafted, this provision cannot be construed in a vacuum. <em>Ceci </em>v. <em>National Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 225 Conn. 168. The definition of the exclusion as contained in the policy clears up whatever confusion might be embodied in its title. The definition expressly states that all bodily injury or property damage \u201carising out of \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d is excluded from coverage. As we noted in <em>Horak </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>181 Conn. 614, 616-17, 436 A.2d 783 (1980), \u201cthe use of the disjunctive conjunction \u2018or\u2019 unambiguously requires that either of the exclusions separated by the conjunction, if applicable, excludes coverage.\u201d By use of the conjunction \u201cor\u201d between product and work, it is made sufficiently clear that the \u201chazard\u201d to be excluded is that arising from <em>either </em>products once out of the insured\u2019s possession, <em>or </em>from the insured\u2019s work once completed. There is no other reasonable reading that may be given to this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We recognize that, in purchasing the comprehensive general liability insurance policy in this case, Universal may have sought to protect itself from exposure to liability for its negligence in the performance of its routine work, work that the Seaco policy specifically excludes from coverage. We cannot, however, ignore the expression of policy language that, although it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>retains some of the awkward phrasing that had apparently been eliminated in the revised comprehensive general liability policy, conveys its meaning nonetheless. \u201cA court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 696, 703, 569 A.2d 1131 (1990). Reading the exclusion and its definition in their entirety, and in the context of the policy as a whole, we conclude that the clause is sufficiently clear, as a matter of law, in excluding from coverage those hazards arising from Universal\u2019s completed operations. We agree, therefore, with the trial court that the policy exclusion for completed operations is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Universal next claims that Flint\u2019s complaint was sufficient on its face to trigger Seaco\u2019s duty to defend. Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">It is beyond dispute that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend, being much broader in scope and application than its duty to indemnify, is determined by reference to the allegations contained in the complaint. See, e.g., <em>Keithan </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>159 Conn. 128, 138, 267 A.2d 660 (1970). \u201cThe obligation of the insurer to defend does not depend on whether the injured party will successfully maintain a cause of action against the insured but on whether he has, in his complaint, stated facts which bring the injury within the coverage. If the latter situation prevails, the policy requires the insurer to defend, irrespective of the insured\u2019s ultimate liability. ... It necessarily follows that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is measured by the allegations of the complaint. . . . Hence, if the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>plaint sets forth a cause of action within the coverage of the policy, the insurer must defend.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Smedley Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In <em>Missionaries of Co. of Mary, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 155 Conn. 112, we quoted with approval the words of Judge Learned Hand, explaining that \u201cthe duty to defend means \u2018that the insurer will defend the suit, if the injured party states a claim, which, qua claim, is for an injury \u201ccovered\u201d by the policy; it is the claim which determines the insurer\u2019s duty to defend; and it is irrelevant that the insurer may get information from the insured, or from any one else, which indicates, or even demonstrates, that the injury is not in fact \u201ccovered.\u201d The insurer has promised to relieve the insured of the burden of satisfying the tribunal where the suit is tried, that the claim as pleaded is \u201cgroundless.\u201d \u2019 \u201d See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>178 F.2d 750, 751-52 (2d Cir. 1949). Hence, if Flint\u2019s complaint alleged facts that brought it within the ambit of coverage of Universal\u2019s liability policy, Seaco was obligated to defend Universal in the action. \u201cOn the other hand, if the complaint alleges a liability which the policy does not cover, the insurer is not required to defend.\u201d <em>Smedley Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 517.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Universal argues that because Flint\u2019s complaint failed explicitly to allege that the negligently performed work had been completed within the meaning of the exclusion, Seaco was not justified in refusing to defend Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>versal in the underlying action on the ground that the allegation fell within the exclusion. Despite the absence in the complaint of any form of the word \u201ccomplete\u201d in reference to Universal\u2019s work, we nevertheless agree with the trial court that the requisite establishment of the work\u2019s completion may be readily gleaned from the allegations set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The applicable provision of Universal\u2019s policy that defines when work is deemed \u201ccompleted,\u201d and thus excluded from coverage, is contained in paragraph 11 (b) (3) of the definitions section. It provides that Universal\u2019s work \u201cwill be deemed completed . . . [w]hen that part of the work done at a job site has been put to its intended use by any person.\u201d Thus, once the equipment is put to its intended use, the work is deemed \u201ccompleted\u201d for purposes of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The trial court properly concluded that, when she was injured, Flint had been putting the machine press to its \u201cintended use,\u201d and that this fact was clearly alleged in her complaint. The parties had stipulated that Universal\u2019s work was performed at the Selmix-Alco site. The only question, therefore, is whether at the time Flint sustained her injuries, she was using the press for purposes other than those for which it was designed. Flint alleged in her complaint, however, that at the time of her injuries she was an employee of Selmix-Alco and had been assigned to operate the press. Flint further alleged that as a result of her operation of the press, it malfunctioned, causing her to sustain injuries. Flint\u2019s complaint clearly alleged, therefore, that when the injury occurred she had been operating the machine in accordance with its intended use as part of her employment duties. Contrary to Universal\u2019s claim, the requisite events necessary to trigger the exclusion were sufficiently alleged. We agree with the trial court, therefore, that Flint\u2019s use of the machine press at the time she sustained her injury fits squarely within the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of the excluded \u201ccompleted work\u201d set forth in paragraph 11 (b) (3) of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Further, the allegations of the complaint regarding the previous repairs to the press support the conclusion that the repairs constituted a \u201ccompleted operation\u201d as defined in the policy language. To hold otherwise would be to conclude that Universal\u2019s workmanship was not completed because the repairs had been negligently performed, leaving the machine in a perpetually defective state. As we stated in <em>Smedley Co., </em>and as was noted by the trial court, to so \u201cconstrue the language of the excluding clauses would deprive them of all meaning and purpose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smedley Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 518. The rationale for the insurer\u2019s use of such an excluding clause thus becomes clear. A policy that contains an exclusion for \u201ccompleted operations hazard\u201d conveys the parties\u2019 intention \u201c \u2018to limit the [insurer\u2019s] liability to accidents occurring during the progress of the work and to exclude liability for accidents occurring, after the work was completed, as the result of defective workmanship.\u2019 \u201d Id. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that Flint\u2019s complaint on its face alleged that Universal\u2019s work was \u201ccompleted,\u201d thus bringing it within the policy exclusion and relieving Seaco of its duty to defend Universal in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Universal\u2019s final contention is that Seaco was obligated to defend Universal because the negligent failure to warn allegation contained in Flint\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>removed the claim from the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exclusion. In this regard, Universal argues that an allegation of a failure to act, as distinguished from the defective performance of an act, mandates coverage under the policy. We agree with the trial court that the failure to warn allegation set forth in Flint\u2019s complaint relates to and is part of the defective workmanship claims upon which the complaint is founded and, therefore, that the policy exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Whether failure to warn of a defective condition is encompassed within a \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exclusion is a question of first impression in this state. On facts similar to those in the present case, other jurisdictions have consistently held that the failure to warn is included within the underlying claim of defective workmanship and, therefore, subject to the completed operations hazard exclusion. See <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Bituminous Casualty Corp., </em>59 Ill. 2d 165, 172-73, 319 N.E.2d 491 (1974); <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>177 Ind. App. 299, 310, 379 N.E.2d 510 (1978); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Avant, </em>404 So. 2d 1311, 1313 (La. App. 1981) (property damage that occurs as result of faulty design and workmanship, including failure to warn of such defects, falls within completed operations hazard exclusion); <em>Mut </em>v. <em>Newark Ins. Co., </em>289 So. 2d 237, 248 (La. App. 1973), cert. denied, 290 So. 2d 910 (La. 1974) (\u201cfailure to warn of defective workmanship falls within the ambit of completed operations hazard where damage from such failure results after the work is completed\u201d); <em>Oceanonics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Petroleum Distributing Co., </em>280 So. 2d 874, 880 (La. App. 1973), aff'd, 292 So. 2d 190 (La. 1974) (where close relationship between failure to warn and completed operations hazard exists, exclusion from coverage of latter operates to exclude from coverage allegations of former).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>In <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Bituminous Casualty Corp., </em>supra, 59 Ill. 2d 167, the underlying complaint contained five allegations of negligence. The first four involved negligence in loading magnesium onto a truck. The fifth alleged that the company had been negligent in failing to warn the driver of the dangerous cargo, which exploded. The court found that a completed operations hazard exclusion, which was almost identical to the one in Universal\u2019s policy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> operated to exclude coverage of claims based on injuries sustained as a result of negligence in loading the truck. Id., 172-73. The court rejected the company\u2019s argument that the allegation of failure to warn had created the potential that the injury arose, not from the negligent loading of the truck, but rather from the failure to warn the driver of the truck\u2019s contents so that he might take proper precautions. Id. It focused on the fact that the failure to warn allegation \u201cwas not centered on simply the failure to warn of the contents, but rather it was directed to the failure to warn of the <em>manner </em>in which the magnesium was loaded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 172. The court in <em>Weiss </em>concluded that because this final allegation \u201creferred back\u201d to those allegations of negligence that were excluded under the completed operations exclusion, the face of the complaint contained no allegations that would warrant coverage. Id., 172-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Similarly, in <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 177 Ind. App. 305, the court recognized that \u201cmost accidents (which lead to lawsuits) can be traced to some preexisting negligence,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[ejxtension of coverage to all such accidents would render a [products [h]azard exclusion meaningless in the many cases in which an insured recommends or makes representations about his products or services, <em>or fails to warn of potential </em>dangers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 305-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The cases cited by Universal in support of its claim are distinguishable from the present case in that they did not involve the performance of faulty workmanship. Rather, they concerned the failure of a product seller to advise properly on the use of what could otherwise be a defective product. For instance, <em>Cooling </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>269 So. 2d 294 (La. App. 1972), cert. denied, 272 So. 2d 373 (La. 1973), involved the sale of a diesel engine and the subsequent failure to warn of the need for safety devices to be attached to the engine. The court noted that \u201cthe alleged negligence under the peculiar facts of this case wherein there is neither a defective product sold nor faulty workmanship involved, is ... in the nature of a general risk of doing business which is the sort of risk which motivated [the obtaining of] liability insurance.\u201d Id., 297. Similarly, <em>Templet </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>341 So. 2d 1248 (La. App. 1976), cert. denied, 343 So. 2d 1077 (La. 1977), involved a failure to warn of the danger of installing a tire from the wrong side of a rim, not, as in the present case, a failure to warn of negligently performed repairs. Thus, the cases upon which Universal relies involve the sale of a product and the failure to warn of a danger incident to its known intended use. They do not address the type of failure to warn claim at issue in this case, which is a claim that refers to the hazards of defective workmanship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>which hazards are specifically excluded from coverage under the completed operations exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">We find the reasoning in <em>Weiss </em>and <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>to be persuasive. Flint\u2019s complaint alleged that Universal failed to warn of the \u201cunsafe and dangerous condition\u201d of the machine press on which it had performed repairs. Clearly, this allegation refers back to those allegations comprising Flint\u2019s negligent workmanship claim against Universal. They are not separate and distinct claims. It logically follows that if claims based on the results of negligently performed work are excluded from coverage, then, so too, should an alleged failure to warn of such work be excluded as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the allegation of negligent failure to warn of defective workmanship in this case did not trigger a duty to defend where the defective workmanship itself was excluded from coverage under the policy exclusion at issue. To rule otherwise would be to obviate an otherwise applicable exclusion by a backdoor method.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> The plaintiff in the underlying action filed three complaints: (1) an original complaint; (2) an amended complaint; and (3) a revised amended complaint.

The majority of courts facing the issue held that the completed operations provision did not apply to an insured if its business was predominantly service oriented, thus construing the provision against the insurer. Included among the factors influencing the courts\u2019 decisions were: (1) the completed operations hazard being tied in by hyphen, format and premium charge with the products hazard; (2) the singular nature of the word \u201chazard\u201d in \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d; and (3) whether the language and arrangement of the policy would lead the ordinary person to believe he had coverage for risks arising from completed operations. R. Henderson, \u201cInsurance Protection for Products Liability and Completed Operations \u2014 What Every Lawyer Should Know,\u201d 50 Neb. L. Rev. 415, 422-23 (1971). As one court noted about the pre-1966 policy, \u201cwhen the contract involves ... the rendering of services which do not involve the furnishing or supplying of any product or material, the question of liability insurance coverage under the products hazard provision becomes most difficult.\u201d <em>Nielson </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>174 F. Sup. 648, 654 (N.D. Iowa 1959), aff'd, 277 F.2d 455 (8th Cir. 1960); R. Henderson, supra, 50 Neb. L. Rev. 421. In 1966, the insurance industry adopted the revised standard comprehensive general liability policy, in which the completed operations hazard was generally set off from the products hazard exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\"> The fact that Seaco looked to outside sources beyond the face of the complaint t.o determine 1he validity of the allegations is irrelevant, if the complaint, in and of itself, sufficiently disclosed whether coverage is warranted.
