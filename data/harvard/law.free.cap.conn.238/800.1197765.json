Doty and Denise Doty, for reimbursement of certain containment costs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a.-4.52,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was time barred. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>plaintiffs appeal from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Steve Mucci, doing business as Steve\u2019s Oil Burning Service. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">For the purposes of this appeal, the following facts are not in dispute. On September 17,1988, the defendant installed an oil tank at the residence of Peter Silver in Sandy Hook. On June 21, 1991, the plaintiffs purchased the property from Silver. In July, 1991, the plaintiffs discovered that the well on their property had been contaminated. On June 23, 1993, the plaintiffs filed a claim against the defendant alleging that on September 17, 1988, he had negligently installed and filled an oil tank on the property, thereby causing the discharge of 200 gallons of oil. As a result, the plaintiffs alleged that their well was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. The plaintiffs further alleged that they had incurred and would continue to incur costs to \u201cobtain or otherwise mitigate the effects of the contamination.\u201d They sought, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452, reimbursement from the defendant of the \u201creasonable cost expended ... to contain, remove or otherwise mitigate the contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In his amended answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the defendant raised a special defense alleging that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, namely, either General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 or General Statutes \u00a7 52-584.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>moved for summary judgment on the basis of the special defense. In support of his motion, the defendant argued that: (1) because the plaintiffs\u2019 claim sounded in negligence, it was governed by \u00a7 52-584, pursuant to which it was time barred; or (2) alternatively, the claim was governed by \u00a7 52-577, pursuant to which it was also time barred. The plaintiffs argued that the applicable statute of limitations for claims brought under \u00a7 22a-452 was General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to which their claim was timely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Thereafter, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court did not determine which of the statutes of limitations advanced by the parties was applicable, reasoning that \u201c[Regardless of which statute of limitations applies to actions brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452, the action [in the present case] must have been brought no later than September 17, 1991,\u201d and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, having been brought after that date, was time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>barred. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that their claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452 are governed by \u00a7 52-577c (b) and that, because their claim was brought within two years of their discovery of the contamination, their claim was timely. The plaintiffs appear to concede that if their claim does not fall within \u00a7 52-577c, it is time barred under either \u00a7 52-577 or \u00a7 52-584 because the defendant\u2019s actions that form the basis of their claim occurred more than three years before their claim was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The defendant offers several arguments in support of his claim that the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is time barred. First, he argues that \u00a7 52-577c is not applicable to claims brought for reimbursement of containment costs pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452 because such claims do not constitute claims for \u201cdamages for . . . property damage\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-577c or \u00a7 52-584 and, therefore, that \u00a7 52-577 is the applicable statute of limitations, pursuant to which the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is untimely. Alternatively, the defendant argues that, if claims for reimbursement pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452 are properly considered claims for property damage, \u00a7 52-584 is the applicable statute of limitations for such claims because they are grounded in negligence, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is untimely under \u00a7 52-584. Finally, the defendant argues that, even if \u00a7 52-577c applies to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim does not fall within it because \u00a7 52-577c incorporates, by reference to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Act (CERCLA); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.; the exclusion of petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, and the plaintiffs\u2019 claim alleges petroleum contamination. Accordingly, he argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim falls within either \u00a7 52-577 or \u00a7 52-584, and that under both statutes, the claim is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, we agree with the defendant that, even if the plaintiffs are correct that \u00a7 52-577c applies to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim falls within the petroleum exclusion, and is therefore, outside the ambit of \u00a7 52-577c. Accordingly, their claim is time barred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201cThe standards governing our review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well established. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995). \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 745. \u201cThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law; <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); and the party opposing such a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Practice Book \u00a7 381.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>229 Conn. 99, 105, 639 A.2d 507 (1994). Summary judgment maybe granted where the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. See <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 566-70, 512 A.2d 893 (1986); <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984) (summary judgment affirmed on ground that suit barred by statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Section 52-577c (b), by its express terms, governs actions \u201cto recover damages for personal injury or property damage caused by exposure to a hazardous chemical substance or mixture<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or hazardous pollutant released into the environment . . . .\u201d \u201cHazardous pollutant\u201d is defined in the statute as \u201cany designated, specified or referenced chemical considered to be a \u2018hazardous substance\u2019 under Section 101 (14) of [CER-CLA] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (14) . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (a) (4). The definition of \u201chazardous substance\u201d in CERCLA provides in relevant part: \u201cThe term [hazardous substance] does not include petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof which is not otherwise specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance under subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (14) (1994). This provision is commonly referred to as the petroleum exclusion. <em>Wilshire Westwood Associates </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Corp., </em>881 F.2d 801, 803 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>At oral argument, the plaintiffs conceded that \u00a7 52-577c incorporates the petroleum exclusion and that, to the extent that their claim is to recover costs for containing or mitigating petroleum discharge, it falls within the statutory exclusion and outside the scope of the extended statute of limitations of \u00a7 52-577c. The plaintiffs contend, however, that contamination attributable to an oil tank \u201cbottom,\u201d that is sludge that forms in the bottom of a tank in which oil is stored by the settling of water and suspended solids in the oil; see <em>Cose </em>v. <em>Getty Oil Co., 4 </em>F.3d 700, 702 (9th Cir. 1993); does not fall within the petroleum exclusion. See id.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Western Processing Co., </em>761 F. Sup. 713 (W.D. Wash. 1991) (oil tank bottom sludge disposed of by oil company did not come within CERCLA petroleum exclusion). They further argue that it is \u201cpossible\u201d that the contamination of their well was due in some part to sludge that could have been released when oil was spilled by the defendant and, therefore, there exists a question of fact as to whether the exclusion for petroleum in \u00a7 52-577c (b) applies to their claim and, consequently, as to whether the claim is time barred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">\u201cIn evaluating the propriety of a summary judgment, we are confined to an examination of the pleadings and affidavits of the parties to determine whether (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u2019 \u2019 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 233 Conn. 745. Even if we were to assume that the petroleum exclusion is properly interpreted not to include contamination due in part to the release of sludge from the bottom of the plaintiffs\u2019 oil tank,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and even if we were to read the pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>generously, there is simply no basis in the allegations or any evidence in the record to raise a question of fact regarding the source of the contamination of the plaintiffs\u2019 well. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint states only that their well had become contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons as a result of the defendant\u2019s having caused, in connection with his installation of and filling of an oil tank on the property, the discharge of 200 gallons of oil into the groundwater. The complaint fails to allege that the contamination of the well was due to sludge in addition to the oil. The plaintiffs also failed to allege that the contamination was due to sludge either in response to the defendant\u2019s special defense or by way of affidavit. \u201cIt is not enough . . . for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of ... a disputed issue.\u201d <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 455. Rather, the party opposing summary judgment \u201cmust substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 745. On this record, there is nothing from which a fact finder could conclude that there is a sufficient foundation to give rise to a question of fact as to whether the contamination was attributable to sources other than the spilled petroleum. We conclude, therefore, that as a matter of law, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim falls within the petroleum exclusion and outside the scope of \u00a7 52-577c. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the defendant on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452 provides: \u201cReimbursement for containment or removal costs. Liability for certain acts or omissions, (a) Any person, firm, corporation or municipality which contains or removes or otherwise mitigates the effects of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes resulting from any discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of such substance or material or waste shall be entitled to reimbursement from any person, firm or corpora-1ion for the reasonable costs expended for such containment, removal, or mitigation, if such oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous wastes pollution or contamination or other emergency resulted from the negligence or other actions of such person, firm or corporation. When such pollution or contamination or emergency results from the joint negligence or other actions of two or more persons, firms or corporations, each shall be liable to the others for a pro rata share of the costs of containing, and removing or otherwise mitigating the effects of the same and for all damage caused thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">\u201c(b) No person, firm or corporation which renders assistance or advice in mitigating or attempting to mitigate the effects of an actual or threatened discharge of oil or petroleum or chemical liquids or solid, liquid or gaseous products or hazardous materials, other than a discharge of oil as defined in section 22a-457b, to the surface waters of the state, or which assists in preventing, cleaning-up or disposing of any such discharge shall be held liable, notwithstanding any other provision of law, for civil damages as a result of any act or omission by him in rendering such assistance or advice, except acts or omissions amounting to gross negligence or wilful or wanton misconduct, unless he is compensated for such assistance or advice for more than actual expenses. For the purpose of this subsection, \u2018discharge\u2019 means spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration and \u2018hazardous materials\u2019 means any material or substance designated as such by any state or federal law or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">\u201c(c) The immunity provided in this section shall not apply to (1) any person, firm or corporation responsible for such discharge, or under a duty to mitigate the effects of such discharge, (2) any agency or instrumentality of such person, firm or corporation or (3) negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\"> Subsequently, this case was consolidated with the case of <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport, Docket No. CV 92 02923192 S.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 provides: \u201cAction founded upon a tort.

The defendant does not advance this interpretation of \u00a7 52-577c (b) on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\"> Because we conclude that the plaintiffs cannot prevail even if, as they contend, \u00a7 52-577c applies to claims brought under \u00a7 22a-452, we do not reach the issue of whether \u00a7 52-577c is the applicable statute of limitations for such claims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>195 Conn. 1, 15 n.11, 485 A.2d 570 (1985) (court will not address issues the resolution of which is purely academic).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> \u201cHazardous chemical substance or mixture\u201d is defined as \u201cany chemical substance or mixture for which there is a federal standard, including any law, requirement, tolerance, prohibition, action level or similar legal authority adopted by an agency pursuant to federal law, including any such standard or legal authority adopted by a state or local government pursuant to federal law, generally intended to prevent, reduce or mitigate the risk of a disease or class or type of diseases to an individual or individuals resulting from exposure to such chemical substance or mixture . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-577C (a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> The defendant argues that, even if the contamination was due in part to sludge from the bottom of the plaintiffs\u2019 oil tank, their claim would still fall within the petroleum exclusion because the sludge is composed of materials indigenous to petroleum.
