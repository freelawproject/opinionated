Meachum, the commissioner of the department of correction (department),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in his individual and official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>capacities, challenging certain department regulations governing inmate use of the telephone and mail systems within Connecticut correctional facilities. The plaintiffs appeal, claiming that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the department regulations permitting the monitoring and recording of nonprivileged inmate telephone calls (a) do not violate either the \u201ceavesdropping statutes\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-187 through 53a-189; or the \u201cwiretapping statutes\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a through 54-41t; (b) do not violate the \u201cHIV confidentiality statutes\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-581 through 19a-592; and (c) do not violate article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution; and (2) the department regulations permitting the review of nonprivileged outgoing inmate mail do not violate the first and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution. The defendant cross appeals, claiming that the trial court improperly ordered specific modifications to department practices regarding inmate telephone calls to attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On the appeal, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. On the cross appeal, we agree with the defendant. We therefore reverse the judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The facts are undisputed. In the early 1990s, the defendant found that the \u201ccollect call only\u201d telephones<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in department facilities were periodically being used to further a variety of illegal activity including inmate escapes, drug trafficking, gang activity and assaults. In 1993, in order to detect and deter some of these activities, the defendant adopted the regulations that are now codified at \u00a7\u00a7 18-81-28 through 18-81-51 of the Regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>tions of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regulations pertaining to telephone use provide that nonprivileged inmate telephone calls from collect call only telephones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>may be listened to and recorded with the authorization of the unit administrator<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or higher authority when there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>is reason to believe that the surveillance is \u201creasonably related to the maintenance of the security, good order or discipline of the facility or the prevention of criminal activity either within the facility or without,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and as long as the following methods of providing notice to the inmates, and to those parties whom the inmates call, are employed: (1) signs written in both English and Spanish must be posted at each telephone location notifying the inmates of the monitoring and recording of calls; (2) each inmate must read and sign a form before he or she uses the collect call only telephones that discloses that his or her conversations may be monitored; and (3) an automatic tone that can be heard at fifteen second intervals shall be used when an inmate\u2019s call is being recorded. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 18-81-44. The regulation pertaining to outgoing mail provides that all outgoing \u201cgeneral correspondence\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> may be read on a targeted or random basis \u201cif the Commissioner [of Correction] or the Unit Administrator has reason to believe that such reading is generally necessary to further the substantial interests of secuiity, order or rehabilitation.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 18-81-31 (a). These provisions are modeled after similar- regulations in effect in at least thirty-one other states as well as the District of Columbia, and also in federal prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The trial court also found the following facts pertaining to telephone monitoring.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cAs of April 27, 1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the [department] had trained and authorized ninety persons to listen to monitored telephone calls. Eighty-nine of these were correctional personnel and one was a state trooper. In practice, however, monitoring is primarily done by only a few people at each facility. At [the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers (CCIS)], for example, the bulk of the listening is done by William Grady, the CCIS Intelligence Coordinator. Mr. Grady, who testified at some length, impressed me as a decent and honest person who took his job seriously and had no interest in hstening to purely personal [telephone cahs. He estimated that he devotes four or five hours a day to hstening, primarily to target recorded hstening. In addition, however, he does some random live hstening every day. In his experience, the vast majority of cahs that inmates make are normal calls. Depending on the luck of the draw, he can happen on a call that may appropriately be listened to \u2014 i.e., a call that affects prison order or security or involves criminal activity \u2014 on his first attempt or he can go for days without hitting one. He estimates that in the average month he comes across ten to twenty calls that are appropriate to hsten to. Of these latter cahs, the vast majority yield information that may appropriately be turned over to . . . correctional or law enforcement authorities, but a few do not. Target monitoring yields dramatically better results than random monitoring. ... Ah persons authorized to hsten to inmate telephone cahs have been trained in the governing standards as required by \u00a7 18-81-45 [of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies]. They are emphatically instructed that it is inappropriate to hsten to purely personal telephone cahs. Mr. Grady takes this responsibility seriously. The [department] personnel who testified in this case exhibited a great deal of professionalism. In addition, there is no evidence either that any purely personal conversation has been listened to after being identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>as such or that any purely personal information overheard has been inappropriately disclosed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The trial court also found the following facts regarding the effect of the telephone regulations on institutional security. \u201cThe Connecticut correctional officials who testified were unanimously of the opinion that the monitoring done pursuant to the [r]egulation[s] \u2014 and especially the telephone monitoring \u2014 had made a unique contribution to institutional security. In their opinion, institutional disruptions had been deterred, law enforcement had been assisted, and contraband had been intercepted because of the monitoring. Copious reports have been submitted that leave no doubt that the monitoring has periodically resulted in the apprehension of criminals and of persons planning to violate institutional rules. In addition, although it cannot be proven, there can be little doubt that the highly publicized existence of the monitoring program has deterred other persons from using the collect call only telephones for illegal purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The plaintiffs claim that the department regulations permitting department officials to monitor and record nonprivileged telephone calls between inmates and various members of the public violate both the eavesdropping statutes; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-187 through 53a-189;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the wiretapping statutes. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 54-41a through 54-41t.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs concede, however, that the activities permitted by the regulations are fully consistent with the more recent recording statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-570d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Before addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, it is useful to trace the history of the legislation regarding the moni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>toring of telephone conversations. In 1969, the legislature enacted as part of our Penal Code; Public Acts 1969, No. 828; the eavesdropping statutes, now codified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-187 through 53a-189. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-189 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of eavesdropping when he unlawfully engages in wiretapping or mechanical overhearing of a conversation.\u201d The definitional section, \u00a7 53a-187, provides that listening to or recording a conversation constitutes \u201cwiretapping\u201d or \u201cmechanical overhearing\u201d only when it is done without the consent of one of the parties to the conversation. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-187 (a) (1) and (2). Section 53a-187 (a) (3) provides that such conduct is \u201cunlawful\u201d only when it is not specifically authorized by law. Section 53a-187 (b) contains an exemption for criminal law enforcement officials acting in the lawful performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In 1971, the legislature, in seeking to regulate the conduct of the law enforcement officials whom it specifically had exempted from the eavesdropping statutes two years earlier, enacted the wiretapping statutes. Public Acts 1971, No. 68. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41b provides that \u201c[t]he chief state\u2019s attorney or the state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district in which the interception is to be conducted may make application to a panel of judges for an order authorizing the interception of any wire communication by investigative officers having responsibility for the investigation of offenses as to which the application is made when such interception may provide evidence of the commission of offenses involving gambling, bribery, violations of section 53-395, violations of section 2 la-277 or felonious crimes of violence. \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The balance of the wiretapping statutes is dedicated primarily to describing, in explicit detail, the procedural requirements accompanying a request for permission to intercept a communication in this state. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41c through 54-41o.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In addition to the procedural requirements, the wiretapping statutes also provide for certain criminal sanctions against the unauthorized disclosure or receipt of information derived from intercepted communications by investigative officers. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41p (d) criminalizes the unauthorized disclosure of any information received via an intercepted wire communication, by providing that \u201c[a]ny investigative officer who discloses the contents of any intercepted wire communication or evidence derived therefrom (1) to any person not authorized to receive such information or (2) in a manner otherwise than authorized by this chapter shall be guilty of a class D felony.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41t makes it a class C felony for \u201c[a]ny investigative officer [to intercept] the wire communications of any person in violation of the provisions of this chapter . . . .\u201d For purposes of the wiretapping statutes, the term \u201cinvestigative officer\u201d includes only Connecticut state police officers, certain inspectors of the division of criminal justice, municipal police officers who are assigned to the statewide narcotics task force or the statewide organized crime investigative task force, and certain state\u2019s attorneys. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">In 1990, the legislature adopted the recording statute, \u00a7 52-570d, in an effort to strengthen the privacy protections afforded to Connecticut\u2019s citizens. It required that recording by officials not involved in law enforcement be done with the knowledge of both parties. Public Acts 1990, No. 90-305. Then Senator Richard Blumenthal described the purpose of the bill that would become the recording statute. He stated: \u201cThe effect of this bill . . . would be to prohibit tape-recorded conversations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>unless done by the knowledge of <em>all </em>parties to those telephonic conversations. Currently, under law, the telephone conversation can be taped with the knowledge of one party [to] the conversation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1990 Sess., p. 1415. The bill exempted 911 emergency calls, emergency situations and certain situations involving law enforcement. In order to ensure that all parties to a monitored conversation would be aware that it was being monitored, the legislature provided that no call could be recorded unless the recording: \u201c(1) is preceded by consent of all parties to the communication and such prior consent either is obtained in writing or is part of, and obtained at the start of, the recording, or (2) is preceded by verbal notification which is recorded at the beginning and is part of the communication by the recording party, or (3) is accompanied by an automatic tone warning device which automatically produces a distinct signal that is repeated at intervals of approximately fifteen seconds during the communication while such instrument, device or equipment is in use.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-570d (a). The plaintiffs concede that the department regulations at issue comply with the recording statute in that each party to a telephone call made from the collect call only telephones in state correctional institutions is provided by the department with notice of the potential monitoring and recording of their conversations. The plaintiffs argue, however, that despite this compliance with the recording statute, the department\u2019s practices violate the eavesdropping and wiretapping statutes. We disagree with the plaintiffs and conclude that neither the eavesdropping statutes nor the wiretapping statutes are applicable to situations in which both parties to the call being overheard have notice that the call may be monitored and recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the department regulations violate the eavesdropping statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 53a-187 through 53a-189. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>As noted previously, the eavesdropping statutes proscribe monitoring and recording of telephonic communications only if the monitoring and recording is done without the consent of at least one party to the call. The plaintiffs argue that the type of \u201cconsent\u201d required by the eavesdropping statutes is akin to the constitutional type of consent that we require in areas such as search and seizure. Such a standard embodies more than mere knowledge and implicates notions of free will and meaningful choice. In arguing against the notion that the term \u201cconsent\u201d as used in the eavesdropping statutes requires only that one of the parties to the conversation have knowledge of the recording, the plaintiffs assert that \u201c[t]here is no indication in the legislative history of the eavesdropping statute [s] that the drafters of the statute [s] anticipated a situation . . . in which the participants in a telephone conversation know that the conversation is being recorded or listened to but do not consent to the recording or listening.\u201d That assertion is particularly interesting in light of the official commentary to the Penal Code, which states that the eavesdropping statutes are intended to address <em>\u201csurreptitious </em>overhearing or recording of a telephonic or telegraphic communication\u201d and that their reach was intended to be \u201climit[ed] ... to situations in which the speakers had no reason to know that they could or might be overheard.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes, pp. 73-74 (1971). We conclude that the eavesdropping statutes are violated only when neither party to the call knows that the call is being monitored. Because, under the department regulations and in compliance with the recording statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>both parties to conversations on the collect call only telephones in the state\u2019s correctional institutions must be provided with notice before the call commences, we conclude that the eavesdropping statutes have not been violated by the department regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The plaintiffs also claim that the department regulations pertaining to the monitoring and recording of telephone calls violate the wiretapping statutes. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a through 54-41t. We conclude, however, that the wiretapping statutes, like the eavesdropping statutes, were intended to apply only to <em>surreptitious </em>monitoring by \u201cinvestigative officers\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and were not intended to apply to those situations covered by the recording statute where both parties are provided with notice that the call may be monitored. Because our goal in construing statutes is to \u201cascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>In re Sheldon G., </em>216 Conn. 563, 568, 583 A.2d 112 (1990); we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">We previously have held that a recording of a telephone call where one party to that conversation is a police officer or informant is not a violation of the wiretapping statutes because those statutes were intended to cover only surreptitious recording. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 209, 562 A.2d 481 (1989). This conclusion is supported by two provisions of the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tory scheme. General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c (10) provides that, if \u201cit is reasonably necessary to make a secret entry upon a private place or premises in order to install an intercepting device to effectuate the interception, a statement to that effect and to the effect that no practicable alternative method of executing the order which will preserve the secrecy of its execution exists\u201d shall be included in an application for an order authorizing a wiretap. Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41k authorizes the three judge panel that issued the interception order to provide notice of the interception to all persons named in the order whose conversations have been overheard, and requires that panel to disclose the fact of the interception to all persons not named in the order whose conversations have been overheard. Such notice would be wholly unnecessary if the parties had been aware of the monitoring at the time of the conversation. Both of these provisions evince the obvious fact that the wiretapping statutes were not intended to apply in those circumstances where, as here, all parties to the conversation are made aware that their conversation is being monitored.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The legislative history further supports our conclusion. Senator Joseph Fauliso, one of the most vocal opponents of the wiretapping statutes, stated that if the wiretapping statutes were to be passed by the legislature, \u201cevery telephone user would have to conjure the possibility that the phantom hands of the electronic eavesdropper could be clutching the very instrument into which he speaks. ... In my judgment, it is enough that the law permits the interception of telephone conversations with the permission of the caller or the receiver. And it is at this point that we should draw the line.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 876-77. Senator Lawrence J. DeNardis, another opponent of the 1971 wiretapping legislation, also spoke of fears inherent in a society where people are afraid to speak on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>telephone for fear that a wiretap may be in use: \u201cA friend of mine, visiting Moscow a few years ago, by a series of accidents became very friendly with a group of young people there, young radicals who were disenchanted with the regime. Serious conversations were always held in the park and communications in his hotel room once, w[ere] by passing notes back and forth. The paranoia that infected these people was at least as distressing as the reality.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 891. These and other similar comments in the legislative history confirm our conclusion that the wiretapping statutes were intended to apply only to monitoring and recording done without the knowledge of either party to the conversation. The wiretapping statutes are not violated when both parties to a conversation are provided extensive notice of the monitoring and recording, as is the case under department regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final statutory claim is that the department regulations pertaining to the monitoring and recording of nonprivileged telephone calls violate General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583, which provides in relevant part that, except in specified circumstances, \u201c[n]o person who obtains confidential HIV-related information may disclose, or be compelled to disclose, such information.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that those inmates who are HIV positive are compelled by department regulations to disclose confidential HIV information. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Those inmates who are HIV positive are not \u201ccompelled\u201d to disclose any information pertaining to their condition to any party. The dictionary defines \u201ccompel\u201d as \u201cto drive or urge forcefully or irresistibly\u201d and \u201cto cause to do or occur by overwhelming pressure.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Web<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ster, Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.). Moreover, in interpreting a rental agreement, we have previously concluded that \u201c[t]he word \u2018compelled,\u2019 in its ordinary sense, means: to drive or urge with force; to constrain; oblige; necessitate, whether by physical or moral force.\u201d <em>Ains </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>92 Conn. 130, 133, 101 A.2d 579 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">As the trial court concluded, \u201c[tjhese authorities confirm what common sense dictates in any event. [General Statutes] \u00a7 19a-583 (a) is violated only where real physical or moral compulsion from an external source is placed on a person who has obtained confidential HIV-related information to disclose that information. The evidence here fails to establish that the [department] has created any sort of coercion, legal or factual. The only \u2018compulsion\u2019 to disclose [HIV-related information] that the plaintiffs can identify is an internal compulsion that compels them to disclose their erstwhile confidential information to others over the telephone. The protected individual himself is specifically entitled to disclose such information by General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 (b).\u201d We cannot conclude that any inmate has in any sense been compelled by department regulations either to use a monitored telephone or to disclose any HIV-related information over such a telephone line.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that \u00a7 19a-583 is not violated by department regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">We next address the constitutionality of certain provisions contained in the regulations. The plaintiffs contend that under article first, \u00a7 7, of our state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>constitution, inmates have a privacy right to unmonitored nonprivileged telephone calls from the correctional facility. No such right has previously been found to exist in any jurisdiction in the country under either the federal constitution or any state constitution, and we find no support for the proposition that the Connecticut constitution confers such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">When determining whether our state constitution affords Connecticut citizens greater individual liberties than its federal counterpart, we consider, to the extent applicable, six factors: \u201c(1) the text of the [relevant] constitutional provisions; (2) related Connecticut precedents; (3) persuasive federal precedents; (4) persuasive precedents of other state courts; (5) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 249, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Under the federal constitution, it is well settled that inmates completely forgo certain of their constitutional rights and may be restricted in their exercise of certain other rights. See <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 524, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984) (\u201cimprisonment carries with it the circumscription or loss of many significant rights\u201d); <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 545-46, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979) (\u201c[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cThe curtailment of certain rights is necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad of institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities, <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>[418 U.S. 539, 555, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974)], chief among which is internal security, see <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>[417 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>U.S. 817, 823, 94 S. Ct. 2800, 41 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1974)]. Of course, these restrictions or retractions also serve, incidentally, as reminders that, under our system of justice, deterrence and retribution are factors in addition to correction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 524. Of those rights that have been curtailed in the prison setting, the fourth amendment right to privacy is one of the most commonly and severely curtailed. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>734 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1110, 106 S. Ct. 1520, 89 L.

See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>168 Ariz. 275, 276, 812 P.2d 1093 (Ariz. App. 1991) (\u201ca prisoner does not have constitutional rights to privacy in his prison cell\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Guirlando, </em>509 So. 2d 172, 174 (La.

In cases in which other state courts have applied the independent provisions of their state constitutions to privacy claims pertaining specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>to prison telephone conversations, those courts unanimously have found that the monitoring or taping of such conversations does not violate the implicit or explicit privacy protections of their respective state constitutions. <em>People </em>v. <em>Myles, </em>62 Ill. App. 3d 931, 936, 379 N.E.2d 897 (1978) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in jailhouse conversations, despite explicit privacy provision in state constitution, because \u201c[a] phone maintained in a jail for prisoner use shares none of the attributes of privacy of a home or automobile or even a public phone booth\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>270 N.W.2d 345, 354 (N. Dak. 1978) (\u201cparties to ajailhouse conversation usually have no reasonable expectation of privacy due to the security needs of maintaining order and of limiting the introduction of contraband, such as drugs, into the jail\u201d unless deceptive actions of law enforcement officials provide such reasonable expectation). Despite the majority of courts that have considered the same or similar claims under both the federal constitution and other state constitutions and have rejected such claims, the plaintiffs maintain that they nonetheless should prevail under the independent provisions of article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution based on the four remaining <em>Geisler </em>factors. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The text of article first, \u00a7 7, contains no indication that the framers of our constitution intended it to provide greater protection of inmate privacy rights than the fourth amendment to the federal constitution. The texts of the two provisions are virtually identical.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 381, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993). There is nothing in the text of article first, \u00a7 7, that warrants an expansive view of its protection when applied to prison inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Moreover, the history of our penal institutions not only fails to support the claim that the state constitution was intended by its creators to vest Connecticut inmates with enhanced privacy rights, it squarely contradicts it. The trial court aptly summarized the nature of Connecticut correctional institutions in 1818, when article first, \u00a7 7, was adopted, as follows: \u201cWhen the constitution of 1818 was adopted, the state prison was Newgate. (Wethersfield prison did not open until 1827.) Newgate, as is well known, was a hellhole. Its prisoners were housed in a copper mine in what would today be considered truly barbaric conditions. A vivid description of this dungeon is set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 452-53 n.15, 497 A.2d 974 (1985) [on appeal after remand sub nom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990)].<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The prisoners living in it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>were \u2018heavily ironed, and secured by both hand-cuffs and fetters.\u2019 1 Edward Augustus Kendall, Travels Through the Northern Parts of the United States (1809) p. 210. As Kendall put it, \u2018[prisoners in this gaol are treated precisely as tigers in a menagerie.\u2019 Id., p. 215.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Despite this grim picture of the sole operating Connecticut prison in 1818, the plaintiffs claim that such a picture \u201cdo[es] not establish a complete lack of privacy for inmates. Indeed our founding fathers might well have been shocked by the types of searches described 160 years later in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>[supra, 441 U.S. 520 (strip and body cavity searches)].\u201d To provide support for their conjecture about the intent of our forebears, the plaintiffs rely on <em>Grumon </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>1 Conn. 39 (1814). In that case, we declared it improper for the defendant, a justice of the peace acting in response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>a complaint regarding the theft of two bags valued at one dollar, to have issued a general warrant that commanded certain officials \u201c \u2018forthwith diligently to search the premises of Aaron Hyatt in said Wilton, and other suspected places, houses, stores or bams in said Wilton, for said bags, and also to search such persons as are suspected; and if you shall find said bags and the person suspected, you are to take said bags, and arrest the person suspected ....\u201d\u2019 Id., 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We fail to see how <em>Grumon, </em>the first of many published opinions by this court disapproving of the issuance of general warrants affecting the privacy rights of members of the public, supports the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. <em>Grumon </em>cannot conceivably be read to extend broader privacy rights to <em>inmates </em>under the Connecticut constitution than under the federal constitution. First, <em>Grumon </em>did not involve inmates or their privacy rights. Second, general warrants were expressly forbidden by the fourth amendment to the federal constitution as of December 15, 1791, upon ratification of the bill of rights. See <em>Stanford </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>379 U.S. 476, 481, 85 S. Ct. 506, 13 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1965) (plain language of fourth amendment \u201creflectfs] the determination of those who wrote the Bill of Rights that the people of this new Nation should forever \u2018be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\u2019 from intrusion and seizure by officers acting under the unbridled authority of a general warrant\u201d). It is unclear how <em>Grumon, </em>a Connecticut case that merely adopted a position stated in the federal constitution, can be said to lend any support to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that article first, \u00a7 7, provides greater privacy rights to inmates than the fourth amendment. The conditions at Newgate at the time the constitution of 1818 was ratified, combined with the lack of any evidence suggesting that Connecticut had or has a different view of the privacy protections to be afforded to incarcerated persons, lead us to reject the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>claim that Connecticut\u2019s history supports their proposed reading of the state constitution to prohibit monitoring and recording of inmates\u2019 nonprivileged telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We next turn to our own precedents. In previous privacy cases, we have interpreted article first, \u00a7 7, to require a determination of whether the party claiming an infringement of his or her privacy right has manifested a subjective expectation of privacy and, if so, whether that expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>229 Conn. 10, 20, 639 A.2d 1007 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 633, 620 A.2d 746 (1993). Whether the particular expectation of privacy at issue here, namely, an inmate\u2019s expectation that his or her nonprivileged telephone calls will be unmonitored and unrecorded, is an expectation that we, as a society, are prepared to recognize as reasonable, is an issue of first impression under our state constitution. All of the previous claims that have come before this court involving the constitutional rights of those in the custody of the commissioner of correction have been decided solely under the federal constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 165-66, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) (probationer has diminished expectation of privacy); <em>Roque </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>181 Conn. 85, 434 A.2d 348 (1980) (rejecting inmate\u2019s claim that disciplinary measures taken against him violated his first amendment rights even though similar discipline of unincarcerated individual would have been unconstitutional); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 619, 626 A.2d 373 (1993) (recognizing that in certain situations privacy concerns \u201c \u2018must yield to paramount concerns for human life and the legitimate need of society to protect and preserve life\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is, therefore, no Connecticut precedent supporting the plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Moreover, assuming that the plaintiffs\u2019 have a subjective expectation of privacy in their non-privileged telephone calls, we conclude that such an. expectation is not one that the citizens of our state would recognize as reasonable. The general law of privacy attendant upon incarceration, and the recognized need for institutional security, clearly do not legitimize such an expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We turn last to contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms. <em>As in. State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 251, we look to the legislative determinations of other states for guidance pertaining to the current social mores nationwide. Thirty-three jurisdictions, including thirty-one states, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the District of Columbia, all have in place some system of monitoring of inmates\u2019 telephone calls. These legislative determinations nationwide are supported by the overwhelming weight of judicial authority across the country that concludes that the monitoring of inmates\u2019 communications is a necessary and constitutional method of ensuring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>institutional security of our prisons, and deterring inmates from continuing on a course of criminal conduct once they are incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In sum, consideration of the six factors that we traditionally have considered when determining whether the protections afforded by the Connecticut constitution are greater than those afforded by the federal constitution persuades us that article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution does not provide inmates with a greater degree of privacy than does the federal constitution. The inmates of Connecticut\u2019s correctional institutions, therefore, have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their nonprivileged telephone calls and those calls may be monitored and recorded. The department regulations pertaining to nonprivileged inmate telephone calls are therefore consistent with article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The plaintiffs also claim that the department regulation permitting the reading of inmates\u2019 nonprivileged outgoing mail violates the first and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The department regulations provide that all outgoing \u201cgeneral correspondence\u201d; Regs., Conn.

Ct. 1800, 40 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1974), the United States Supreme Court recognized the expertise of prison officials and that the judiciary is \u201cill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration,\u201d and emphasized that courts should afford \u201cdeference to the appropriate prison authorities.\u201d The court held that \u201cany regulation or practice that restricts [outgoing] inmate correspondence must be generally necessary to protect one or more of the legitimate governmental interests identified above.\u201d Id., 414. The interests to which the court referred were \u201csecurity, order, and rehabilitation.\u201d Id., 413. Although the United States Supreme Court has recognized since <em>Martinez </em>that, when prison regulations affect outgoing mail, as opposed to incoming mail, there must be a \u201ccloser fit between the regulation and the purpose it serves,\u201d it has also reiterated that in neither case must the regulation satisfy a \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d test. <em>Thornburgh </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 411-12, 109 S.

In <em>Martinez, </em>the court itself recognized that \u201cthe most obvious example of justifiable censorship of prisoner mail would be refusal to send . . . letters concerning escape plans or containing other information concerning proposed criminal activity.\u201d <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>supra, 416 U.S. 413. We agree with the reasoning of the First and Tenth Circuits that \u201cthere is no other way to determine whether escape plans or other proscribable matter is being sent except by looking at the correspondence.\u201d <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Grimaldi, </em>supra, 993 F.2d 1004; see <em>Beville </em>v. <em>Ednie, </em>supra, 74 F.3d 214 (\u201c[i]n order to enforce permissible restrictions which are reasonably related to substantial governmental interests, corrections officers must be able to inspect all outgoing mail\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 18-81-31 is consistent with the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Martinez </em>because it is generally necessary to further the substantial governmental interests in security, order and rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The Defendant\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">We turn finally to the defendant\u2019s cross appeal. The trial court concluded that the department\u2019s conduct relating to attorney-inmate telephone calls was constitutionally deficient in three ways: (1) although \u00a7 18-81-46 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that, after placing a privileged call to an attorney and verifying the identity of its recipient, the staff member placing the call \u201cshall then move out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>listening range of the inmate\u2019s conversation,\u201d those staff members regularly stay within listening range; (2) although \u00a7 18-81-46 provides that \u201c[a]n inmate shall be provided a reasonable accommodation to make prearranged\u201d attorney calls, the department\u2019s implementation of this regulation has been \u201chaphazard,\u201d and some inmate requests for attorney calls have been denied altogether; and (3) the time allowed for attorney calls is generally limited to ten to twenty minutes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs claimed that the \u201c[defendant's arbitrary limitations on the availability and length of confidential, unmonitored telephone calls between inmates and their attorneys, and monitoring of attorney calls violate [the] plaintiffs\u2019 right to counsel and right of access to courts, in violation of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10 of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d The trial court found as a factual matter that, on several occasions, staff members of the department had remained within earshot of inmate conversations with their attorneys. The trial court concluded that this practice was not only a violation of the department\u2019s regulations but also a violation of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Accordingly, the trial court issued a declaratory judgment that the department must comply with the requirement of \u00a7 18-81-46 that staff members must not remain within listening range of attorney-inmate telephone calls. The defendant does not challenge this ruling.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The defendant, however, does challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the right to counsel and access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>to courts provisions of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> of our state constitution embody a right to telephonic access to counsel that requires, at a constitutional minimum, that attorneys be allowed telephonic access to their inmate clients whenever the attorneys request it, and that inmates be allowed to initiate two thirty minute<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> telephone calls to attorneys per month, in addition to those calls requested by an attorney.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the limitations on attorney-inmate telephone calls in the regulations do not violate the right to counsel or access to court provisions of either the state or the federal constitution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">An inmate\u2019s access to counsel implicates two distinct constitutional protections. First, it implicates the right to counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution. Second, and less directly, it implicates the inmate\u2019s right of access to courts guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 10, of the state constitution. See <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>supra, 416 U.S. 419 (striking down rule restricting attorney-client interviews to members of bar and licensed private investigators as violative of inmates\u2019 right of access to courts). We address these claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>It is axiomatic that all criminal defendants, including inmates, have a right to counsel throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings against them in the trial court; <em>Gideon </em>v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1972); and during the pendency of appeals as of right. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 83 S. Ct. 814, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1963). It is also settled beyond question that, under both the federal and the state constitutions, this right to the assistance of counsel includes the right to communicate effectively with counsel in the preparation of one\u2019s defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mebane, </em>204 Conn. 585, 603, 529 A.2d 680 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1046, 108 S.

Ed. 2d 419 [1970].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>161 Conn. 291, 287 A.2d 386 (1971). The trial court concluded that, in the prison setting, this constitutional right to confer with counsel includes the right to confer telephonically as frequently as counsel desires and includes, in addition, two thirty minute telephone calls per month at the request of the inmate. We conclude that neither the federal nor the state constitution contains any such particularized right to confer with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The right to the effective assistance of counsel is grounded in the mandates of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. Under both the federal constitution and the state constitution, however, the right to counsel is the right to counsel\u2019s effective assistance, and not the right to perfect representation or unlimited access to counsel. See <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>222 Conn. 469, 478, 610 A.2d 631 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 159-60, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977). Department regulations require that inmates \u201cshall be provided a reasonable accommodation to make prearranged non-recorded telephone calls to [attorneys] on non-collect call only telephones\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch calls shall normally be limited to ten minutes duration.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 18-81-46. The trial court found that, in reality, the typical length of attorney calls was between ten and twenty minutes, and that there had been some instances in which requests for attorney calls had been denied. The trial court also found, however, that there was no evidence in the record that any inmate had been denied the effective assistance of counsel as a result of the limitations on the inmates\u2019 ability to confer with counsel over the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The fact that the record contains no evidence that any of the plaintiffs has been denied the effective assistance of counsel as a result of the telephone regulations is not surprising, given the variety of opportunities that inmates in our state have to communicate with counsel. They are allowed unlimited communication through the mails. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 18-81-35. They are allowed an unlimited number of personal visits by attorneys, investigators, paralegals and law students. An attorney and his or her incarcerated client can confer in the lockup at the courthouse each time the inmate has a scheduled court date. Furthermore, the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and client can generally communicate over the telephone, subject to the limitations set forth in the regulations. These numerous and varied means of communication provide adequate opportunity for inmate and attorney to confer meaningfully, as required by both the federal and the state constitutions. See <em>State </em>v. Ferrell, supra, 191 Conn. 42 n.5; <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 155 Conn. 39. If, for any reason and at any stage of the proceedings, attorney and client have not had the ability to communicate sufficiently, the defendant can bring that fact to the court\u2019s attention and we would expect the court to ensure that the defendant and counsel are afforded a reasonable opportunity to confer as required by both the state and the federal constitutions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Deleon, </em>230 Conn. 351, 645 A.2d 518 (1994) (defendant moved in trial court for continuance based on insufficient communication with counsel based in part on allegedly restrictive visitation policy at Hartford correctional facility); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>State, </em>521 A.2d 1069, 1084-85 (Del. 1987) (approving trial court\u2019s issuance of detailed order in response to inmate\u2019s claim that prison officials had interfered with right to confer with counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In the absence of evidence that any inmate has been denied a reasonable opportunity to confer with counsel or has been denied the effective assistance of counsel, we cannot conclude that the department\u2019s practices violate the right to counsel to which inmates are entitled, in certain legal proceedings, under both the state and the federal constitutions. We are, therefore, unwilling to invade the province of the department and order specific modifications of department regulations or otherwise micromanage attorney-client contact in a prison setting. \u201cPrison administrators are responsible for maintaining internal order and discipline, for securing their institutions against unauthorized access or escape, and for rehabilitating, to the extent that human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>nature and inadequate resources allow, the inmates placed in their custody. The Herculean obstacles to effective discharge of these duties are too apparent to warrant explication. Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government. For all of those reasons, courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform. Judicial recognition of that fact reflects no more than a healthy sense of realism.\u201d <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>supra, 416 U.S. 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We next consider the plaintiffs\u2019 access to courts claim under the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 10, of the state constitution. The trial court concluded that, although the department\u2019s practices pertaining to attorney telephone calls do not violate the federal access to courts guarantee, those practices do violate the independent guarantee of that right under our state constitution. The plaintiffs urge that we conclude that department practices violate the access to courts protections of both the federal and the state constitutions. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the limitations imposed on attorney-inmate telephone conversations do not violate the access to courts provision of either constitution. We agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\u201cIt is now established beyond doubt that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts . . . [and that such access must be] adequate, effective and meaningful.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821-22, 97 S. Ct. 1491, 52 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1977). Decisions of the United States Supreme Court \u201chave consistently required [sjtates to shoulder affirmative obligations to assure all prisoners meaningful access to the courts. It is indisputable that indigent inmates must be provided at state expense with paper and pen to draft legal documents, with notarial services to authenticate them, and with stamps to mail them. States must forgo collection of docket fees otherwise payable to the treasury and expend funds for transcripts. State expenditures are necessary to pay lawyers for indigent [criminal] defendants at trial, <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>[supra, 372 U.S. 335]; <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>[supra, 407 U.S. 25], and in appeals as of right, <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>[supra, 372 U.S. 353].\u201d <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 824-25. <em>\u201cBounds </em>does not [however] guarantee inmates the wherewithal to transform themselves into litigating engines capable of filing everything from shareholder derivative actions to slip-and-fall claims. The tools it requires to be provided are those that the inmates need in order to attack their sentences, directly or collater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ally, and in order to challenge the conditions of- their confinement. Impairment of any other litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>U.S. , 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2182, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\u201c[T]he fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers . . . .\u201d <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 430 U.S. 828. Such assistance, however, may take many forms. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 116 S. Ct. 2182 <em>(\"Bounds . . </em>. guarantees no particular methodology but rather the conferral of a capability \u2014 the capability of bringing contemplated challenges to sentences or conditions of confinement before the courts\u201d); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Giarratano, </em>492 U.S. 1, 14, 109 S. Ct. 2765, 106 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (right of meaningful access to courts \u201ccan be satisfied in various ways\u201d); <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 831 (\u201c[ajmong the alternatives are the training of inmates as paralegal assistants to work under lawyers\u2019 supervision, the use of paraprofessionals and law students, either as volunteers or in formal clinical programs, the organization of volunteer attorneys through bar associations or other groups, the hiring of lawyers on a part-time consultant basis, and the use of full-time staff attorneys, working either in new prison legal assistance organizations or as part of public defender or legal services offices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">We conclude that reasonable restrictions on inmate telephone calls to attorneys are constitutional, so long as other viable means are available to the inmates to pursue their legal claims. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>South, </em>595 F. Sup. 785, 789-90 (D. Mont. 1984) (policy requiring inmates to obtain prior written authorization to telephone their attorney and limiting those calls to one per week found reasonable in light of inmates\u2019 ability to correspond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>with attorneys through mail and during prison visits); <em>Pino </em>v. <em>Dalsheim, </em>558 F. Sup. 673, 675 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (unlimited personal and mail communication with attorney constitutionally sufficient because state is not required to provide best manner of access); see also <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>615 F. Sup. 330, 340 (N.D. Ill. 1985) (lack of telephonic access to counsel may not deprive inmates of access to courts if inmates have access to law library).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Providing telephonic access to counsel is clearly one appropriate way to guarantee an inmate an opportunity to have his or her legal claims, both civil and criminal, properly framed and brought before a court of competent jurisdiction. As stated in <em>Bounds, </em>however, this is only one of several ways of assuring inmates the opportunity to present their legal claims to our courts. <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 430 U.S. 831. Reasonable access to a law library within the correctional facilities; <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 615 F. Sup. 340; consultation with attorneys or their representatives through the mails and personal visits; <em>Pino </em>v. <em>Dalsheim, </em>supra, 558 F. Sup. 675; and consultation with attorneys over the telephone within department guidelines; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>South, </em>supra, 595 F. Sup. 789-90; are all valid methods of ensuring that inmates are not denied the access to the courts to which they are entitled by the fourteenth amendment and article first, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The plaintiffs argue that, even if their federal constitutional right of access to courts does not require that inmates be given a specific right to telephone attorneys with a specified level of frequency, article first, \u00a7 10, does encompass such a right. In making this argument, the plaintiffs rely primarily on the sixth <em>Geisler</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>lac-tor \u2014 \u201ccontemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>230 Conn. 249. The plaintiffs argue that the practical difficulty of arranging personal interviews in the prison setting and the inability of illiterate inmates to communicate through the mails require, under the state constitution, that inmates be allowed to confer with counsel over the telephone. As we noted with respect to the right to counsel, however, there is adequate opportunity for Connecticut inmates to obtain legal assistance under the existing department regulations. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, article first, \u00a7 10, requires, as does the federal constitution, only that inmates be afforded meaningful access to the courts and that the means of providing such access can take many forms. See <em>Bounds </em>v. Smith, supra, 430 U.S. 831. Merely because inmates are not entitled to telephone an attorney whenever the urge strikes them does not mean that they have been denied meaningful access to courts under the state constitution. If, for any reason, aparticular inmate is deprived of the right of meaningful access to the courts, we will address those claims on a case-by-case basis. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 116 S. Ct. 2180 (successful federal access to court claims require showing of particularized harm); <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 615 F. Sup. 340 (\u201canalysis of a meaningful access-to-court claim must proceed on a case-by-case basis and be rooted in the particular facts of each case\u201d). Today, we hold only that the department regulations and practices pertaining to attorney-inmate telephone calls do not, on their face and as a matter of law, deprive inmates of meaningful access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The judgment of the trial court with regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 personal telephone calls from collect call only telephones and with regard to the review of the plaintiffs\u2019 outgoing mail is affirmed, the judgment of the trial court with respect to attorney-client telephone calls is reversed except for that portion of the judgment declaring that inmates are entitled to privacy when mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ing such calls, and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\"> The plaintiffs are Kenneth Washington, David Copas, Paul Graziani and Lee MacClaine, Sr., on behalf of themselves and other sentenced prisoners and pretrial detainees housed in the state correctional institutions in Connecticut.

On the sides and niches of the cavern, cabins were built of heavy planks, within which straw was placed for their beds. . . .

Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996). \u201c[Tjhe inmate . . . must . . . demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim. He might show, for example, that a complaint he prepared was dismissed for failure to satisfy some technical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>prison\u2019s legal assistance facilities, he could not have known. Or that he had suffered arguably actionable harm that he wished to bring before the courts, but was so stymied by inadequacies of the law library that he was unable even to file a complaint.\u201d Id., 2180. Although we could dispose of at least the <em>plaintiffs1'federal </em>access to courts claim under <em>Lewis </em>based on the failure of the plaintiffs to establish that any inmate had been injured in fact, we need not do so and we decline to do so in the interest of avoiding unfair surprise to the plaintiffs because the case was neither litigated in the trial court nor briefed and argued in this court with the <em>Lewis </em>decision in mind. We also do not decide if the <em>Lewis </em>\u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d requirement applies to state constitutional claims as well. Rather, we will decide the issue presented to us by the plaintiffs, namely, whether the department regulations, on their face, violate the plaintiffs\u2019 right of access to the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 685.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b755-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amq\">dissenting. The court today unreasonably burdens the plaintiff inmates\u2019 (both preconviction and postconviction) right of access to their attorneys. In doing so, this court not only deprives the plaintiffs of their state constitutional rights, but also makes it more difficult for public defenders and legal assistance attorneys to effectively serve their clients. Presently, legal assistance for the poor is scarce. Resources are being stretched to their limits, as those who serve the poor are increasingly burdened with heavy caseloads. The court\u2019s insensitivity to the plight of the poor is disturbing, as its decision today places yet another obstacle in the path of providing justice to the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Although I disagree with much of what the majority holds today, I will address only the issue of the state constitutional right of access between an inmate and his or her lawyer raised in the defendant\u2019s cross appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority concedes, as it must, that the plaintiffs have not only a state constitutional right of access to the courts; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; but also a right of access to counsel. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. The majority, however, examines the constitutionality of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>tiffs\u2019 claims in terms of whether they have been deprived of their right to \u201ceffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Although these rights are related, interference with the constitutional right of access to counsel is not measured in terms of whether an individual has been denied effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">This court has held that interference with an attorney\u2019s reasonable access to his or her client, who is in the custody of the state, violates the state constitutional right of access to counsel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 167, 537 A.2d 446 (1988) (When counsel seeks to contact his or her client who is in custody, the client must be notified. \u201cThe police, because they are responsible for the suspect\u2019s isolation, have a duty to act reasonably, diligently and promptly to provide counsel with accurate information and to apprise the suspect of the efforts by counsel.\u201d). The provision of mere access between a client and his or her lawyer does not satisfy the state constitution; rather, the access provided must be <em>reasonable. State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 43-45, 463 A.2d 573 (1983) (admissions made by defendant while conversing with counsel on telephone and overheard by police were not admissible). Read together, <em>Stoddard </em>and <em>Ferrell </em>stand for the proposition that the state constitutional right of access to counsel, as informed by the due process clause, requires that inmates must have reasonable access to counsel at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In this age, access to counsel, which is meaningful in its time and manner, includes telephonic communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tion. The realization of the right of access to counsel cannot depend upon postal correspondence, for contemporaneous dialogue is often vital to the attorney-client relationship. Development of a proper defense requires open and uninhibited communication between the client and the attorney. Matters that may seem unimportant to the client, could ultimately prove to be crucial to his or her defense. The majority\u2019s focus on postal correspondence as a means of communication between an attorney and his or her client also ignores the situation of those inmates who are illiterate and poorly educated. Furthermore, the physical location of counsel often renders the telephone the most effective means of communicating. As the trial court noted, the state\u2019s prisons are often a significant distance from the attorney\u2019s office or the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Restricting telephonic communication will discourage attorneys from representing inmates, further drain the resources of the public defender\u2019s office, and hinder the establishment of an appropriate relationship between an incarcerated client and his or her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In sum, the state constitutional right of access to counsel, in my view, is violated when the state refuses to allow reasonable telephonic communication between an attorney and his or her incarcerated client. That access, to meet constitutional standards, must be provided at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Section 18-81-46 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, concerning telephonic access between inmates and their attorneys, provides in relevant part: \u201cAn inmate shall be provided a reasonable accommodation to make prearranged non-recorded telephone calls to [his or her attorney] on non-collect call only telephones without the recording and/or listening provided for in Section 18-81-44 above, and provided the [attorney] called agrees to accept the charges. Such calls shall be placed by staff who shall verify the party\u2019s identity prior to placing the inmate on the line. The staff member shall then move out of listening range of the inmate\u2019s conversation. The employee placing the call may maintain visual observation of the inmate. Such calls shall normally be limited to ten minutes duration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I agree with the trial court that \u00a7 18-81-46, by its terms and application, violates the state constitutional guarantee of access to counsel in three respects.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, the specific time limitation of ten minutes for telephonic contact with an attorney places an unreasonable limitation upon the inmates\u2019 access to counsel. The trial court found that \u201cthis requirement is interpreted and enforced virtually at the whim of the staff member in charge of the telephone. The actual time limit enforced seems to be between ten and twenty minutes, but that limit cannot be predicted with respect to any particular call. The substance of the call or the inmate\u2019s or the attorney\u2019s need for a longer conversation does not seem to be a factor. (Of course, at least in theory, the staff member is not supposed to be listening to the conversation in the first place.) Rather, the decisive factor in determining whether a privileged conversation is to be stopped\u2014 assuming that the decision is not wholly capricious \u2014 is the need of the staff member or another inmate to use the telephone. In any event, it is clear that many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>privileged conversations are simply stopped without consulting either [the] inmate or [the] attorney as to the need for a longer conversation.\u201d The trial court concluded, and I agree, that although, as a practical matter, certain limitations must be established, each inmate should be allowed to make two privileged telephone calls a month to his attorney.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the absence of exigent circumstances, such calls may be limited to a thirty minute duration, subject to an extension at the specific oral or written request of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Second, the staff of the various correctional facilities frequently failed to comply with the mandate of \u00a7 18-81-46 that the staff member placing the telephone call \u201cshall then move out of listening range of the inmate\u2019s conversation.\u201d The trial court found that \u201c[t]here is overwhelming evidence that this requirement is often simply ignored.\u201d As noted by the trial court, \u201c[t]his is not only a violation of \u00a7 18-81-46 but is incompatible with the requirements of the state and federal constitutions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Third, despite the directive of \u00a7 18-81-46 that \u201c[a]n inmate shall be provided a reasonable accommodation to make prearranged non-recorded telephone calls,\u201d the trial court found that \u201c[t]here does not appear to be any uniform interpretation of the word \u2018prearranged.\u2019 \u201d More importantly, the trial court found that \u201c[a] number of inmates credibly testified that requests for privileged phone calls duly accompanied by attorney letters had either been ignored altogether or had been granted at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>some time after the time specified in the attorney letter had already passed.\u201d I agree with the trial court\u2019s remedial order set forth in footnote 7 of this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Therefore, with respect to telephone access between an inmate and his or her attorney, I would affirm the order of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\"> Although I focus, as the majority does, on the state constitutional rights of the plaintiffs, they also have a federal constitutional right of access to their attorney: \u201cThe constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to challenge unlawful convictions and to seek redress for violations of 1 heir constitutional rights. This means that inmates must have a reasonable opportunity to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys. Regulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the availability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts are invalid.\u201d <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 421, 94 S.

An attorney in Stamford who represents a client incarcerated in Somers will rarely have the luxury to take a day from his busy schedule and visit his client in person. If he is required to do so, other clients (and the courts) will be deprived of his services for that day. If a trial or other hearing is imminent, the mail may be too slow.
