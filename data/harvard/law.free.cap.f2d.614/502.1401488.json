At the time of purchase the tract was unzoned. The city\u2019s Community Development Plan, drawn up some six months prior to the purchase, recommended that the tract be zoned for commercial use, as it was in an industrial area. Nevertheless, after International Oceanic\u2019s purchase the city council unanimously voted to zone the tract for residential use only.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Appellants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sued for declaratory and injunctive relief against the police chief, the city attorney and the members of the city council, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Appellants alleged that the sole reason for the precipitous residential zoning was IOE\u2019s affiliation with the Unification Church led by Sun Myung Moon. After a hearing the district court granted the requested relief, holding that the zoning ordinance \u201coperates as an unconstitutional abridgment of plaintiffs\u2019 First (and Fourteenth) Amendment rights.\u201d That decision was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Appellants then moved for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The district court found appellants to be \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of the statute but declined to award attorneys\u2019 fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">A prevailing party is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees absent special circumstances rendering such an award unjust. <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>606 F.2d 635 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Iranian Students Association </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Concerned Democrats of Florida </em>v. <em>Reno, </em>601 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284 (5th Cir. 1978). The district court held that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees would be inappropriate in a ease \u201cinvolving basically financial interests.\u201d Appellees suggest two further circumstances which, they argue, would render any award unjust: the Unification Church, as a wealthy corporation, is well able to pay its own attorneys\u2019 fees, and the appellees herein are \u201cmere functionaries\u201d carrying out the will of the city council. We find none of these circumstances compelling and reverse the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The argument that the case involves only financial interests is logically untenable. The district court\u2019s grant of injunctive and declaratory relief affirms appellants\u2019 contention that the city council\u2019s action infringed their constitutional rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. To hold now that the rights protected are merely financial undermines the rationale underlying the court\u2019s order on the merits. <em>See Perez </em>v. <em>University of Puerto Rico, </em>600 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1979). Moreover, the district court\u2019s distinction between personal rights and property rights has been rejected by the Supreme Court in the context of a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., </em>405 U.S. 538, 542, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 1116, 31 L.Ed.2d 424, 429 (1972). Since the scope of \u00a7 1988 is at least as broad as that of \u00a7 1983, <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2575, 57 L.Ed.2d 522, 536 (1978), the distinction is also inappropriate in the context of \u00a7 1988. <em>See also Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, </em>587 F.2d 159 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), <em>prob. jur. noted, </em>442 U.S. 928, 99 S.Ct. 2857, 61 L.Ed.2d 295 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Regardless of the extent of appellants\u2019 affiliation with the Unification Church, the financial status of the Church is irrelevant. The plaintiff\u2019s ability to pay is not a special circumstance sufficient to render an award under \u00a7 1988 unjust. <em>International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Collins, </em>609 F.2d 151 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Bunn v. Central Realty of Louisiana, </em>592 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Gore v. Turner, </em>563 F.2d 159 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The argument that appellees are \u201cmere functionaries\u201d also fails. Since appellees were sued in their official capacities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>any award of attorneys\u2019 fees will be paid by the city. <em>Hutto v. Finney, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 693-94, 98 S.Ct. at 2575, 57 L.Ed.2d at 536; <em>McNamara v. Moody, </em>606 F.2d 621, 626 (5th Cir. 1979). Nor does appellees\u2019 good faith in carrying out their official duties render an award unjust. <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, supra, </em>606 F.2d at 637; <em>Morrow v. Dillard, supra, </em>580 F.2d at 1298; <em>Brown v. Culpepper, </em>559 F.2d 274, 278 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for an award of appropriate attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">. Plaintiffs below, and appellants before this court, are IOE, its general manager, U.S. Marine, Inc. (which contracted to build a shipyard on the tract for IOE), and its president.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
