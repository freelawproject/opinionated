The appellant limited partners contend that the bankruptcy court improperly precluded them from objecting to the sale of the partnership\u2019s assets under the terms of the limited partnership agreement and the applicable provisions of Florida law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">Dutch Inn is a limited partnership whose assets consist primarily of a leasehold interest in real property adjacent to Disney World, upon which it erected a six-hundred room hotel. It initiated this proceeding under Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-926 (repealed 1979), by filing a petition in bankruptcy on July 2,1976. In February, 1978, the bankruptcy court adjudicated Dutch Inn to be a bankrupt but stayed its order pending appeal. Following an attempt by a major creditor of Dutch Inn to force a sale of its assets, the bankruptcy court found on August 10, 1978, that Dutch Inn had substantial equity in the unexpired portion of its leasehold interest. Later in August, Dutch Inn filed a fifth amended plan of arrangement and in September, 1978, it petitioned the court to authorize the sale of its assets to fund the plan. Following a hearing, the bankruptcy judge, on September 28, 1978, approved the sale and on October 5, 1978, confirmed the plan of arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-18\">The appellants, who constituted a minority of the limited partners of Dutch Inn, appeared at the hearing to object to the sale and filed an objection to the plan of arrangement, contending that the limited partnership agreement prohibited the partnership from selling its assets without the written consent of the limited partners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The bankruptcy judge ruled that the limited partners lacked standing to object to the sale of the partnership\u2019s assets because they were not materially and adversely affected by the bankruptcy proceedings since the partnership\u2019s liabilities exceeded its assets, the limitation on the sale of the partnership\u2019s assets was not contained in the Certificate of Limited Partnership issued by the Florida Secretary of State to Dutch Inn, and the appellants held a minority of the limited partnership interests in Dutch Inn. On appeal the District Court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy judge, concluding that the limitation contained in the limited partnership agreement was of no effect and that the appellant limited partners had not shown that the findings of fact upon which the bankruptcy judge premised his approval of the sale were clearly erroneous. On this appeal the appellant limited partners contend that the lower court\u2019s determination that they were without standing to object to the sale of the partnership\u2019s assets constituted an erroneous application of Florida partnership law. We conclude that the lower courts correctly found the appellant limited partners to be without standing and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The limited partners of Dutch Inn lacked standing to object to the sale of its assets on two grounds. First, they were not materially and adversely affected by the approval of the sale of assets and Dutch Inn\u2019s plan of arrangement since the partnership\u2019s debts exceeded its total assets. Second, the limitation upon the partnership\u2019s ability to sell its assets upon which the appellant limited partners rely appears only in the limited partnership agreement and is contrary to other parts of the agreement and to the terms of the Certificate of Partnership issued to Dutch Inn by the Florida Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">As limited partners of Dutch Inn, the appellants possess a personal property interest in the partnership\u2019s profits and surplus, which interest is subordinate to the interests of all of the partnership\u2019s creditors. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 620.15, .18, .23 (West). Although the partnership had a substantial equity in its leasehold interest, the bankruptcy court specifically found that the partnership\u2019s total debts exceeded the value of its assets, and the appellant limited partners have not attacked that finding on this appeal as being clearly erroneous. Accepting this finding, as we must, means that once the claims of the partnership\u2019s creditors were satisfied, no profit or surplus would remain for distribution to the limited partners. They thus were not materially and adversely affected by these proceedings. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 806(7), 807 (repealed 1979). <em>See In re Northern Illinois Development Corp., </em>309 F.2d 882 (7th Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 965, 83 S.Ct. 1090, 10 L.Ed.2d 129 (1963), appeal following remand, 324 F.2d 104 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 938, 84 S.Ct. 792, 11 L.Ed.2d 658 (1964). Since the appellant limited partners did not qualify as creditors who hold a claim affected by the Dutch Inn\u2019s proposed plan of arrangement, they lack standing to object to the confirmation of the plan and the sale of Dutch Inn\u2019s assets under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 861 (repealed 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The appellant limited partners base their argument that they are entitled to object to the sale of the partnership\u2019s assets without their prior consent upon paragraph 6(a) of the \u201cLimited Partnership Agreement,\u201d which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, however: (a) Neither the leasehold interest of the Partnership nor the hotel may be sold without<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>'the consent of the Limited Partners.\u201d Paragraph 9 of the agreement, however, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Limited Partners shall have no voice in or right to manage or control the Partnership affairs and business and shall be deemed to have only those rights concerning the conduct of Partnership affairs as are provided for limited partners pursuant to the Partnership Law of the State of Florida.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The Certificate of Limited Partnership issued to Dutch Inn by the State of Florida does not contain the restriction upon the sale of the partnership\u2019s assets that appears in the partnership agreement but does dictate in Article IX that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">The Limited Partners shall take no part in or interfere in any manner with the conduct or control of the Partnership business, and shall have no right or authority to act for or bind the Partnership. All Partnership decisions shall be made by any two of the General Partners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We agree with the courts below that in light of the apparent inconsistency between paragraph 6(a) of the agreement and paragraph 9 of the agreement\u2019 and Article IX of the Certificate, the agreement did not limit the authority granted to the general partners by Florida law to convey the real property of the partnership without the consent of the limited partners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">. Under Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 620.09(1) (West), every general partner of a limited partnership has the authority to execute a conveyance of the partnership\u2019s real property, and section 620.081(3) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">Any estate in real property may be acquired in the partnership name. Title so acquired shall be conveyed or encumbered in the partnership name. Unless otherwise provided in the <em>certificate, </em>a conveyance or encumbrance of real property held in the partnership name, and any other instrument affecting title to real property in which the partnership has an interest, shall be executed in the partnership name by one of the general partners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 620.081(3) (West) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-22\">. The appellant limited partners also argue that Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 620.09(2) (West) bars the general partners from altering the character of the partnership\u2019s business without the written consent of all of the limited partners and that the sale of the Dutch Inn\u2019s sole asset, the hotel and leasehold interest, is a change in the character of the partnership\u2019s business. That section, however, only restricts the authority of the general partners to \u201c[d]o any act in contravention of the certificate\u201d without the consent of the limited partners. It does not restrict the right of the general partners as the appellant limited partners contend.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
