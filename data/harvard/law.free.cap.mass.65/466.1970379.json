Said Peleg died December 8th, 1813, being in the receipl of an annual pension of $200, for military service, and leaving the defendant his executor and residuary legatee. Mary Slade, his widow, died September 18th, 1838, having also appointed the defendant her executor and residuary legatee, and he gave the usual bond to pay debts and legacies. On the 4th day of February, 1851, the following pension certificate was issued from the secretary of the interior: \u201c I certify that in conformity with the law of the United States, Mary Slade, deceased, who was the widow of Peleg Slade, was entitled to a pension under act 4th July, 1836, (3d section,) and having died on the 18th September, 1838, her children, Lloyd Slade, Peleg Slade, Nancy Slade, Obadiah Slade, Elizabeth Slade, and Hannah Mason, are entitled to the amount at the rate of three hundred dollars per annum, from 4th March, 1831, to 18th September, 1838, when she died, payable to Lloyd Slade, executor of the estate of Mary Slade, deceased, after deducting former payments at the rate of two hundred dollars per annum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">On the same day, the commissioner of pensions addressed the following letter to F. Haven, Esq. pension agent at Boston: \u201c Sir,\u2014Be pleased to inscribe on your roll, act 4th July, 1836, the name of Mary Slade, deceased, widow of Peleg Slade, who was a colonel in the revolution, at the rate of three hundred dollars per annum, commencing 4th March, 1831, and terminating 18th September, 1838, when she died, and payable to Lloyd Slade, executor, for the benefit of himself, Peleg Slade, Nancy Slade, Obadiah Slade, Elizabeth Slade, and Hannah Mason, only surviving children, after deducting former payments, at the rate of two hundred dollars per annum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">On the 15th February, 1851, the defendant received of said Haven the sum of $753.88, for which he gave the following ceint: \u201c Received of Franklin Haven, agent for paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>pensioners belonging to the state of Massachusetts, seven hundred and fifty-three dollars 88-100, being for ninety months 14 days pension due to Mary Slade, deceased, from the 4th day of March, 1831, to the 18th day of September, 1838, for which I have signed duplicate receipts, deducting amount heretofore paid.\u201d And the several plaintiffs, as children of said Peleg and Mary, sued for a portion of said money as belonging to them. In the court of common pleas, <em>Byington, </em>J. ruled that the money belonged to the estate of Mary Slade, and was either held by the defendant as her executor, or became his in his own right, as residuary legatee, and that the actions could not be maintained; to which rulings the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-4\"><em>H. </em>Battelle, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFJ\">1. The defendant, by receiving the money upon and by virtue of the pension certificate, with full knowledge of its contents, bound himself to pay over their shares to the several children named therein, as entitled to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-5\"><em>2. </em>The increase of the pension in this case vested in the children named in the pension certificate, immediately upon the issuing thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-6\">3. But if it did not vest immediately in the children, the <em>arrears </em>of the pension of Mary Slade vested in her children at the time of her death, and are not assets to be administered by her executor. 4 U.

Upon an examination of that case, and the authorities upon, which it rests, we are satisfied it was rightly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">It is suggested by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs, that the <em>St. </em>of March 2d, 1829, was not in the mind of the court when <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>was determined. But in looking at that statute, it seems to us to be limited to the pension laws in force at the time of its passage. Before the act of June 19th, 1840, the right to this money had become fixed. The act is also in terms prospective only.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
