Their assignment of error is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">\"The trial court erred in not allowing defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict of not guilty because the regulations under which the defendants were convicted were void <em>ab initio\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The defendants were arrested on August 26, 1977. Under the Columbia River Fish Compact (ORS 507.010,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Oregon and Washington had established an \"early fall\u201d commercial salmon season on the river from August 14 to August 19 and from August 21 to August 23. OAR 635-35-230. Defendants admit that they were fishing commercially in Oregon waters when the river was closed by Oregon regulations which were validly adopted after consent and approval by appropriate agencies of this state and Washington pursuant to the compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">On August 23, 1977, a Washington trial court had entered what was denominated a \"preliminary injunction\u201d against that state\u2019s Department of Fisheries, the department\u2019s director and Governor Ray enjoining enforcement of Washington\u2019s regulations under the compact. That injunction had, of course, no extraterritorial effect; nonetheless defendants base their motion on it, arguing a syllogism that is harder to state than it is to refute. They assert that the compact forbids each of the state-parties to change its regulations without the consent of the other. The injunction voided the Washington regulations. Therefore, either (1) Washington changed its regulations without Oregon\u2019s consent, or (2) Washington never adopted valid regulations, or (3) Washington\u2019s regulations, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>been declared void, are not identical with Oregon\u2019s \u2014and so Oregon could not enforce its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\">The third of the alternative conclusions, whatever are the formal logic problems in the syllogism, has no merit whatsoever. The parties here agree that the regulations adopted by each state were identical, but nothing in the compact (as distinct from the political and practical necessities of the situation) has been shown to require that identity. Historically there have been differences between the states\u2019 regulations (and statutes) on occasion, and those differences have never been held to be violations of the compact. <em>See P. J. McGowan &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Van Winkle, </em>21 F2d 76 (DC Or 1927); <em>Olin v. Kitzmiller, </em>268 F 348 (9th Cir 1920), aff\u2019d 259 US 260, 42 S Ct 510, 66 L Ed 930 (1921). <em>Olin </em>declares that the thrust of the compact is that neither state can act unilaterally to affect detrimentally the common right of licensees of the other state to take fish from the Columbia River. In fact, Oregon and Washington did meet, did confer, did agree on the early fall season and did adopt their respective regulations. That was the compact required and was consistent with the compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">No party to the compact has changed its regulations. The Washington court said nothing about the Oregon regulations, and of course it could not. To be sure, the preliminary nature of the injunction meant that the court had said nothing <em>final </em>even about Washington\u2019s regulations; and the case touched not at all on Washington\u2019s power to approve Oregon\u2019s regulations. Finally, whether or not Washington ever validly adopted its own regulations as a substantive or procedural matter is irrelevant to the validity of Oregon\u2019s regulations, which have never been challenged with respect to their validity under the compact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Defendants violated Oregon\u2019s regulations when they fished in the closed season.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\"> \"All laws and regulations now existing, or which may be necessary for regulating, protecting or preserving fish in the waters of the Columbia River, over which the States of Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction, or any other waters within either of said states, which would affect the concurrent jurisdiction, shall be made, changed, altered and amended in whole or in part, only with the mutual consent and approbation of both states.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-5\"> The state suggests that defendants\u2019 argument, if it were valid, would lead to the conclusion that because there was no regulation at all establishing a 1977 open fishing season, the season never opened. Therefore, the defendants were guilty of fishing in a closed season. We need not decide whether the absence of agreement under the compact would leave the river open or closed to fishing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
