The complaint alleges that on August 9, 1938, Louisa M. Govey, the mother of the parties, was the owner of the property and on that day \u201cin reliance upon the defendant\u2019s oral promise that she would after the death of said Louisa M. Govey, divide the said property equally between herself and the plaintiffs, the said Louisa M. Govey executed and delivered to defendant a deed conveying the . . . property to said defendant\u201d which was recorded August 17, 1939, and that in 1946 appellant \u201crepudiated the aforesaid trust and agreement and refuses to divide said property and claims to be the owner thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">The answer admits that on August 9, 1938, the mother owned the property and that the deed was recorded as alleged, but denies the other allegations and pleads \u201cthat there were no conditions attached to the said conveyance and no trust was intended or created upon said premises by the grantor; there were no promises by grantee either express or implied, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>after the death of grantor the grantee would divide the said premises with the plaintiffs herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The court found that a confidential relationship existed between the mother and appellant; that \u201cno consideration was paid by the defendant to her mother for the conveyance . . . and said conveyance was made ... to said defendant upon her promise to divide the proceeds realized from a sale of said property after the death of said Louise M. Govey and the payment of all debts of said Louise M. Govey, equally between plaintiffs and the defendant\u201d and that on July 7, 1946, defendant \u201crepudiated her trust agreement and refused to divide the property or to sell the same and divide the proceeds with the plaintiffs and since said date defendant claims to be the owner of said property.\u201d The judgment decreed that appellant holds the title in trust for Louisa Grace, Manuel M. Govey and herself in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The only question presented is whether the evidence is sufficient to support the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Appellant attacks the finding that a confidential relationship existed between her and her mother, claiming that there is no evidence to support it. Mrs. Grace testified that appellant managed the business affairs of her mother because the latter \u201ccouldn\u2019t do much writing English at all\u201d; also that appellant \u201ckept everything, nobody could get hold of them [deeds], she put it in the bank in the safe deposit box so nobody could get their hands on anything.\u201d Respondent Govey testified that appellant took care of the business affairs of both their mother and father. All this testimony stands uncontradicted, and of course is sufficient to support the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">With respect to the finding that no consideration was given for the deed, appellant testified that she had given her mother $500 for the deed, and admitted of course that the property was worth more than that. The record shows that it was valued at from $18,000 to $21,000. Later she admitted that she did not give her mother this $500 in cash or on the date of the deed, but at \u2018 \u2018 certain times when she was sick, I had to pay her hospital bills\u2014I mean her sickness, the doctor bills and food\u201d; in short, it appears that the $500 claimed to have been paid was not in a lump sum but was spread over some time. Respondent Govey testified that during a conversation with appellant at her home he said \u201cI see you gave mama $10 for this property\u201d to which she replied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 I didn\u2019t give her nothing. \u2019 \u2019 The finding that no consideration for the deed was given by appellant is amply supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">With respect to the circumstances attending the delivery of the deed, respondents rely principally, if not entirely, upon admissions made and assurances given by appellant to them, all of which appellant denies. The mother died on December 30, 1945, which was over seven years after the deed from her to appellant, and none of the admissions or assurances on which respondents rely was earlier than abont the time of the mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Mrs. Grace testified that while appellant was in the hospital (which was about the time of the mother\u2019s death) appellant \u201csaid when she came out she would make everything all right.\u201d She testified further that on July 7, 1946, in the presence of respondent Govey, his wife, and Mrs. Rose Almeida appellant had at first said \u201cmy mother said to sell the property and divide it between my brother and I . . . Then after, when she was offered this price I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you sell it? \u2019 She said \u2018By the time I give you a little bit and brother, I will have nothing.\u2019 So then we left her alone.\u201d She also testified that after she had taken care of appellant after her hospitalization and the latter had left the Grace home she said: \u201cI will give you what\u2019s coming to you, you have been very good to me.\u201d Mrs. Grace was asked on cross-examination if she did not say to Mrs Augusta Lopes that it was right that appellant should have the property since she took care of their mother, and answered: \u201cNo sir, I said my sister should have at least half of the property and split the other half between us, . . . for taking care of her for ten years.\u201d On rebuttal she made a somewhat similar statement. When asked if she did not say that the property belonged to appellant and that respondents had no claim on it she replied \u201cNever. I said she should get a little more because she took care of the folks we shouldn\u2019t get as much as her,\u201d and again, \u201cNo, she should get more than the two of us, because she stayed with them longer ... I always said that and I will always stick with that. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Respondent Govey testified that at the conversation to which Mrs. Grace referred at which Mrs. Almeida was present, \u201cthere had been quite a little conversation in reference to being equalized between us three\u201d and that appellant had said \u201cthat it was no more than right that each one of us should have our share as my mother wanted it.\u201d On cross-examination he said: \u201cI told her I wanted her to live up with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>she said my mother wanted. Q. And she said she was not going to do it? A. She said, no.\u201d He also testified that when he was called by appellant to his mother\u2019s deathbed appellant said \u201cLet\u2019s not have any trouble . . . you know mother said this property was for the three of us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Mrs. Rose Almeida testified that she was present at a conversation where there were present respondent Govey, his wife, \u201cJoe Grace, me and her\u201d when appellant had returned from the hospital after her illness, at which appellant said \u201cjust as soon as she gets better she is going to give Manuel\u2014put it for sale and they were going to divide it among the three, \u2018Because Louise has been taking care of me and she has been so good,\u2019 she said, \u2018Manuel is so good\u2019 . . . She said she was going to divide it up . . .\u201d She testified that later on they met and appellant said \u201cI ain\u2019t going to give them nothing\u201d to which the witness replied \u201cYou said you were going to give it half and half, divide it up.\u201d On cross-examination she said \u201cYes, she was going to divide it up.\u201d And again, on cross-examination \u201cShe told me she was going to divide it up; the last time she told me, her husband was there . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Mrs. Irene Govey, wife of respondent, testified that she was at Mrs. Grace\u2019s home when appellant was sick there and that they were talking about the property, and appellant said \u201cWell, I will sell the property and divide it between you and Louisa and the three of us . . . They said that was agreeable with them. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Appellant testified to at least two conversations with respondents, the first at Mrs. Grace\u2019s home in early February, 1946, on returning from the hospital and the other on July 7, 1946, on 90th Avenue. She denied that at any time, in either her home or her sister\u2019s home, she had promised to give them a share in this property. She explained that at the February meeting \u201cthey wanted me to sell\u2014they were forcing me to get a real estate man to put my property for sale.\u201d She repeated her denial of any promise to respondents. With respect to the deathbed incident she said she sent for her brother because she felt, it to be her duty, but definitely denied having said \u201cMother says this property is for the three of us\u201d and said that the property was not discussed at all. She testified that at the last meeting, on July 7, 1946, she told respondents that \u201cif they did what was right, they wouldn\u2019t be sorry\u201d and that what she meant was \u201cif they do what was right, after my death I would do what was right, that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>all. ...\u201d On redirect she testified that her mother in discussing the deed did not say \u201cto give it to your brother,\u201d and that when the notary asked the mother if she wanted $3.00 in documentary stamps on the deed \u201cShe said as long as it protected me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Rose Marie Davis, the stepdaughter of appellant, testified: \u2018 \u2018 Q. Did your mother make any promise to either one of them to give them any interest in the property standing in her name ? A. I never heard anything about a promise. Q. Did Mrs. Grace say she wanted the property divided? A. No, Louise always said \u2018I have no right to anything, neither has my brother, because Mamie has taken care of my mother for so many years.\u2019 \u201d She testified also that after respondent Govey left on July 7, \u201chis sister said, \u2018Well, we have no right to say anything, we have no right to anything, to be here. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In rebuttal Mrs. Grace testified that Mrs. Lopes was not present at the meeting on July 7. She also testified that Mrs. Davis was not present during all of that meeting but went outdoors to take some pictures. She denied that she had ever discussed this matter with Mrs. Lopes.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The issue tendered by the complaint was whether, when the mother made the deed to appellant, it was made in reliance upon the defendant\u2019s oral promise that she would after the death of the mother, divide the property equally between herself and her sister and brother. There was no attempt by respondents to prove anything that was said by the mother to appellant imposing such trust on appellant, or the latter\u2019s acceptance of it, other than by the testimony just summarized of admissions and assurances made about the, time of the mother\u2019s death and during the six or seven months following it.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The first of these, asserted by respondent Govey and flatly denied by appellant, was the deathbed episode where he quotes appellant as saying \u201cLet\u2019s not have any trouble . . . you know mother said this property was for the three of us.\u201d If the court accepted his version and rejected hers, you have a clear-cut admission against appellant\u2019s proprietary interest, bearing in mind that legal title then stood in her name by virtue of a deed absolute on its face made seven years earlier. This if believed went far toward supporting the finding of a trust relation. However, it is buttressed by a number of other admissions testified to by not only the respondents but by their witnesses, and it is to be implied from the findings that the trier of fact accepted them and rejected appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>denials and the testimony of her witnesses. The record presents simply another case of conflicting testimony, with respect to which the rule is familiar.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel in moving for a nonsuit said; \u201c. . . its a mere promise here that she promised to divide her property, it wasn\u2019t a consideration whatsoever, therefore, they have not made a prima facie case.\u201d Appellant still adheres to this theory, arguing on this appeal as though she had received the deed from her mother with no trust imposed and no conditions attached, and then seven years later had magnanimously promised her sister and brother to divide equally with them, without any consideration moving from them to her. The pleadings tender no such issue; the evidence makes no such case, and the case was tried on no such theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Appellant argues that in a case such as this the burden rests on the plaintiffs to show by clear and convincing evidence that a deed or other transfer absolute on its face is not what it purports on its face to be. That is true, but as was said in <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Bear Film Co., Inc., </em>28 Cal.2d 154, 173 [168 P.2d 946] :</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u201cAlthough it is necessary, in order to establish a trust, to offer clear and convincing proof, such proof may be indirect, consisting of acts, conduct, and circumstances <em>(Airola </em>v. <em>Gorham, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 42, 49 [133 P.2d 78]; <em>Kobida </em>v. <em>Hinkelmann, </em>53 Cal.App.2d 186 [127 P.2d 657]; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>3 Cal.App.2d 154 [39 P.2d 820]), and the question whether the showing is clear and convincing is primarily one for the trial court <em>(Beeler </em>v. <em>American Trust Co., </em>24 Cal.2d 1, 7 [147 P.2d 583] ; <em>Stromerson </em>v. <em>Averill, </em>22 Cal.2d 808, 815 [141 P.2d 732]).\u201d Such evidence need not be \u201cconclusive\u201d <em>(Hobart </em>v. <em>Hobart Estate Co., </em>26 Cal.2d 412, 444-446 [159 P.2d 958]).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Appellant contends that the court had no power to declare a trust since the estate of Mrs. Govey had not gone through probate. The evidence clearly shows that the deed was made on August 9, 1938, that she died on December 30, 1945, and that on her death there was no property left subject to probate. It had been conveyed by the deed now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">This brings us to another point made by appellant, i. e., that neither the complaint nor the findings state the death of Mrs. Govey, the mother. The findings contain a statement showing that both parents were deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Another point made by appellant is that \u201cNo title in Louise M. Govey is shown at the time of this deed to appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>lant or even later, and therefore there is no property as to which a trust can be declared.\u201d The complaint alleges that on the date of the deed Louisa M. Govey was the owner of the property. The answer expressly admits this, hence there was no issue as to that <em>(Munfrey </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 779, 784 [171-P.2d 750]), and it \u201cmust be treated as admitted on appeal\u201d <em>(Palpar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>82 Cal.App.2d 578, 583 [186 P.2d 748]).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Appellant complains that the finding that this was community property is without any support in the record. The complaint did not allege that it had been community property and such allegation would have been surplusage, since the father had conveyed to the mother and she admittedly held title when she deeded to appellant, hence the finding respecting community property was wholly outside the issues and may be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The court decreed that appellant holds the title to the property in trust for the two respondents and herself in equal shares. There are numerous eases in this state enforcing constructive trusts under similar circumstances and it suffices simply to cite 25 California Jurisprudence, pages 159-161, section 31, where the rule is stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Nourse, P. J., and Jones, J. pro tern., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 14, 1952, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 10, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
