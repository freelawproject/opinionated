No motion for a new trial was made and no notice of appeal from the judgment was taken. On August 27, 1951, about six years later, plaintiff, in propria persona, filed a document in the Superior Court denominated \u201cPetition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis,\u201d which writ was denied. Immediately thereafter, he again filed such a petition and \u201cAddenda Thereto,\u201d in which it is generally charged that it was filed \u201cfor the purpose of exoneration and vindication from an erroneous conviction and sentence had in the above entitled court, by trick and device and extrinsic fraud by false testimony given in \u2018Proxy.\u2019 \u201d Defendant now prosecutes this appeal from the order denying his petition. He claims on appeal that certain facts existed which, if known by the defendant and presented to the trial court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment of guilty. In his statement of facts, which is an admixture of factual and argumentative material, the defendant quotes some of the claimed testimony produced at the trial by the prosecution. The record on appeal does not include the reporter\u2019s transcript of the trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">To epitomize defendant\u2019s argument, it is based upon the alleged weakness, falsity, improbability and impossibility of the statements made by the two witnesses for the State, against whom the crimes were committed. Defendant also attempts to prove by affidavits from various persons that the crimes alleged to have been committed on certain days could not have been so committed because the two girls were either in school or church or that he was at work on those days. Nowhere does defendant allege that he was prevented by extrinsic causes from offering the newly discovered evidence contained in the affidavits. The newly discovered evidence was either known or should have been discovered by the defendant by the use of reasonable diligence. Suffice it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>say that defendant stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to Barbara, and because of such relationship he, more than anyone else, should have known at the time of trial of the alleged facts that he now claims he later discovered. He endeavors to account for the delay in instituting this proceeding on the claimed ground that - he was unable to employ counsel, compelled to study law in the prison to \u201cfind a case in point similar to\u201d his; that his spasmodic access to books and the securing of evidence to support his assignments of error and in obtaining the attention of the courts to act, were difficult tasks and caused the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The cases are legion which announce the narrow scope or limitations of this writ.  The purpose of it is to secure relief, where no other remedy exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court had known it, and which through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not then known to the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schuman, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 140 [219 P.2d 36]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingles, </em>97 Cal. App.2d 867, 871 [218 P.2d 987]; <em>In re Sprague, </em>37 Cal.2d 110 [230 P.2d 633]; <em>In re Lindley, </em>29 Cal.2d 709 [177 P.2d 918]; <em>People </em>v. <em>James, </em>99 Cal.App.2d 476 [222 P.2d 117]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuthill, </em>32 Cal.2d 819 [198 P.2d 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The attacks made by defendant in reference to the credibility of the prosecuting witnesses are answered by the same principle of law set forth in the cited cases. These grievances are matters commonly adjudicated on a motion for new trial, or on an appeal from an order denying a new trial, or from the judgment, and are not matters reviewable by writ of error <em>coram nolis. (People </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>73 Cal. App.2d 532 [166 P.2d 899].) The trial court was justified in denying the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">In some supporting affidavits presented with this petition on appeal, defendant claims that a duplicate commitment of him to the state\u2019s prison was issued by the superior court and that the Adult Authority, in certifying its action taken on June 19, 1950, to the Department of Corrections, in fixing the term of imprisonment, erroneously fixed the term of sentence'. These are not matters that can be raised on a <em>coram nolis </em>proceeding. If there is merit to the claim an appropriate remedy exists which may be used at the proper time. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1487; <em>In re Morck, </em>180 Cal. 384 [181 P. 657] ; 13 Cal.Jur. 243, \u00a7 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Barnard, P. J., and Mussell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
