J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ast\">Plaintiff is the holder of a treasurer\u2019s deed to real property in the city of Los Angeles described in the judgment, which deed was issued December 10, 1948, after foreclosure'of a street bond dated December 27, 1928, issued pursuant to the Improvement Act of 1911. Defendant is the holder of a deed from the State of California dated October 20, 1945, issued following a deed to the state for nonpayment of taxes levied for the fiscal year 1930-1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">The court found that the parties own equal interests in the property, as tenants in common, that plaintiff is the holder of an equitable lien in the sum of $1,951.02, defendant is the holder of an equitable lien in the sum of $75, and that defendant has paid taxes in the sum of $4.44, a lien upon the property. The judgment ordered the property sold by a referee, and that the proceeds, after costs of sale, should be distributed as follows: To plaintiff, his costs in the sum of $17.85; to defendant, the sum of $4.44; to plaintiff, the further sum of $1,951.02; and to defendant, $75; reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff to be hereafter fixed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>for prosecution of the action; and the balance, if any, to be divided equally between the parties. It was provided that if sufficient sums are not obtained on the sale there shall be a proportionate distribution. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The sole contention on the appeal is that defendant\u2019s tax title is superior to that of plaintiff. The law was settled to the contrary of defendant\u2019s contention in <em>Monheit </em>v. <em>Cigna, </em>28 Cal.2d 19 [168 P.2d 965, 167 A.L.R. 995]. (See, also, <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Laing, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 892 [239 P.2d 3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Wood (Parker), J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
