The demurrer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>was sustained with leave to amend. Defendant having failed to amend within the period allowed by the court, an order dismissing the second amended cross-complaint was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">\n<em>Question-. Was the demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint on the ground of uncertainty and unintelligibility properly sustained?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>Yes. </em>A mere reading of the second amended cross-complaint shows that facts are not alleged in either purported cause of action from which it is possible to ascertain how or in what manner defendant was damaged by the alleged breach of contract by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Where, as in the instant case, damages do not necessarily result from the wrongful breach of a contract, an injured party must specifically plead the facts showing the damage which has resulted to him because of the wrongful act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>of the other party to the contract, and a general allegation of damages is insufficient as against a special demurrer for uncertainty and/or unintelligibility. <em>(Judson Mfg.
