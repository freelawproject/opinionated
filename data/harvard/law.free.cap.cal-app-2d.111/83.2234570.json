A minute order was entered in the matter on December 21, 1951 and a more formal written order signed by the judge on December 27. The minute order contained no direction for a written order and the movant asserts that under rule 2 (b) (2), Rules on Appeal, the minute order is the appealable order in which event the notice of appeal filed on February 25 was not in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">It is settled that under rule 2 (b) (2) even though there is no direction in the minute order for the preparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of a written order if the minute order omits any essential portion of a valid order, such as findings when necessary, the minute order is not the appealable order. <em>(Trubowitch </em>v. <em>Riverbank Canning Co., </em>30 Cal.2d 335, 346-347 [182 P.2d 182]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 711, 717 [234 P.2d 287] ; <em>Estate of Dow, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 420, 423 [205 P.2d 698] ; <em>Hirschberg </em>v. <em>Oser, </em>82 Cal.App.2d 282, 286 [186 P.2d 53].)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In probate proceedings the code expressly requires a finding of the giving of the required notice of the hearing. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1200; <em>Estate of Kauffman, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 655, 659-660 [147 P.2d 11] ; <em>Estate of Dow, supra, </em>91 Cal.App. 2d at p. 432.) This essential finding does not appear in the minute order of December 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Motion to dismiss denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Nourse, P.
