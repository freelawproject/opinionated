Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">At the time of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial her counsel stated: \u201cNow may the record show that the only attack we are making is in the matter of attorneys fees.\u201d However, on appeal plaintiff argues the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified to facts which if believed by the trial judge would have supported findings for her. Defendant testified that he purchased the note and second trust deed at a discount, in good faith and for value. Other testimony and facts in the record support his testimony. So, under the familiar substantial evidence rule the findings on the merits must stand. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Pollack, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 26 [224 P.2d 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s contention that it was error for the court to adjudge $1,500 for defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees is also untenable. Plaintiff argues that there was no evidence in the record to support the judgment and \u201cno proof of the amount of services rendered,- value thereof or obligation or agreement of the defendant to pay attorneys fees;\u201d that defendant failed to file a counterclaim for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees; and that in any event attorneys\u2019 fees in such circumstances as these are not recoverable in a suit by the maker against the holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Defendant\u2019s answer pleads the covenant in the note for attorneys\u2019 fees should action be instituted thereon. The trust deed provides for attorneys\u2019 fees, \u201cin the event beneficiary shall appear in an action wherein the security of the deed of trust or the rights or powers of the beneficiary are affected.\u201d So no counterclaim was required, and the judgment was properly rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Attorneys\u2019 fees may be recovered where the adverse claim is made by the mortgagor or grantor. <em>(Hewlett </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>56 Cal.App. 344 [205 P. 492].)  A finding that a mortgage was executed is equivalent to a finding that the mortgagor agreed to pay a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee if so provided in the mortgage. The conclusion of law that defendant was entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees rests upon the provisions of the mortgage, and the court could determine what amount would be reasonable without hearing any testimony thereon. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 449 [119 P.2d 1012]; <em>Hellier </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>136 Cal. 143 [68 P. 581]; <em>Huber </em>v. <em>Shedoudy, </em>180 Cal. 311 [181 P. 63].)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Appeal from order denying \u25a0 motion for new trial is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
