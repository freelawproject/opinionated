Defendant was adjudged guilty by a jury of all three offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">It is contended on appeal that the court erred in refusing to give certain instructions relating to circumstantial evidence; that the\u2019 evidence is insufficient to support the conviction; that there is a fatal variance between the allegations and the proof; and that the verdicts on all counts are contrary to the evidence and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Briefly, the facts are that defendant gave a check as a down payment on the purchase of an automobile. The check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>was returned marked insufficient funds. It was given on March 16, 1951, but was dated 4-16-51. Defendant did not inform the salesman nor did the salesman notice the date on the check. But defendant had no account even on the date the check bore. The home address given by defendant at the time was a vacant lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">At 2 a. m. on March 16th, defendant was arrested for \u201cdrunk driving,\u201d following a collision. The prosecution followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">There is no merit to appellant\u2019s contentions. That the evidence is sufficient there can be no question. As to the other contentions, they are highly technical. The instructions fully covered the issues and there was no variance in the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
