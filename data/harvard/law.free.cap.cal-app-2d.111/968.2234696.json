The facts of the case are sufficiently recited in the basic case and hence need not here be repeated. In view of the conclusions we have arrived at in the basic case it is self-evident that the judgment in this case must as in the basic case be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 16, 1952, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 24, 1952.
