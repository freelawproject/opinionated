In resolving this appeal, we must decide whether the excluded testimony was admissible under Maryland Rule 5-608(a)(3), which allows a character witness on direct examination to give a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for opinion testimony but does not permit a witness to testify as to \u201cspecific instances of truthfulness or untruthfulness.\u201d We shall hold that the character witness\u2019s testimony was improperly restricted, but that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">On June 17, 1996, Jason Aaron Jensen, along with Brian Wooldridge, Jean Nance, and Rachel Whitman, met up with Adrian Pilkmgton, the victim, at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Frederick where the victim worked. The group left Mcr Donald\u2019s in Pilkington\u2019s car and, after spending some time at Whitman\u2019s house, traveled to Virginia. On a rural road in Virginia, Pilkington was stabbed twice and placed in the trunk of his car. On the return trip to Frederick, the car, driven by Jensen, stopped on the Route 17 bridge in Brunswick City. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Pilkington, bleeding from his stab wounds but still alive, was taken from the trunk and thrown from the bridge. On June 21, 1996, Pilkington\u2019s body was recovered from the Potomac River a few miles from the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">All four were charged with Pilkington\u2019s murder. Jensen\u2019s trial began on February 4, 1997 and lasted five days. Brian Wooldridge testified for the State pursuant to a plea agreement. The defense called one witness, Melissa Goff, to impeach the credibility of Wooldridge. Portions of her testimony follow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">DEFENSE ATT\u2019Y: Could you tell the jury, if you know, if you\u2019re familiar with Brian Wooldridge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">GOFF: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">Q: Okay, and how are you familiar with Brian Wooldridge?

The court agreed with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Jensen was convicted of first degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and assault with intent to murder. Jensen appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari to consider the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">Did the Court of Special Appeals misinterpret Maryland Rule 5-608, holding that a character witness could be prevented from giving the basis for her opinion that the State\u2019s chief witness was a compulsive liar?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Petitioner argues that a character witness is permitted to give the basis of his opinion on direct examination, so long as that witness does not cite specific instances of misconduct. Petitioner maintains that without allowing for some evidence of reasonable basis, \u201ca jury will not be impressed with a bald conclusion of personal opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The State argues that reasonable basis evidence properly is limited to how long and under what circumstances the witnesses have been acquainted. The State contends that, \u201cin accordance with common law evidentiary standards,\u201d Maryland Rule 5-608 \u201cembodies a restrictive approach designed to avoid diverting the jury\u2019s attention and creating mini-trials on the issue of a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d According to the State, Goffs proffered testimony was \u201cno more than a number of specific events tied together\u201d and thus contemplated specific instances of conduct prohibited on direct examination under Maryland Rule 5-608(a)(3)(B). The State further argues that any purported error in the evidentiary ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, given Goffs disparaging assessment of Brian Wooldridge as a \u201ccompulsive liar,\u201d and given the testimony by two of Jensen\u2019s friends and a fellow inmate that he had killed Pilkington.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Maryland Rule 5-~608(a)(3)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">On direct examination, a character witness may give a reasonable basis for testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness, but may not testify as to specific instances of truthfulness or untruthfulness by the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">We first must determine whether the excluded testimony constituted specific instances of untruthfulness. If we find that the evidence was not specific instances of untruthfulness, we must determine whether the evidence was admissible as a reasonable basis for testimony. Finally, if we determine that the evidence was improperly excluded, we must consider whether the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">A common understanding of the words \u201cspecific instance\u201d indicate that Goffs testimony does not fall into that category. \u201cSpecific\u201d is defined as \u201cof an exact or particular nature,\u201d \u201cparticular,\u201d \u201cprecise.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1398 (6th ed,1990). Goff was not testifying as to a particular incident; she was testifying, as a general matter, to Wooldridge\u2019s tendency to tell mutually inconsistent stories, <em>ie., </em>his general tendency to be untruthful. Nor was her testimony \u201cno more than a number of specific events tied together.\u201d She was not testifying as to several particular instances of conduct; she was testifying as to a general behavior pattern which was the basis for her opinion that Wooldridge was untruthful. <em>Cf. Blake v. Cich, </em>79 F.R.D. 398, 403 n. 2 (D.Minn. 1978) (applying the Federal counterpart to Maryland Rule 5-608 and explaining, \u201cIn one sense, the absence of a criminal record is a record of innumerable specific instances of good conduct. But such a history becomes something more than the specific instances comprising it, it is what is generally meant by good character.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">It becomes even clearer after examining the purposes underlying the prohibition that her testimony was not, as the State classifies the evidence, a string of \u201cspecific instances.\u201d Maryland\u2019s Rule 608(a)(3)(B) is based on Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Evidence 608(b), which in turn is related to Federal Rule of Evidence 405(b) on specific instances evidence. The advisory committee\u2019s note to Federal Rule 405 explains that although specific instances are the most convincing character evidence, that type of evidence also \u201cpossesses the greatest capacity to arouse prejudice, to confuse, to surprise, and to consume time.\u201d <em>See also </em>Court of Appeals of Maryland Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Proposed Title 5 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 5-608 Reporter\u2019s Note (Subcommittee Draft 1991) (on file with Committee) (explaining that \u201croutinely permitting such proof would distract and unduly influence juries and create too many time-consuming side issues.\u201d). As these notes suggest, once a witness testifies to a specific instance, the jury\u2019s focus necessarily turns to whether in fact that particular event occurred and the circumstances surrounding that event. In contrast, because Goffs statement that Wooldridge often told her mutually inconsistent stories spoke to a general trait and not to particular occasions on which he lied, it would not serve to distract and confuse the jury, nor would it consume time by altering the focus of the trial to other particular events.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Having decided that Goffs testimony was not evidence of \u201cspecific instances,\u201d we turn to the more difficult inquiry of whether the trial court abused its discretion in limiting the \u201creasonable basis\u201d for her testimony to her acquaintance with Wooldridge and her conclusion that Wooldridge was a \u201ccompulsive liar.\u201d Because Maryland Rule 5-608 must be read in light of Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 9-115, and because the Maryland rules of evidence were \u201cnot intended to repeal or supplant the entire common law of evidence,\u201d \u201cbut only such of it as is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of the rules,\u201d <em>see </em>125th Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, 20 Md. Reg. pt. II at P-1 (July 23, 1993) (issue 15), we must understand the phrase \u201creasonable basis for testimony\u201d in light of the law at the time Rule 5-608(a)(3) was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Prior to the 1700\u2019s in England, a character witness could testify both as to an opinion of a witness\u2019s credibility and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>specific acts of the witness. <em>See </em>3A J\u201e Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 979, at 823 (Chadbourn rev.1970). By the mid 1700\u2019s, it became settled that, although a witness could be cross-examined about specific or particular acts or courses of conduct, the witness could not testify as to such matters on direct examination. <em>See id. </em>The rule further developed that a character witness could testify only as to what he heard from others about the defendant\u2019s reputation, and not to his opinion of the witness\u2019s truthfulness. <em>See Taylor v. State, </em>278 Md. 150, 155, 360 A.2d 430, 433-34 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In 1971, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 760, entitled \u201cAN ACT ... providing that a character witness in any proceeding shall be permitted to give evidence to prove character based on personal opinion.\u201d 1971 Maryland Laws ch. 760, at 1634. The current version of this statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">[wjhere character evidence is otherwise relevant to the proceeding, no person offered as a character witness who has an adequate basis for forming an opinion as to another person\u2019s character shall hereafter be excluded from giving evidence based on personal opinion to prove character, either in person or by deposition, in any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, in any court or before any judge, or jury of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 9-115 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The statute clearly modified the common law rule insofar as it allowed a witness to testify as to the personal opinion of the truthfulness of another witness. <em>See Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. 445, 449, 397 A.2d 600, 603 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">This Court inteipreted \u00a7 9-115 in <em>Durkin v. State. </em>In <em>Durkin, </em>we addressed whether the trial judge must make a preliminary decision as to the adequate basis for the opinion before permitting the opinion witness to testify. We concluded that \u201cthe trial judge has the threshold function of evaluating the circumstances and making a determination that the personal opinion of the character witness is relevant and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>an adequate basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 397 A.2d at 605. We explained that \u201cthe extent of the basis for the personal opinion character testimony relates to admissibility, <em>and not just to the weight to be given the testimony by the trier of fact.\u201d Id., </em>397 A.2d at 605 (emphasis added). Although the issue before the Court related to the trial judge\u2019s role under \u00a7 9-115, the emphasized portion of the latter statement indicates that \u201cthe extent of the basis for the personal opinion character testimony,\u201d and not simply the bare opinion itself, is presented for the trier of fact\u2019s consideration. Further support is found in <em>Kelley v. State, </em>288 Md. 298, 302, 418 A.2d 217, 219 (1980), wherein we stated that \u00a7 9-115 \u201cpermits the admission of a broad range of testimony which may aid the jury in assessing the credibility of a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In contrast to the general pronouncements made by this court, the Court of Special Appeals has addressed precisely what is permitted as a basis for opinion testimony under \u00a7 9-115. In <em>Hemingway v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 127, 543 A.2d 879 (1988), the Court of Special Appeals interpreted \u00a7 9-115 to allow a character witness, on direct examination, to testify as to specific instances bearing on the credibility of the witness to be impeached. In <em>Hemingway, </em>the central issue was whether Hemingway had acted in self-defense when he shot and killed the decedent, Hickman. In support of his self-defense argument, Hemingway called a character witness, Lantz, to testify as to Lantz\u2019s opinion that Hickman was a violent person. Before trial, the State successfully moved to prevent Lantz from testifying as to any specific acts of violence by Hickman. Lantz was limited to testifying that he was acquainted with Hickman and that Hickman was, in his opinion, a violent person. <em>See id. </em>at 131-32, 543 A.2d at 880-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed. The court first quoted from Chief Judge Gilbert\u2019s opinion for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Taylor </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>As a result of the enactment of what is now Courts Art. \u00a7 9-115, Maryland possesses the common law rule with a vastly broadened field of vision. No longer is a character witness prevented from speaking of specific acts or precluded from demonstrating a basis of knowledge leading to his own independent opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 185, 543 A.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The court then wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">Under Md.Code, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9-115 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the party who offers the personal opinion of a character witness must first convince the trial judge that the witness possesses an adequate basis for forming an opinion as to another person\u2019s character. <em>Kelley v. State, supra; Durkin v. State, supra. ... </em>This does not mean, however, that the basis for the character witness\u2019s opinion, if admitted, has no relevance to the weight ascribed to that opinion by the jury. Clearly, the bald conclusion of the witness without any reason to support it hardly commends the opinion for serious consideration by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 134-35, 543 A.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">[T]he trial court abused its discretion in restricting Officer Lantz\u2019s character witness testimony to the recital of the length of time he had known Randall Hickman and his bald conclusion as to Hickman\u2019s reputation for violence. In so ruling, the court deprived the appellant of an ability to urge the jury to credit Lantz\u2019s opinion because of the substantial basis for it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>... At the retrial, Officer Lantz should be permitted to give his opinion of Randall Hickman\u2019s violent character and the bases for his opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 136, 543 A.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">It is with this backdrop that we turn to the history underlying the promulgation of Rule 5-608. In 1988, the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure began drafting proposed rules of evidence. The task of the committee was to undertake an independent review of Maryland and federal law, not simply to copy the federal rules of evidence. <em>See </em>Audio tape of Public Hearing on Proposed Rules of Evidence, held by the Court of Appeals (Oct. 4, 1993) (statement of Judge Alan Wilner, Chair, Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure) (on file with clerk of this Court). Among the rules considered by the Evidence Subcommittee of the Committee was a rule governing opinion and reputation evidence of character for impeachment purposes. The first proposed rule on this topic mirrored the Federal Rule and provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">(a) Opinion and Reputation Evidence of Character</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">(b) Specific Instances of Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 credibility ... may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Minutes of Committee Meeting, at 2 (Sept. 9-10, 1988) (on file with the Committee). The Subcommittee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>presented the proposed rule to the full committee, which voted not to recommend the rule to the Court of Appeals. <em>See id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The Subcommittee drafted a different rule in 1991, which provided in section 5-608(a)(3)(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">On direct examination, a character witness may give a reasonable basis for testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to the character of the previous witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness, but may not testify to specific instances of truthfulness or untruthfulness by the previous witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYm\">Court op Appeals Standing Committee on Rules op Practice and Procedure, Proposed Title 5 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure: Evidence (Subcommittee Draft 1992) (on file with Committee). That text is identical to the rule ultimately presented to the Court of Appeals with the 125th Report by the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure in July of 1993.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Reporter\u2019s Note<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to that final rule read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">Subsection (a)(3) expresses certain limitations on the character witness\u2019s testimony, whether offered as impeachment or rehabilitation.... The second sentence <em>goes beyond the Federal Rule somewhat </em>by providing that on direct examination, a character witness may give a \u201creasonable basis\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>for testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to truthfulness of the previous witness. The Committee envisions \u201creasonable basis\u201d evidence as covering such matters as how long the witnesses have been acquainted, under what circumstances, etc. The sentence goes on, however, to express the substance of F.R.Ev. 608(b)(2)\u2014that specific instances of conduct by the previous witness may be inquired into on cross examination of the character witness\u2014 as a limitation on direct examination. That provision is inconsistent with <em>Hemingway v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 127, 543 A.2d 879 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">20 Md. Reg. pt. II at P-14 (July 23,1993) (issue 15) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">An examination of this history makes several things clear. At the time Rule 5-608 was adopted by this Court, various opinions in both this Court and the Court of Special Appeals had interpreted \u00a7 9-115 as permitting a broad range of testimony by an impeaching character witness to go before the trier of fact. Rule 5-608 unquestionably intended to modify Maryland law, in particular, <em>Hemingway v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 127, 543 A.2d 879 (1988), to the extent that specific instances of truthfulness or untruthfulness were not admissible on direct examination of a witness. Except for this provision, however, there is no indication that the Rule intended to restrict the latitude previously given to character witnesses in testifying as to the reasons underlying their opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Second, although this Court clearly borrowed from the Federal Rule in adopting the prohibition on specific instances of untruthfulness, the Court did not intend to mimic the Federal Rule in whole. This is made clear by the Committee\u2019s choice, after rejecting the Federal Rule in 1988, to redraft the rule and explicitly allow the witness to give a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for an opinion, and by this Court\u2019s ultimate adoption of the redrafted rule; such a provision is absent from the Federal Rule. This is further made clear by the Reporter\u2019s Note, which provides that the Maryland Rule <em>\u201cgoes beyond the Federal Rule somewhat </em>by providing that on direct examination, a character witness may give a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to truthfulness of the previous witness.\u201d 20 Md. Reg. pt. II at P-14 (July 23, 1993) (issue 15) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Put another way, although it is clear that the Court intended to parrot the federal rule with regard to what material <em>was not permitted </em>on direct examination of the witness (specific instances of untruthfulness), it is equally clear that the Court intended to \u201cgo beyond\u201d the federal rule as to what <em>was permitted </em>to go before the trier of fact as the basis for the opinion. Thus, there is little indication that the Federal Rule\u2019s limitation on opinion testimony\u2014the witness is generally confined to the nature and extent of observation and acquaintance upon which the opinion is based\u2014should be read as a limit on the Maryland rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the contrary, there is strong indication that the Court intended to distinguish the Maryland Rule from the Federal Rule in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In summary, when Rule 5-608 is read in conjunction with Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 9-511, which contains no express limitations beyond requiring a witness to have an adequate basis before testifying, the case law interpreting \u00a7 9-511, permitting a binad range of testimony, the explicit language of Rule 5-608, allowing for a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for testimony on direct examination, and Rule 5-608\u2019s history, there is no indication that \u201creasonable basis\u201d was to be restricted to the length and manner of acquaintance. In drafting Rule 5-608, the Rules Committee chose a workable compromise which, while allowing for meaningful opinion testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>mony, does not transform trials into a series of separate mini-trials. It is fair to infer from the Rule and its history that the committee felt that a character witness was entitled to some latitude in informing the jury as to the basis for an opinion, so long as that person avoids venturing into the troublesome area of specific instances. Permitting such latitude allows the witness, within reason, to offer something to the jury beyond a bare conclusion that the witness \u201cis a truthful person\u201d or \u201cis not a truthful person.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in restricting Goffs testimony to a description of her acquaintance with Wooldridge and her conclusion that he was a \u201ccompulsive liar.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We now turn to whether the error in excluding portions of Goffs testimony was harmless. Under <em>Dorsey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976), we must determine whether, upon our independent review of the record, we can declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict. The evidence in this case convinces us that the <em>Dorsey </em>standard for harmlessness has been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The excluded testimony was relatively insignificant. Goffs testimony was that \u201c[a] lot of the stories that he told me didn\u2019t add up, saying that\u2014one day he would tell me something that happened on that day and then a couple days later he would tell me something else that had happened on that day that wouldn\u2019t have been able to happen if what he said before was true\u201d and that this happened repeatedly. While, as our discussion above indicates, we do not suggest that this testimony did not provide some further basis to her opinion, given Goffs statement that Wooldridge was a \u201ccompulsive liar,\u201d the defense\u2019s vigorous cross-examination of Wooldridge concerning his arrangement with the State in exchange for his testimony, and the fact that Jensen\u2019s trial occurred over the course of five days, we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that this testimony would not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">At trial, the medical examiner, Dr. Margarita Korell, testified that Pilkington had suffered two stab wounds to his back. One had perforated the chest wall and entered the lower lobe of the left lung and the other had entered the right lobe of the liver. Dr. Korell also testified that Pilkington\u2019s body showed evidence of drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Melissa Gentry, appearing on behalf of the State, testified that several days prior to the murder, she had been in a parking lot with Jensen and Pilkington. She stated that she and Pilkington \u201cwere horsing around and he said fuck you to me.\u201d She testified that Pilkington was \u201cjust joking.\u201d She stated that Jensen \u201cgot mad\u201d and got out of the car in which he was seated and \u201cwanted to fight\u201d Pilkington. Gentry testified that Jensen said that \u201cit was disrespect to a girl. And then he was saying he would kill him.\u201d Jensen tried to get Pilkington out of the car in which he was seated, at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>point Gentry and two others \u201chelped get him back into his car and get him to settle down.\u201d When Gentry returned to the car where Jensen was sitting, he was \u201cstill angry\u201d with Pilkington and \u201cstayed mad\u201d for \u201cabout ten minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">James Teneyck, testifying for the State, stated that on the night of the murder, he accompanied Jensen to McDonald\u2019s. He testified that Jensen had said \u201cthat there was somebody who worked there named Adrian Pilkington and that he wanted to beat him up because he thought Adrian was a punk.\u201d Teneyck further testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1f\">[h]e wanted to make Adrian believe that everything was okay between them, because they had had some arguments previously in the past. And he wanted to make Adrian think that it was okay, and then get Adrian to take he, Jason and Brian and Jean and Rachel somewhere, and they were planning to beat Adrian up and take his car and his weed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">After they entered McDonald\u2019s, Teneyck overheard \u201ca conversation of Jason mending things with Adrian and saying are we cool, and saying don\u2019t worry about it, I don\u2019t have anything against you, and things like that.\u201d Teneyck testified that when they exited McDonald\u2019s, Jensen told Teneyck, \u201cthat stupid mother fucker thinks we\u2019re okay.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7D\">Steven Simmons also testified for the State. He stated that he had been with Jensen on June 17th, and that Jensen had come back from making a phone call and, referring to a man, said he \u201cwas going to kill that mother fucker.\u201d Later that evening, in the parking lot of McDonald\u2019s, Simmons testified that \u201cBrian [Wooldridge], Jean [Nance] and Jason [Jensen] were talking about beating him up for messing with a girl.\u201d Jensen, referring to Pilkington, \u201cwas like, I\u2019ll pulverize him into the concrete.\u201d Simmons also testified that before going into McDonald\u2019s, Jensen said \u201cI\u2019m going to be buddy-buddy with him, so he won\u2019t think anything is up.\u201d Jason went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>inside McDonald\u2019s and said to Pilkington \u201che was sorry about what happened that night in the parking lot. Adrian was like don\u2019t worry about it, you know, it\u2019s over. So they shook hands.\u201d Simmons also testified that \u201cJason had pulled me up to the side and asked me do you want to help me kill him, and I was like no. I said if you all are going to do that you all do that on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">On cross-examination, Simmons conceded that he told Detective Melissa Oland that Wooldridge was the one who threatened to pound Pilkington\u2019s head in the cement, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">Well first Jason [Jensen] was the one that had made the first statement, Brian [Wooldridge] was the one that had followed up on it. So he had, I guess, he had asked them if they were with it. They came up with these little things like beating his face in, chopping him on his head, stomping him, whatnot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Frederick County Police Officer Joseph Chris Carroll testified as to events occurring after Pilkington was thrown from the bridge. He stated that he pulled over a vehicle, later identified as Pilkington\u2019s, at approximately 2:00 a.m.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Jensen was driving the vehicle, and Nance and Rachel Whitman were passengers. Jensen did not produce either a driver\u2019s license or vehicle registration, and falsely identified himself. The officer noticed what appeared to be smears of blood on the outside of the vehicle, on the door frame on the inside of the door, and on the center console area in between the two front seats. He observed a flannel shirt jacket on the driver\u2019s seat back, which, upon closer inspection, was marked with what appeared to be stains of blood or dried blood. When he removed the shirt, the officer observed what appeared to be stains of blood on the driver\u2019s seat back. He recovered a buck knife in a sheath in a white plastic bag from the rear of the vehicle, which he retained. Jensen told the officer that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>run over a dog, used the knife to cut the dog\u2019s throat, -wrapped the carcass in the shirt, and then threw the carcass over a bridge. Jensen told the police that the car belonged to a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">On cross-examination, Carroll testified that Whitman admitted to ownership of the plastic bag containing the knife. Carroll also testified that \u201c[o]n [Jensen\u2019s] right forearm area there was, appeared to be scrapes on his arm there, they appeared fresh, as if they had just stopped bleeding.\u201d Jensen told Officer Carroll that he had received the injuries when shadow boxing with Nance.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The jury was presented with two versions of events occurring that evening. One account was given by Brian Wooldridge, who testified on behalf of the State pursuant to a plea agreement. Jensen\u2019s account of events was introduced at trial via a lengthy statement made to several Frederick County detectives that was placed into evidence by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Wooldridge testified that, after the group left Whitman\u2019s house, Pilkington, following Jensen\u2019s instructions, drove to Virginia and stopped the ear in a dark, rural area. Jensen and Pilkington exited the car and began walking toward a house. They then U-turned and walked back to the car. Wooldridge heard a noise. When Wooldridge exited the car and walked to the back of the car, he saw Pilkington \u201ckind of down on the ground and Jensen standing with a knife.\u201d Pilkington \u201cwas having serious trouble breathing, all you could hear, he was ... he was trying to breathe.\u201d According to Wooldridge, Jensen grabbed Pilkington, pulled him up and stabbed him again. When asked whether Jensen said anything before Jensen stabbed Pilkington, Wooldridge responded, \u201cHe smiled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Wooldridge testified that he tried to help Pilkington, and Jensen asked him \u201cwhat the fuck [he] was doing.\u201d Wooldridge responded that he was going to help Pilkington, to which Jensen responded \u201cno you\u2019re not.\u201d When Wooldridge went to put Pilkington in the car, he \u201cgot shoved into the car\u201d and \u201cthe door was pushed shut\u201d onto his leg. Jensen told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Pilkington \u201cget the fuck in the car and don\u2019t get out.\u201d Jensen had the knife in his hand at the time. Jensen and Nance then dragged Pilkington to the back of the car. When Wooldridge again exited the car and tried to help Pilkington, Jensen came at him with the knife and told him to get in the car or he was going to stab him. Wooldridge got back in the car and saw the trunk go up, felt a weight hit the car, and saw the trunk lid shut. Jensen then drove the car and stopped on a bridge. Jensen and Nance exited the car, and after a moment, Wooldridge exited the car. Jensen and Nance had taken Pilkington out of the car, and Pilkington was laying on the ground barely breathing, making gurgling, choking noises, and slightly moving, \u201cas if he was trying to get up but he couldn\u2019t.\u201d When Jensen realized Wooldridge was outside the car, he told him to \u201cget in the car right now or I\u2019ll stab you and throw you off this bridge with him.\u201d When Wooldridge did not get in the car, Jensen stepped forward with the knife, at which point Wooldridge got in the car. After sitting in the car two to three minutes, Wooldridge heard a splash, shortly after which Jensen and Nance came running around to the car. He also testified that when they were on the bridge, Nance and Jensen were wearing rubber gloves. Jensen then proceeded to drive toward Frederick. Wooldridge testified that the car stopped near a store, at which point \u201cJohn [Nance] and Rachel [Whitman] and Jason [Jensen] were out of the car, they were cleaning off, they took socks off, wiping down the trank, and the car and everything, getting the blood off it, there was blood all over the car.\u201d Wooldridge was told \u201cif you tell anybody what happened I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Later that morning, Jensen called Wooldridge and told him that they had been pulled over by city police who had found the knife and bloody clothes. Jensen told him that \u201cthey were going to ran away\u201d and that they wanted him to come with them. After Wooldridge declined, Jensen told him that \u201cif he told or anything happened\u201d Jensen would kill Wooldridge and anybody that he cared about. Wooldridge also testified that in exchange for his testimony, he was subject to a maximum of 15 years in the Division of Correction for his plea of conspiracy to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>first degree murder. On cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">Q: So you\u2019re saying that ... you had nothing to do with the knifing ... of Adrian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">A: No I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">Q: Okay, then in that case why did you plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">A: I didn\u2019t plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">Q: Okay, explain to me what you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">A: I was told there was a slight chance I could get convicted if I went to trial. I would admit I was scared to take that chance. I didn\u2019t have nothing to do with the killing of my friend. I was taking a chance going to prison for the rest of my life for a crime I didn\u2019t commit, or I could take this deal, plead not guilty, settle for a 15 year cap, possibly, even likely I could do up to 15 years. But in the meantime I will get out. And I can help my friend now seeing I wasn\u2019t brave enough to do it then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">Q: But isn\u2019t it true that you didn\u2019t plead not guilty but you pled to a charge that you felt that the State had enough evidence to prove you guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">A: Yes, conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">In Jensen\u2019s statement, Jensen admitted to stabbing Pilkington one time, but stated that it was accidental and that he acted in self-defense. In his statement to police, Jensen testified that he, Nance, Whitman, and Wooldridge had planned to go \u201ccruising\u201d with Pilkington after Pilkington finished work at McDonald\u2019s. According to Jensen, they drove to Virginia where Pilkington parked on a deserted road and exited the car; he then directed Jensen to exit the car. The others followed. Jensen became concerned when he noticed that everyone had rubber gloves. He stated that he was seared because Wooldridge removed a knife from the trunk of the car, and he thought he was going to be killed. Jensen stated that Wooldridge threw the knife on the ground. Jensen turned back to walk back to the car, when Pilkington picked up the knife, came toward Jensen, and tackled him. Jensen \u201cthought [he] was gonna die\u201d when Pilkington came at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>him with a knife, so he grabbed the knife and just stabbed Pilkington in the shoulder. Jensen testified that he stabbed Pilkington one time, because he was afraid that he would be killed if he did not protect himself. He also stated that \u201cI had no part in trying to rob this dude. I didn\u2019t even know him. And when I stabbed him, it was just straight self defense. I didn\u2019t try to kill nobody, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Gwen Marie Kurtz, Jensen\u2019s girlfriend at the time of the offense, also testified on behalf of the State. Kurtz testified that when she arrived home from work on the morning of June 18th, Jensen and Nance were at her home. Jensen was crying, and told Kurtz that \u201cthey all really screwed, up.\u201d She stated that \u201c[h]e said that him and a couple of friends went out and they ended up killing a guy.... Killing a kid. And then he got traffic tickets. He caught a ride with somebody and h\u00e9 came to my house.\u201d She asked him who it was, and he identified Adrian Pilkington. When asked whether Jensen had ever made comments to her about whether the killing was planned, she responded, \u201cHe said that they had all gotten into a fight. And that when they went back to Rachel\u2019s [Whitman\u2019s] house they figured he and Adrian would stay in the living room and they would go get a knife, they\u2019d take a ride and kill him.\u201d Jensen told her that the knife came from Whitman\u2019s kitchen. She did not know if he had told her whether or not he had actually stabbed Pilkington, but did say that \u201cthey threw him over a bridge into ... the river.\u201d She also testified that Jensen and Nance wanted her to cash her paychecks and go with them to either Chicago or Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">On cross-examination, Kurtz stated that Jensen had told her that Pilkington was trying to kill him, and that Jensen had told her that Wooldridge had a gun. These statements were made to Kurtz not when Jensen was at Kurtz\u2019s house but later, when Jensen was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Bradley Eugene Fritz testified that on June 19, 1996, \u201cJason told me that he did something real, real bad, eventually he broke down and told me that he killed somebody.\u201d He told him that \u201che stabbed the person through the shoulder and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>then through the lungs.\u201d Fritz testified that Jensen \u201cwanted me to come and get him and Jean [Nance] that night and get them to a bus station or when I had time to come get them and get them out of town.\u201d Jensen also asked Fritz for Jensen\u2019s cousin\u2019s number in Arizona. Fritz also testified that Jensen told him \u201cit felt good to kill someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Martin Howard Shepley, an inmate at the Frederick County Detention Center, testified to a conversation he overheard between Jensen and other inmates. He stated, \u201cI remember him telling [another inmate] that he stabbed Adrian and that there was a lot of blood everywhere. And that they should have gotten rid of the car and that they should have covered up their tracks better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Finally, correctional officer Annette Frahm testified that while Jensen was incarcerated, she overheard him talking in a loud voice. She testified that \u201c[Jensen] and another inmate were speaking about playing football and making tackles. Suddenly that conversation turned to Mr. Jensen making tackles and stabbing a person.\u201d She also testified that \u201c[Jensen] specifically said when I was tackling him and stabbed him, he continued to fight, but he would not get up from the stab wound.\u201d At that point Frahm told Jensen that \u201cfor his safety, he should not be talking about his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">To summarize, Jensen admits to stabbing Pilkington once, but claims that this stabbing was done in self-defense. He also claims that he had nothing to do with the second stabbing or with throwing Pilkington over the bridge. The evidence demonstrates that prior to the killing, Jensen was angry with Pilkington, pretended to befriend him, and told several other people that he wanted to either hurt or kill Pilkington. Following the killing, he was pulled over in Pilkington\u2019s blood-covered car and gave a false explanation to the police. Four individuals testified that Jensen told them, or that they overheard him, either revealing the details or bragging about the killing. Several individuals testified as to his plans to flee. Taken as a whole, even without Brian Wooldridge\u2019s testimony, Jensen\u2019s explanation that the first stabbing of Pilkington was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>in self-defense simply flies in the face of the evidence. The error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">BELL, C.J., and ELDRIDGE, J., dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">CHASANOW, J., concurs and dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">.

Accordingly, it, like the Court of Special Appeals, affirms the petitioner\u2019s murder conviction. I agree that the trial court erred. I do not agree that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of Maryland Rule 5-608<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is careful and well reasoned, it takes into account the wording of the rule, its difference from the federal rule, from which it emanated, the history of its promulgation and its relationship to Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Replacement Volume), \u00a7 9-115 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s analysis makes clear that the term, \u201creasonable basis,\u201d as used in Rule 5-608, contemplated something more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>recitation by the character witness of his or her \u201clength and manner of acquaintance\u201d the witness whose testimony is being impeached. It makes a strong case not only for its conclusion that \u201c[i]n drafting Rule 5-608, the Rules Committee chose a workable compromise which, while allowing for meaningful opinion testimony, does not transform trials into a series of separate mini-trials,\u201d 355 Md. at 707-08, 736 A.2d at 315 (1999), but for concluding that this Court, in adopting the rule, intended the character witness to have \u201csome latitude in informing the jury as to the basis for an opinion, so long as that person avoids venturing into the troublesome area of specific instances\u201d of truthfulness or untruthfulness. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">A critical issue in <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 602 A.2d 677 (1992) was harmless error. Unlike this case, evidence had been erroneously admitted, so the inquiry was the effect of its admission on the verdict, while, here, the question is whether its admission would have made a difference. Nevertheless, what I said in dissent in that case is relevant to this case and bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201cFollowing a thorough review of our cases and those of the Supreme Court which addressed the issue, this Court, in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), enunciated the test of harmless error which controls the resolution of this case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u2018 ... When an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict, (footnote omitted)\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\"><em>\u201cId. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. The test focuses on the effect of erroneously admitted, or excluded, evidence on the verdict rendered by the jury. Once it has been determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility, \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cWe also made clear that the test of harmless error is supposed to be strict; indeed, it \u2018 \u201chas been and should be carefully circumscribed.\u201d \u2019 <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 248, 322 A.2d 211, 219 (1974). In that case, quoting <em>People v. Jablonski, </em>38 Mich.App. 33, 195 N.W.2d 777, 780 (1972), we pointed out:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u2018 \u201cContinued expansion of the harmless error rule will merely encourage prosecutors to get such testimony in, since they know that, they have a strong case, such testimony will not be considered to be reversible error, yet if they have a weak case, they will use such testimony to buttress the case to gain a conviction and then hope that the issue is not raised on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">\u201c272 Md. at 248, 322 A.2d at 219.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cWhere the evidence remaining after excluding erroneously admitted evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction, the error can never be harmless. Similarly, if the questioned evidence goes to an important issue in the case, especially if credibility is central to the resolution of the case, the error in admitting that evidence is likewise not harmless. This is the case because it is the trier of fact, in this case, the jury, not an appellate court, that must find the facts and resolve credibility issues. Therefore, what appears, on the cold record, to be an insurmountable case for the State, when viewed from the jury\u2019s perspective, having seen it unfold through live witnesses, in the dramatic atmosphere of the courtroom, may be quite a close case or result in a defense verdict. How, or why, a jury may decide to resolve credibility or fact issues in a particular manner is a matter only it knows. One thing is certain, the jury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>under no obligation to decide any case consistently with what is, objectively, the strongest case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201cNo matter how strong a case for conviction the State may present, even when the defense presents no evidence, the court may not direct a verdict for the State. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-324, which, while providing that a defendant may move for judgment of acquittal, Rule 4-324(a), and the court may direct the entry of judgment in his or her favor if there is insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, Rule 4-324(b), makes no provision for the making of a motion for judgment by the State. Compare Maryland Rule 2-519, the civil counterpart. <em>Lyles v. State [State v. Lyles], </em>308 Md. 129, 135, 517 A.2d 761, 764 (1986). This is so because it is the trier of fact, whether the court or a jury, that must determine if the State has met its burden of proof. To make that determination, the trier of fact is required to find the facts and when, as is usually the case, there are credibility issues, to resolve them. That, in turn, involves weighing the evidence. Appellate courts do not find facts or weigh evidence, \u2018what evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u2019 <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260-61 (1990). <em>See Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 214, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 566, 276 A.2d 214, 221 (1971); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>238 Md. 648, 650, 210 A.2d 722, 723-24 (1965). Even when an appellate court assesses the sufficiency of the evidence, it does not weigh it, <em>see Clemson v. Butler Aviation-Friendship, </em>266 Md. 666, 671, 296 A.2d 419, 422 (1972); <em>Gray v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>245 Md. 80, 84, 224 A.2d 879, 881 (1966), it only determines if any evidence exists, on the basis of which a rational trier of fact could find the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056, 1057 (1986). There is no reason that a harmless error analysis should permit it to do more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">325 Md. at 592-94, 596-97, 602 A.2d at 696-97, 698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">As in <em>Rubin, </em>the majority declares that it can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the excluded testimony would not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Boiled down to its essence, its basis is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">\u201cThe excluded testimony was relatively insignificant. Goffs testimony was that \u2018A lot of the stories that he told me didn\u2019t add up, saying that\u2014one day he would tell me something that happened on that day and then a couple days later he would tell me something else that had happened on that day that wouldn\u2019t have been able to happen if what he said before was true\u2019 and that this happened repeatedly. While we do not suggest that this testimony did not provide some further basis to her opinion, ... given Goffs statement that Wooldridge was a \u2018compulsive liar,\u2019 the defense\u2019s vigorous cross-examination of Wooldridge concerning his arrangement with the State in exchange for his testimony, and the fact that Jensen\u2019s trial occurred over the course of five days, we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that this testimony would not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">355 Md. at 709, 736 A.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">It is, to be sure, undoubtedly true, as the majority also points out that the State\u2019s case is much stronger than the petitioner\u2019s. Indeed, that is to be expected; after all, it is the State that has the burden of proof and all the petitioner has to do is to create a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact. The majority is not the trier of fact, yet it has weighed the evidence\u2014note its characterization of the excluded testimony\u2014and substituted its judgment for that of the jury. When it weighs evidence, an appellate court usurps the function of the jury. In this case, the usurpation of the jury function has occurred after holding that the jury was deprived of relevant evidence favorable to the petitioner, evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>explained the character witness\u2019s reason for testifying that the State\u2019s main witness was a liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Explaining why one calls another a \u201ccompulsive liar\u201d is, to my mind, quite important and, in this case, may have been, and most likely would have been, viewed by the jury as more than \u201crelatively insignificant.\u201d To call a person a \u201ccompulsive liar\u201d is but to state a conclusion; telling the jury what you mean by compulsive liar or why you have drawn that conclusion is more persuasive and, to a trier of fact, has more value in the decision-making process. In any event, whether that explanation was important or not, or its effect on the jury, is a matter that the jury should have been allowed to determine in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The majority concludes its opinion with the following statement: \u201cTaken as a whole, even without Brian Wooldridge\u2019s testimony, Jensen\u2019s explanation that the first stabbing of Pilkington was in self defense simply flies in the face of the evidence.\u201d 355 Md. at 716-17, 736 A.2d at 320. From this, it appears that, like the <em>Rubin </em>majority, the majority is also construing the <em>Dorsey </em>test as permitting harmless error to be determined on an \u201cotherwise sufficient\u201d basis: if the evidence is sufficient without the improper evidence, <em>ie., </em>the jury could have convicted the defendant without it, so harm could not have resulted. <em>See Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 674, 350 A.2d 680, 686-7 (1976). In any event, whether intended or not, there is a real danger that it will be so construed in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The application of the <em>Dorsey </em>test in this case is nothing more than unwarranted expansion of the harmless error rule. As I have said on a number of prior occasions, that is something that should not be condoned by this Court. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Judge ELDRIDGE joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\">. At issue in this case is the limitation on character witnesses contained in section (a)(3)(B) of the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">\"On direct examination, a character witness may give a reasonable basis for testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness, but may not testify to specific instances of truthfulness or untruthfulness by the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-12\">. Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Replacement Volume), \u00a7 9-115 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">\"Where character evidence is otherwise relevant to the proceeding, no person offered as a character witness who has an adequate basis for forming an opinion as to another person's character shall hereafter be excluded from giving evidence based on personal opinion to prove character, either in person or by deposition, in any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, in any court or before any judge, or jury of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b756-9\">CHASANOW, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AErN\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">I concur with the majority that Jason Jensen\u2019s convictions should be affirmed, but I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sion that the trial judge abused his discretion in restricting the testimony of a character witness who stated that a material state\u2019s witness was a \u201ccompulsive liar.\u201d Although a qualified witness may testify to another witness\u2019s bad reputation or character for truthfulness, the witness should not be permitted to add an indication of a psychological defect such as \u201cpathological\u201d or \u201ccompulsive.\u201d If, as in the instant case, the character witness blurts out an improper character trait, the witness should not be permitted to explain how the improperly expressed opinion was arrived at.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Since the trier of fact has only a brief opportunity to observe a witness and little basis for making critical judgments about a witness\u2019s veracity, we allow impeachment of a witness by evidence of the witness\u2019s character or reputation for untruthfulness, but we try to do so in a manner that minimizes the inflammatory nature of this evidence. One way we limit this character for untruthfulness testimony is by circumscribing the character trait. We do not allow veracity character impeachment by testimony that the witness is immoral or corrupt; we limit the character impeachment to \u201cuntruthfulness.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5\u2014608(a)(1), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">\u201cIn order to attack the credibility of a witness, a character witness may testify (A) that the witness has a reputation for untruthfulness, or (B) that, in the character witness\u2019s opinion, the witness is an untruthful person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-7\"><em>See also </em>1 John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 43, at 157 (4 th ed.1992), noting that the relevant character trait is limited to bad character for truth and veracity. There is an obvious difference between an untruthful person and a person who has an uncontrollable compulsion to lie. Wester\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 468 (1986) defines \u201ccompulsive\u201d as \u201chaving power to compel ... exercising or applying compulsion ... produced or caused by compulsion ... of, having to do with, caused by, or suggestive of psychological compulsion or obsession.\u201d When the character witness went beyond the permissible testimony concerning truthfulness and added the inference of an irresistible or uncontrollable need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>lie, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to allow the witness to express a basis for this improperly volunteered opinion. <em>Cf. Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993). Having volunteered an improper opinion bordering on a psychological diagnosis, the witness should not be permitted to reinforce her testimony by expressing how she arrived at the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In addition to the trial judge being entitled to restrict testimony about the basis for an improperly expressed opinion, the majority seems to fail to recognize a vital distinction in the application of Md. Rule 5-608(a)(3)(B). It is quite clear that the rule is intended to allow the character witness to express the reasonable basis for arriving at an opinion, not the reasonable basis for the opinion arrived at. The relevant provision of Md. Rule 5-608 is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201c(3) Limitations on character witness\u2019s testimony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">(B) On direct examination, a character witness may give a reasonable basis for testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness, but may not testify to specific instances of truthfulness or untruthfulness by the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Professor McLain, one of the Reporters for the Evidence Subcommittee that drafted the evidence rules, explains the rule in her book Maryland Rules of Evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">\u201cThe second sentence of subsection (a)(3) provides that, on direct examination, a character witness may give a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for testimony as to (1) the reputation for truthfulness of, or (2) the character witness\u2019s opinion as to the truthfulness of, the principal witness. But the Rule goes on to adopt the substance of Fed.R.Evid. 608(b)(2)\u2014 that specific instances of conduct by the principal witness may be inquired into <em>on cross-examination </em>of the character witness\u2014as a limitation on direct examination. The Rule overrules <em>Hemingway v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 127, 543 A.2d 879 (1988), insofar as that decision permitted (indeed, required) a character witness to state on direct the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>acts of the other witness that had led the character witness to form his or her opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">A \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for reputation testimony under the Rule, therefore, would be that the character witness and the other witness have both been members of a particular community for a certain period of time, and that the character witness had heard of the other witness\u2019s reputation there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">Similarly, a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for opinion testimony would be how long and under what circumstances the character witness knows the other witness, <em>e.g., </em>they have worked side by side on the assembly line for ten years and they eat lunch together every workday. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 608, Advisory Committee\u2019s note (\u2018[Tjestimony of specific instances is not generally permissible on the direct examination of an ordinary opinion witness to character. * * * Opinion testimony on direct ... ought in general to correspond to reputation testimony as now given, <em>ie., </em>be confined to the nature and extent of observation and acquaintance upon which the opinion is based.\u2019); 3 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 608[03] at 608-24 and \u00b6 608[04] at 608-27 (1993).\u201d (Citations omitted)(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Lynn McLain, Maryland Rules of Evidence \u00a7 2.608.4, at 149 (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In order for a character witness to testify about the untruthful character or bad reputation for truthfulness of another witness, the character witness should establish a basis of knowledge. This is a predicate to the admissibility of the reputation or character for truthfulness and this is what Md. Rule 5-608(a)(3)(B) refers to when it allows the \u201creasonable basis for testimony as to reputation or an opinion as to the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness .... \u201d This permissible testimony concerns how long and under what circumstances the character witness knew the primary witness, or how often and under what circumstances the character witness discussed the reputation of the primary witness. This permissible testimony about the basis of knowledge for the opinion or reputation of untruthfulness is far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>different from testimony concerning specific instances of untruthfulness that is prohibited by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In the instant case, the testimony at issue was that \u201c[a] lot of the stories that he told me didn\u2019t add up\u201d and \u201cone day he would tell me something that happened on that day and then a couple days later he would tell me something [absolutely inconsistent with the first version].\u201d This testimony is far more analogous to the prohibited specific acts of untruthfulness than to the permissible basis for knowledge of the witness\u2019s character.
