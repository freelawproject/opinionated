Yol.), Article 27, \u00a7 151A, which punishes the transmittal of false statements or rumors about the location or detonation of a bomb or explosive.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The evidence at Moosavi\u2019s trial in the Circuit Court for Frederick County disclosed the following facts. Moosavi, a retired elementary school teacher, had a credit card account with Chevy Chase Bank. Moosavi disputed a charge on his credit card for $30 membership dues to Columbia House Video. Evidently, he paid $30 for a three year membership in Columbia House Video, but the club canceled his membership after only three months. He wrote a letter to the bank dated July 14, 1995, detailing his dispute. Apparently, when he heard nothing from the bank, he contacted someone at the bank. Next, in an August 3, 1995, letter to Moosavi, the Chevy Chase Bank charge back department claimed that it did not receive his July 14th letter. Moosavi was told that he would have to write another letter, which he did, dated August 28,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Moosavi also telephoned the bank in regard to the disputed charge. He called the bank three times on August 30, 1995. When the customer service representative told Moosavi that he would have to send a detailed letter in order to have his disputed charge resolved, he refused and then asked to speak to a supervisor. He was transferred to Rona Bowers, the supervisor of the credit card division. Bowers testified that Moosavi was \u201cirate\u201d and \u201cvery angry\u201d about the \u201cprocedure that the customer service representative told him he needed to follow in order to have a dispute resolved from his Chevy Chase account.\u201d Bowers further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201cA. He just started stating that he\u2014he kept insisting that he wanted the charges taken off of his account. I explained to him in order for that to happen\u2014I repeated myself\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">Q. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">A. In order for that to happen, you must submit the documents. He began\u2014he was very angry and somewhere in the conversation, that\u2019s when he began to state that he would blow up Chevy Chase Bank if we didn\u2019t do what he wanted him to\u2014what he wanted done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Q. Okay. Did he tell you where he was going to blow up the bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">A. He asked\u2014he stated, I\u2019m going to blow up the bank. Well, I\u2019m going to blow up Chevy Chase Bank. Where are you? In Frederick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">Q. And then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">A. And I asked him, well when would you blow up the bank? And he said probably on a Sunday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Bowers then contacted the Chevy Chase Bank security department and informed someone in the department of Moosavi\u2019s statement. Moosavi denied ever making the statement to Bowers about blowing up the bank. The Chevy Chase Bank building in Frederick, Maryland, was not bombed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Theresa Martinez Rivera testified that Moosavi came into her office without an appointment sometime in mid-October 1995. She advised Moosavi, who was not then represented by an attorney, that he needed a defense attorney and that he should not discuss the matter with her because she was a prosecutor. Despite her repeated efforts to discourage Moosavi from speaking with her about the matter, she said that \u201che just kept telling me, you know, it\u2019s the bank\u2019s fault because he\u2014there was a discrepancy in their account, and that he was\u2014the reason why he called in the bomb threat was because he was very\u2014he was very angry with the bank.\u201d The administrative assistant in the State\u2019s Attorneys Office, Ginger Fogle, was present during the conversation between Moosavi and Rivera and stated that she heard Moosavi say \u201cwell, it\u2019s just all a big mistake, I didn\u2019t mean what I said, I didn\u2019t mean it when I said I was going to blow the building up, I was just mad.\u201d Moosavi denied ever making these statements to Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Moosavi was charged under Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL), Article 27, \u00a7 151A, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">\u201c151A. False statement or rumor as to bomb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-12\">A person is guilty of a misdemeanor if, knowing the statement or rumor to be false, he circulates or transmits to another or others, with intent that it be acted upon, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>statement or rumor, written, printed, or by word of mouth, concerning the location or possible detonation of a bomb or other explosive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">A jury trial was held on October 21 and 22,1996, in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s evidence, Moosavi, by his counsel, made a motion for judgment of acquittal. He argued that the alleged criminal statement was not covered by \u00a7 151A. Instead, Moosavi asserted that if this statement was punishable at all, it was more appropriately covered by Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 9, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\u201c \u00a7 9. Threats of Arson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A person may not threaten either verbally or in writing to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">(1) Set fire to or burn a structure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">(2) Explode a destructive explosive device ... in, on, or under a structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">In support of his motion, Moosavi\u2019s attorney argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACZ\">\u201c151A is\u2014a person is guilty of a misdemeanor if, knowing the statement or rumor to be false, he circulates it, or transmits to another, or others, with the intent that it be acted upon. A statement, or rumor, written, printed, or by word of mouth concerning the location or possible detonation of a bomb or other explosive. It\u2019s very precise. If my client did threaten to explode a device, he\u2019d be subject by [\u00a7 9], which makes it very clear\u2014a person may not threaten either verbally, or in writing, to explode an\u2014a destructive explosive device.... That\u2019s the matter that we have according to the State\u2019s case. But 151A makes it\u2014a part of this is that knowing the statement or rumor to be false, circulating that, transmitting that____ There has been no evidence whatsoever that this was knowingly false\u2014knowing at the time that it was made that it was knowingly false. And that\u2019s part of this case. That\u2019s part of this charge. That\u2019s part of this offense.... And that\u2019s unmistakably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>part of 151A. It\u2014it fits very well within [\u00a7 9], but he\u2019s not charged with that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The circuit court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence in the case, Moosavi again made a motion for judgment of acquittal, asserting that the evidence was insufficient to convict him under \u00a7 151A. He renewed the argument that the alleged offense, making a threat to explode a bomb, is more appropriately covered by \u00a7 9 than by \u00a7 151A. The court again denied the motion for judgment of acquittal. The jury found Moosavi guilty of making a false statement as to a bomb. The court sentenced him to thirty days in jail, suspended the sentence, and imposed two years of unsupervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Moosavi appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals. He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the guilty verdict because \u201c[u]nder \u00a7 151A, the specific intent to have the threat acted upon is a required element of the crime.\u201d (Moosavi\u2019s brief in the Court of Special Appeals at 6). Moosavi contended that this intent requirement \u201cis obviously included in the statute to prevent spontaneous, obviously idle statements such as the one alleged in the instant case from being charged as serious bomb threats.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Moosavi\u2019s conviction, holding that the evidence of intent was sufficient. <em>Moosavi v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 683, 703 A.2d 1302 (1998). Despite its own misgivings about the evidence with regard to intent, the Court of Special Appeals held that it would not interfere with the \u201cexclusive prerogative of the fact finders\u201d to \u201cpermissibly\u201d infer that Moosavi \u201cmeant to do exactly what he said he was going to do.\u201d 118 Md.App. at 688, 691, 695, 703 A.2d at 1305, 1306, 1308.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals stated that, for another reason, it would have found the evidence to be legally insufficient with respect to the crime charged under \u00a7 151A had Moosavi raised the issue on appeal. The appellate court explained (118 Md.App. at 700, 703 A.2d at 1310):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\u201c151A was not even of the type of offense arguably perpetrated by the appellant. There was no false statement or rumor already in existence that he knew to be false and that he circulated to others with the intent that the Chevy Chase Bank, for instance, be evacuated. That is the type of thing that is meant by \u00a7 151A\u2019s \u2018with the intent that [the false rumor] be acted upon.\u2019 The evidence simply did not fit the crime charged (\u00a7 151A) and, therefore, was legally insufficient to support the conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the \u201cgravamen of \u00a7 151A is the passing on or the transmitting of a false report or a false rumor with respect to the existing location and/or the possible detonation of an existing bomb.\u201d 118 Md.App. at 697-698, 703 A.2d at 1309. The appellate court stated that clearly \u201c\u00a7 151A does not involve the actual making of a threat by the would-be perpetrator to explode a bomb at some future time.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, the purpose of \u00a7 151A, according to the Court of Special Appeals, is to target</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201cthe malicious prankster who perpetrates expensive and disruptive hoaxes in the form of bomb scares. The social harm, in addition to the very real fear engendered, is the hundreds and thousands of man hours that are lost as schools, office buildings, and courthouses are evacuated, with hundreds of employees forced to stand idly on the street while the Bomb Squad scans a building in vain.\u201d 118 Md.App. at 698, 703 A.2d at 1309-1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In contrast, the Court of Special Appeals stated that \u00a7 9 punishes threats whether or not \u201cthe maker of the threat actually intended to carry out the threat or made a false threat without the remotest intention of carrying it out. It is the making of the threat itself, whether it be true or false, that is the gravamen of the offense.\u201d 118 Md.App. at 697, 703 A.2d at 1309. The court indicated that the evidence in this case may have supported a conviction under \u00a7 9. The intermediate appellate court, however, ruled that Moosavi waived this argument because he did not raise the issue in his appellate brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Moosavi filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which this Court granted. <em>Moosavi v. State, </em>349 Md. 237, 707 A.2d 1330 (1998). The questions presented in his petition were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201cI. Has Petitioner been denied meaningful appellate review by the refusal of the Court of Special Appeals to reverse a conviction for which it found the evidence to be insufficient but held that the issue was not preserved when, in fact, it was preserved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u201cII. Is the evidence insufficient to convict Petitioner?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">At every stage of this case, Moosavi has argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish a violation of \u00a7 151A. In the trial court, Moosavi broadly argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was insufficient evidence to show that he knowingly made a false statement concerning the location or possible detonation of a bomb or other explosive, and that, if his statement was punishable at all, it was punishable as a threat to explode a structure under \u00a7 9. On appeal, however, he did not contend that \u00a7 151A was inapplicable to the type of conduct in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>he engaged. Instead, Moosavi made the more narrow argument that the evidence was insufficient because it failed to show that he intended for his statement to be acted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The Court of Special Appeals correctly observed that these are two different sufficiency arguments. Each focuses upon different elements of the statute. The first argument is that \u00a7 151A does not embrace the type of conduct here involved. It concerns the basic statutory requirements that one circulate or transmit a \u201cstatement or rumor,\u201d knowing it to be false, \u201cconcerning the location or possible detonation of a bomb or other explosive.\u201d The second argument, made by Moosavi on appeal, is much more narrow and concerns the statutory requirement that the defendant have the \u201cintent that [the statement] be acted upon.... \u201d The first argument met the general preservation requirement set forth in Maryland Rule 8-131(a) because Moosavi clearly raised the issue in the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, as pointed out by the Court of Special Appeals, Moosavi failed to raise the first argument in his Court of Special Appeals\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">As recently pointed out by Judge Wilner for this Court in <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 56, 729 A.2d 354, 374 (1999), \u201cif a point germane to the appeal is not adequately raised in a party\u2019s brief, the [appellate] court may, and ordinarily should, decline to address it.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 375, 597 A.2d 432, 447 (1991) (the Court of Special Appeals, in its \u201cdiscretion,\u201d need not have \u201cconsidered the arguments\u201d which where not made in the appellant\u2019s brief); <em>Health Serv. Cost Rev. v. Lutheran Hosp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>298 Md. 651, 664, 472 A.2d 55, 61 (1984) (\u201ca question not presented or argued in an appellant\u2019s brief is ... not properly preserved for review\u201d). Nonetheless, in a case where arguments are not made in an appellant\u2019s brief, the \u201cCourt of Special Appeals ... could have, in its discretion, considered the arguments,\u201d <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, supra, </em>324 Md. at 375, 597 A.2d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">When an appellate court does exercise its discretion to address and consider an argument which was not made in the appellant\u2019s brief, and when the appellate court resolves that issue in the appellant\u2019s favor, it is ordinarily inappropriate for the appellate court then to refuse to give the appellant the benefit of its ruling because of the failure to preserve the issue. <em>See DiPino v. Davis, supra, </em>354 Md. at 57, 729 A.2d at 375 (\u201cTo affirm that judgment after finding that it had no legal basis was inappropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In the case at bar, the Court of Special Appeals exercised its discretion to consider and rule upon an argument which Moosavi had advanced at trial but had failed to make in his appellate brief. Under the circumstances, the Court of Special Appeals should not have refused to give Moosavi the benefit of its ruling on the ground that the issue was not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">There are additional reasons why we shall consider the broad issue of whether Moosavi\u2019s conduct, as show n by the evidence in the case, falls within the prohibition of \u00a7 151A. As Judge J. Dudley Digges pointed out for the Court in <em>Squire v. State, </em>280 Md. 132, 134-135, 368 A.2d 1019, 1020 (1977), the Court of Special Appeals and this Court each have \u201cindependent discretion\u201d to excuse the failure of a party to preserve an issue for appellate review. Two different circumstances, both present in the case at bar, warrant this Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to rule upon the applicability of \u00a7 151A to Moosavi\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">First, if \u00a7 151A is clearly inapplicable to Moosavi\u2019s conduct, and if the only reason for not reversing his conviction is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>failure of appellate counsel to raise the issue in the Court of Special Appeals, under the circumstances of this case Moosavi would be entitled to relief in an appropriate post conviction proceeding collaterally attacking his conviction. In light of this, fairness and interests of judicial economy justify granting relief on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 211, 362 A.2d 629, 637 (1976), where Chief Judge Murphy for the Court pointed out that, although the trial court\u2019s errors were not preserved for appellate review, since the \u201cerrors were subject to collateral attack under [the Post Conviction Procedure Act] in any event,\u201d the appellate court was justified \u201cto recognize them on its own motion____\u201d <em>See, e.g., Franklin v. State, </em>319 Md. 116, 122, 571 A.2d 1208, 1210-1211 (1990); <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985) (\u201cbecause the defendant would be entitled to post conviction relief ... although [the error was] not objected to at trial, interests of expedition and judicial economy support review of the [alleged error] on direct appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Second, where a defendant has been charged and convicted under an entirely inapplicable statute, but has not raised the issue on appeal, this Court has reviewed the issue on the theory that the resulting sentence under the inapplicable statute is an illegal sentence which may be challenged at any time. In <em>Campbell v. State, </em>325 Md. 488, 601 A.2d 667 (1992), the Court considered the issue of whether the defendant Campbell had been charged under the wrong statute even though the issue had never previously been raised. Judge Bell for the Court explained (325 Md. at 508-509, 601 A.2d at 677):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201cThe paraphernalia counts, charging possession of \u2018numerous smoking pipes, adapted for administration of controlled dangerous substance under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use for purpose of illegally administering controlled dangerous substance ...,\u2019 were brought pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 287(d). Although the petitioner does not raise the issue, it is quite obvious that \u00a7 287(d) does not apply and, so, as to the count of which he was convicted, the petitioner received an illegal sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Illegal sentences may be challenged at any time, even on appeal. Rule 4-345(a); <em>Matthews v. State, </em>304 Md. 281, 288, 498 A.2d 655, 658 (1985), citing to <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201cSection 287(d)(1) defines \u2018controlled paraphernalia\u2019 as it pertains to its use, rather than its packaging <em>(see </em>subsection (d)(2)) or its preparation <em>(see </em>subsection (d)(3)), as \u2018[a] hypodermic syringe, needle or other instrument or implement or combination thereof adapted for the administration of controlled dangerous substances by hypodermic injections .... \u2019 The \u2018numerous smoking pipes\u2019 referred to in the paraphernalia counts simply do not come within that definition. The petitioner should have been charged under Article 27, \u00a7 287A(a), which defines \u2018drug paraphernalia\u2019 as: \u2018all equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use, or designed for use, in ... ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled dangerous substance</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">For all of the above-discussed reasons, we shall address the broad issue of whether Moosavi\u2019s conduct was encompassed by Art. 27, \u00a7 151A.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Like the Court of Special Appeals, we conclude that Moosavi was charged and convicted under the wrong statute. The plain statutory language and legislative history of Art. 27, \u00a7 151A, and Art. 27, \u00a7 9, demonstrate that \u00a7 151A does not encompass Moosavi\u2019s conduct, and that he should have been charged, if at all, under \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The crux of the offense under \u00a7 151A is the transmittal or circulation of a statement or rumor, knowing the statement or rumor to be false, and intending that it be acted upon, \u201cconcerning the location or possible detonation of a bomb or other explosive.\u201d The statute, by its plain language, is aimed at those telephoning, mailing, or otherwise transmitting <em>false </em>bomb scare <em>rumors </em>or <em>statements, </em>intending to create havoc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>by, for example, having buildings evacuated and police bomb squads summonsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Section 9, on the other hand, provides that \u201ca person may not <em>threaten </em>... to: (1) Set fire to or burn a structure; or (2) Explode a destructive explosive device ... in, on, or under a structure.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Section 9 is obviously the statute aimed at persons who threaten to blow up buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">As a matter of plain English, there is a distinction between a statement that \u201cthere is a bomb in the building\u201d and a statement, such as Moosavi\u2019s, that \u201cI\u2019m going to blow up the [building].\u201d The latter falls within the purview of \u00a7 9\u2019s prohibition of threats to \u201c[e]xplode a destructive explosive device ____\u201d That Moosavi was charged with \u00a7 151A ignores the clear difference between the commonly understood meaning of the words \u201cfalse statement or rumor\u201d and the plain meaning of the word \u201cthreat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The term \u201cfalse statement\u201d encompasses statements which are \u201cknowingly false,\u201d and made \u201cwith purpose to mislead or deceive.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 602 (6th ed.1990). A \u201crumor\u201d is a \u201cstory passing from one person to another without any known authority for the truth of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333. In contrast, a \u201cthreat\u201d is a \u201ccommunicated intent to inflict\u201d harm. <em>Id. </em>at 1480. It defies common sense to view \u201cfalse statements\u201d and \u201crumors\u201d as synonyms of \u201cthreats.\u201d An individual may truthfully threaten to explode a bomb in a building without making a false statement. Similarly, one may transmit a false statement or rumor that there is a bomb in a building without ever threatening, or communicating an intent, to explode a bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Section 151A punishes the making of particular statements because they are false and extremely disruptive. Section 9 does not look to the truth or falsity of the statement; rather, it punishes statements which constitute communicated intentions to do harm. The statement by Moosavi that \u201cI\u2019m going to blow up the bank\u201d is not a \u201cfalse statement or rumor.\u201d It distorts the language and purpose of \u00a7 151A and \u00a7 9 to view it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>as such. If anything, his statement suggests an intention or desire to inflict harm, <em>i. e., </em>a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In addition to the statutes\u2019 plain language, the legislative history indicates that \u00a7 151A is inapplicable to Moosavi\u2019s statement. There is no suggestion in the legislative history of \u00a7 151A and \u00a7 9 that the General Assembly intended bomb threats to be punishable under \u00a7 151A. When \u00a7 151A was first enacted by Ch. 395 of the Acts of 1963, the Title indicated that the purpose was to punish \u201cFalse Statements\u201d knowingly made concerning the location of a bomb or explosive. In contrast, \u00a7 9 was introduced to address an increasing number of arson threats. What is now \u00a7 9 was first enacted by Ch. 494 of the Acts of 1989.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s bill file on Ch. 494 discloses that the Maryland Chiefs of Police Association, the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland Sheriffs\u2019 Association had urged the General Assembly to enact \u00a7 9 because they often found that, in the investigation of arson, \u201cthe crime of arson was committed after the occupants of the house were <em>threatened </em>with having their house burned down.\u201d (Emphasis added). Ch. 494 of the Acts of 1989, when it was first introduced as Senate Bill 645, did not initially include a provision relating to bomb threats. During the course of passage, the bill was amended to include threats to \u201c[e]xplode a destructive explosive device ... in, on, or under a structure.\u201d The General Assembly intended specifically to prohibit threats of bombing as well as threats of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In 1991, both \u00a7 151A and \u00a7 9 were amended by a single enactment in order to enhance the penalties. Ch. 166 of the Acts of 1991. The bill file on Ch. 166 indicates that the amendments were a response to complaints from the Maryland Association of Boards of Education and others about the rash of bomb scares in the schools. In the 1990-1991 school year, for example, the Washington County public schools received 23 false bomb scares resulting in lost instructional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>time for students, lost wages, and police investigations. When Ch. 166 was first introduced as House Bill 239, it would have enhanced only the penalties of \u00a7 9. The Legislature, however, realizing that false bomb scares are more appropriately within the coverage of \u00a7 151A, added amendments to the penalty provisions of \u00a7 151A as well. The Title of House Bill 239, when it was first introduced and related only to \u00a7 9, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cAN ACT concerning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asb\">Bomb Threats and Arson Threats</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">FOR the purpose of establishing an additional penalty for certain bomb and arson threats; and generally relating to penalties for bomb and arson threats.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The amended Title of House Bill 239, after it was amended to enhance the penalties under \u00a7 151A as well, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aki\">\u201cAN ACT concerning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Bomb Threats and Arson Threats <em>and False Statements Regarding Bombs\u2014Penalties</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">FOR the purpose of establishing an additional penalty for certain bomb and arson threats; <em>increasing the fine for certain false statements or rumors regarding bombs; </em>and generally relating to penalties for bomb and arson threats, <em>and certain false statements or rumors regarding bombs.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">The above-reviewed legislative history shows that the General Assembly was well aware of the difference between making a bomb threat and making a false statement about the location of a bomb. The former was encompassed by \u00a7 9 and the latter by \u00a7 151A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>In the case at bar, the State charged Moosavi under the wrong statute.

Although we generally agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of Art. 27, \u00a7 151A, in one respect we disagree with the intermediate appellate court's view of the statute. Some language in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion reflects the court\u2019s belief that, under \u00a7 151A, the prohibited false statement or rumor must be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>preexisting statement or rumor, originating with a person other than the accused. <em>See Moosavi v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 683, 700, 703 A.2d 1302, 1310 (1998) (\u201cThere was no false statement or rumor already in existence that he [Moosavi] knew to be false ...\"). Neither the language of the s\u00edatme nor its legislative history support the view that the false statement or rumor must be preexisting or must originate with someone other than the accused. Instead, the false statement or rumor may come into existence when the accused first transmits it to another.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b701-7\">RODOWSKY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">I join in Parts 1 and II of the Court\u2019s opinion. I write separately, however, because I respectfully disagree with the holding in Part III. In my opinion Article 27, \u00a7 9 is not the exclusive statute under which Moosavi could properly be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">The words of Article 27, \u00a7 iolA embrace Moosavi\u2019s conduct. Focusing on the words of the statute that are relevant to the State\u2019s theory of the case and stripping the statute of language that describes other ways in which the crime can be committed, \u00a7 151A reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">\u201cA person is guilty of a misdemeanor if, knowing the statement ... to be false, he ... transmits to another ... with intent that it be acted upon, a statement ... concerning the ... possible detonation of a bomb.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Moosavi certainly made a statement concerning the possible detonation of a bomb. A statement is \u201c1: the act or process of stating, reciting, or presenting orally or on paper\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u201c[2]b: a single declaration or remark.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2229 (1976). Under the evidence most favorable to the State, Moosavi\u2019s statement was knowingly false because he had no intention actually to bomb the Bank. Further, Moosavi intended that the false statement be acted upon. The supervisor of the credit card division of the Bank, Rona Bowers, testified that Moosavi stated to her \u201cthat he would blow up Chevy Chase Bank if we didn\u2019t do ... what he wanted done.\u201d The jury could find that the statement was intended to have the effect of forcing the Bank to credit Moosavi\u2019s account to offset the $30 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The majority concludes that a false statement concerning the detonation of a bomb that is a threat is not embraced within the prohibition of \u00a7 151A because a threat to \u201c[ejxplode a destructive explosive device ... in, on, or under a structure\u201d is expressly prohibited by \u00a7 9. <em>Moosavi, </em>355 Md. at 665, 736 A.2d at 292. The issue before us, however, is not whether Moosavi could have been charged under \u00a7 9, but whether he was properly charged under \u00a7 151A. It does not follow that because one statute makes certain conduct criminal that another statute may not also make the same conduct criminal. Our jurisprudence is replete with illustrations of circumstances where the same conduct can constitute two crimes. <em>See, e.g., Miles v. State, </em>349 Md. 215, 219-21, 707 A.2d 841, 843-45 (1998) (listing cases that address, <em>inter alia, </em>the merger of offenses for sentencing purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">As part of its analysis the majority has construed Article 27, \u00a7 9 from the intent standpoint. The Court says: \u201cSection 9 does not look to the truth or falsity of the statement; rather, it punishes statements which constitute communicated intentions to do harm.\u201d <em>Moosavi, </em>355 Md. at 664, 736 A.2d at 292. Under the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 9, \u00a7 151A, on the facts of this case, simply creates a crime that has at least two elements, falsity of the statement and the intent that it be acted upon, that are in addition to the required elements of \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Further, the legislative history does not, in my view, demonstrate a legislative intent to exclude from the scope of \u00a7 151A a threat to explode a bomb which the maker has no intention of carrying out. Section 151A antedates \u00a7 9 by some twenty-six years, the former having been enacted by Chapter 395 of the Acts of 1963 and the latter by Chapter 494 of the Acts of 1989. Section 151A, since its inception, has addressed false statements about the detonation of a bomb. No provision in \u00a7 151A defines \u201canother or others\u201d to whom the false statement is transmitted as excluding the owner or occupant of the building or other place where a bomb is falsely stated to be detonated. Further, the majority opinion, in footnote 5, rejects the construction by the Court of Special Appeals of \u00a7 151A and concludes, as do I, that \u00a7 151A does not require that the false statement originate with a third person. In other words, the false statement may originate with the maker of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Thus, during the first twenty-six years of its existence, it would seem that the accused-originating scenarios to which \u00a7 151A might apply could fall into two general categories. First, the accused says, in effect, \u201cI am going to detonate a bomb in your building,\u201d without any intent on the part of the accused to do so. Second, the accused says that a third party, either identified or unidentified, plans to detonate a bomb in the building of the person to whom the statement is transmitted and the accused knows that either there is no such third person or that the third person does not intend to do that act. Under the majority\u2019s construction, \u00a7 151A has never applied at any time to the first set of circumstances (\u201cI am going to detonate a bomb in your building\u201d) because that is a threat. I find nothing in the language of \u00a7 I51A that can support excluding that false threat from the false \u201cstatement\u201d referred to in \u00a7 151A. Inasmuch as our jurisprudence is replete with instances in which the same conduct constitutes a crime under two statutes, I find unconvincing the argument that, because the later enacted statute expressly addressed bomb threats, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the earlier enacted statute should be construed as excluding bomb threats.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">There is no legislative history available on the original enactment of \u00a7 151A by Chapter 395 of the Acts of 1963. There is some legislative history available on Chapter 494 of the Acts of 1989, by which what is now \u00a7 9 was first enacted. As the majority points out, \u201cthe Maryland Chiefs of Police Association, the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland Sheriffs\u2019 Association had urged the General Assembly to enact \u00a7 9 because they often found that, in the investigation of arson, \u2018the crime of arson was committed after the occupants of the house were <em>threatened </em>with having their house burned down.\u2019 (Emphasis added).\u201d <em>Moosavi, </em>355 Md. at 665, 736 A.2d at 292. The bill enacting present \u00a7 9 was amended in the course of passage to add a proscription against threats to bomb. The majority infers from the 1989 legislative history that threats to bomb were being addressed for the first time. To me it is equally inferable that threats to bomb were added in 1989 because the police were encountering situations in which threats to burn were actually consummated, and the same could be the situation with respect to threats to bomb, but \u00a7 151A could not be the basis of prosecution where the threat to bomb was a genuine threat that the communicator intended to carry out. It is consistent with the known facts that the purpose of adding threats to bomb to \u00a7 9 was to fill the void created by the fact that it would be a defense to a charge under \u00a7 151A that the accused actually intended to bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">For these reasons I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Judge WILNER has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">. By taking the position that the original intent of \u00a7 151A was to exclude threats from \"statement[s],\u201d the majority seeks, unconvincingly to me, to avoid saying that the later enacted statute partially repealed, as to threats, the earlier enacted statute. That would, of course, violate a cardinal rule of statutory construction \u201cthat repeals not express will not be found unless demanded by irreconcilability or repugnancy.\u201d <em>Harden v.
