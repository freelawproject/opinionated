In so doing, it concluded that \u00a7 69(e) permits it to subscribe to a \u201cbroader and more forward-looking measure of rate reasonableness than can be obtained through an examination and matching of the [telecommunications company\u2019s] rate base, revenues, and expenses.\u201d More particularly, the Commission adopted the view that \u00a7 69(e) obviates the requirement that it set \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d as \u00a7\u00a7 68(a) and 69(a) prescribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Disagreeing with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the inter-relationship among these statutory provisions and alleging that the Commission\u2019s factual determinations were arbitrary and capricious, the Office of People\u2019s Counsel (\u201cPeople\u2019s Counsel\u201d or \u201cOPC\u201d) sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Order in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. Although that court disagreed with the Commission, finding that \u00a7 69(e) did not relieve it of meeting the obligation \u00a7 68(a) imposes, to set \u201cjust and reasonable rates,\u201d it nevertheless affirmed the Commission\u2019s Order. The court concluded that \u201cit does not follow ... that the determination of whether a rate is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 is confined to or dictated by the provisions of Sec. 69(a). That \u2018subsection\u2019 applies to the determination when public service company rates are set by the \u2018traditional method\u2019 outlined in Sec. 69(a). It no more applies to determinations made pursuant to the authority of Sec. 69(e) than to those made pursuant to the authority of Sec. 69(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Factual and Procedural Context</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The Commission has regulated the telecommunication industry in Maryland since 1910. <em>See </em>1910 Maryland Laws, ch. 180, \u00a7 18. Traditionally, the Commission utilized \u201ctest year\u201d data to project the future cost of service and expenses of Bell Atlantic (the former Chesapeake and Potomac (\u201cC &amp; P\u201d) Telephone Company of Maryland) and, ultimately, to set telephone rates. The rates are designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>yield to Bell Atlantic a \u201crevenue requirement\u201d sufficient to pay its prudent expenses and to allow it the opportunity to earn a fair return on investments. <em>See Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 360 n. 2, 329 A.2d 691, 694 n. 2 (1974), in which this Court, citing 1 A.J.G. Priest, Principles of Public Utility Regulation 45 (1969), summarized the determinations that undergird public utility rates, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">\u201cThe orthodox making of public utility rates requires four basic determinations: (1) what are the enterprise\u2019s gross utility revenues under the rate structure examined; (2) what are its operating expenses, including maintenance, depreciation and all taxes, appropriately incurred to produce those gross revenues; (3) what utility property provides the service for which rates are charged and thus represents the base (rate base) on which a return should be earned and (4) what percentage figure (rate of return) should be applied to the rate base in order to establish the return to which investors in the utility enterprise are reasonably entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWS\">Thus, the Commission\u2019s role is to determine what rates the utility should be allowed to charge in future years to cover prudent expenses and earn a reasonable profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The \u201crate-of-return\u201d regulatory scheme is prescribed primarily in two statutes: Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl. Volume, 1997 Cum.Supp.) Article 78, \u00a7\u00a7 68(a) and 69(a). Pursuant to \u00a7 68(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cThe Commission shall have the power to determine just and reasonable rates of public service companies, whether as maximum, minimum or maximum and minimum, respectively. The rates so determined shall be fixed by order to be served upon each public service company affected thereby. This subsection does not apply to small rural electric cooperatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Section 69(a) addresses, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201c[sjtandard for determining rates and charges\u201d and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u201c(a) <em>\u2018Just and reasonable rates\u2019 defined; common carriers </em>excepted.\u2014\u2018Just and reasonable rates\u2019 means rates which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>are not in violation of any of the provisions of the article, which fully consider and are consistent with the public good, and which will result in an operating income to the public service company, except common carriers, yielding, after reasonable deduction for depreciation and other necessary and proper expenses and reserves, a reasonable return upon the fair value of the company\u2019s property used and useful in rendering services to the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In the early 1980\u2019s, the Commission began modifying the regulation of Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates in an effort to allow Bell Atlantic more pricing flexibility, with the intent that Bell Atlantic would have the incentive to operate more efficiently. Subsequently, in the early 1990\u2019s, the Commission began to investigate alternatives to rate-of-return rate-making for Maryland\u2019s regulated telephone companies; however, recognizing that its authority in this area was limited by statute, \u00a7 68(a) requiring the Commission to \u201cdetermine just and reasonable rates of public service companies,\u201d it was unable to adopt certain attractive price plans recommended by Bell Atlantic. In response to requests from the industry and the Commission, the Maryland General Assembly amended the PSC Law in 1995, <em>see </em>1995 Maryland Laws, ch. 140 and 141, by adding \u00a7 69(e) to Article 78. That section, effective June 1, 1995, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">\u201c(e) <em>Regulation of telephone </em>company.\u2014Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of law to the contrary, the Commission may regulate a telephone company by means of alternative forms of regulation, which may include, but not limited to, the use of price regulation, revenue regulation, ranges of authorized return, rate of return, categories of services, or price indexing, if it finds, after notice and hearing that the alternative form of regulation protects consumers by, at a minimum, producing affordable and reasonably priced basic local exchange service, as defined by the Commission, by ensuring the quality, availability, and reliability of telecommunications services through the State; encourages the development of competition; and is in the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Soon after \u00a7 69(e) took effect, four \u201cprice cap\u201d proposals, each offering an alternative method of regulating Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates, were filed with the Commission. Also filed with the Commission were requests to reduce Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates. The first \u201cprice cap\u201d proposal, contained in a \u201cPetition for Implementation of Competition Plus: A True Price Cap Plan for Maryland,\u201d was made by MCI Communications, Inc. (\u201cMCI\u201d.) The MCI proposal was followed a short time later by a petition, filed by the Office of People\u2019s Counsel, to reduce Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates. Subsequently, the Commission, by Order No. 73011, <em>In the Matter of the Inquiry Into Alternative Forms of Regulating Telephone Companies, </em>Case No. 8715, 1995 WL 848271, instituted a formal proceeding to investigate the alternatives for regulating telephone companies permitted by \u00a7 69(e), its newly acquired statutory authority. Bell Atlantic also filed a \u201cPetition for Adoption of a Price Cap Form of Alternative Begulation.\u201d The PSC Staff and People\u2019s Counsel later filed separate price cap proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The Commission\u2019s order, which adopted a procedural schedule and required the parties to develop and file a list of issues, contemplated an investigation that would include \u201cone evidentiary proceeding which will encompass an examination of all alternative regulation proposals ... as well as a review of Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates as necessary to meet the requirements of [section] 69(e).\u201d Also, it made clear that \u201c[a]ll parties should be aware that the Commission envisions that this proceeding will involve something less than a traditional rate case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Following the receipt of written testimony, evidentiary hearings before the full Commission, at which witnesses were cross-examined on their written testimony, and argument by the parties, the Commission issued Order No. 73011, <em>In the Matter of the Inquiry Into Alternative Forms of Regulating Telephone Companies, </em>Case No. 8715, adopting a Price Cap Plan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (hereinafter, the \u201cPrice Cap Order\u201d), to replace the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>rate-of-return regulation. The Commission thus abandoned traditional rate setting under \u00a7 69(a) in favor of a price cap under the new \u00a7 69(e). The order described the plan adopted as an incentive-based price cap regime designed to simulate market competition. Under the plan, the PSC set the initial price for telecommunication services (\u201cgoing-in-rates\u201d), with future price changes being controlled by a formula that takes into account the rate of inflation, the increasing productivity of the Company and costs, such as taxes and regulatory requirements (\u201cexogenous changes\u201d), that are beyond the Company\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The Price Cap Plan the Commission adopted was of its own design, it having found that none of the plans proposed by the parties was acceptable in its entirety. Its Order adopting the plan does not expressly address the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard, but instead adopts a \u201cbroader and more forward-looking measure of rate reasonableness than can be obtained through an examination and matching of the Company\u2019s rate bases, revenue, and expenses.\u201d The Commission set Bell Atlantic\u2019s \u201cgoing in\u201d rates, using its existing rates and ordered a reduction in the \u201caccess rates paid by long-distance carriers to terminate calls on Bell Atlantic\u2019s local network.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Both People\u2019s Counsel and MCI sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. The actions having been consolidated, following a hearing, the court issued an Opinion and Order, affirming the Commission\u2019s Order. The court specifically concluded that, when setting rates pursuant to \u00a7 69(e), the Commission still was required by \u00a7 68(a) to set \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates. People\u2019s Counsel noted its appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before the case was heard by the intermediate appellate court, this Court, on its own motion, issued a Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Before this Court, People\u2019s Counsel argues that, by adopting the Price Cap Order, the Commission (1) improperly interpreted Article 78, \u00a7 69(e) and, as a result, failed to set \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates for the telecommunications industry, as \u00a7 68(a ) requires and (2) acted arbitrarily, thus in violation of the residential telephone customers\u2019 substantive due process rights. People\u2019s Counsel urges the Court to reverse and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings. In addition to determining that the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard of \u00a7 68(a) applies to rates set pursuant to \u00a7 69(e), People\u2019s Counsel asks the Court to require the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">\u201cto explain the term \u2018just and reasonable rates\u2019 as applied to alternative forms of regulation under \u00a7 69(e), and to establish criteria to evaluate rates under that definition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cto explain \u2018affordable and reasonably priced basic local exchange service\u2019 as required by \u00a7 69(e) and develop criteria for its application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201conce all explanations and criteria are in place, to reevaluate whether all rates set in Order No. 73011 are \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 and whether the elements of basic local exchange service are \u2018affordable and reasonably priced\u2019; and \u201cto make adequate findings of fact based on the record, conclusions of law and determinations of the issues based on a reasoned analysis of those finding and conclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Addressing the standard of review of Commission decisions, People\u2019s Counsel contends that the issue this case presents concerns legal, not factual, determinations. Thus, it points out that, when administrative agencies like the Commission determine questions of law, \u201c[ajppellate courts are not bound by the decision of the agency, but may substitute their interpretation of the statute for that of the agency.\u201d Because, People\u2019s Counsel maintains, in this case, the Commission was required only to interpret a statute, this Court is not obligated to give any deference to the Commission\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Predictably, the Commission takes a contrary view, arguing instead that \u201c[a] review of the relevant statutory and case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>clearly demonstrates that \u2018a great deal of discretion is necessarily vested in the Commission in order that it may discharge its important and complex duties,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Public Service Comm\u2019n., </em>52 Md.App. 715, 722, 451 A.2d 945, 949 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>295 Md. 441 (1983)). The Commission also maintains that a significant measure of its discretionary authority includes evaluating and balancing conflicting opinions and recommendations presented during hearings, and using its expert judgment to arrive at reasoned determinations that are statutorily required to be accorded great judicial deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The Legislature has clearly defined the powers of the Commission, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201c \u00a7 1. <em>Jurisdiction and powers of Commission generally.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cThe jurisdiction and powers of the Public Service Commission shall extend to all public service companies, as hereinafter defined, engaged in or operating a utility business in this State.... The powers of the Commission shall be liberally construed; and the Commission shall have the powers specifically conferred by this article and by any other law, and also all implied and incidental powers necessary and proper to carry out effectually the provisions of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Md.Code (1957, 1995 RepLVol.) Art. 78, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The scope of the Court\u2019s review also is expressly defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201c\u00a7 97. <em>Scope of Review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201cEvery final decision, order, rule or regulation of the Commission shall be prima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be (1) in violation of constitutional provisions, or (2) not within the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission, or (3) made upon unlawful procedure, or (4) arbitrary or capricious, or (5) affected by other error of law, or (6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested case after hearing, such order is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Art. 78, \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In addition, this Court has made clear that a decision of the Commission is subject to judicial review, but it will not be disturbed on the basis of a factual question except upon clear and satisfactory evidence that it was unlawful and unreasonable. <em>See Public Service Commission v. Byron, </em>153 Md. 464, 479, 138 A. 404, 410 (1927); <em>West v. United Rys. &amp; Elec. Co., </em>155 Md. 572, 582, 142 A. 870, 873 (1928) (quoting <em>Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pac.

Such a decision is accorded the respect due an informed governmental agency that is aided by a competent and experienced staff. <em>Potomac Edison Co. v. Public Serv.

Questions of law, however, are \u201ccompletely subject to review by the courts,\u201d <em>Cambridge v. Eastern Shore Public Serv.

Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. at 161-62, 501 A.2d at 1315.

At issue in that case was the meaning of \u201cinterested person\u201d as used in the Maryland Prevailing Wage Law, Maryland Code (1957,1979 Repl.Vol.) Art. 100, \u00a7 101(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 290 Md. at 14, 427 A.2d at 981. Considering \u201cthe language of the enactment in its natural and ordinary signification,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, 427 A.2d at 982, this Court held that the Commissioner of Labor and Industry wrongly determined that a labor union council was an \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning of that section. Rejecting the argument that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute was not given proper deference, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cThe Council misunderstands the standard of review. We pay great deference to findings of fact of an administrative agency since it has heard and observed the witnesses. The standard for review of the decision of an administrative agency was stated for the Court by Chief Judge Hammond in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309, 236 A.2d 282 (1967), as \u2018whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the <em>factual </em>conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) This has been repeated in a host of cases since then. <em>See, e.g., Resetar v. State Bd. of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 554, 399 A.2d 225 (1979); <em>Folly Farms I, Inc. v. Trustees, </em>282 Md. 659, 670, 387 A.2d 248 (1978); <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, </em>278 Md. 659, 670, 366 A.2d 369 (1976); and <em>Pemberton v. Montgomery County, </em>275 Md. 363, 367-68, 340 A.2d 240 (1975). Here, however, the review is one of law. It is true that as we stated in <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, </em>283 Md. 677, 685, 393 A.2d 181 (1978), in the matter of statutory construction it is well understood that the view taken of a statute by administrative officials soon after its passage is strong, persuasive influence in determining the judicial construction and should not be disregarded except for the strongest and most urgent reasons. <em>See, e.g., F. &amp; M. Schaefer v. Comptroller, </em>255 Md. 211, 218, 257 A.2d 416 (1969); <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 132-33, 48 A.2d 754 (1946); and <em>John McShain, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>202 Md. 68, 73, 95 A.2d 473 (1953), and cases cited in each. However, as Judge Delaplaine said for the Court in <em>Rogan v. Baltimore &amp; O.R. R., </em>188 Md. 44, 58, 52 A.2d 261 (1947), \u2018(W)here the language is plain and unambiguous, the judicial construction cannot be controlled by extraneous considerations. No custom, however venerable, can nullify the plain meaning and purpose of a statute.\u2019 <em>Schaefer </em>could be cited for the latter proposition because we there held, despite the prior construction by the Comptroller, that his \u2018rule as (t)here sought to be applied (was) an invalid attempt to render taxable that which the General Assembly ha(d) precisely defined as not taxable.\u2019 255 Md. at 219, 257 A.2d 416.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 427 A.2d at 981-82.

Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 49.05 (\u201can agency\u2019s interpretation is not binding on the court, and will not be upheld if it is considered to be clearly erroneous.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">In the instant case, the term, \u201caffordable and reasonably priced local exchange service,\u201d as used in \u00a7 69(e), has never been interpreted, much less consistently applied, for a substantial period of time by the Commission. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s proffered interpretation of \u00a7 69(e) is neither long-standing nor a product of a \u201cprocess of reasoned elaboration.\u201d Therefore, with respect to the interpretation of \u00a7 69(e), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the scope of this Court\u2019s review is essentially plenary, with a primary reliance upon the plain meaning and purpose of the statute. Substantial deference, however, is accorded to the Commission\u2019s factual determinations and to its implementation of the statutory provisions based on those factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The Commission contends that, under \u00a7 69(e), it is not required to apply the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard of sections 68(a) and 69(a) because that standard applies only to a rate-of-retum regulation, not to alternative means of telecommunication regulation, such as a price cap regulatory scheme. The Commission argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cThe Act specifically permits traditional rate base/rate-of-return regulation to be supplanted by alternative modes of regulation. Thus, rate-of-return regulation merely is one of a list of choices. While the alternative forms of regulation must protect consumers, this protection may be achieved within the new regulatory structures authorized by the Act, not by requiring superimposition of old methods which are no longer mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">To be sure, the \u201cold method\u201d of establishing rates that conform to the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard and requirements of sections 68(a) and 69(a) is no longer mandatory when regulation is done by means other than the traditional rate-of-return methodology. This approach, the Commission argues, is not only supported by legislative intent, but is made crystal clear by the Legislature\u2019s use in the first clause of \u00a7 69(e) of the language, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section.\u201d Stated differently, according to the Commission, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 69(e) permits the Commission to disregard the requirements of \u00a7 69(a) because that statute has historically been interpreted to mean that \u201cthe Commission <em>must </em>use a rate-of-return methodology to establish just and reasonable rates.\u201d (emphasis in original). Relying on <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Heintz, </em>69 Md.App. 74, 87, 516 A.2d 599, 606 (1986) for support, the Commission asserts that \u201c[t]he ratemaking provisions of [t]he Public Service Commission Law consistently have been interpreted to link \u2018just and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>reasonable rates\u2019 to a rate-of-return methodology.\u201d Therefore, the Commission reasons, when the rate-of-return methodology is not used or another methodology is used, the applicability of the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard becomes \u201coptional,\u201d rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">People\u2019s Counsel disagrees, contending that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of sections 68(a), 69(a) and 69(e), the relevant statutory provisions, does not conform with the Commission\u2019s previous interpretation of the significance of the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard in telecommunication regulations, the rules of statutory construction or the legislative history of those provisions. People\u2019s Counsel first points to <em>Re Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co., </em>79 Md. PSC 169 (1988), in which the Commission addressed the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard, articulated in \u00a7 68(a), within the context of alternatives to rate-of-return rate-making. There, the Commission opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">\u201cThe concept of just and reasonable rates is the cornerstone of regulation in Maryland and every other jurisdiction of the United States. The phrase \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d appear frequently in The PSC LAW and the laws of many other jurisdictions. Any regulatory methods adopted by this Commission must result in just and reasonable rates in accordance with the provisions of The PSC Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cImportantly, Section 56 ... states that \u2018the Commission shall enforce compliance by the public service companies with all requirements of the law.\u2019 Thus, the general authority of the Commission is broad, but the Commission must make certain that a public service company\u2019s rates and charges adhere to the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 statutory requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Furthermore, People Counsel argues that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statutes is \u201coverly expansive\u201d and renders \u00a7 68(a) nugatory. While People\u2019s Counsel seems to agree with the Commission that the \u00a7 69(a) definition of \u201cjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and reasonable rates\u201d is not directly applicable to alternative forms of regulation adopted under \u00a7 69(e), it maintains that \u00a7 68(a), as an \u201cenabling\u201d provision, requires the Commission to set just and reasonable rates for all public service companies, whenever \u00a7 69(e) is employed to determine rates, whatever the methodology utilized, and to develop a definition for \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d consistent with that methodology. As support, he points out that in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cBG &amp; E places great weight on the introductory phrase in \u00a7 54F(c), \u2018[notwithstanding any other provisions of this article,\u2019 interpreting it to mean that in construing \u00a7 54F we must not look beyond the language of this single section. As we read it, this phrase simply means that the procedure set forth in \u00a7 54F controls within its area of applicability in spite of any apparent conflict with other parts of the Public Service Commission Law. It does not mean that \u00a7 54F must be interpreted in a vacuum, without due consideration of other consistent and complementary portions of the article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap\"><em>Id. </em>at 158, 501 A.2d at 1313.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Section 68(a) and, for that matter, Md.Code (1957, 1995 RephVol.) Art. 78, \u00a7 28(d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> People\u2019s Counsel maintains, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>charge the Commission with the responsibility of ensuring that public service companies only charge rates that are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d Additionally, People\u2019s Counsel argues that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that rates are \u201caffordable and reasonably priced\u201d is not a substitute for finding that rates are just and reasonable under \u00a7 68(a). He reasons: \u201cThe legislative intent, as evidenced by the statutory language and the legislative history, requires the [Commission] to make a finding that consumers have affordable and reasonably priced basic local exchange service <em>and </em>that the rates are just and reasonable under [section] 68(a).\u201d People\u2019s Counsel adds that a failure to find that rates are just and reasonable effectively provides the public with no assurance that the telecommunications company is not \u201cextracting monopoly profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Next, People\u2019s Counsel points to the \u201clegislative history\u201d of \u00a7 69. It maintains that, when the Commission requested in 1994 that Bell Atlantic submit draft legislation to modify \u00a7 69(a) and allow alternative forms of regulation, it clearly articulated its desire that an amendment to \u00a7 69 not repeal the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard. In <em>In re Regulation of Firms, Including Current Telecommunications Providers and Cable Television Firms, Which May Provide Local Exchange and Exchange Access Service In Maryland In Future, </em>85 Md. PSC 187, 1994 WL 810629 (1994), the Commission wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cIn order to eliminate any questions or doubts about the scope of our authority, we favor a simple legislative amendment to Article 78 which makes clear the authority of the Commission to consider alternative to rate base/rate of return methodology in determining just and reasonable rates for any public service company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201c[W]e note that [t]he PSC Law currently sets the very broad policy of enabling the Commission to \u2018determine just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and reasonable rates of public service companies ... \u2019 (Art. 78, Section 68(a)). The purpose of our directive to [Bell Atlantic] to submit draft legislation and our consideration of the same is not to change this broad standard but instead to redefine \u2018just and reasonable rates\u2019 to include something other than rate base/rate of return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 210,1994 WL 810629.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">While the process of statutory construction is straight forward and requires resort only to the words of the statute when the statute is clear and unambiguous, <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v.

State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Under the plain meaning \u00a7 69(e), the Commission is authorized to regulate telephone companies using alternative forms of regulation, <em>\u201cnotwithstanding </em>any provisions of \u00a7 69(a) or <em>any other provision of la,w to the contrary.\u201d </em>Among such alternative forms of regulation is the instant price cap plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 69(a) requires a traditional rate analysis to be made from a specified comparison of costs, rates and profits to determine just and reasonable rates. Indeed, it defines \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d in just those terms. Thus, the criteria enumerated in \u00a7 69(a) to guide evaluation of justness and reasonableness does not apply when the Commission regulates a telephone company by means different from the traditional rate-of-return methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Whether \u00a7 68(a) falls within the category of \u201cany other provision of law to the contrary\u201d is the critical question to be resolved by this Court. The Commission suggests, but does not actually argue, that the requirement of \u00a7 68(a), that \u201c[t]he Commission shall have the power to determine just and reasonable rates of public service companies,\u201d does not apply when the rates are set pursuant to the alternative forms of regulation permitted by the provisions of \u00a7 69(e). This, of course, is not so because \u00a7 68(a) merely requires the Commission to set \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates; it does not prescribe the specific criteria to be used for the determination, and evaluation, of the justness and reasonableness of those rates. As People\u2019s Counsel correctly observes, the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard has been incorporated into the Public Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Commission Laws since the establishment of the Commission in 1910. <em>See </em>1910 Md. Laws, ch. 180, \u00a7 13, entitled \u201cSafe and Adequate Service: Just and Reasonable Charges: Excessive Charges Prohibited.\u201d Section 69(a) with its definition of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d in the context of a rate-of-return analysis was added in 1955. <em>See </em>1955 Md. Laws, ch. 441.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, \u00a7 68(a) stood alone, without \u00a7 69(a), from 1910 to 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Section 69(a) provides the definition of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d that \u00a7 68(a) lacked. That definition, however, is for the traditional mode of telecommunication regulation: rate base/ rate-of-return. It has no applicability to alternative modes of regulation such as price or revenue regulation. The definition of \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d applicable to alternative forms of regulations, that is, what is required to be shown or the result that these alternative forms of regulation are expected to achieve, is prescribed in \u00a7 69(e). That section, as we have seen, provides that the Commission must determine that the alternate form of regulation chosen produce \u201caffordable and reasonably priced basic local exchange service, as defined by the Commission.\u201d \u201cAffordable and reasonably priced basic local exchange service\u201d under \u00a7 69(e) is the equivalent of the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d the Legislature mandated under \u00a7 68(a). Thus, the Legislature has effectively left the definition of \u201caffordable and reasonably priced,\u201d the meaning of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d under a non-rate base regime, to the Commission. Thus, rather than the two concepts being contradictory, they are consistent, if not complementary. Indeed, and in point of fact, they must be presumed to have been intended by the Legislature to be consistent. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, it easily could have so stated, as it did expressly with respect to the inapplicability of \u00a7 69(a) to \u00a7 69(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The concept of just and reasonable rates is the cornerstone of the regulation of public utilities in Maryland. Section 68(a) defines the general powers of the Commission in terms of determining only \u201cjust and reasonable rates of public service companies.\u201d Even the public service companies, under \u00a7 28(d), have an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d to charge the \u201cjust and reasonable rate\u201d determined by the Commission. <em>See Baltimore Gas and Elec. Co., </em>305 Md. at 150, 501 A.2d at 1309. These mandates clearly remain unchanged by the 1995 legislation enacting \u00a7 69(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">People\u2019s Counsel contends that the Commission\u2019s application of \u00a7 69(e) in Order No. 73011 violates the \u201csubstantive due process rights\u201d of Maryland residential customers. People\u2019s Counsel explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cExcessive prices for regulated telecommunication services used by over 97% of Maryland households, and (it is safe to assume every business) clearly has an economic impact. The stated basic premise of [section] 69(e), that the [Commission] is authorized to continue regulating telephone companies using alternative means as long [as] consumers are still protected, is ignored when the [Commission] sets rates that are not subject to the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 standard. Such action is arbitrary and offensive to a legislative policy that demands just, reasonable, affordable and reasonably-priced basic telephone service. <em>Setting inflated rates and unilaterally eliminating an impoHant test designed to protect consumers from excessive rates is not rationally related to the State\u2019s interest in exercising its police powers to protect the public interest, enforce its valid statutes and protect regulated utility consumers.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">(emphasis supplied).

To achieve these goals, the Legislature authorized the Commission to regulate telephone companies \u201cby means of alternative forms of regulation, which may include, but [are] not limited to, the use of price regulation, revenue regulation, ranges of authorized return, rate of return, categories of services, or price indexing.\u201d These alternative forms of regulation must produce \u201caffordable and reasonably priced local exchange service, as defined by the Commission.\u201d There is no question that these alternative forms of regulation are intended to achieve the goals enumerated and that they are, therefore, rationally related to achievement of those objectives.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[Sjetting inflated rates and unilaterally eliminating an important test designed to protect consumers from excessive rates,\u201d as correctly argued by People\u2019s Counsel, clearly are not the means by which the Legislature intended to achieve the stated objectives of \u00a7 69(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">People\u2019s Counsel nevertheless maintains that, in promulgating Order No. 73011, the Commission made arbitrary and irrational decisions in several confusing ways, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the substantive, <em>not </em>procedural, due process rights of Maryland telephone customers. More particularly, as we understand the arguments, it contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">(1) The Commission \u201cinterpreted away\u201d \u00a7 68(a) without informing the public it had done so until the Order was subject to judicial review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">(2) The Commission adopted \u201ca facially inadequate definition of the \u2018affordable and reasonably priced\u2019 standard\u201d in \u00a7 69(e);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">(3) Without any analysis concerning the manner in which that decision was reached, the Commission arbitrarily set \u201cgoing in\u201d rates at levels $100-200 million above the ratio that would have been set under rate of return regulation. Specifically, the People\u2019s Counsel asserts that the Commission failed to explain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">(a) How \u00a7 69(e) and the \u201caffordable and reasonably priced\u201d standard applied; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">(b) Why the rates authorized by the Commission are \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">(4) The Commission deviated from its previous published pronouncements, made during the process of amending \u00a7 69 and the adjustment of Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates when the OPEB amortization was complete, relating to the retention of the \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">None of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">People\u2019s Counsel argues that \u201c[t]o have received substantive due process in this proceeding, Maryland residential telephone customers ... were entitled to notice from the [Commission] of the appropriate administrative standards that would be applied in reaching a decision.\u201d A quasi-judicial administrative process should be totally transparent, it continues, and \u201c[no party] should be required to guess what standards will be applied or what reasoning the [Commission] actually used to reach it final conclusions.\u201d This argument, similar to some of the aforementioned arguments made by People\u2019s Counsel, concerns the Commission\u2019s position that rates determined pursuant to \u00a7 69(e)\u2014by a means different than the traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>rate-of-return analysis\u2014are not required to be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d under either \u00a7 68(a) or \u00a7 69(a). As earlier stated, the rates determined by the Commission using the alternative means of regulation authorized under \u00a7 69(e) are subject to the just and reasonable standard prescribed by \u00a7 68(a), but not \u00a7 69(a). And, in this instant case, the Commission deliberately applied \u00a7 69(e) and, thus, there was yielded, in the judgment of PSC, a \u201cjust and reasonable rate\u201d under \u00a7 68(a), which was not arbitrary. That is the standard that, as we have seen, People\u2019s Counsel maintains is applicable to the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Another argument advanced by People\u2019s Counsel is that, although the Legislature specifically authorized the Commission to define \u201caffordable and reasonably priced local exchange service,\u201d the definition the Commission settled on was arbitrarily determined and applied. In arriving at the definition of the phrase, the Commission reasoned that Bell Atlantic\u2019s current telephone rates met the \u201caffordable and reasonably priced\u201d requirement of 69(e) because: (1) more than 97% of Maryland households currently have telephone service, and (2) existing other-than-competitive (\u201cOTC\u201d) rates are lower than they were in 1985. People\u2019s Counsel disagrees with the Commission\u2019s definition, arguing that (1) there is a difference between \u201caffordability\u201d and \u201creasonably priced,\u201d thus, each term should be defined separately, (2) the number of households with telephone service is not an adequate indicator of affordability, telephones now being a necessity that almost everyone has whether they can afford them or not, and (3) the fact that existing rates are lower in dollar terms than they were in 1985 cannot establish that local exchange is reasonably priced because existing rates have not been adjusted to reflect the changes in Bell Atlantic\u2019s cost of service. In addition, well aware of this Court\u2019s limited review when the Legislature has specifically left a matter to the determination of a governmental agency with expertise, People Counsel points out that it is not arguing for the Commission to adopt its analysis of \u201caffordability\u201d or \u201creasonably priced,\u201d but only that \u201csome rational analysis\u201d be adopted and applied by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>As we see it, however, People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s definitions is, in addition to being based on a disagreement with the definitions themselves, a continuing attempt to infuse factors usually considered in the traditional rate of return analysis of \u00a7 69(a) into the Commission\u2019s newly-adopted price cap regulation under \u00a7 69(e).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In arriving at its definition of \u201caffordability and reasonably priced\u201d the Commission properly exercised its discretion, as authorized by the General Assembly. Its exercise was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. Indeed, contrary to People Counsel\u2019s contention, the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by \u201crational analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cAs previously described, Staff and OPC proposed adjustment to [Bell Atlantic\u2019s] OTC<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> revenue requirement prior to the initiation of (or \u2018going-in\u2019 to) a price cap plan. [Bell Atlantic], conversely, contends that existing OTC rates should be the starting point for the price cap plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u201cWe understand Staffs and OPC assertions that, based on traditional rate base/rate of return ratemaking methodologies, [Bell Atlantic\u2019s] rates should be reduced. However, underlying their assertions is the assumption that the only appropriate tool to measure the reasonableness of [Bell Atlantic] OTC revenue requirement is a RB/ROR approach. We find that [t]he PSC Law does not require us to adopt that assumption. Specifically, we observe that Section 69(e) of the PSC Law leaves to us the definition of \u2018affordable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>reasonably priced basis local exchange service.\u2019 While the reasonableness of OTC service rates certainly could be determined utilizing a RB/ROR approach, it is neither the only nor the best approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">\u201cAfter considering the evidence and arguments presented on this issue, we find that it is reasonable to utilize [Bell Atlantic\u2019s] existing OTC rates, except access rates, as we initiate price cap regulation. In doing so, we find that since so many Maryland households currently have telephone service at existing rate levels (in excess of 97 percent), and since existing OTC rates actually are lower now than they were in 1985, current OTC rates are reasonable. Moreover, since the OTC rates set herein will be in effect for an extended period of time, we find it is reasonable to utilize a broader and more forward-looking measure of rate reasonableness than can be attained through an examination and matching of Company\u2019s rate base, revenues and expenses. Additionally, a broader measure of rate reasonableness also is justified by the competitive incursions into some and eventually all of [Bell Atlantic\u2019s] OTC service offerings that we can expect in the years ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Order at 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">People Counsel argues that the Commission failed to provide a \u201ccomprehensive analysis\u201d concerning the manner in which its decision was reached and, specifically, <em>how </em>the \u201caffordable and reasonably priced\u201d standard applied and <em>why </em>the rates settled upon are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by these arguments. As we have stated in prior opinions, judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s finding is \u201climited to whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, </em>273 Md. at 363, 329 A.2d at 695 (citing <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. National Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309-310, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>236 A.2d 282, 291-292 (1967)). <em>See also Potomac Edison v. Public Service Commission, </em>279 Md. 573, 581, 369 A.2d 1035, 1040-41 (1977). \u201c[t]he burden is on those who seek to set it aside on appeal to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that there is illegality or unreasonableness\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. McQuaid, </em>220 Md. 373, 387, 152 A.2d 825, 832 (1959). Here, the findings of the Commission are clearly reasonable and, equally as clear, People Counsel has failed to show that the findings are arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s final argument in support of its contention that the Commission engaged in arbitrary decision-making is that the Commission retracted two \u201cregulatory promises\u201d it made in <em>Re C &amp; P Telephone of Maryland, </em>84 Md. PSC 135, 1993 WL 667164 (1993). The first promise, People\u2019s Counsel alleges, was that the Commission would thoroughly review Bell Atlantic\u2019s rates to ensure that they remained \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d after permitting a period of experimental pricing, incentive concepts and profit sharing to develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The Commission also made promises, People\u2019s Counsel continues, concerning changes in the accounting of the other post-employment benefits (\u201cOPEB\u201d) and transitional benefit obligations (\u201cTBO\u201d). According to People\u2019s Counsel, in <em>Re C &amp; P Telephone of Maryland, </em>84 Md. PSC at 140-42, 1993 WL 667164, \u201c[t]he Commission allowed [Bell Atlantic] to shorten the period for the amortization of OPEB expenses from <em>l&amp;k </em>years to 6 years (amortization began in 1991) and use excess profits that otherwise would have been returned to ratepayers (under the then-existing \u2018profit sharing\u2019 regulatory scheme) to payoff the OPEB amortization expense at a faster rate.\u201d After the OPEB obligation was fully amortized in 1996, however, the Commission failed to reduce rates and instead continued a fictitious $59 million expense to be built into Bell Atlantic\u2019s rate base, while the Company no longer incurred such expense. As evidence of this \u201cregulatory promise,\u201d People\u2019s Counsel points to the Commission\u2019s 1993 ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201cHaving considered the arguments raised by OPC and Staff, ... we continue to believe that accelerated amortization of the OPEB obligation will serve the ratepayers\u2019 interests as well as the Company\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">\u201cA key element of concern expressed by OPC and Staff is that, after the rapid amortization of the OPEB transition obligation is completed, the rates paid by customers will be excessive and C <em>&amp; </em>P will be the beneficiary of inflated earnings....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cThe concerns of OPC and Staff are misplaced because Staff and OPC have ignored the Commission\u2019s expressed intent to institute a proceeding after a three-year period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>Re C&amp;P Telephone Co., </em>84 Md. PSC at 243, 1993 WL 667178.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">People\u2019s Counsel argues that it relied on and made decisions based upon the Commission\u2019s statements that it would review rates in 1996 and that the OPEB TBO amortization, while costing customers in the short run, would benefit customers in the long run through a hybrid profit-sharing/rate-of-return form of regulation. Instead, People\u2019s Counsel maintains, the Commission arbitrarily adopted a \u201cnew direction without any analysis showing why the OPEB expenses should not be removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In response, the Commission does not dispute the facts stated by People\u2019s Counsel. Rather, it simply argues that \u201c[t]here is no basis in law for the argument that a prior regulatory decision must be continued despite the intervening enactment of a new statute.\u201d The passage of \u00a7 69(e), the Commission contends, disrupted its \u201cprior regulatory promise\u201d to determine rates using the traditional rate-of-return regulation. This change of form of regulation, as authorized by the Legislature in \u00a7 69(e), permitted the Commission to implement new policies and to make \u201cadjustments,\u201d including the termination of any \u201congoing regulatory treatments.\u201d Once the Commission decided, pursuant to \u00a7 69(e), that an alternative method of regulation would better serve the public interest, it was no longer required to factor OPEB adjustments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>into its analysis, as that consideration is part of rate-of-return regulation, not price cap regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Despite the Commission\u2019s claim that \u00a7 69(e) <em>permitted </em>it to change forms of regulation and to implement new policies, it is clear that the Commission did not have to renege on its acknowledged \u201cregulatory promises.\u201d Section 69(e), however, gave the Commission an option to adopt methods of regulation that it was previously unable to implement. These alternative means of regulation made it impracticable for the Commission to use OPEB adjustments in its analysis. In any event, as the Commission said, its actions \u201cmay well have frustrated OPC\u2019s expectations, but it denied no legally protected interest in doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AFFIRMED.
