Because we agree with Appellant on a number of the issues she has raised, we shall reverse and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Frederick County for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Appellant, Christine Ann Bentley, filed suit against Appellees, Alan Carroll, M.D., Morningstar <em>&amp; </em>Carroll, P.A., and the Estate of George L. Morningstar, alleging medical malpractice by the defendants based upon their purported negligence in failing to prevent the continual, long-term child sexual abuse suffered by Appellant at the hands of persons within her household.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pertinent facts and arguments regarding Appellees\u2019 treatment of Appellant which underlie the latter\u2019s medical malpractice claims and this appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Appellees began treating Appellant in March of 1978, when Appellant, then just shy of two and a half years old, was brought by her mother into Appellees\u2019 family health care office complaining of frequency of urination, dysuria (painful urination), constipation, and vaginal inflammation. Treating Appellant on approximately twenty occasions over the next ten years, Drs. Carroll and Morningstar acted as Appellant\u2019s primary care physicians until 1988, the year Dr. Morningstar passed away. During some or all of this period, Appellant was sexually abused on a regular basis by Luther Burner, her mother\u2019s boyfriend, at times by Etheline Burner, her mother, and at least once by Luther\u2019s nephew. Appellant\u2019s chief contention is that Appellees could have prevented the continuation of this abuse had they not been negligent in meeting the standard of medical care at that time, which included a mandatory statutory obligation for physicians to report to social service or law enforcement authorities what they believed, or had reason to believe, constituted child physical or sexual abuse. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1976 RepLVol., 1981 Cum.Supp., 1982 RepLVol., 1984 Cum.Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 35A(b)(l), (c), and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>In contrast, Appellees\u2019 core theory is that they met all their obligations under the prevailing standard of medical care required of family health care physicians during the relevant period. Simply put, Appellees argue, they were not negligent. Moreover, any negligence that might be attributed to them was wholly superseded by intervening causes. The abuse and injuries suffered by Appellant were due solely to criminal actions that were neither known nor suspected by the doctors, and that were committed by offenders, the worst of whom, Luther Burner, Appellees had never met nor were even aware of, and over all of whom the doctors had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In large part, Appellees\u2019 medical treatment of Appellant during the critical period from 1978 to 1984 is not disputed by the parties. Recitation of all those details and the related trial testimony and exhibits seems unnecessary for purposes of our analysis. It is worth noting, however, that there was significant factual disagreement at trial concerning whether Dr. Carroll ever (1) evaluated Appellant for sexual abuse and a variety of sexually transmitted diseases, (2) questioned her about being touched inappropriately, (3) inquired into Appellant\u2019s childhood and sexual history, (4) conducted a standard, thorough examination, and (5) explained to her mother why he was administering a gonorrhea culture, the method and significance of which were also hotly contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The parties do not dispute that the gonorrhea culture was performed in January of 1980 when Appellant was four and a half years old, and that it tested negative. They are in conflict, however, as to the site of the culture sample. Dr. Carroll testified that when he took the sample for the gonorrhea culture from Appellant, her hymen was intact. Admitting that it would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to sample the cervix if the hymen were intact, and that it would probably require \u201can examination under anesthesia to even attempt it\u201d on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>child of Appellant\u2019s age at the time, Dr. Carroll attributed to \u201cclerical error\u201d the fact that the laboratory sheet sent to the Maryland Department of Health along with the cotton swab to be analyzed indicated Appellant\u2019s cervix as the culture examination site. Appellant countered that in responding to her pretrial interrogatory as to whether any medical report or like document from the doctors\u2019 records contained any inaccuracy, Dr. Carroll stated, \u201cNo such contention is made at this time.\u201d In addition, Appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. David Abramson, testified that the condition of a female child\u2019s hymen can be a critical factor in determining whether the child has been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">As to the significance of the gonorrhea culture, Appellees claim that the negative test result refuted any cause for concern of possible sexual abuse. Appellant asserts that the taking of the gonorrhea culture itself reveals Dr. Carroll\u2019s suspicion of abuse, and that the negative result did not rule out, or should not have ruled out, such suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In addition to these factual disputes, the parties at trial were naturally at complete odds as to whether the Appellees'\" treatment violated the required standard of medical care, the crux of the case. Specifically contested were whether the doctors believed or had reason to believe Appellant had been or was being sexually abused and, consequently, whether they had a duty to file a report of suspected child abuse with social service and law enforcement authorities. Lastly, disagreement at trial also occurred over several legal issues, namely: Appellees\u2019 evidentiary use of a psychological test performed on Appellant by a defense expert witness; Appellant\u2019s attempted use of a medical treatise to impeach one of Appellees\u2019 expert witnesses; Appellant\u2019s attempt to evoke from her expert witness his conclusion regarding the cause of Appellant\u2019s recorded medical symptoms prior to age five; and Appellant\u2019s prayers for additional and revised jury instructions. The trial court ruled for Appellees on each of these issues. As noted earlier, the jury later returned a verdict in favor of the defendants-Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Appellant filed a timely appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. On our own motion, we granted certiorari prior to that court\u2019s consideration of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">A. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">(1) <em>Denied Jury Instruction on Violation of the Maryland Child Abuse Act as Evidence of Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In her first assignment of error, Appellant essentially asks that we decide the following question in the affirmative: Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury that violation of a statute may be evidence of negligence and that Maryland\u2019s Child Abuse Act, at the time pertinent to plaintiffs suit, required every health practitioner to report the existence of possible child abuse to social service and law enforcement authorities whenever the health practitioner treated a child and believed or had reason to believe the child had been abused? Specifically, Appellant takes issue with the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the jury two instructions she proposed regarding Appellees\u2019 arguable violation of the Maryland Child Abuse Act, codified during the relevant period under Article 27, \u00a7 35A, as well as the legal effect of both a violation and a non-violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Appellant contended at trial that, during the time period pertinent to the present case, \u00a7 35A imposed a statutory duty upon Appellees to report the possibility of child abuse in certain circumstances, that the defendant doctors violated that duty in their treatment of Appellant, that their violation of the statute constituted evidence of medical malpractice, <em>ie., </em>of Appellees\u2019 negligent failure to render the standard of care imposed upon their profession, and that a non-violation of the statute did not necessarily preclude a finding of professional negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The statutory duty of physicians to report suspected child abuse stemmed from two subsections of \u00a7 35A which in 1978 provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00a7 35A. Causing abuse to child under eighteen.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">(c) <em>Persons who shall report abuse, </em>etc.\u2014Every health practitioner, educator or social worker or law-enforcement officer, who contacts, examines, attends, or treats a child and who believes or has reason to believe that the child has been abused is required to make a report in the form and manner provided in the following subsection, notwithstanding any other section of the law relating to privileged communications....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">(d) <em>Form and contents of </em>report.\u2014Each such report made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) shall be made to the agencies as provided for hereinafter, both orally and in written form; both the reports to be made as soon as is reasonably possible in the circumstances, but, in any case, the written report must be made within forty-eight (48) hours of the contact, examination, attention or treatment which disclosed the existence of possible abuse. The oral report shall be made either by telephone or direct communication to the local department of social services or to the appropriate law-enforcement agency. The agency to which the report is made shall immediately notify the other agency. Nothing however, shall prohibit the local department of social services and the appropriate law-enforcement agency from jointly agreeing to cooperative arrangements. The written report required to be made shall be made in all cases to the local department of social services and a copy sent to the local State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">The oral and written reports shall contain the following information, or as much thereof as the person making the report shall be able in the circumstances to furnish:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">(1) The name and home address or addresses of the child or children and the parent or other persons responsible for the care of the child or children in question;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">(2) The present whereabouts of the child or children if not the same as the home address or addresses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>(3) The age or ages of the child or children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">(4) The nature and extent of the injuries or injury or sexual abuse of the child or children in question, including any evidence or information available to the person or agency rendering the report of previous injury or injuries possibly resulting from abuse or previous sexual abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(5) All such information available to the reporter which would be of aid in establishing the cause of the injuries or injury and the identity of the person or persons responsible therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In order to fully impress upon the jury her theory of the case, which was based in substantial part upon her claim that Appellees violated their duty to report under \u00a7 35A, Appellant first beseeched the trial court to include in its charge to the jury the following statement: \u201cThe violation of a statute, which is a cause of plaintiffs injuries or damages, is evidence of negligence.\u201d Maryland Institute for Continuing Professional Education of Lawyers, Inc., Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 19:7, at 484 (3d ed.1995) (hereinafter \u201cMPJI 19:7\u201d). Appellant then requested as the first of two \u201cadditional proposed jury instructions\u201d that the court follow the MPJI 19:7 instruction with a reading of significant portions of the Maryland Child Abuse Act, as codified in 1978. Included within the proposed additional instruction were subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 35A exactly as they appear above\u2014 except for the headings\u2014along with excerpts from other subsections dealing with the statute\u2019s purpose, the definition of terms, and the procedures to be followed as well as the concerns to be addressed after a report has been made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the penultimate paragraph of Appellant\u2019s proposed instruction incorporated the provision of immunity granted to persons making a report in good faith, which appeared in the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>(h) <em>Immunity from civil liability or criminal penalty</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">(1) Any person, including a health practitioner, educator, or social worker or law enforcement officer, participating in the making of a good faith report pursuant to this section or participating in an investigation or in a judicial proceeding resulting therefrom shall in so doing be immune from any civil liability or criminal penalty that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Finally, Appellant\u2019s \u201cfirst additional proposed jury instruction\u201d ended with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Should you find that Drs. Carroll and/or Morningstar violated Article 27 Section 35A, if you find their violation to be a cause of the injuries or damages suffered by Ms. Christine Bentley, then that finding of a statutory violation is evidence of that Defendants\u2019 negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Appellant also proposed a second additional jury instruction to be read immediately after the first, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD5\">Even if you find that the conduct of Drs. Carroll and Morningstar may have complied with Article 27, Section 35A, their compliance with the statute does not necessarily preclude a finding of negligence if you determine, after reviewing all of the evidence, that a reasonable person would have taken precautions beyond the statutorily required measure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The trial court refused to instruct the jury in any manner as to MPJI 19:7, as to any of the provisions of the Maryland Child Abuse Act excerpted by Appellant, or as to the legal effect of Appellees\u2019 violation or non-violation of that statute. In rejecting Appellant\u2019s additional proposed instructions regarding these issues, the trial judge stated, \u201cI am persuaded that the standard of care is for the jury to determine, and I believe that should be based on the medical standard of care that\u2019s been presented here and not the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Before directly analyzing the judge\u2019s rejection of all of Appellant\u2019s requested instructions relating to the statute, we shall initially dispose of Appellees\u2019 arguments in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>court\u2019s decision. First, Appellees assert that Appellant \u201coffered no evidence that Drs. Carroll or Morningstar ever violated\u201d \u00a7 35A. As the basis for this assertion, Appellees cite only Dr. Carroll\u2019s testimony, that he conducted a variety of physical examinations, medical tests, and personal inquiries in treating Appellant, that those interventions confirm that there was \u201cno evidence of any kind of sexual activity going on,\u201d and that he never suspected nor had reason to suspect the girl had been sexually abused. Appellees ignore, however, that Appellant contradicted Dr. Carroll\u2019s claims through the testimony of several witnesses, including herself, her mother, and her expert witness, Dr. David Abramson, some or all of whom the jury could have deemed credible. In sum, the record itself reveals the fallacy of Appellees\u2019 assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellees next argue that \u00a7 35A is inappropriate for purposes of jury instruction in part because it \u201ccarries [no] criminal penalty and [is] silent as to civil liability.\u201d Understandably, Appellees fail to cite any legal authority in support of this proposition; our research reveals nothing in Maryland precedent requiring that a statute whose violation may be used as evidence of negligence need impose either criminal or civil liability in order to be utilized in such fashion. That statutes typically used for such evidentiary purposes, for instance, provisions of the State\u2019s motor vehicle law or utility regulation, may routinely allow for sanction(s) upon their violation is of little, if any, legal significance here. Such an observation certainly does not translate into a rule of law requiring the inclusion of sanctions as a condition precedent to the use of a statute\u2019s violation as evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Appellees\u2019 contention that instructing the jury on \u00a7 35A would have been inappropriate for the additional reason that the statute \u201cwas designed not only to protect children who have been the subject of abuse, but also to extend immunity from civil liability or criminal penalty to those who report in good faith\u201d is an argument against itself. For, Appellees fail to recognize that the immunity from liability is granted to those who report, not to those who do not. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>rather than hiding the statute\u2019s immunity provision from the jury, Appellant deliberately included it within her proposed instructions. The evident purpose behind the statute\u2019s grant of immunity to good faith reporters is to instigate the exercise of the duty to report; it hardly serves as an excuse for not reporting. Moreover, to the extent that laypersons might commonly experience and expect that physicians render their treatment of patients under a duty of privacy and confidentiality, the instruction on the immunity provision would have directly assisted the jurors in understanding the existence of a duty to report and the ramifications of reporting, particularly the protections provided to physicians who, in filing a report, might appear to a layperson to breach any such confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Appellees\u2019 alternatively argue that Appellant\u2019s proposed instructions were unnecessary and superfluous, because the statutory duty to report was no different than that which was required under the medical standards of care testified to by both sides\u2019 expert witnesses. Appellees\u2019 equation of the standards as identical is directly nullified, however, by the assertion of their trial counsel during closing remarks that, for a doctor treating child patients in 1978, \u201c[t jhere was no standard of care ... requiring a mandatory reporting [of sexual abuse]. It was simply you had to use your best medical judgment, that\u2019s what you were required to do.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Finally, Appellees postulate that Appellant \u201ccould not establish that a violation of the statute was the proximate cause of her injuries.\u201d The legal effect Appellees attach to the actual incidents of abuse committed by third-party intentional tortfeasors, as \u201csuperceding, intervening torts that broke any possible chain of causation between an alleged violation of [\u00a7 35A] and the harm alleged by\u201d Appellant, essentially denies the legislative purpose and desired beneficial effects of \u00a7 35A: to redress previous abuse and to prevent future incidence thereof. The General Assembly\u2019s intended goals in enacting the Child Abuse Act, and specifically in imposing a duty on physicians to report suspected abuse, are neither illusory nor fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Maryland Rule 2-520 addresses jury instructions for civil cases tried in circuit court and provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avc\">[t]he court may instruct the jury, orally or in writing or both, by granting requested instructions, by giving instructions of its own, or by combining any of these methods. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOB\">Maryland Rule 2-520(c). This Court has provided guidance to trial courts concerning the considerations to be made in determining whether a particular jury instruction requested by a party should be given. More than a decade ago we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">A party is generally entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury through a requested instruction if that theory is a correct exposition of the law and there is evidence in the case which supports it. The test for whether an instruction was proper has two aspects: (1) whether the instruction correctly states the law, and (2) whether the law is applicable in light of the evidence before the jury. If the test is met, the instruction <em>must </em>be given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 512, 495 A.2d 1, 13 (1985) (citations omitted). <em>See also Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 179-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>80, 486 A.2d 196, 198 (1985). More recently, we have restated this test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">[T]o rule upon the propriety of denying a requested jury instruction, a reviewing court must determine whether the requested instruction was a correct exposition of the law, whether that law was applicable in light of the evidence before the jury, and finally whether the substance of the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instruction actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, </em>334 Md. 480, 495-96, 639 A.2d 701, 709 (1994) (quoting <em>Wegad v. Howard Street Jewelers, </em>326 Md. 409, 414, 605 A.2d 123, 126 (1992)). <em>See also Jacobson v. Julian, </em>246 Md. 549, 561, 229 A.2d 108,116 (1967) (\u201cSo long as the law is fairly covered by the instructions ... we will not disturb them.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Applying the principles of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Holman </em>to the present case, we must initially determine whether Appellant\u2019s requested instructions were legally accurate. Specifically, is it the law in Maryland, first, that the violation of a statute may be evidence of negligence and, second, that a finding by the jury that Appellees had not violated that statute did not necessarily preclude a finding of negligence?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">Not long ago we reaffirmed that ftjhis Court has consistently held that the violation of a statutory duty may furnish evidence of negligence. The positive evidentiary value of a statutory violation, however, is subject to the condition that \u201cthe person alleging negligence is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of the kind which the statute was intended, in general, to prevent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\"><em>County Commissioners v. Bell Atlantic, </em>346 Md. 160, 179, 695 A.2d 171, 181 (1997) (quoting <em>Atlantic Mutual v. Kenney, </em>323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Md. 116, 124, 591 A.2d 507, 510-11 (1991) (other citations omitted)). <em>See also Erie Ins. Co. v. Chops, </em>322 Md. 79, 84, 585 A.2d 232, 234 (1991) (reiterating that the negligence for which the statutory violation provides evidence is only actionable to the extent it proximately caused injury or damage to the plaintiff). Furthermore, in <em>Leonard v. Sav-A-Stop Services, </em>289 Md. 204, 424 A.2d 336 (1981), we stated that \u201c \u2018[cjompliance with a legislative enactment ... does not prevent a finding of negligence where a reasonable man would take additional precautions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 424 A.2d at 340 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 288C (1964) and citing W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts 203 (4th ed.1971)). It therefore cannot be denied that MPJI 19:7 and Appellant\u2019s reformulation of it with specific regard to the Child Abuse Act correctly stated the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s proposed instruction on the legal effect of the jury\u2019s finding no violation of the Child Abuse Act by Appellees also accurately reflects Maryland law. Consequently, Appellant was entitled to have the jury instructed as to the substance contained in her requested instructions, as long as the legal propositions therein were applicable in light of the evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In our view, the evidence within the present case was sufficient to trigger the applicability of the Maryland Child Abuse Act and the possible judgment by the jury that Appellees\u2019 violation of the duty incorporated therein constituted evidence of negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the relevant time period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Appellant was a child under eighteen and thus a member of the class intended to be protected by the Act. Moreover, the general injury that she allegedly suffered prior to 1981 and undeniably endured thereafter was child abuse, the very evil against which the legislation was intended to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">As to the final requirement of proximate cause, Appellant produced a reasonable, credible theory that a violation by Appellees of their statutory duty to report contributed to the set of circumstances which allowed the perpetrators to continue their sexual abuse of the plaintiff and therefore proximately caused whatever related injuries she endured after the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the law. Such causation could be inferred from the Act\u2019s stated purpose for setting into motion the intervention of the State\u2019s social service and law enforcement personnel: to redress previous abuse of the reported child while ensuring against any future incidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the provisions of the statute detailing the responsibilities of the respective state agencies triggered by a report of suspected child abuse, see \u00a7 85A(f)-(i), could likewise have generated or reinforced the inference that Appellees\u2019 failure to fulfill the duty to report resulted in continued abuse. Along these lines, Appellant had presented testimony from Peggy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Walter, a child protective service worker with the Frederick County Department of Social Services, who explained in great detail the practices and procedures implemented by her office, in combination with local police authorities, whenever a report of suspected child abuse was filed during the years between 1978 and 1984. The \u201coverriding goal\u201d of this combined intervention was to ensure the \u201csafety of the child.\u201d Therefore, under Appellant\u2019s theory of the case and presentation of evidence, the jury could reasonably have found the required element of causation to have been adequately proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">With regard to the last prong under <em>Holman, </em>the instructions actually given by the trial court did not fairly cover the substance of the issues validly presented by Appellant for consideration by the jury. Indeed, as noted earlier, the court refused to instruct the jury in any manner whatsoever as to these statutory matters. Perhaps most egregious was that the jurors in this case were in no way instructed by the trial court as to the obligation of physicians to report suspected child abuse, whether couched as a statutory duty or a professional requirement. To the extent it places a statutory reporting duty on physicians, the Maryland Child Abuse Act, now contained in the Code in large part within the Family Law Article, \u00a7\u00a7 5-701 to 5-715, is thus incorporated as part of the general standard of care expected of and within the medical profession in the treatment of child patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">While we do not decide exactly how much of or in what manner Appellant\u2019s requested instructions ought to have been given, we hold that the trial court was obligated in the instant case to instruct the jury in some manner as to the legal propositions that (1) Maryland statutory law, during the relevant period, required every physician who treated a child and believed or had reason to believe that the child had been abused was required to make a report as to the existence of such suspected abuse to the local department of social services or to the appropriate law enforcement agency, which would then investigate and intervene to the extent necessary to redress prior abuse and prevent future occurrences and (2) the violation of such a statute by a physician constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>evidence of negligence. Appellant was additionally entitled to have the jury instructed that the statute provided immunity to a physician who in good faith reported suspected sexual abuse of a child patient and that any non-violation of the statute by Appellees did not necessitate that they were not negligent. We therefore hold that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury pursuant to Appellant\u2019s requests relative to those issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Whereas we remand the present case to the circuit court for a new trial based upon its error in charging the jury, we deem it appropriate to address several of the other issues raised by Appellant in order to guide both the parties and the trial court should the same issues resurface upon retrial. <em>See Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 55, 702 A.2d 699, 716 (1997); <em>Foster v. State, </em>297 Md. 191, 215, 464 A.2d 986, 999 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">(2) <em>Jury Instruction on Determination of Causation Based Solely on Expert Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellant asserts that the trial court made a second error in its instructions to the jury, one of commission rather than omission, and poses the following query: Did the trial court err in twice charging the jury, over plaintiffs objections, that it must make its judgment as to whether plaintiffs claimed injuries were caused by the alleged negligence of defendants only on the basis of expert medical testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>which speaks in terms of reasonable probability or reasonable certainty?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The trial court included in its charge to the jury an instruction derived almost verbatim from one proposed by counsel for Appellees, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">In considering the question of whether the alleged negligence of the Defendants was the cause of the injuries of which the Plaintiffs now complain, <em>you must form your judgment only on the basis of expert medical testimony </em>which speaks in terms of \u201creasonable probability\u201d or \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d Your decision may not be based on expert testimony that admits of a mere possibility of negligence, or a mere possibility that such negligence caused the injury. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">At the close of the court\u2019s charge to the jury, counsel for Appellant immediately objected to this particular instruction, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">I believe there was an instruction that the jurors should only consider expert testimony that was stated in the form of reasonable medical probability in determining whether or not there was a cause of the injuries. And the problem I\u2019m having with that is that other evidence is certainly appropriate to be considered in addition to expert testimony. Now I don\u2019t have a problem with an instruction that expert testimony needs to be stated in order to be evidence to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, but I do have a concern with the Court\u2019s instruction on that element there because it\u2019s suggesting that the plaintiff has an obligation to produce expert testimony stated within a reasonable degree of medical probability in order to demonstrate causation. And respectfully, we would submit that the evidence to demonstrate that can include non-expert testimony or it can include expert testimony, it\u2019s up to the jury to determine whether the evidence that\u2019s submitted is sufficient to find causation, whether it be proximate cause or direct cause. So that is my objection to that particular instruction, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In response to Appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court decided \u201cto re-read that instruction, modifying it by deleting that second [sentence]____\u201d Thereupon, Appellant reiterated her protest, contending that the court\u2019s proposed solution failed to dispel her dissatisfaction with the original instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">The problem I\u2019m having, even deleting that sentence, it still makes it sound as if they have to form their judgment based only on the basis of expert medical testimony. And my problem is ... that obviously there\u2019s a lot of other evidence besides expert medical testimony in the case. And so I think that needs to be clarified, something needs to be added to it, that says ... you should consider only expert medical testimony which speaks in terms of reasonable probability or reasonable certainty, along with any other evidence that is not from an expert that you deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">With its instruction in the instant case the trial court improperly restricted the jury in its determination of causation to the bare consideration of three witnesses\u2019 testimony, this wiping out all the other voluminous evidence admitted at trial\u2014in the form of interrogatories, depositions, live testimony and exhibits\u2014as provided by both Appellant and Appellees. In particular, the testimony of the plaintiff patient and the defendant doctor in the present case might undoubtedly have some evidentiary value relative to causation. To the extent that the court\u2019s instruction rendered all non-expert evidence irrelevant to the issue of causation, the jury was misguided in its task, and the court erred. <em>See Singleton v. Roman, </em>195 Md. 241, 247, 72 A.2d 705, 707 (1950) (\u201c[A]n instruction is erroneous if it withdraws from the consideration of the jury any evidence, however weak, tending to establish material facts.\u201d (citation omitted)). This is particularly true in light of the oddity that, as to causation, the only evidence left to the jury by the court\u2019s single instruction on the issue\u2014the expert opinion testimony\u2014necessarily derived its probative force from the very evidence the court had excised from the jury\u2019s review. <em>See State Health Dep\u2019t v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 520, 209 A.2d 555, 559 (1965) (\u201cAn expert opinion derives its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>probative force from the facts on which it is predicated, and these must be legally sufficient to sustain the opinion of the expert.\u201d (citation omitted)). Because the court\u2019s instruction that the jury consider only expert medical testimony in determining the cause of Appellant\u2019s injuries misrepresented the law in Maryland, it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury as it did in the present case. <em>See Kennelly v. Burgess, </em>387 Md. 562, 572, 654 A.2d 1335, 1340 (1995) (\u201c[T]he instruction given was an improper statement of the law and was therefore error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">B. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">(1) <em>Use of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory as Evidence of Plaintiff\u2019s Exaggeration of Complaints for Litigation Purposes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Appellant has also assigned error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to strike testimony from a defense expert witness in psychiatry that his testing of the plaintiff by use of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory demonstrated that she had exaggerated her complaints for purposes of litigation. Appellant argues that the trial judge erred as a matter of law by refusing to strike the testimony of defense expert witness, Dr. John Henderson, that the plaintiff had exaggerated her complaints. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In presenting their defense, Appellees called Dr. Henderson, a forensic psychiatrist practicing in Baltimore, who prior to the trial had conducted a mental-status exam of Appellant, during which he administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) upon her. The MMPI is a widely used psychological test designed to measure ten general possibilities for abnormality in psychological function. The test consists of approximately 560 questions, each calling for a true or false response. The MMPI has several built-in validity scales, designed to determine the extent to which the test is accurately measuring the traits it purports to measure and to help detect whether the taker is attempting to lie or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>appear in a falsely virtuous light. <em>See People v. Stoll, </em>49 Cal.3d 1136, 265 Cal.Rptr. 111, 783 P.2d 698, 704 (1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Dr. Henderson concluded from his examination and the results of the MMPI that Appellant displayed no clinical indication that she was afflicted with either the depression or post traumatic stress disorder from which she claimed to be suffering. Testifying as an expert at trial, however, Dr. Henderson did not limit his testimony to announcing this conclusion to the jury. Instead, despite Appellant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude any testimony by the doctor that might impugn her credibility as a witness, the trial court permitted Dr. Henderson to describe the MMPI to the jury as a test that \u201cgives you a profile of the validity and the consistency of the individual answering it, sort of, I hate to use the word, mini truth, or lie detector, truth detector.\u201d Despite his professed discomfort with his characterization of the MMPI, Dr. Henderson went on to advise the jury that his testing of Appellant revealed a \u201cfrequency of unusual, bizarre complaints endorsed by the patient on the test.\u201d Thus, the doctor informed the jury, \u201cWhat this represents is that there\u2019s an extreme exaggeration of unusual complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The doctor, however, had not yet finished his attack on the veracity of Appellant and her claims. In replying to defense counsel\u2019s request for his opinion as to the precise form of Appellant\u2019s exaggeration, Dr. Henderson stated, in part, \u201cNow what\u2019s important here is there\u2019s exaggeration of emotional difficulties.... This is a pattern in the validity scales that is seen predominantly in litigation involved patients.\u201d Counsel for Appellant at this point immediately requested the court to strike Dr. Henderson\u2019s \u201clast comment\u201d as \u201ctotally inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ate,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe Court of Appeals has made it clear that a psychologist is not a lie detector ... who takes away from the jury its responsibility, it doesn\u2019t matter what testing he\u2019s using, we don\u2019t have polygraphs in the courtroom.\u201d The court denied Appellant\u2019s request, concluding that \u201cthis test is measuring the truth, not for my purpose of truth, [but] the honesty of the individual while taking the test.... And your recitation of the law is correct, but it doesn\u2019t apply here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that courts in Maryland are improper fora for the introduction and interpretation of \u201clie detectors,\u201d \u201cpolygraphs,\u201d or any like measurement of a witness\u2019s veracity. <em>See Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 658, 480 A.2d 800, 803 (1984) (reiterating firm rule that polygraph tests are not admissible, including fact of taking such a test). Our resistance against admitting evidence of lie detection applies equally where human beings are the fount of such testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">We have not recognized that a witness may be a more reliable lie detector than a polygraph machine. We have never indicated that a person can qualify as an \u201cexpert in credibility,\u201d no matter what his experience or expertise. We have insisted that, in a jury trial, the credibility to be given a witness and the weight to be given his testimony be confined to the resolution of all of the jurors. It is the settled law of this State that a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth. Testimony from a witness relating to the credibility of another witness is to be rejected as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><em>Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 278, 539 A.2d 657, 663 (1988). <em>See also Hutton v. State, </em>339 Md. 480, 503, 663 A.2d 1289, 1300 (1995) (\u201c[N]o matter how learned in his or her field of expertise, no expert is in a better position to assess the credibility of a \"witness than is the jury.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Reviewing the testimony in context, we conclude that the witness went beyond a mere expression of opinion as to the plaintiffs \u201chonesty ... while taking the test.\u201d Moreover, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Henderson\u2019s reference to the MMPI as a \u201cmini-truth, or lie detector\u201d was inadmissible, highly inflammable and prejudicial. Even if the testimony regarding the MMPI test results were admissible in evidence for another valid purpose, we hold that as presented in this case, the evidence should have been excluded and the trial judge should have granted the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(2) <em>Expert Witness\u2019s Opinion as a Vouch for the Credibility of Plaintiff\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In her final claim of error,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant requests us to consider whether the trial court erred or abused its discretion by disallowing testimony from plaintiffs expert witness as to the cause of plaintiffs medical condition at the age of thirty-one months on the basis that such testimony would improperly vouch for the credibility of the plaintiffs anticipated testimony, disputed by the defense, that she was being sexually abused during that period of her life. Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding expert opinion testimony by Dr. Abramson that the cause of Appellant\u2019s medical complaints to Appellees prior to ages five or six was sexual abuse, the possibility of which the defendant doctors were negligent in not recognizing and reporting. We hold, however, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In the trial below, the court precluded Dr. Abramson\u2019s proposed testimony that, in his opinion, the cause of Appellant\u2019s symptoms between 1978 and 1980, as reported to and treated by Appellees during her first seven visits to their offices, was sexual abuse. The judge reasoned that such testimony would improperly vouch for the credibility of Appellant\u2019s anticipated testimony, disputed by the defense, that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>was sexually abused prior to 1981, or prior to the ages of five or six.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 539 A.2d 657 (1988), we considered the trial court\u2019s admission of expert opinion testimony adduced by the State that the complainant in a criminal trial \u201cwas, in fact, a victim of sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 539 A.2d at 659. We held not only that under the circumstances of that case was admitting the opinion in evidence an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion because of insufficient foundation, but also that such testimony was inadmissible as a matter of law because of its improper impact upon the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of both the complainant and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 277, 539 A.2d at 662. Appellant\u2019s proposed expert opinion testimony in the present case would suffer from the same legal flaws as the evidence erroneously admitted in <em>Bohnert. </em>Just as in <em>Bohnert, </em>the proffered expert opinion in the present case could not be admitted as a matter of judicial discretion given that the underlying, non-testimonial evidence could not support the conclusion sought by Appellant\u2019s counsel, nor could the opinion be admitted as a matter of law to the extent that any reliance by Dr. Abramson upon Ms. Bentley\u2019s recollection of events of abuse prior to 1981 would necessarily vouch for the credibility of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The record in <em>Bohnert </em>led \u201cto no other conclusion than that [the expert]\u2019s opinion was founded only upon what [the complainant] said had occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 539 A.2d at 662. As we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">The opinion of [the expert] was not based on facts sufficient to form a basis for her opinion. There were no facts to show that [the complainant\u2019s allegations were true, so that a reasonably accurate conclusion that the child had been sexually abused could be made. The conclusion that she had in fact been abused was no more than mere conjecture or guess. The short of it is that the very groundwork for [the expert's opinion was inadequately supported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Id., </em>539 A.2d at 662. The same reasoning holds equal sway in the present case. Despite Appellant counsel\u2019s concerted at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tempts before both the trial court and this Court to make the underpinnings of Dr. Abramson\u2019s proffered opinion testimony distinguishable from the circumstances attendant in <em>Bohnert, </em>those efforts were, and remain, ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel had repeatedly assured the trial judge that Dr. Abramson\u2019s opinion would be founded solely upon his review of medical and other records, already admitted into evidence on stipulation of all the parties, as well as the uncontested evidence that Appellant was sexually abused by different persons in her household between 1981 and 1989, when she was between the ages of six and thirteen. Indeed, in framing his question to Dr. Abramson, plaintiffs counsel specifically warned the doctor not to consider Appellant\u2019s account of the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered from ages two to five: \u201cNow, I would like to ask you to exclude from your consideration any sworn testimony....\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nonetheless, these maneuvers could not cure the expert opinion of its legal infirmities.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We reiterated in <em>Bohnert </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">no matter how highly qualified the expert may be in his field, his opinion has no probative force unless a sufficient factual basis to support a rational conclusion is shown. The opinion of an expert, therefore, must be based on facts, proved or assumed, sufficient to form a basis for an opinion, and cannot be invoked to supply the substantial facts necessary to support such conclusion. The facts upon which an expert bases his opinion must permit reasonably accurate conclusions as distinguished from mere conjecture or guess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8q\"><em>Id. </em>at 274-75, 539 A.2d at 661 (quoting <em>State Health Dep\u2019t v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 520, 209 A.2d 555, 559-60 (1965) (citations omitted)). <em>See also Worthington Constr. v. Moore, </em>266 Md. 19, 29, 291 A.2d 466, 470-71 (1972) (\u201cAn expert\u2019s judgment has no probative force unless there is a sufficient basis upon which to support his conclusions.\u201d (citations omitted)); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Maryland Rule 5-702 (requiring a sufficient factual basis for the admission of expert testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In pronouncing his opinion while disregarding Appellant\u2019s sworn testimony, and thus not incorporating her accounts of abuse prior to 1981 into his calculus, Dr. Abramson would have had to rely upon facts that were insufficient to support his purported conclusion, and therefore the opinion was inadmissible. Dr. Abramson\u2019s reasoning was essentially that, in his expert opinion, because Appellant undeniably suffered sexual abuse <em>after </em>1981, the medical problems she endured <em>prior </em>to 1981, as documented and treated by Appellees, were caused by sexual abuse, even though all of the symptoms exhibited by Appellant could, by the expert\u2019s own testimony, be attributed to a myriad of causes wholly unrelated to sexual abuse. Appellees are correct in their assertion that the necessary link between the basis for Dr. Abramson\u2019s opinion and his conclusion is absent: the subsequent undisputed history of sexual abuse in combination with earlier medical symptoms attributable to a vide variety of causes cannot be opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty to establish sexual abuse as the cause of those earlier symptoms. Our primary reasoning in Bohnert, 312 Md. at 276, 539 A.2d at 662, concluding the expert\u2019s opinion to have been inadequately supported, would be equally germane here. Because Dr. Abramson\u2019s proposed testimony, couched as expert opinion, amounted to no more than mere speculation and conjecture, it was incompetent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Conversely, because the non-testimonial materials to be considered by Dr. Abramson were insufficient to render an opinion, by necessity he would have had to ignore the limitations urged upon him by counsel in order to pronounce a factually supportable conclusion, <em>i.e., </em>one reliant upon Appellant\u2019s accounts of early abuse. The doctor\u2019s opinion would then have been vouching for the credibility of those accounts, impermissibly so according to our alternate reasoning in <em>Bohnert:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">The opinion of [Dr. Abramson] that [Appellant] in fact was sexually abused was tantamount to a declaration by [him] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that [Appellant] was telling the truth.... In the circumstances here, the opinion could only be reached if [Appellant]^ testimony were believed____ The import of the opinion was clear\u2014[Appellant] was credible....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 539 A.2d at 663. In light of the discretion and wide latitude afforded to the trial court in ruling on the admission of expert opinion testimony, <em>see Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 576, 611 A.2d 581, 590 (1992), we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence proffered by Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED.

During his testimony in the present case, Dr. Henderson briefly explained these validity scales to the juiy, and characterized them as exhibiting a \u201cvalidity pattern in terms of how the individual took the test.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">. Appellant raised one other issue on appeal, namely, whether the trial court erred or abused its discretion by refusing to allow plaintiff to impeach a defense expert witness with statements from a published treatise where the same witness\u2019s testimony indicated that the treatise was recognized as a reliable authority by others in his field. Because this issue was fact-intensive, in light of our reversal based upon other issues, we shall not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">.
