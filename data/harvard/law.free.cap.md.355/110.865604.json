That court seeks our resolution of the parties\u2019 state law property disputes so that it may determine whether an uncompensated taking of private property has occurred in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The questions pertain to a right-of-way in Montgomery County called the \u201cGeorgetown Branch\u201d that was granted to a railroad in 1911 and that has been converted for use as a hiker/biker trail under the federal \u201cRails-to-Trails\u201d Act (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Specifically, the case requires that we construe a 1911 deed from appellant Chevy Chase Land Company of Montgomery County (CCLC or the land company) to the Metropolitan Southern Railroad Company (MSRC or the railroad),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is a predecessor in interest to the right-of-way now owned by appellee Montgomery County (the County). Additional parties to this appeal include appellant Columbia Country Club (Country Club), which claims an interest in the right-of-way for which it should be compensated, and appellee the United States, which along with the County was named as a defendant in this takings claim. The certified questions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">1. Under Maryland law, did the 1911 deed convey an interest in fee simple absolute or an easement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">2. If the deed conveyed an easement, is the easement subject to any limitations as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>3. If the deed conveyed an easement, has the easement been abandoned as a matter of law since its conveyance and, if so, when?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We examine each of the certified questions, in <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Addressing the first question in Part II, we conclude that the 1911 deed granting a \u201cright-of-way\u201d to the railroad conveyed an easement. The use of the \u201cright-of-way\u201d language provides a strong indication that the parties intended to convey an easement as opposed to an estate in fee simple absolute. We find nothing in the deed to indicate that anything more than a right of passage was intended, particularly in light of the deed\u2019s separate grant \u201cin fee simple\u201d of other land upon which a passenger station was to be located. Our conclusion is confirmed by the circumstances of the conveyance, including the 20-year existence of the railway and the nominal consideration paid by the railroad for the right-of-way. Moreover, the conveyance of the right-of-way in fee simple would not have furthered any purpose of the railway not served by its conveyance as an easement and could adversely affect the public\u2019s interest in the best use of the land. <em>See </em>Part H.B., <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Regarding the second certified question, we conclude in Part III that use of the right-of-way as a recreational trail falls within the scope of the easement. The language of the deed includes no express limitations on the use of the right-of-way; rather, it indicates through its use of terms such as \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cperpetual\u201d that the parties contemplated general use of the land as a way of passage through Montgomery County. In light of our decisions holding that easements for public highways are subject to reasonable changes in mode of transportation and the railroad\u2019s status as a highly regulated public service corporation, recreational trail use of a general use right-of-way is within the legally anticipated scope of the 1911 deed. Finally, the use of the right-of-way as a trail poses no unreasonable burden on the underlying fee simple estate, as it is self-evident that bikers and walkers inflict less of a burden on a right-of-way than a freight railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In Part IV we explain why, as a matter of law, the railroad did not abandon its easement prior to assigning it to Montgomery County in 1988. To the extent that the appellants\u2019 arguments regarding abandonment hinge on their contention that the scope of the easement is limited to railroad purposes, our holding in Part III also disposes of this issue. Even if appellants\u2019 abandonment arguments are not contingent upon a more limited scope, there is insufficient evidence for appellants to meet their burden of proving abandonment. When determining whether thei\u2019e is an abandonment, the fact that the easement is regulated by federal railroad law is a circumstance that may be relevant to the intent to abandon. The railroad\u2019s actions in conformance with federal law cannot supply the decisive and unequivocal act necessary to prove that it abandoned its state law property interest. This is particularly the case when the railroad\u2019s actions were entirely consistent with an intent to sell the right-of-way and when a finding otherwise would mean that the railroad intended to violate federal law, exposing itself to criminal and civil liability, when no evidence would support the finding of such an intent. Finally, appellants presented no other evidence that would be sufficient to support a finding of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The stipulated facts show the following. The property alleged to have been taken and for which the appellants seek compensation is a strip of land approximately one mile long and 100-feet wide, spanning some 12 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland, that lie on either side and across Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase. The mile-long stretch is a segment of an approximately 6.4 mile former railroad line in Montgomery County known as the Georgetown Branch, which runs from Silver Spring southwesterly into the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The land company was founded in 1890 in part to develop the residential area now known as Chevy Chase and it then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>owned all the land relevant to this case. In 1891, the land company and the railroad entered into an agreement whereby the land company would convey the \u201cright-of-way\u201d over the mile-long stretch of land and a second parcel \u201cfor the purposes of a passenger and freight depot.\u201d As part of the agreement, the railroad agreed to erect a passenger station on the second parcel to cost not less than $4,000 (or it would contribute $4,000 toward the land company\u2019s construction of the station), to build the tracks to Connecticut Avenue on or before August 31, 1891, and to charge the land company half rates on freight delivered over the line. The railroad missed the August 31, 1891, deadline, but built that portion of the line in 1892, while the rest of the line was not completed until 1910; it never built the passenger and freight station nor did it pay the $4,000 toward the land company\u2019s construction of the station. In 1909, the Country Club bought more than 125 acres of land from the land company primarily for use as a golf course. The deed conveyed the property in two separate parcels described by metes and bounds with one parcel on each side of the railroad\u2019s right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In 1911, after the railroad line had been constructed and in operation for 19 years, the land company executed a deed conveying to the railroad, \u201cits successors and assigns, a free and perpetual right of way\u201d over the land referred to in the 1891 agreement. The deed also conveyed, in \u201cfee simple,\u201d the parcel of land on which the depot was to have been built. The railroad paid $4,000 for the conveyance, and the deed stated that the 1891 agreement was \u201cmutually abrogated, canceled and set aside, and the [railroad] is hereby released and discharged from the obligation ... of erecting a passenger station to cost not less than Four Thousand (4,000) Dollars.\u201d <em>See </em>Part II.C.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The railroad used the right-of-way for shipping freight continuously from 1892 until 1985, when damage to a bridge on the right-of-way prevented its use. Between 1969 and 1985, however, traffic over the line had decreased by over 90%. In 1983, in conformance with federal law, the railroad posted a notice on the Georgetown Branch that it would be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>subject of an abandonment application before the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). A series of internal corporate decisions were made by the railroad in 1984 and 1985 to abandon service over the Georgetown Branch. On April 9, 1986, the railroad applied to the ICC for authorization to abandon rail service on the line, as required by federal regulation. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10908 (1988);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1152.20-22; and Part IV.A.2. The ICC issued a tentative decision on February 25, 1988, permitting abandonment on condition that the railroad continue to maintain the right-of-way in order to facilitate the possible acquisition of the right-of-way for public use pursuant to the Rails-to-Trails Act, which is codified at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d)(1988)(*ee footnote 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">After the ICC\u2019s tentative decision, Montgomery County began discussions with the railroad about acquiring the right-of-way for a light-rail system as well as a hiker/biker path pursuant to the Rails-to-Trails Act. On December 12, 1988, the ICC approved the purchase and transfer of use of the right-of-way to Montgomery County. Four days later the railroad conveyed the entire Georgetown Branch to Montgomery County by quitclaim deed for the County\u2019s payment of $10 million. As described in more detail in Part IV.A.2., as a result of the ICC\u2019s actions pursuant to the Act, regulatory abandonment of the railroad right-of-way was delayed indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We will provide more facts as we examine each of the certified questions. Additional facts are also available in the opinion of the federal trial court, <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery v. U.S., </em>37 Fed.Cl. 545 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">B. Summary of Arguments and Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The plaintiffs/appellants assert that the 1911 deed conveyed an easement. They further argue that the proposed use of the easement as a hiker/biker trail is beyond its scope, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>which they contend is limited to railroad uses. Alternatively, they contend that the easement was abandoned prior to the railroad\u2019s conveyance of the quitclaim deed to the County. Accordingly, appellants conclude that a reversion of the easement occurred and that they own the right-of-way unencumbered by any other interest. Thus, they are seeking compensation in federal court for the \u201ctaking\u201d of their interest in the right-of-way by Montgomery County under the Rails-to-Trails Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Defendants/appellees Montgomery County and the United States, on the other hand, argue that the 1911 deed conveyed to the railroad an interest in the right-of-way in fee simple absolute and therefore the appellants have had no interest in the property since 1911. Alternatively, should the deed be found to have conveyed an easement, they contend that the use of the right-of-way as a hiker/biker trail pursuant to federal law is within the scope of the easement and that the railroad never abandoned the easement. Accordingly, they conclude that no taking occurred. We are concerned only with the state law property issues and not with the takings claim itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC), where appellants filed their takings claim, found in favor of Montgomery County and the United States. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, supra. </em>The CFC concluded that the 1911 deed conveyed a fee simple absolute and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 565-75. Although that conclusion disposed of the case, the CFC went on, in <em>dicta, </em>to conclude that if it was an easement that was conveyed, the easement was abandoned by the railroad prior to its conveyance to the County. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 575-80. Also in <em>dicta, </em>the CFC stated that the language of the 1911 deed did not limit the scope of the easement to railroad purposes (thereby implying that the use as a hiker/biker trail would not cause a reversion) but that if the deed were limited to railroad purposes, the proposed use would be beyond the scope of the easement, thereby causing a reversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>giving rise to a takings claim. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 585-87. The land company and the Country Club appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which certified the state law property questions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">II. THE RAILROAD\u2019S PROPERTY INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The first question asks whether the 1911 deed conveyed an interest in fee simple absolute or an easement. The question requires that we construe the 1911 deed between the land company and the railroad. We begin with a summary of the principles involved in construing a deed. We then consider how the courts of this State and other states have construed the phrase \u201cright-of-way.\u201d We then apply those principles to the deed conveyed by the land company to the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">A. Basic Principles of Deed Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In construing a deed, we apply the principles of contract interpretation. <em>Buckler v. Davis Sand, Etc., Corp., 221 </em>Md. 532, 537, 158 A.2d 319, 322 (1960). These principles require consideration of \u201c \u2018the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution,\u2019 \u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 436, 727 A.2d 358, 363 (1999)(quoting <em>Pacific Indem. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985)). At least initially, the construction of a deed is a legal question for the court, and on appeal, it is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Calomiris, 353 </em>Md. at 433-35, 727 A.2d at 362-63. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule in the construction of deeds that \u2018the intention of the parties, to be ascertained from the whole contents of the instrument, must prevail unless it violates some principle of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.C. Transit Systems v. S.R.C., </em>259 Md. 675, 686, 270 A.2d 793, 798-99 (1970)(D.C. <em>Transit </em>/)(quoting <em>Marden v. Leimbach, </em>115 Md. 206, 210, 80 A. 958, 959 (1911)). Thus, we must consider the deed as a whole, viewing its language in light of the facts and circumstances of the transaction at issue as well as the governing law at the time of conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>B. Right-of-Way</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In railroad parlance, \u201cthe term \u2018right of way\u2019 has two meanings: in one sense it is \u2018the strip of land upon which the track is laid\u2019; in the other sense it is \u2018the legal right to use such strip,\u2019 and in this sense it usually means the right of way <em>easement.\u201d Ma. &amp; Pa. RR. Co. v. Mer.-Safe, Etc., Co., </em>224 Md. 34, 36-37 n. 1, 166 A.2d 247, 248 n. 1 (1960)(quoting <em>Quinn v. Pere Marquette Ry. Co., </em>256 Mich. 143, 239 N.W. 376, 379 (1931)). <em>See also Joy v. City of St. Louis, </em>138 U.S. 1, 44, 11 S.Ct. 243, 256, 34 L.Ed. 843, 857 (1891)(\u201c[T]he term \u2018right of way\u2019 ... sometimes is used to describe a right belonging to a party, a right of passage over any tract; and it is also used to describe that strip of land which railroad companies take upon which to construct their road-bed.\u201d). <em>Cf. </em>Philip A. Danielson, <em>The Real Property Interest Created In a Railroad Upon Acquisition of Its \u201cRight of Way, </em>\u201d 27 Rocky Mtn. L.Rev. 73, 74 (1954)(noting the two meanings and stating that \u201c[i]n law [right of way] is synonymous with \u2018easement\u2019\u2014a legal concept\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Nevertheless, it has generally been held by courts of this and other states that \u201cdeeds which in the granting clause convey a \u2018right of way\u2019 are held to convey an easement only.\u201d <em>Deed to Railroad Company as Conveying Fee or Easement, </em>Annotation, 6 A.L.R.3d 973, \u00a7 3, at 977 (1966); <em>The Real Property Interest Created In a Railroad Upon Acquisition of Its \u201cRight of Way, </em>\u201d 27 Rocky Mtn. L.Rev. at 84 (\u201c[I]f the conveyance is of a \u2018right of way,\u2019 or of land \u2018for a right of way,\u2019 the courts tend to find an <em>easement </em>\u201d)(emphasis in original; footnote omitted). As explained in Professor Elliott\u2019s 1907 treatise on railroad law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201c \u2018Right of way,\u2019 in its strict meaning, is \u2018the right of passage over another man\u2019s ground;\u2019 and in its legal and generally accepted meaning, in reference to a railway, it is a mere easement in the lands of others, obtained by lawful condemnation to public use or by purchase. It would be using the term in an unusual sense, by applying it to an absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>purchase of the fee-simple of lands to be used for a railway or any other kind of way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">2 Elliott on Railroads \u00a7 1158, at 628 n. 77 (3d. ed,1907)(quoting <em>Williams v. Western Union Railway Company, </em>50 Wis. 71, 5 N.W. 482, 484 (1880)). <em>See also Richfield Oil Corp. v. Chesapeake &amp; Curtis Bay Railroad Co., </em>179 Md. 560, 572, 20 A.2d 581, 587 (1941); <em>D.C. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 688, 270 A.2d at 799 (both quoting Elliott on Railroads).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Maryland courts have often construed deeds of \u201crights-of-way\u201d to railroads as easements or have used the terms \u201ceasement\u201d and \u201cright-of-way\u201d synonymously. <em>See, e.g., D.C. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 689, 270 A.2d at 800 (\u201cThe addition of the language for \u2018a right of way\u2019 in the <em>habendum </em>clause ... makes clear the intent of the parties to grant an easement ----\u201d)(emphasis in original); <em>Richfield Oil Corp., </em>179 Md. at 572, 20 A.2d at 587-88 (quoting 2 Elliott on Railroads \u00a7 1158, at 627-28 (3d ed. 1907))(\u201c Where the intention to convey a fee does not appear, as in case of the conveyance of a \u201cright of way\u201d for the railroad through certain lands, the company takes an easement only.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Greenwalt v. McCardell, </em>178 Md. 132, 136, 12 A.2d 522, 524 (1940)(\u201cWhere a <em>right of way </em>is established by reservation, the land remains the property of the owner of the servient estate, and he is entitled to use it for any purpose that does not interfere with the easemewf.\u201d)(emphasis added); <em>Miceli v. Foley, </em>83 Md.App. 541, 570, 575 A.2d 1249, 1264 (1990)(\u201cAbsent an express intention to convey a fee, a grant of a right of way to a railroad is generally considered to be an easement.\u201d). Our eases are consistent with those of other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The general rule that the terms \u201cright-of-way\u201d and \u201ceasement\u201d are synonymous came about because the rule is consistent with the likely intent of the parties to a deed when the term \u201cright-of-way\u201d is used. As we observed in <em>Green, Tr. v. Eldridge, </em>230 Md. 441, 448, 187 A.2d 674, 678 (1963): \u201cThe fact that the word \u2018easement\u2019 was not used to designate the property interest passing is not of particular significance, since use of the phrase \u2018right of way is generally understood to mean that only an easement is being granted.\u201d <em>See also Pub. Serv. Commn. v. Gas Etc. Corp., </em>162 Md. 298, 312, 159 A. 758, 763 (1932)(quoting <em>Bosley v. Susquehanna Canal, </em>3 Bland 63, 67 (1830))(\u201c \u2018A right of way, whether public or private, is essentially different from a fee simple right to the land itself over which the way passes. A right of way is nothing more than a special and limited right of use.... \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Furthermore, policy considerations support interpreting the conveyance of a \u201cright-of-way\u201d to a railroad as an easement where the intent to convey an estate in fee is not clearly expressed. A great number of railroad corridors have been abandoned in recent years. <em>See Preseault v. ICC, </em>494 U.S. 1, 5, 110 S.Ct. 914, 918, 108 L.Ed.2d 1, 10 (1990)(observing that the nation\u2019s railway system has lost about 130,000 miles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>track since 1920 and noting that \u201cexperts predict that 3,000 miles will be abandoned every year through the end of this century\u201d)(footnote omitted). Whether a right-of-way is construed as an estate in fee simple or an easement has significant implications for the utility of the land upon abandonment. If the deed of a right-of-way is construed as an estate in fee simple, the railroad will retain the right-of-way even after it is no longer used for any transit purposes\u2014effectively severing otherwise contiguous pieces of property, and for no useful purpose. As the Indiana Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIi\">\u201cPublic policy does not favor the conveyance of strips of land by simple titles to railroad companies for right-of-way purposes, either by deed or condemnation. This policy is based upon the fact that the alienation of such strips or belts of land from and across the primary or parent bodies of the land from which they are severed[ ] is obviously not necessary to the purpose for which such conveyances are made after abandonment of the intended uses as expressed in the conveyance, and that thereafter such severance generally operates adversely to the normal and best use of all the property involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>Ross, Inc. v. Legler, </em>245 Ind. 655, 199 N.E.2d 346, 348 (1964). <em>See also The Real Property Interest Created In a Railroad Upon Acquisition of Its \u201cRight of Way, </em>\u201d27 Rocky Mtn. L.Rev. at 74 (observing that construing a right of way as an easement \u201cseems socially more desirable, since it helps clear titles and prevents long narrow strips of agricultural land from being separated from the adjoining farms, with attendant waste and inconvenience.\u201d). We have previously recognized that the construction of a right-of-way as a fee simple would not further any significant interest that is not served by construction as an easement. <em>See D.C. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 688, 270 A.2d at 800 (construing a deed to a railroad as an easement in part because it would not serve any useful purpose to convey \u201ca strip of land 80 feet wide\u201d as an estate in fee); <em>Ma. &amp; Pa. RR. Co., </em>224 Md. at 37, 166 A.2d at 249 (following the \u201cgeneral rule ... that a railroad company acquires only an easement in a right of way by prescription .... [because] the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>user by the railroad requires no more than an easement in the right of way\u201d). <em>See also Daugherty v. Helena &amp; Northwestern Ry., </em>221 Ark. 101, 252 S.W.2d 546 (1952)(holding that a deed conveying a strip of land for a right-of-way created an easement rather than a fee primarily because the parcel would be useful for little else because of its shape); <em>Hartman v. J. &amp; A. Development Co., </em>672 S.W.2d 364 (Mo.Ct.App.1984)(recognizing that long narrow strips of land serve little or no function other than for easements or rights-of-way).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">This is not to say that a deed conveying a \u201cright of way\u201d to a railroad cannot convey an estate in fee simple. It is well settled that a deed to a railroad, even though it characterizes the grant as conveying a right-of-way, may convey an estate in fee simple. <em>See Hodges v. Owings, </em>178 Md. 300, 303, 13 A.2d 338, 339 (1940)(observing that the railroad\u2019s charter authorized it to take an estate in fee). However, when a deed conveying a right-of-way fails to express a clear intent to convey a different interest in land, a presumption arises that an easement was intended. \u201cThe logical rule ... is that where the deed is ambiguous <em>and </em>the granting clause is not specific, references to the interest being conveyed as a right-of-way gives rise to a presumption that an easement was intended.\u201d Danaya C. Wright, <em>Private Rights and Public Ways: Property Disputes and Rails-to-Trails in Indiana, </em>30 Ind. L.Rev. 723, 740 (1997). <em>See also Miceli, </em>83 Md.App. at 571, 575 A.2d at 1265 (\u201cAs there is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that a condemning railroad takes an easement, we hold that the railroad did not acquire a fee simple absolute in the property at issue.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">C. Application to the 1911 Deed</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The deed in question was executed on March 22, 1911, and recorded on April 4, 1911. In pertinent part, the granting clause of the deed states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">\u201c[T]he said party of the first part [the land company] for and in consideration of the sum of FOUR THOUSAND <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(4,000) DOLLARS, to it paid by the said party of the second part, <em>does hereby grant and convey </em>unto the said party of the second part [the railroad], its successors and assigns, <em>a free and perpetual right of way, </em>one hundred (100) feet wide, <em>over the land and premises hereinafter designated as \u2018Parcel A\u2019 </em>and does hereby <em>grant and convey </em>unto the said party of the second part [the railroad], its successors and assigns, <em>in fee simple, the land and premises, hereinafter designated as Parcel </em>B\u2019.... \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The deed then provides a metes and bounds description of Parcel A, the \u201cright-of-way,\u201d and Parcel B, the land granted in \u201cfee simple.\u201d Parcel A is summarized as \u201cbeing a <em>strip of land </em>fifty (50) feet wide on each side of the center line of the Metropolitan Southern Railroad through the land of [t]he Chevy Chase Land Company.. .. \u201d (Emphasis added). The granting clause pertaining to Parcel A is made subject to an \u201cexisting right of way for highway and other purposes over what is known as Connecticut Avenue Extended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The deed\u2019s warranty clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cAND the said party hereto of the first part hereby covenants to warrant specially the property hereby conveyed, and to execute such further assurances of said land as may be requisite.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Finally, the deed provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cin consideration of the execution and delivery of this Deed, and of the payment of the consideration herein expressed, the ... agreement entered into on [April 21, 1891] ... is mutually abrogated, canceled and set aside, and [MSRC] is hereby released and discharged from the obligation set forth in said contract, of erecting a passenger station to cost not less than Four Thousand (4,000) Dollars, or of contributing the sum of Four Thousand (4,000) Dollars toward the erection by ...

The use of the term \u201cright of way,\u201d however, does not <em>ipso facto </em>create an easement; rather the language of the deed must be viewed as a whole in the context of the entire transaction. As explained next, we believe that the express language of the deed in light of the circumstances makes sufficiently clear the intention of the land company and the railroad to create an easement. <em>See Desch v. Knox, </em>253 Md. 307, 310-11, 252 A.2d 815, 817 (1969)(holding deed conveyed \u201cright-of-way\u201d based on the language of the deed); <em>Fedder v. Component Struct. Corp., </em>23 Md.App. 375, 380, 329 A.2d 56, 60 (1974)(holding that the \u201cintention of the parties [to convey an easement was] crystal clear\u201d when deed conveyed a \u201cright-of-way\u201d and \u201c[w]hen the simple language of the contract is considered in the surrounding circumstances.\u201d) We first examine the language of the deed itself and only then turn to the circumstances of the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Initially, we note what is obvious about the deed. The granting clause does not state that a piece of land is being conveyed nor does it provide any indication that an estate in fee simple was intended to be conveyed. The language \u201cfree and perpetual\u201d sheds no light on whether a nonpossessory or possessory interest is being conveyed, since an estate in fee or an easement may be \u201cfree and perpetual.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Real Property Art., \u00a7 4-105 (\u201c[E]very grant or reservation of an easement passes or reserves an easement in perpetuity.\u201d). Rather, the granting clause of the deed directly conveys a \u201cright of way.\u201d The appellees therefore have a high hurdle to overcome in order to demonstrate that the term right-of-way was used \u201cin [the] unusual sense ... [ofj an absolute purchase of the fee-simple of lands.... \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>2 Elliott on Railroads \u00a7 1158, at 628 n. 77 (3d ed.l907)(quoting <em>Williams, </em>5 N.W. at 484).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">That hurdle is elevated upon further examination and a contrasting of the deed\u2019s dual granting clauses. The two granting clauses each declare the land company\u2019s intent to \u201chereby grant and convey.\u201d First, the land company conveyed \u201ca free and perpetual <em>right of way, </em>one hundred (100) feet wide, over the land and premises hereinafter designated as \u2018Parcel A.\u2019 \u201d Second, the land company conveyed to MSRC \u201cin fee simple, the land and premises, hereinafter designated as \u2018Parcel B.\u2019 \u201d Appellees contend that because each clause contains the word \u201cgrant\u201d the land company intended to pass an estate in fee simple even though the first clause grants a \u201cright of way\u201d while the second clause conveys the \u201cland and premises\u201d in \u201cfee simple.\u201d The CFC concluded that the use of the term \u201cfee simple\u201d in reference to Parcel B merely referenced duration of the estate conveyed and not the estate itself. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 571. Relying in part on extrinsic evidence, the CFC concluded that the language \u201cfee simple\u201d in reference to Parcel B was synonymous with the term \u201cperpetual\u201d in reference to Parcel A and thus both granting clauses conveyed estates in fee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We believe that the CFC\u2019s and appellees\u2019 construction of the deed is overly strained. If the land company intended to convey estates in fee over both parcels, it would have been unnecessary to include two separate granting clauses. Moreover, given that two granting clauses were used, if they had intended to convey the same interest, we believe the author of the deed would have used the same language. Neither the CFC nor appellees explain why different language was used if the intent was to convey the same interest in both parcels. To hold that both Parcel A and Parcel B conveyed estates in fee would be to ignore what we believe is self-evident from the deed: that the parties intended to convey different interests, one for the \u201cright of way\u201d designated as Parcel A and the other for \u201cthe land and premises\u201d in \u201cfee simple\u201d and designated as Parcel B. If the intent was to convey Parcel A as an estate in fee, no drafting hurdles would have prevented mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ing such intent explicit. <em>Cf. United States v. 1.44 Acres of Land, Etc., Montgomery County, Md., </em>304 F.Supp. 1063, 1071 (D.Md.1969)(applying Maryland law)(\u201c[A] legal draftsman ... would not use such [right-of-way] language to convey a fee title to a railroad.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Appellees further attempt to bootstrap the description of Parcel A as a \u201cparcel of land\u201d into the granting clause to show that an estate in fee of the right-of-way was intended to be conveyed. As noted above, the description of Parcel A is found in a separate paragraph of the deed, which summarizes Parcel A as a \u201cparcel of land ... being a strip of land fifty (50) feet wide on each side of the center line of the Metropolitan Southern Railroad through the land of [t]he Chevy Chase Land Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We disagree as to the implications of the language \u201cparcel of land\u201d in the description of \u201cParcel A\u201d in the deed. The language is used in the portion of the deed establishing the <em>location </em>of the right-of-way, not the interest granted. Language used in a descriptive clause is less important than the language of the granting clause in denoting what interest in land is conveyed by a deed. <em>See Marden, </em>115 Md. at 209, 80 A. at 959 (observing that, when determining the interest conveyed by a deed, in the case of conflict the granting clause generally prevails over the habendum clause). Indeed, the granting clause for Parcel B explicitly stated that what was being conveyed was \u201cthe land and premises\u201d while the disputed grant was of a \u201cright of way ... <em>over </em>the land and premises.\u201d (Emphasis added). Furthermore, as discussed next, in previous eases we have construed language similar to the \u201cparcel of land\u201d language upon which appellees rely. In these cases the deed language was found not in a descriptive clause but in the granting clause itself, and we nevertheless found that the deed conveyed an easement in lieu of the reference to! the interest as a \u201cright-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>Green, </em>the deed was entitled a \u201cRight of Way Deed.\u201d 230 Md. at 447-48, 187 A.2d at 677. The granting clause conveyed in fee simple \u201c\u2018the free and uninterrupted use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>liberty and privilege of, and passageway in and along a certain right of way....\u201d\u2019 Despite the reference to the grant in \u201cfee simple,\u201d we concluded based on the entire instrument and the circumstances of the transaction that the deed granted an easement only, \u201cwith the fee remaining in the original grantor, his heirs and assigns.\u201d <em>Green, </em>230 Md. at 448, 187 A.2d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Another example is <em>East Wash. Railway v. Brooke, </em>244 Md. 287, 223 A.2d 599 (1966). In that case, the granting clause of the deed conveyed a \u201c <em>\u2018strip of land </em>for a right of way through said lands.\u2019\u201d <em>Brooke, </em>244 Md. at 293, 223 A.2d at 603 (emphasis added). A description of the strip of land summarized it as being \u201c \u2018land sixty feet in width ... as now located and used <em>for railroad purposes.\u2019 \u201d Brooke, </em>244 Md. at 294, 223 A.2d at 603 (emphasis in original). Even though the granting clause conveyed a \u201cstrip of land\u201d (which seems synonymous with \u201cparcel of land\u201d), we concluded that \u201c[i]t is plain that the conveyance was of an easement for railway purposes and use only.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">A final example is <em>D.G. Transit I, supra. </em>In that case, the deed we interpreted \u201c \u2018grant[ed] and convey[ed] ... all the piece or parcel of land\u2019 \u201d described in the deed. <em>D.G. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 679, 270 A.2d at 795. The habendum clause stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201c \u2018To have and hold the same unto and to the use of ... [the railroad company] <em>for a right of way </em>and such other purposes as said Railway Company is authorized under its act of incorporation ... and the General Incorporation Law of this State to acquire, dispose of or deal in real estate.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\"><em>D.G. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 680, 270 A.2d at 795. The granting clause thus conveyed <em>\u201call </em>the piece or parcel of land\u201d (emphasis added) with the only reference to the \u201cright-of-way\u201d being in the habendum and not the granting clause. Moreover, the deed explicitly stated that the right-of-way could be used for purposes for which the railroad company was authorized under the law, and the deed itself noted that such authorization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>included the acquisition and disposal of real estate. Nevertheless, we concluded based on the deed language and the circumstances that the parties intended to convey an easement only. We observed that the statute authorizing the railroad to acquire and dispose of real estate was for the purpose of \u201claying out town sites, erecting buildings and opening and working quarries\u201d and \u201ca strip of land 80 feet wide is hardly a town site .... [and] is an unlikely place for the erection of buildings of consequence.\u201d <em>D.C. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 688, 270 A.2d at 800. Moreover, we observed that the use of the term \u201cright of way\u201d in the habendum clause was \u201cobviously intended to have some meaning [and] makes clear the intent of the parties to grant an easement.\u201d <em>D.C. Transit </em>I, 259 Md. at 689, 270 A.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">That the deed in this case conveys an easement and not an estate in fee follows, <em>a fortiori, </em>from <em>G-reen, Brooke, </em>and <em>D.C. Transit I. </em>Unlike <em>Green, </em>in the instant case there is no express language suggesting that the right-of-way was conveyed in \u201cfee simple\u201d (even though Parcel B was conveyed \u201cin fee simple\u201d). Furthermore, we do not see any legally significant difference between the \u201cstrip of land\u201d in <em>Brooke </em>and the \u201cparcel of land\u201d in this case, and, unlike the instant case where the express grant was of a \u201cright of way,\u201d the grant in <em>Brooke </em>was expressly of a \u201cstrip of land.\u201d Therefore, the deed in <em>Brooke </em>provided a much stronger reason under appellees\u2019 analysis to conclude that an estate in fee simple was conveyed rather than a servitude. We nevertheless found it \u201cplain\u201d in <em>Brooke </em>that the grant conveyed an easement only.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Finally, that the 1911 deed conveyed an easement seems compelled by our holding in <em>D.C. Transit I, </em>where the granting clause conveyed \u201call the piece or parcel of land\u201d and the only reference to a right-of-way was in the deed\u2019s habendum clause. The deed in the instant case contains nearly identical language as in <em>D.C. Transit I </em>(\u201cright of way\u201d and \u201cparcel of land\u201d), but it more clearly indicates an easement was granted than <em>D.C. Transit I </em>since the granting clause directly conveys a right-of-way and the only reference to a \u201cparcel of land\u201d is in the descriptive clause\u2014the opposite locations in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>phrases were used in the deed at issue in <em>D.C. Transit I. </em>Therefore we find unconvincing appellees\u2019 creative attempt to argue that, given the definition of Parcel A as a \u201cparcel of land\u201d in the descriptive clause, the \u201cright of way\u201d in the granting clause refers not to the legal right to use the land but rather to the strip of land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The circumstances and positions of the parties to the 1911 deed confirm that the deed conveyed an easement and not an interest in fee simple absolute. Both the CFC and appellees emphasize the lack of conditional language in the 1911 deed restricting the uses of the right-of-way or setting forth its purposes. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 569 (emphasizing \u201cthe outright grant of the right-of-way and the absence of purpose limitations\u201d). They argue that the lack of conditional language in the 1911 deed is what distinguishes the term \u201cright-of-way\u201d in that deed from the rights of way in the numerous Maryland cases that were construed to be easements. For example, the CFC stated that \u201c[t]he 1911 deed does not even refer to the word \u2018railroad,\u2019 let alone restrict the use of the land to railroad purposes.\u201d <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 571. Turning to evidence extrinsic to the deed, the CFC supported its conclusion by quoting from other deeds executed by the land company to railroad companies that conveyed easements which contained purpose language. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 570. For example, the court quotes from a deed stating that the \u201cright-of-way\u201d is subject to the railroad \u201cconstruct[ing] and completing] and commencing] regular operations] within nine months\u201d and another deed conveying a \u201cright of way for the purpose of constructing and operating the railroad.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">While the CFC and appellees correctly point out that there are no purpose limitations in the 1911 deed, they entirely overlook the fact that the railway for which the conveyance was executed had already been built and was in operation for nearly 20 years prior to the 1911 conveyance. Thus, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the right-of-way deeds examined in our prior cases, and unlike the land company\u2019s deeds to other railroads, the 1911 deed did not convey an undeveloped railroad corridor but rather a railway that had been in existence for quite some time. As a result, there was little need to state in the deed the purposes for which the right-of-way was conveyed. Regardless, contrary to the intimations of appellees and the CFC, our prior cases have never stated that a right-of-way deed must include purpose language. Rather, we have looked to the circumstances and positions of the parties. In this case, the fact that both parties to the deed were well aware that the right-of-way was to be used for a freight and passenger railroad that had been in operation for many years overcomes any need for limiting language in the deed itself for purposes of creating an easement as opposed to an estate in fee simple absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Furthermore, construing the deed to convey an easement is consistent with the 1891 agreement between the land company and the railroad. That agreement was made \u201cin contemplation of] the construction of a line of road ... to traverse the property\u201d of the land company. It further explained the land company\u2019s intention \u201cto donate and convey to the said railroad company a right of way 100 feet wide.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1891 agreement also required the railroad to construct a passenger and freight depot on the tract of land that in the 1911 deed was denoted as \u201cParcel B,\u201d or, if the railroad did not construct the depot, the agreement provided that it would contribute $4,000 toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the cost of the land company\u2019s construction of the depot. The agreement was never recorded. After the agreement, the railroad constructed the railway but it never built the passenger and freight depot on Parcel B. The CFC concluded that \u201cit is fairly clear that [the 1891 agreement] contemplated the conveyance of an easement.\u201d <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Despite its conclusion that the 1891 agreement contemplated an easement, the CFC considered extrinsic evidence to conclude that the 1911 deed conveyed an interest in fee simple absolute. The CFC relied on a 1910 letter from a land company official referencing the conveyance to occur in the next year. The letter stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201c \u2018the arrangement was that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company pay to the Chevy Chase Land Company Four Thousand Dollars in cash, and in consideration of this payment, have conveyed to it, <em>all the property covered by its right of way contract </em>with the Land Company, entered into some years ago.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\"><em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 572. The CFC concluded that the letter \u201cindicates\u201d that the 1911 conveyance was to involve estates in land and not an easement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that this letter was properly used to construe the interest that was conveyed in the deed, we fail to see the letter\u2019s significance in determining whether the right-of-way in the 1911 deed conveyed an estate or an easement. The use of the language in the letter \u201call the property\u201d is no more convincing as to intent to convey in fee simple than appellees\u2019 arguments rejected earlier relating to the description of the right-of-way as a \u201cparcel of land.\u201d As we see it, the letter has less significance than the language in the deed describing Parcel A as a \u201cparcel of land.\u201d The letter\u2019s statement of intent to \u201cconvey[] all the property covered by its right of way contract\u201d can be interpreted as an intent to convey an easement just as convincingly as it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>interpreted to show an intent to convey an estate in fee simple absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Appellees contend that the 1891 agreement should not be considered because it was \u201cmutually abrogated, canceled and set aside\u201d in the 1911 deed. Indeed, as discussed above, we need not turn to the 1891 agreement to reach our conclusion that an easement was conveyed in the 1911 deed. However, the abrogation language of the 1911 deed was \u201cin consideration of the execution and delivery\u201d of the new deed. Thus, it is relevant to the 1911 deed since it supplied consideration for the transaction. Moreover, the relevant portion of the deed states in full that the 1891 agreement is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">\u201cmutually abrogated, canceled and set aside, <em>and </em>[MSRC] is hereby released and discharged from the obligation set forth in said contract, of erecting a passenger station to cost not less than Four Thousand (4,000) Dollars, or of contributing the sum of Four Thousand (4,000) Dollars toward the erection by ...

We applied this principle in <em>Hodges, supra, </em>where we found that a deed to a railroad conveyed an easement. We noted that \u201c[t]he purpose of the grantee was the building of a railroad, in which the grantor was willing to cooperate with the grantee <em>by a gift of this piece of right of ruay.\u201d Hodges, </em>178 Md. at 304, 13 A.2d at 340 (emphasis added). <em>See also Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Co. v. Northwestern Pac. R. Co., </em>73 Cal.App.2d 917, 167 P.2d 825, 830 (1946)(\u201c[T]he fact that no monetary consideration, or only nominal monetary consideration was paid for the grant is a factor of considerable importance indicating that the grant conveys an easement and not a limited fee.\u201d); <em>Weeks v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, </em>505 S.W.2d 33, 37-38 (Mo.1974)(finding that deed conveyed an easement interest based in part on evidence that defendant paid no consideration for the grant).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Appellees argue unconvincingly that the $4,000 the railroad paid to the land company was for an estate in fee simple of the land occupied by the right-of-way and not for release from the obligation in the 1891 agreement to expend or pay that amount for the construction of a passenger depot. They go on to contend that the $4,000 for Parcels A and B was more than nominal consideration, which they argue demonstrates that the deed conveyed an estate in fee simple. The CFC apparently accepted appellees\u2019 arguments, finding \u201cmore than nominal consideration,\u201d but it went on to conclude that the \u201cconsideration tendered does not militate in either direction.\u201d <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 573-74. We disagree that the consideration was more than nominal and believe the lack of more than nominal consideration further militates toward construing the deed to convey an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We must look no further than the deed itself to see that the consideration paid was nominal. The granting clause states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>that the property conveyed by the land company was \u201cin consideration of FOUR THOUSAND (4,000) DOLLARS.\u201d As noted above, the deed provides that \u201cin consideration of the execution and delivery of this Deed,\u201d the land company would release MSRC from its contractual obligation to pay $4,000 for the construction or the land company\u2019s construction of a passenger depot. Thus, the railroad paid $4,000 for release of a $4,000 contractual obligation <em>and </em>the conveyances of Parcel A and Parcel B, which were promised to be conveyed in the agreement of 1891. In lieu of its outstanding $4,000 contractual obligation, the consideration the railroad paid for the property was clearly nominal, which supports our interpretation of the deed as conveying an easement. In sum, we do not believe, as the appellees intimate and the CFC apparently accepted, that it was sheer coincidence that the $4,000 the railroad paid for the 1911 deed was of the same amount as the railroad\u2019s outstanding $4,000 contractual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Finally, we are unconvinced by appellees\u2019 arguments that the Maryland statute in effect in 1911 suggests that the deed conveyed a fee simple estate. That statute declares that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">\u201c[t]he word \u2018grant,\u2019 the phrase \u2018bargain and sell,\u2019 in a deed, or any other words purporting to transfer the whole estate of the grantor shall be construed to pass to the grantee the whole interest and estate of the grantor in the lands therein mentioned, unless there be limitations or reservations showing, by implication or otherwise, a different intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Md.Code (1904), Art. 21, \u00a7 12. Appellees contend that the statute applies because of the use of the term \u201cgrant\u201d in the 1911 deed. As described above, the limitations in the 1911 deed are inherent in the grant of a right-of-way to a railroad company. Thus, \u201cthere [are] limitations or reservations showing, by implication or otherwise, a different intent\u201d than to convey the whole estate of the grantor. <em>Id. </em>Our previous cases construing deeds to railroad companies containing the term \u201cgrant\u201d nevertheless have concluded that the instruments conveyed easements and not estates in fee, notwithstanding the statute relied on by appellees. <em>See Brooke, </em>244 Md. at 293, 223 A.2d at 603 (noting Article 21\u2019s \u201cprinciple that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the word \u2018grant\u2019 must be construed to pass all of the grantor\u2019s interest unless there are indications otherwise\u201d but concluding nevertheless that deed to railroad using term \u201cgrant\u201d conveyed an easement); <em>Richfield Oil Corp., supra </em>(refusing to apply statute to deed using term \u201cgrant\u201d to convey a \u201cright of way\u201d); <em>Hodges, </em>178 Md. at 303-04, 13 A.2d at 339-40 (refusing to apply the statute when deed used term \u201cgrant\u201d but language showed that grantor \u201cgave the [railroad] a right of way,\u201d which conveyed an easement); <em>Ross v.

Our cases and the cases from other states consistently have construed deeds to railroads of \u201crights-of-way\u201d as conveying easements and not estates in fee simple absolute. The language of the deed at issue in this case provides no reason to deviate from our previous cases. This is especially the case in light of the dual granting clauses of Parcel A, conveying a \u201cright of way\u201d and Parcel B, conveying the parcel \u201cin fee simple.\u201d Finally, the circumstances of the deed confirm the conclusion that the deed conveyed an easement only. In particular, the fact that the railway had already been built and was in operation obviated any need for limiting language in the deed to indicate that less than a fee simple was being conveyed, and the nominal consideration given the land company by the railroad is a factor more consistent with the conveyance of an easement than an estate in fee simple absolute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>III. THE SCOPE OF THE EASEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Since we have determined that the 1911 deed granted an easement, we must now consider the second certified question regarding the scope of the easement. We initially determine whether the express language of the deed limits the available uses of the right-of-way. After that determination, we consider the extent to which Maryland common law on railroad easements imposes any implied limits on use of the right-of-way that would prevent the right-of-way in the instant case from being used for a hiker/biker trail. This part then concludes with an examination of whether the use of the right-of-way for a hiker/biker trail unreasonably increases the burden of the easement on the servient estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>A. Interpretation of the 1911 Deed</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Appellants contend that the proposed interim use of the right-of-way as a hiker/biker trail is beyond the scope of the easement. Instead of the language of the deed, appellants emphasize the circumstances at the time of the original agreement between the railroad and the land company in 1891, contending that the \u201cevidence is clear\u201d that the land company intended that the easement was for purposes of freight railroad only. The land company cites the <em>Brooke </em>and <em>D.C. Transit I </em>decisions as support for its view that when a right-of-way is conveyed to a railroad, it is <em>ipso facto </em>restricted to railroad uses. Appellees, on the other hand, emphasize the deed itself, which contains no express limitations on the right-of-way conveyed. They contend that the easement was for a right-of-way to be used for general transportation purposes and that its use as a recreational trail is consistent with those purposes and imposes no additional burden on the servient estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We agree with appellees that the primary consideration in construing the scope of an express easement is the language of the grant. \u201c[T]he extent of the rights [of an easement acquired by express grant] must necessarily depend upon a proper construction of the conveyance or that part of it by which the easement was created.\u201d <em>Parker v. T &amp; C Dev. Corp., </em>281 Md. 704, 709, 381 A.2d 679, 682 (1978)(quoting <em>Buckler, </em>221 Md. at 537, 158 A.2d at 322). <em>See also Reid v. Washington Gas Lt. Co., </em>232 Md. 545, 549, 194 A.2d 636, 638 (1963)(stating that the \u201cscope of the easement is to be determined from the language of the grant\u201d); 4 Powell on Real Property \u00a7 34.12[2], at 34-178 (1998 Supp.)(observing that courts interpreting easements conveyed by express grant \u201cstress the primary control exercised by the language of the creating conveyance\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">No language in the deed in the instant case suggests that the right-of-way was limited to railroad purposes only (and much less so to <em>freight </em>railroad purposes, as the land company contends). The deed conveyed a \u201cfree and perpetual right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>way.\u201d The use of the terms \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cperpetual\u201d provide a clear indication that few, if any, conditions were intended to be placed on the railroad\u2019s use of the right-of-way. \u201c[F]ree\u201d is defined as \u201c[n]ot [being] subject to [the] legal constraint of another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 663 (6th ed.1990). The use of the term \u201cperpetual\u201d clearly indicates that the easement was intended to be of indefinite duration and, particularly when combined with the term \u201cfree,\u201d suggests that the use of the easement was to be dynamic, <em>i.e., </em>adaptable to the evolving circumstances and transit needs of those intended to benefit from the right-of-way\u2014in particular the general public whom the land company was attempting to attract to the areas served by the railroad. The language making the easement transferable to \u201csuccessors and assigns\u201d further supports a broad construction of the deed language.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Unlike many of the grants of easements that we have addressed in the past, the deed in the instant case does not suggest any limit on the use of the right-of-way. It is clear that a right of passage was granted, and, as noted above in Part II.C.3, the circumstances clearly indicate that the original instrumentality was a railroad. But nowhere in the granting clause or. elsewhere in the deed does the language suggest that a railroad was the only instrumentality for use of the perpetual right-of-way. For example, nowhere does language \u201cfor railroad purposes\u201d appear, and there are no other express limitations on the use of the right-of-way. <em>Cf. Brooke, </em>244 Md. at 294, 223 A.2d at 603 (concluding that deed language <em>\u201cfor railroad purposes </em>\u201d limits scope of right-of-way). Even if we consider the 1891 agreement to convey the right-of-way to the railroad, that agreement includes no express limitations; it states only that the agreement was made \u201cin contemplation of] the construction of a line of road ... to traverse the property\u201d of the land company. As the Minnesota Supreme Court observed in addressing the scope of an easement granted to a railroad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201c[N]one of the deeds expressly limit the easement to railroad purposes, provide that the interest conveyed terminates if use for railroad purposes ceases, or provide that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>easement would exist only for so long as the right-of-way was used for railroad purposes. While the grantors were undoubtedly aware that a railroad would be constructed on the land, none of the deeds limit the use to railroad purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>State by Wash. Wildlife Preservation v. State, </em>329 N.W.2d 543, 546 (Minn.), <em>cert. denied </em>463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3540, 77 L.Ed.2d 1390 (1983). In sum, it seems undisputable that the deed sweeps broadly by conveying an interest that is \u201cfree and perpetual\u201d and making it freely transferable to \u201csuccessors and assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">While the deed presents no express limitations on the use of the right-of-way, that does not end our analysis. Keeping in mind the broad language in the grant, we must determine whether the appellees have the right to substitute, at least for the interim, the use of the right-of-way as a recreational trail for the previous use of the right-of-way as a railroad corridor. We must consider whether the use of the right-of-way as a hiker/biker trail is of the same quality of use as anticipated in the original grant and whether it imposes any unreasonable new burdens on the dominant tenement. Before analyzing those questions, we note that because of the broad language of the grant any doubts about its use will be resolved in favor of the grantee, <em>i.e., </em>the railroad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201cIf the grant contains no limitations, the court will attempt to discern what the parties would have reasonably expected, and will usually be generous in its interpretation. The language of the easement can grant to the easement holder a good deal of discretion in the use of the easement or limit the use very narrowly; if the grant is not clear, the court will interpret the scope of the easement in favor of \u2018free and untrammeled use of the land.\u2019\u201d (Footnotes and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">7 Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 60.04(a), at 451 (Thomas ed.1994). <em>See also Washington Gas Lt.

In <em>Whalen, </em>we accepted the notion that a railroad is \u201c \u2018obliged to use its powers and privileges for the benefit of the public, and in aid of the public good.\u2019 \u201d 108 Md. at 21, 69 A. at 393 (quoting the appellant\u2019s brief). Indeed, as the CFG acknowledged, the statutes in place at the time of the conveyance did not restrict railroad corporations to conducting rail service only. <em>See Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 585-86. For example, Maryland law empowered the legislature to \u201cregulate, modify or change the control, use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and estate of any rail road constructed by such corporation, in such manner as it may deem equitable towards the said corporation and <em>necessary to ike accommodation of the public travel or use of the said rail road or rail roads.\u201d </em>Md.Code (1860), Corporations Art., \u00a7 71 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Chapter 231 \u00a7 1 of the Act of 1882 (authorizing railroad to engage in telegraph business); Ch. 279 of the Acts of 1880 (railroad authorized to operate other railroads and works facilitating commerce). Because the public nature of the railroad business was obvious at the time of the 1911 deed, we must assume that the land company knew that its grant was subject to reasonable accommodations for the public use and that, if it wanted to limit the uses of the right-of-way to rail use only, it would have included appropriate limiting language in its deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">We have long considered a railroad line as analogous to a public highway. <em>Whalen, </em>108 Md. at 21, 69 A. at 393 (\u201cA railroad is in many essential respects a public highway, and the rules of law applicable to one are generally applicable to the other.\u201d); <em>Hessey v. Capital Transit Co., </em>193 Md. 265, 272, 66 A.2d 787, 790 (1949)(observing that \u201ca railroad company, organized and conducted for private corporate profit, ... devot[es] its property to the use of the public\u201d). Just like highways, railroad lines are subject to public use as is evidenced by their common carrier obligations. And railroads historically have had the power of eminent domain, a power reserved only to the government and those the government has annointed. Thus, our cases interpreting the scope of public highways provide a solid framework upon which to construe the grant of a general use \u201cright-of-way\u201d to a railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Our highway cases have construed easements for public highways as including within their scope changing means of transportation. In <em>Baltimore County Water &amp; Electric Co. v. Dubreuil, </em>105 Md. 424, 66 A. 439 (1907), we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A47\">\u201cwe have been governed by the fact that such [electric railway] uses, of both streets and rural highways, were only new modes of travel and transportation, and the right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>originally acquired, to use them was not simply for the then existing modes, but for all such as might arise in the ordinary course of improvement. It could therefore be presumed that such improved modes of travel and transportation were within the contemplation of the parties.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">105 Md. at 431, 66 A. at 441. About a decade earlier, in <em>Poole v. Falls Road Electric Ry. Co., </em>88 Md. 533, 41 A. 1069 (1898), we noted that the purpose of a highway easement is for \u201cpassing and repassing\u201d and only when a use is \u201cnot incident to such right of passage\u201d does it create an additional servitude. 88 Md. at 537, 41 A. at 1071. We therefore concluded that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\u201ctest ... of what is a new use would seem to be found not necessarily in the nature of the structure nor in the number of the tracks but in the use itself; whether it is promotive of the objects and purposes for which the easement in the public was acquired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em>Id.

In <em>Peddicord v. B., C. &amp; E.M.R.R. Co., </em>34 Md. 463 (1871), we held that a right-of-way conveyed to a turnpike company could be used for a horse railway for passengers even though \u201cit was not actually contemplated by any of the parties to the acquisition and grant.\u201d 34 Md. at 480-81. We recognized that the turnpike company had a perpetual easement over the highway, lasting \u201cforever,\u201d and we observed that its conversion to a horse railway was an appropriate improvement \u201cconsistent with its character and purpose as a public highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that the conversion to horse railway did not cause an additional burden on the land or operate to impair the incidental rights of the dominant tenement. <em>Id. See also Hodges v. Balto. Union P. Ry.

In <em>Koch v. North-Ave. R.R. Co., 75 </em>Md. 222, 23 A. 463 (1892) and <em>Green v. City &amp; Suburban R.R.

As the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201crailroads are not viewed strictly as private corporations since they are publicly regulated common carriers. Essentially, a railroad is a highway dedicated to the public use.

Compatibility of Trail Use with Prior Uses</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">As discussed above, the starting point for determining whether the current use of the Georgetown Branch as a hiker/biker trail is compatible with its prior use is the deed itself. The phrase \u201cright-of-way\u201d as used in the context of the grant is a \u201cright belonging to a party to pass over land of another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1326 (6th ed.1990). Since the deed contains no limits on the use of the right-of-way, we apply the rule that \u201c[a] grant in general terms of an easement of way will ordinarily be construed as creating a general right of way capable of use in connection with the dominant tenement for all reasonable purposes.\u201d 3 Herbert Thorndike Tiffany, The Law of Real Property \u00a7 803, at 322 (3d ed.l939)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We believe it indisputable that use of the right-of-way as a trail is consistent with its essential nature relating to the \u201cpassing] over land of another\u201d and is a reasonable use of a general right of way. Accordingly, the scope of the right-of-way in the instant case encompasses use as a hiker/biker trail. It follows from our cases that the fact that a recreational trail may not have been actually contemplated by the parties when the deed was conveyed in 1911 is not outcome determinative. Rather, we assume that the parties anticipated that the use of the right-of-way would conform over time to the reasonable demands of the public. Just like the highway easement in <em>Peddicord </em>lasted \u201cforever,\u201d the deed in this case was made \u201cperpetual,\u201d and although use as a hiker/biker trail \u201cwas not actually contemplated by any of the parties to the acquisition and grant, ... it may be said to have been within the legal contemplation of all that it was to be used for all purposes by which the object of its creation, as a public highway, could be promoted.\u201d <em>Peddicord, </em>34 Md. at 480-81. In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the use of the right-of-way as a public trail was legally contemplated by the parties to the 1911 deed and is of the same nature as the public railway in existence for some 90 years, <em>i.e., </em>the use involves the passage over land consistent with the needs of the public. The 1891 contract and 1911 deed both clearly anticipated that the right-of-way would be put to use for public transportation, as evidenced by the plans to build a \u201cpassenger station\u201d (the 1911 deed) or a \u201cfreight and passenger depot\u201d (the 1891 agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Use of the right-of-way as a hiker/biker trail constitutes a change in instrumentality consistent with the essential purpose anticipated at the time of the original grant in 1911\u2014 passage through Silver Spring, Chevy Chase, and Bethesda.

The Reasonableness of the Burden</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We must next consider whether use of the right-of-way as a hiker/biker trail unreasonably increases the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>den on the underlying fee simple estates. It is \u201cthe generally accepted rule that since an easement is a restriction upon the rights of the servient property owner, no alteration can be made by the owner of the dominant estate which would increase such restriction except by mutual consent of both parties.\u201d <em>Washington Gas Lt. Co., </em>232 Md. at 548-49, 194 A.2d at 638. <em>See also W. Arlington L. Co. v.

As we explained in <em>Washington Gas Lt.

That use of the right-of-way by bikers and walkers poses less of a burden than the use required by a freight train is obvious. Bikers and walkers, even in large groups, simply cannot be said to be more burdensome than locomotive engines pulling truck-sized railroad cars through the corridor. \u201cThe legitimate burden presented by frequent, loud, and even dangerous, railroad use far outstrips any burden presented by foot or bicycle traffic.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>730 P.2d at 1320 (Utter, J., dissenting). <em>See also Barney, </em>490 N.W.2d at 733 (observing that conversion from railway to recreational trail poses \u201c[n]o greater burden ... on the servient estate.\u201d) Moreover, the conversion from a railway to a trail is consistent with the general rule of property law that easements are non-exclusive. <em>Wagner v. Doehring, </em>315 Md. 97, 104, 553 A.2d 684, 687 (1989)(\u201c[T]he holder of a right-of-way does not ordinarily have exclusive use of the way.\u201d). On the other hand, an easement held by a railroad tends to exclude use of the easement by the owner of the servient tenement. <em>See, e.g., State v. Preseault, </em>163 Vt. 38, 652 A.2d 1001, 1003 (1994)(\u201c[T]he holder of a railroad easement enjoys the right to the exclusive occupancy of the land, and has the right to exclude all concurrent occupancy in any mode and for any purpose.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Richley, </em>55 Ohio St.2d 142, 378 N.E.2d 472, 475 (1978)(\u201cThere can be no greater burden upon property than that which results from [a railroad\u2019s] appropriation of a right to exclusive use.\u201d); <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company v.

Thus, the change in use in this case actually decreases the burden on the servient tenement because, <em>inter alia, </em>the shift is from an exclusive to a non-exclusive use. In this case, the owners of the underlying fee estates with property abutting the Georgetown Branch have access to a corridor to which they did not have access prior to conversion to a trail. <em>See also </em>Marc A. Sennewald, <em>The Nexus of Federal and State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Law in Railroad Abandonments, </em>51 Vand.

Indeed, that hiking and biking may be recreational in addition to fulfilling transportation needs is not all that different from the enjoyment that some derive from driving a car or even riding a train; the enjoyment that some derive from those activities does not detract from their essential character as transportation-related. Indeed, by the very nature of the right-of-way\u2014 a confined, narrow strip of land\u2014the \u201crecreational\u201d use is limited to those uses involving <em>transportation </em>itself, including biking, running, and walking, each of which involves moving from one place to another. <em>Cf D.C. Transit I, </em>259 Md. at 688, 270 A.2d at 800 (observing that the useful purpose of \u201ca strip of land 80 feet wide\u201d is limited); <em>Ma. &amp; Pa. RR., </em>224 Md. at 36-37, 166 A.2d at 248-50 (making a similar observation).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">E. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The right-of-way in the instant case is affected by the public interest. That railroad companies are in the nature public service corporations has been a constant theme of statutory and case law, and we have recognized the public nature of such easements in our jurisprudence regarding the scope of public easements well before the conveyance of the deed in the instant case. <em>See </em>Part III.B., <em>supra. </em>The public policies have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>been evidenced by the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme that governs many aspects of the railroad business <em>(see </em>Part IV. A.2, infra), by a railroad\u2019s status as a common carrier, and by state regulation, even at the time the right-of-way was deeded to the railroad in this case. <em>See generally Benson v. Public Service Comm,., </em>141 Md. 398, 118 A. 852 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Federal and state laws explicitly recognize the value to the general public of railroad rights-of-way. The federal Rails-to~Trails Act, which serves as the impetus for this lawsuit, is an obvious example of the perceived public value of railroad corridors. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d); <em>Preseault, </em>494 U.S. at 18, 130 S.Ct. at 925,108 L.Ed.2d at 17 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 98-28, at 8 (1983) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1983 at 112, 119)(upholding the Act as a legitimate exercise of congressional power and observing that \u201cCongress intended \u2018to preserve established railroad rights-of-way for future reactivation of rail service, to protect rail transportation corridors, and to encourage energy efficient transportation use\u2019 \u201d). The Maryland legislature has also recognized the public value of railroad rights-of-way. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1997 Repl.Vol.) Natural Resources Art., \u00a7 5-1010(a)(2)(\u201cAbandoned railroad corridor property is a unique source of land corridors that are, in many cases, suitable for recreational trails.\u201d); Md.Code (1977, 1993 RepLVol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 7-901 (authorizing the state to acquire railroad corridor property). Thus, our holding furthers, rather than frustrates, legitimate state and federal policy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Our conclusion here also is consistent with the decisions of courts in other states that have held that trail use falls within the scope of the right-of-way conveyed to the railroad. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Preseault, </em>some rights of way \u201care held as easements that do not even as a matter of state law revert upon interim use as nature trails.\u201d 494 U.S. at 16, 110 S.Ct. at 924, 108 L.Ed.2d at 16 (citation omitted). For example, in <em>State by Wash. Wildlife Preservation, supra, </em>the Minnesota Supreme Court construed a giant of a right-of-way to a railroad that included no express limitations. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>concluded that \u201c[u]se of the right-of-way as a recreational trail is consistent with the purpose for which the easement was originally acquired, public travel, and it imposes no additional burden on the servient estates.\u201d 329 N.W.2d at 545. <em>See also Barney, </em>490 N.W.2d at 732-33 (similar holding).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">A different outcome was reached by the Supreme Court of Washington in <em>Lawson, swpra. </em>That court held that a right-of-way conveyed to a railroad reverted to the fee owners when it was conveyed to the local government for use as a recreational trail. The <em>Lawson </em>court\u2019s decision, however, turned on its acceptance of the deeds at issue as being expressly limited to \u201crailroad purposes only.\u201d 730 P.2d at 1312. That court stated: \u201c[W]e hold that a change in use from \u2018rails to trails\u2019 constitutes abandonment of an easement <em>which was granted for railroad purposes only.\u201d Lawson, </em>730 P.2d at 1313 (emphasis added). While appellants allege that the right-of-way in the instant case was for railroad purposes only, as discussed above, the language of the deed simply provides no support for its contention. The deed in this case is similar to the deed construed in <em>State by Wash. Wildlife Preservation, supra, </em>and therefore that case provides the more persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In sum, the deed in this case conveyed the general use of a right-of-way. The grantee railroad is obligated under statutory and common law to operate and use its assets for the furtherance of the general public welfare. This obligation runs to its rail corridors, which, in effect, are public highways that must conform in their use to new modes of transportation so long as they are reasonable and are no more burdensome to the servient estate. Finally, the conversion of a railway used for freight to a footpath is consistent and compatible with the prior railway use. As the Minnesota Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMn\">\u201cThe right-of-way is still being used as a right-of-way for transportation even though abandoned as a railroad right-of-way. Recreational trail use of the land is compatible and consistent with its prior use as a rail line, and imposes no greater burden on the servient estates. The use is a public use, which is consistent with the purpose for which the easement was originally acquired. State and federal stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>utes encouraging the conversion of railroad rights-of-way to recreation trails also support our holding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>State by Wash. Wildlife Preservation, </em>329 N.W.2d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">IV. ABANDONMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The final issue we address is the certified question regarding whether the railroad\u2019s easement has been abandoned. We initially observe that appellants\u2019 arguments on abandonment appear to be predicated on their contention that the scope of the easement was for railroad purposes. The Country Club contends, for example, that various facts show \u201cthat the Railroad was not going to be using this property <em>for railroad purposes again.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). .Along the same lines, the land company contends that the railroad \u201chad no intent to continue <em>railroad use.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). These arguments of the appellants in part reflect the overlapping nature of the questions of scope and abandonment. As we stated in <em>Peck v. Baltimore County, </em>286 Md. 368, 410 A.2d 7 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cThe use to which the County proposes to put the land in question is relevant to whether it has an intention to abandon. If it were to be found that the contemplated use were within the scope of the easement this could be evidence of a lack of intention to abandon. If the contemplated use were not within the scope of the easement, then unless it be found that some other permitted use is being made, it is <em>possible </em>that an intention to abandon might be found, although if the contemplated use is found not to be within the scope of the easement this would not necessarily establish an intention to abandon.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">286 Md. at 377-78, 410 A.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">As <em>Peck </em>suggests, in the instant case if the scope of the easement were limited to railroad purposes, then an intent to abandon railroad use could indicate an intent to abandon the easement. However, the converse is also true. If the easement is not limited in its scope to railroad purposes, then, in order for there to be an abandonment, the party alleging abandonment must show more than an intent to abandon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>railroad service. In <em>Ma. &amp; Pa. RR. Co., </em>we addressed whether an easement held by a railroad had been abandoned and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that the right and title to a <em>mere </em>easement in land acquired by a quasi-public corporation, either by purchase, condemnation or prescription, for a public purpose is dependent upon the <em>continued use of the property for that purpose, </em>and when such .public use is abandoned the right to hold the land ceases, and the property reverts to its original owner or his successors in title.\u201d (Emphasis in original and added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">224 Md. at 39,166 A.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Since we have held that the scope of the easement permits use of the right-of-way as a trail, the facts indicating that the railroad did not intend to resume <em>rail service </em>prove unhelpful to appellants\u2019 abandonment arguments. We held in Part III that the trail use, in the words of <em>Ma. &amp; Pa. RR. Co., </em>is a \u201ccontinued use of the property for th[e] purpose\u201d for which it was conveyed, <em>i.e., </em>transit uses. <em>Id. </em>To the extent that appellants\u2019 abandonment arguments rest on their contention that the scope of the easement is limited to railroad purposes, they fail to meet their burden of proving abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Nevertheless, we will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that appellants\u2019 allegations that the right-of-way has been abandoned does not hinge upon the issue of the scope of the easement. We therefore begin with an examination of Maryland law on easement abandonment and a description of the federal regulatory scheme, which is crucial to an understanding of the various actions the railroad took in the years immediately preceding its conveyance to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">A. State Law \u201cAbandonment\u201d Versus Regulatory \u201cAbandonment\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">In <em>Vogler v. Geiss, </em>51 Md. 407 (1879), our predecessors set forth the standard by which to measure whether an easement has been abandoned. In that case, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201cIt is now very well settled, by authorities of the highest character, that a party entitled to a right of way or other mere easement in the land of another may abandon and extinguish such right by acts <em>in pais, </em>and without deed or other writing. The act or acts relied on, however, to effect such result, must be of a decisive character; and while a mere declaration of an intention to abandon will not alone be sufficient, the question, whether the act of the party entitled to the easement amounts to an abandonment or not, depends upon the intention with which it was done, and that is a subject for the consideration of the jury. A cesser of the use, coupled with any act clearly indicative of an intention to abandon the right, would have the same effect as an express release of the easement, without any reference whatever to time.\u201d (Emphasis in original and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Vogler, </em>51 Md. at 410. <em>See also D.C.

No single factor is usually sufficient to establish the inference of abandonment. <em>Id. </em>Rather, <em>Vogler </em>and its progeny make clear that non-use alone is insufficient to show an intent to abandon; there must be an act or a combination of acts that unequivocally demonstrate an intention to abandon. <em>See Shuggars v.

In <em>Cityco Realty Co. v. Phila., B. &amp; W.R.

And in <em>Hagerstown &amp; F. Rwy. Co. v. Grove, </em>141 Md. 143, 118 A. 167 (1922), we upheld a finding of abandonment after a railroad had removed its tracks from the right-of-way four years after it was constructed and after it had begun using another route.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In deciding the certified question, we therefore must decide whether there has been a sufficiently \u201cdecided and unequivocal act of the owner inconsistent with the continued existence of the easement.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>99 Md. at 218, 57 A. at 639. Before examining the facts to see if any one of them or taken together they are sufficiently decisive to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>finding of abandonment, it is necessary to review the federal regulatory scheme under which the railroad operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Interstate rail carriers have long been subject to comprehensive federal regulation as common carriers. <em>See Chicago, R.I. &amp; P.R. Co. v. Hardwick Farmers Elev. Co., </em>226 U.S. 426, 433-35, 33 S.Ct. 174, 174-75, 57 L.Ed. 284, 286-87 (1913). Under the Interstate Commerce Act, the ICC<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> oversees the common carrier obligations of freight railroads operating in interstate commerce. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101(a)(re-quiring railroads subject to ICC jurisdiction to \u201cprovide ... service on reasonable request\u201d). Furthermore, railroads subject to ICC jurisdiction may construct or acquire new railroad lines only if the ICC finds that public convenience and necessity require or permit their acquisition or construction. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901. Federal law also controls a railroad\u2019s abandonment of its railroad lines or the discontinuation of rail service over any part of its lines. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903 (requiring a railroad to obtain a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance prior to taking either action). Permission for abandonment or discontinuation also depends upon an ICC finding of \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903(a)(2). The ICC must deny the abandonment application if it \u201cfails to find public convenience and necessity.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903(b)(1)(B). In making a finding of public convenience and necessity, the ICC must consider \u201cwhether the abandonment or discontinuance will have a serious, adverse impact on rural and community development.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903(a)(2). The Supreme Court has concluded that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard involves a balancing test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cThe benefit to [the railroad] of the abandonment [should be balanced] against the inconvenience and loss to [the public]. Conversely, the benefits to particular communities and commerce of continued operation must be weighed against the burden thereby imposed upon other commerce.... Whatever the precise nature of these conflicting needs, the determination is made upon a balancing of the respective interests.... In that balancing, the fact of demonstrated prejudice to interstate commerce and the absence of earnings adequate to afford reasonable compensation are, of course, relevant and may often be controlling. But the [A]ct does not make issuance of the [abandonment] certificate dependent upon a specific finding to that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arn\"><em>Colorado v. United States, </em>271 U.S. 153, 168-69, 46 S.Ct. 452, 456, 70 L.Ed. 878, 885-86 (1926). When the ICC issues an order finding that public convenience and necessity allow a carrier to abandon a line, that order is permissive, not compulsory, and the railroad may choose not to exercise its permission to abandon. <em>See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>93 F.3d 793, 797-99 (D.C.Cir.1996). Moreover, until abandonment has been consummated, the ICC \u201cmay at any time on its own initiative\u201d reconsider its grant of permission to abandon if it finds \u201cmaterial error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10327(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Congress enacted the Rails-to-Trails Act in 1983 against this background of federal regulation over the abandonment of railroad rights-of-way. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d). The Rails-to-Trails Act amended the National Trails System Act by adding to it subsection (d), which in essence provides a third option for railroads in lieu of an application to either abandon the line or discontinue service. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201c[I]n furtherance of the national policy to preserve established railroad rights-of-way for future reactivation of rail service ... in the case of interim use of any established railroad rights-of-way ... such interim use shall not be treated, for purposes of any law or rule of law, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>abandonment of the use of such rights-of-way for railroad purposes. If a State, political subdivision, or qualified private organization is prepared to assume full responsibility for management of such rights-of-way and for any legal liability arising out of such transfer or use, and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed against such rights-of-way, then the Commission shall impose such terms and conditions as a requirement of any transfer or conveyance for interim use in a manner consistent with this chapter, and shall not permit abandonment or discontinuance inconsistent or disruptive of such use.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ6\">The Act was the \u201cculmination of congressional efforts to preserve shrinking rail trackage by converting unused rights-of-way to recreational trails.\u201d <em>Preseault, </em>494 U.S. at 5, 110 S.Ct. at 918, 108 L.Ed.2d at 9. \u201cCongress apparently believed that every line is a potentially valuable national asset that merits preservation even if no future rail use for it is currently foreseeable.\u201d <em>Preseault, </em>494 U.S. at 19, 110 S.Ct. at 926, 108 L.Ed.2d at 18-19. The statute provides a means by which railroads can escape from the economic burden of maintaining unprofitable railroad lines without loss of the right-of-way, while using those rights-of-way for the public benefit in the interim. Potential interim trail use is considered prior to abandonment of rail lines, and if an agreement for interim trail use is consummated, abandonment is foregone.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The rails-to-trails provisions are triggered only when the railroad files an application with the ICC proposing to abandon the line. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29 (requiring the entity interested in acquiring the right-of-way to participate when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the rail line is \u201cproposed to be abandoned\u201d); <em>Birt v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>90 F.3d 580, 581-82 (D.C.Cir.1996)(observing that \u00a7 1247(d) may come into play when \u201ca railroad seek[s] to abandon a line\u201d). If the ICC finds the Act applicable, it will delay the effective date of the abandonment order pending negotiations between the proposed trail sponsor and the railroad. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(c). The ICC issues a Certificate of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (CITU)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> allowing the railroad to negotiate an agreement with the public or private organization willing to assume responsibility for the right-of-way. The certificate may be issued only when the circumstances are otherwise such that \u201cthe public convenience and necessity ... permit abandonment.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(b)(l)(ii)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">If an agreement on trail use is reached with a state or local government or private group, \u00a7 1247(d) treats the interim trail use as a discontinuance of service, in which ICC jurisdiction is preserved over the right-of-way, rather than an abandonment that would terminate ICC jurisdiction and cause any right-of-way held as an easement to revert to the owner of the underlying estate in fee simple. According to federal regulations, the issuance of the CITU \u201c[p]ermit[s] the railroad to discontinue service, cancel tariffs, and salvage track and material consistent with interim trail use and rail banking.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(c)(1). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he CITU will indicate that interim trail use is subject to future restoration of rail service.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(c)(2). In several cases, the ICC has ordered that service be restored over rail lines that had previously been converted to trails under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d). <em>See Norfolk and, Western Railway </em>Company\u2014 <em>Abandonment between St. Marys and Minster in Auglaize County, OH, </em>9 I.C.C.2d 1015, 1017 (1998); <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Company\u2014Abandonment Exemption\u2014in St. Louis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>County, MO, </em>Dkt.

Thus, during the interim the rail corridor is held in a national \u201crail bank,\u201d over which federal regulators retain jurisdiction for the possibility of future rail use.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In addition to the need to comply with federal laws and regulations governing the cessation of railroad service and the potential abandonment of railroad property, Maryland law governs a railroad\u2019s disposition of railroad corridor property that has been abandoned pursuant to the ICC process. Md. Code (1977, 1993 RepLVol.), Transportation Art., \u00a7 7-901. Section 7-901 covers \u201cany railroad property owned or maintained by a railroad company ... [that] is or was subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s abandonment process.\u201d Section 7-901(c) requires a railroad to notify the state of its intent to dispose of a corridor. That provision states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201c(c) <em>Notice of sale or </em>disposition\u2014Required.\u2014If a railroad company intends to sell or otherwise dispose of any railroad corridor property that is located in this State <em>and for which the company has received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission or other governmental agency with jurisdiction in the matter to abandon transportation services, </em>the company shall notify the Secretary and the Administration of its intent to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.\u201d (Emphasis in original and added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The notification provisions of \u00a7 7-901 are intended to facilitate the state\u2019s acquisition of abandoned railroad property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-901(b)(authorizing acquisition of railroad corridor property). <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1974, 1997 RepLVol.), Natural Resources Art., \u00a7 5-1010 (declaring Maryland policy of preserving railroad corridors for trail use and authorizing the Department of Natural Resources to acquire rail corridors).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">While we have never had to address whether notification under \u00a7 7-901 is required when federal regulators certify a rails-to-trails agreement (as opposed to authorizing abandon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ment of the line), it would appear that the section is inapplicable when a CITU is issued since a CITU is issued in lieu of approval of abandonment. This interpretation of state law is consistent with the ICC\u2019s \u201cexclusive and plenary\u201d jurisdiction over railroads up until the time when the ICC approves of abandonment. <em>See Chicago &amp; N.W. Tr. Co. v. Kalo Brick &amp; Tile, </em>450 U.S. 311, 321, 101 S.Ct. 1124, 1132, 67 L.Ed.2d 258, 267 (1981). <em>See also Preseault, </em>494 U.S. at 8, 110 S.Ct. at 920, 108 L.Ed.2d at 11. The notification requirement is effective only after \u201cthe company has received permission ... to abandon transportation services.\u201d Md.Code (1977, 1993 Repl.Vol.), Transportation Ait., \u00a7 7-901(e). Presumably, this is because when the ICC approves an abandonment petition, \u201cas a general proposition ICC jurisdiction terminates.\u201d <em>Preseault, </em>494 U.S. at 6 n. 3, 110 S.Ct. at 918 n. 3,108 L.Ed.2d at 10 n. 3. <em>See also </em>54 Fed.Reg. 8011-12 (1989). In other words, the Maryland statute comes into play only when a railroad disposes of railroad corridor property for which federal regulatory jurisdiction has ceased; since ICC regulation continues after a CITU is issued, \u00a7 7-901 would not be applicable under a rails-to-trails agreement pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">B. The Railroad\u2019s Pursuit of Regulatory Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Turning to the instant case, we first note that the facts alleged to support appellants\u2019 contentions that the easement conveyed by the 1911 deed has been abandoned relate largely to actions taken by the railroad pursuant to the federal regulatory scheme. The appellants emphasize that the railroad\u2019s intent to abandon the Georgetown Branch is demonstrated by the following: the 90% decline in traffic over the years 1969 to 1985; the posting of notices in 1983 declaring that an abandonment application would be filed with the ICC within three years; the discontinuation of service in 1985 due to the need for major repairs on the trestle over Rock Creek after a storm; the B &amp; O Executive Committee\u2019s vote to \u201cabandon or discontinue service\u201d over the Georgetown Branch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in 1985; and the filing of the application for abandonment and discontinuance of service on April 9,1986.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">The land company concludes on the basis of these facts that \u201c[t]he undisputed evidence ... shows that [the railroad] publicly stated its intention to abandon the Georgetown Branch in 1988, that an internal decision to proceed with abandonment was made in 1984, that the use of the right of way was, in fact, terminated on May 10, 1985 and that [the railroad\u2019s] directors formally adopted a resolution of abandonment on July 22, 1985, more than three years before ... agreeing] to give Montgomery County a quitclaim deed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARG\">The land company concludes that abandonment occurred in 1985 when service was discontinued because of the need for major bridge repairs. The Country Club argues that the easement \u201cfor railroad purposes\u201d was abandoned by April 1986 when the railroad filed its ICC application and that \u201cabandonment certainly did not occur any later than the February 1988 order of the ICC approving the abandonment.\u201d Appellants apparently concede that if the railroad had not been abandoned for purposes of state law by February 1988 (when the ICC authorized abandonment but stayed the effect of its authorization), then the right-of-way was not abandoned under Maryland law when the railroad conveyed the quitclaim deed to Montgomery County in December 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The appellants\u2019 arguments oversimplify the nature of the railroads\u2019 actions. Outside of the decline in use of the line and the decision to forego repairs on the bridge over Rock Creek, which we discuss further below, the acts alleged to support a finding of abandonment of the state law property interest relate primarily to the railroad\u2019s plans to undertake an abandonment proceeding before the ICC. In regard to these facts, the issue seems to be largely one of nomenclature, <em>ie., </em>whether the term \u201cabandonment\u201d in the context of an ICC proceeding can be used synonymously with the state law concept of \u201cabandonment\u201d of an easement. We believe that appellants unnecessarily confuse the state law question by relying on actions taken by the railroads to comply with regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cabandonment\u201d under federal law. As we explain next, the railroad\u2019s actions in pursuing regulatory \u201cabandonment\u201d before the ICC are consistent with an intent to retain its state law property interests; in fact, the railroad\u2019s actions are mandated under federal law in order for the railroad to take any action to reduce or eliminate, even temporarily, its common carrier obligations. As a result, the facts alleged by appellants to evidence the railroad\u2019s intent to abandon the right-of-way prove unhelpful in determining the question of whether the right-of-way was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Appellants acknowledge that the state law question of abandonment is distinct from ICC action on abandonment. The land company argues, however, that actions taken pursuant to the federal regulatory regime establish the necessary intent to abandon under state law. For example, the notices posted in 1983 that the line would be the subject of an abandonment proceeding, the internal decisions of the committees of the railroad companies to pursue abandonment in 1984 and 1985, and the filing of the application for abandonment in 1986 are alleged to constitute evidence of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Each of these actions, however, is a prerequisite for a railroad wishing to sell its interests in a right-of-way or to participate in a rails-to-trails agreement pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d). Federal regulations require a railroad to post a notice on the line informing readers that the line is anticipated to be the subject of an ICC regulatory proceeding. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.20(a)(3). The corporate resolutions are necessary internal decision-making steps for pursuing regulatory abandonment, and a railroad obviously cannot obtain approval for discontinuance of service or abandonment without filing an application with federal regulators.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Even if we were to conclude that the word \u201cabandon\u201d in the regulatory context could be synonymous with state law abandonment of an easement, the railroad\u2019s application to the ICC made clear that the \u201c[ajpplicants seek to abandon and discontinue <em>service </em>\u201d over the Georgetown Branch, not their interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>in the land. (Emphasis added). The application repeatedly refers to the \u201cproposed abandonment,\u201d and it noted that \u201cvarious public bodies may be interested in acquiring the subject properties for public purposes or uses.\u201d As the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit recently observed, \u201c[t]he word \u2018abandon\u2019 has a precise meaning in this regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>NARPO v. STB, </em>158 F.3d 135, 137 n. 1 (D.C.Cir. 1998). <em>See also Cristofani v. Board of Education, </em>98 Md.App. 90, 92 n. 1, 632 A.2d 447, 448 n. 1 (1993)(observing that \u201cabandonment\u201d is a concept in other areas of law beyond the easement context); <em>Vieux v. East Bay Regional Park Dist., </em>906 F.2d 1330, 1339 (9th Cir.)(noting the permissive nature of ICC abandonment approval, which \u201cis only a determination that ... cessation of service would not hinder ICC\u2019s purposes. It is not a determination that the railroad has abandoned its lines\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 967, 111 S.Ct. 430, 112 L.Ed.2d 414 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The railroad\u2019s statements and actions are entirely consistent with an intention to sell the right-of-way and to pursue a rails-to-trails agreement pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An intention to sell the right-of-way is inconsistent with an intent to abandon the property interest. <em>Vieux, </em>906 F.2d at 1341. Moreover, regulatory abandonment was never even consummated since a trail use agreement was reached. Indeed, the corridor cannot have been abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>under federal law because the trail use is only interim, and federal regulators may require the restoration of rail service. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(c)(2). <em>See </em>Part IV.A.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Of course, it is not an impossibility for a railroad to abandon its state law property interest when a trail-use agreement is pursued. But the decisive act required to carry the abandonment proponent\u2019s burden of proof cannot be supplied by acts entirely consistent with the federal regulatory scheme, which precludes such abandonment. Furthermore, if abandonment of the state-law property interest occurs when a trail use agreement is being pursued in compliance with federal law, that abandonment would occur without the federal regulatory approval which, as discussed next, could result in civil and criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Appellants\u2019 contention that the right-of-way was abandoned prior to the consummation of the agreement with Montgomery County would require us to conclude that the railroad intended to disobey rather than comply with various provisions of federal and state law. In other words, if it had the intent to abandon its state law property interests prior to ICC action, the railroad would have to also have intended to violate several provisions of federal law, subjecting itself to various criminal and civil sanctions. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11901, 11906.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>As one court explained, \u201cbecause of the importance of uninterrupted rail transportation service in the nation\u2019s economy, Congress has expressed a clear intent, even to the point of criminal sanctions, that abandonments without prior ICC approval are not tolerated.\u201d <em>I.C.C. v.

Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905, a railroad may not abandon its line immediately on the date which the ICC determines that public convenience and necessity permit abandonment. Rather, abandonment is delayed by at least ten days after notice of the abandonment order is published in the <em>Federal Register </em>to allow any \u201cfinancially responsible person\u201d to \u201coffer to pay the carrier a subsidy or offer to purchase the line.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905(c)-(d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If a financially responsible person makes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>offer, issuance of the ICC certificate is further delayed 30 days, allowing the railroad and the offeror to negotiate the terms of the purchase or subsidy. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905(e). If they are unable to agree on terms, either the railroad or offeror may ask the Commission to establish the terms and conditions of the sale or subsidy. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905(e)-(f). <em>See Hayfield N.R. Co. v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Tr. Co., </em>467 U.S. 622, 629-30, 104 S.Ct. 2610, 2615-16, 81 L.Ed.2d 527, 534-35 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In the instant case, after the ICC authorized the railroad to abandon the Georgetown Branch, Laurel Sand <em>&amp; </em>Gravel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(LSG) filed an offer of financial assistance under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905. The Commission found LSG to be \u201cfinancially responsible\u201d and directed the railroad to negotiate a subsidy or sale of the line to LSG. These negotiations took precedence over the proposed rails-to-trails conversion being discussed at that time with the County. <em>See Rail Abandonments\u2014Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails, </em>2 I.C.C.2d 591, 608 (1986). The negotiations lasted more than six months but ultimately proved unsuccessful; LSG subsequently withdrew its offer of financial assistance. Under the theory proposed by appellants, however, the negotiations between the railroad and LSG would have been essentially meaningless, since prior to the start of negotiations with LSG the railroad would have had already abandoned its right-of-way; under appellants\u2019 theory, had an agreement been reached, LSG would have either been a trespasser over the abandoned right-of-way or it would have had to reacquire the right-of-way from the land company.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In addition to the requirement of entertaining offers of financial assistance, the railroad was subject to the ICC\u2019s broad authority to place conditions on regulatory abandonment. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903(b)(l)(A)(ii)(granting the ICC the power to approve abandonment <em>\u201cwith modifications ... [and] conditions </em>that the Commission finds are required by public convenience and necessity\u201d)(emphasis added). Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10906, the Commission must make a determination of \u201cwhether the rail properties that are involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance are suitable for use for public purposes, including highways, other forms of mass transportation, conservation, energy production or transmission, or recreation.\u201d Should the Commission find the rail properties suitable for public purposes, \u201cthe properties may be sold, leased, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of <em>only under conditions provided in the order of the Commission.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Again, if the railroad had abandoned its property interests before the ICC acted pursuant to its abandonment application, it would have been impossible for the railroad to comply with any conditions imposed on the abandonment without being deemed a trespasser on the right-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>way. Moreover, the conclusion that the easement had been abandoned prior to the conveyance of the quitclaim deed\u2014 thereby leaving the railroad with no interest in the right-of-way\u2014would appear to contravene the spirit of the Maryland law authorizing acquisition of the right-of-way. <em>See </em>Part IV.A.2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">We do not lightly presume, as appellants do, that a person, or in this case a railroad company, acted contrary to explicit legal requirements. \u201cWhere an individual proposes to engage in what is otherwise a lawful venture, the presumption is that he will conduct his activities in a proper manner.\u201d <em>Leatherbury v. Gaylord Fuel Corp., </em>276 Md. 367, 377, 347 A.2d 826, 832 (1975). This is particularly the case where, as here, criminal sanctions may be involved. No evidence in this case would support a finding that the railroad violated or intended to violate the law, and we could not uphold a finding that it took action that would be tantamount to a federal crime and that would expose it to civil liability without substantial evidence that it intended to do so, evidence which is not present here. <em>See also Md. Securities v. U.S. Securities, </em>122 Md.App. 574, 588, 716 A.2d 290, 297 (1998)(stating presumption that administrative officers \u201cact[] regularly and in a lawful manner\u201d); <em>Valentine v. On Target, </em>112 Md.App. 679, 692, 686 A.2d 636, 642 (1996)(purchasers of firearms presumed to have made purchase for legitimate purposes), <em>aff'd, </em>353 Md. 544, 727 A.2d 947 (1999). The stipulated facts all indicate that the railroad was making every effort to comply with the law. Yet, a finding that the railroad had abandoned its state law property interest in the right-of-way would be tantamount to a finding that the railroad intended to violate the law, thereby exposing itself to criminal and civil sanctions. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">If we were to accept the appellants\u2019 efforts to use the railroad\u2019s acts taken in pursuit of federal regulatory approval for \u201cabandonment\u201d as the decisive acts necessary to demonstrate an intent to abandon an easement under state law, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>would create an irreconcilable dilemma for railroads wishing to pursue rails-to-trails agreements or otherwise dispose of their property interests in right-of-ways. The railroad could not pursue a rails-to-trails agreement without filing an application for regulatory abandonment at the ICC, but the actions taken to pursue such an application, and the application itself, would constitute evidence of abandonment for state law purposes, thereby causing it to risk undermining the rails-to-trails agreement. This would create a Hobson\u2019s choice for the railroad that must apply for regulatory abandonment under federal law as the necessary first step to obtaining a CITU, while that application itself would constitute evidence of an intent to abandon in terms of state law (thereby undermining the CITU effort by making it more costly). Such a holding would completely frustrate state and federal policies intended to promote the preservation of rail corridors and their conversion to trail use. We conclude therefore that the actions of the railroad taken to comply with the federal regulatory regime cannot, as a matter of state law, supply the unequivocal act or acts that evidence the intent to abandon an easement interest in land.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">C. The Insufficiency of Any Other Potential Evidence of Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We must next determine whether the remaining actions of the railroad alleged to constitute abandonment supply sufficient evidence to support a finding of an intent to abandon the easement. Those acts include the railroad\u2019s decisions to fore-go bridge repairs in 1984 and the subsequent discontinuance of use of the line after a storm caused major damage to the bridge in 1985. Even assuming that the forbearance of repairs combined with the nonuse of the right-of-way constitute more than evidence of mere nonuse, we conclude that they are insufficient to meet appellants\u2019 initial burden of proving a clear and unequivocal act that is necessary to support a finding of an intent to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Our conclusion is dictated by our previous cases concerning abandonment of an easement by a railroad. In <em>Canton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>supra, </em>for example, we affirmed a finding that a railroad right-of-way had not been abandoned when the circumstances much more strongly supported a finding of abandonment than the instant case. The appellant, the Canton Company, was the owner of land over which a right-of-way had been taken in a condemnation proceeding brought by the B &amp; 0 in 1885 and for which it was paid $20,000. The railroad took possession of the land and laid track, but it never connected the track with its other tracks, and in 1898 it removed the tracks although they never \u201cha[d] been employed for any substantial use.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>99 Md. at 214, 57 A. at 637. In addition, the railroad used other connections instead of going through the condemned land. One of the alternative routes was achieved through a contract, entered into in 1890 and to last 999 years, which required it to ship over that line \u201call its traffic of every kind passing through the city of Baltimore.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>99 Md. at 220, 57 A. at 640. Primarily on the basis of these facts, <em>Canton </em>brought an action in ejectment claiming that the railroad had abandoned the strip of land condemned. We affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the easement had not been abandoned, observing that nonuse of an easement will not <em>per se </em>operate as abandonment \u201cunless there is some decided and unequivocal act of the owner inconsistent with the continued existence of the easement, or unless the nonuse has been for a considerable period.... \u201d <em>Canton, </em>99 Md. at 218, 57 A. at 639. We rejected the contention that the contract for use of an alternative line, requiring \u201call ... traffic of every kind\u201d to go over that line, was sufficient evidence of abandonment. <em>Canton, </em>99 Md. at 220-21, 57 A. at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Unlike <em>Canton, </em>in the instant case, the evidence is undisputed that the railroad actually used the right-of-way for some 90 years until 1985, when the need for major bridge repairs made continued use unfeasible. It is also undisputed that about the time the railroad began taking steps toward obtaining permission from the ICC for regulatory abandonment, a management committee of the railroad had agreed to pursue negotiations with Montgomery County for transfer of the right-of-way. In <em>Canton, </em>the railroad made an affirmative decision to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tracks on land condemned for a right-of-way\u2014tracks which had never really been used\u2014and to enter a contract whereby \u201call\u201d of its traffic would go over another line for 999 years; nevertheless, we held that the facts failed to supply the decisive act necessary to show an intent to abandon. In the instant case, there is much less evidence of an unequivocal and decisive act evidencing an intent to abandon the property interest in the right-of-way. The use of the right-of-way ended altogether only because of the deterioration of a bridge (due to a severe weather storm) while at approximately the same time the railroad undertook action to adhere to federal regulations to end service over the line and to negotiate the sale of its assignable interest in the right-of-way pursuant to the Rails-to-Trails Act. The decision to take up tracks and enter a long-term contract for another route in <em>Canton </em>provided stronger evidence of an intent to abandon than the decision to forego repairs in the instant case\u2014particularly when that decision is consistent with the contemplated new transit use of the corridor. If anything, the railroad\u2019s actions in this case evidence a clear intent not to abandon but to sell to the County its interest in the right-of-way consistent with the requirements of federal regulation. As one court observed in a similar context, \u201c[cjonveyance of property and abandonment of property are not consistent actions.\u201d <em>Vieux, </em>906 F.2d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Furthermore, a railroad\u2019s participation in a rails-to-trails program implies that it does not intend to fully abandon the line, but rather to retain the right-of-way while permitting interim trail use. <em>Birt, </em>90 F.3d at 587; <em>KCT Railway Corporation\u2014Abandonment Exemption\u2014In Franklin, Anderson, and Allen Counties, KS, </em>7 I.C.C.2d 1035, 1036 (1991)(observ-ing that railroad\u2019s interest in negotiating trail agreement is \u201cinconsistent with clear intent to consummate the abandonment and implies that KCT may be interested in preserving the right-of-way for the future restoration of rail service\u201d). The facts of this case closely resemble those in <em>Birt. </em>In that case, the landowner, Birt, argued that the railroad had abandoned its property interest in the right-of-way prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>consummation of a rails-to-trails agreement, thus depriving the ICC of jurisdiction over the rail corridor. In reviewing a decision of the ICC that abandonment had not occurred, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cThe Commission has listed several concrete actions which may indicate an intent to abandon: cessation of operations cancellation of tariffs, salvage of the track and track materials, and relinquishment of control over the right-of-way. <em>These factors, however, are equally consistent with temporary cessation of operations (\u2018discontinuance\u2019), which permits a rails-to-trails conversion but does not effect a permanent abandonment. </em>Thus, to determine whether the railroad\u2019s conduct is abandonment or mere discontinuance, we must often look to additional behavior which signifies one or the other.... \u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\"><em>Birt, </em>90 F.3d at 585-86. The court also rejected Birt\u2019s contention that abandonment occurred as a result of two letters written by the railroad which explicitly conceded that the right-of-way \u201cwas abandoned.\u201d <em>Birt, </em>90 F.3d at 586. Fewer facts in the instant case are available for reaching a conclusion that the right-of-way was abandoned than in <em>Birt. </em>Appellants have produced no letter from the railroad declaring that the right-of-way has been abandoned.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">That the right-of-way could not have been abandoned is further evidenced by the federal requirement that when a right-of-way is converted to trail use under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d), regulatory abandonment is foregone and the ICC\u2019s approval is expressly made \u201csubject to the future restoration of rail service.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(e)(2)(requiring the CITU to state that \u201cinterim trail use is subject to future restoration of rail service\u201d); <em>id. </em>at (c)(3)(stating that if a railroad seeks to reinstitute service over the right-of-way, and federal regulators grant permission to do so, \u201cthe CITU will be vacated accordingly.\u201d As the ICC has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cBy consenting to the issuance of a CITU/NITU, a carrier agrees to forgo consummating the authorized or exempted abandonment. As a consequence, <em>its common carrier obligation does not terminate. </em>Instead, <em>the abandoning carrier retains a residual common earner obligation and transfers the right-of-way to the trail user, subject to the stipulation that the rail corridor remain available for the reinstitution of rail service. </em>A carrier\u2019s decision to agree to a CITU/ NITU is totally voluntary and, as far as the Commission is concerned, may be withdrawn at any time the abandoning carrier wishes to reinstitute rail operations over the right-of-way.\u201d (Emphasis added.))</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company\u2014Abandonment between St. Marys and Minster in Auglaize County, OH, </em>9 I.C.C.2d 1015,1018 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thus, upon the consummation of a rails-to-trails agreement, the right-of-way is placed in a national \u201crailbank,\u201d and, at a later date, federal regulators may permit removal of the corridor from the railbank in order to reactivate service. That service may be reactivated on the right-of-way supports our conclusion that the right-of-way has not been abandoned, for it would be difficult, if not virtually impossible, to reactivate service on an abandoned line.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Our decision avoids frustrating the federal and state public policies of promoting the conversion of railroad rights-of-way for other transportation and recreational uses. Were we to hold otherwise, it would be hard to imagine a situation in which a railroad pursuing a rails-to-trails agreement would not have abandoned its property interest, since there must be some point at which a railroad comports itself differently in anticipation of a rails-to-trails agreement than if it were to continue to operate the line. Conversely, if we were to hold that the failure to repair the bridge over Rock Creek were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>sufficient to carry appellants\u2019 burden of proving an intent to abandon, we would create an incentive for a railroad to make futile expenditures in order to avoid being found to have abandoned its property interest under state law as it complies with the mandates of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">We do not intend to intimate that a railroad may never abandon an easement under Maryland law prior to federal regulatory approval of abandonment; rather, we merely hold that under the circumstances of this case, where the actions supporting the alleged abandonment coincide in time and in function with the railroad\u2019s efforts to comply with federal law and where there is no suggestion or reason to conclude that the railroad intended to not comply with federal law, as a matter of Maryland law, the facts are not sufficient to meet the burden of showing that abandonment occurred prior to the railroad\u2019s conveyance of the quitclaim deed to the County. While the question of abandonment of an easement is to be decided as a matter of Maryland property law, the question should not be resolved in a vacuum in which the federal regulatory scheme is ignored.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Finally, we note that our conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to show that the railroad intended to abandon the right-of-way is consistent with the obvious economic interests of the railroad. The railroad had a \u201cfree and perpetual\u201d interest in the portions of the right-of-way at issue in this case; it would have been irrational for the railroad to abandon the right-of-way without attempting to recover some value from its interest in the land. As the stipulated facts demonstrate, the railroad did in fact pursue a course of action whereby it recovered value through the sale of the corridor to the County. As explained above, that course of action was necessarily lengthy and somewhat arduous because of the scheme of federal regulation under which it was operating. The railroad had to pursue that process, however, in order to derive any economic value out of its right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In sum, we hold that when a railroad takes actions pursuant to federal regulation that are wholly consistent with an intent to retain the property interest, in this case in order to pursue an interim trail use agreement, those actions alone cannot supply the decisive and unequivocal act evidencing an intent to abandon. It follows that in the instant case, where the appellants have not pointed to any other actions sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>to carry their burden of proving an act sufficiently evidencing an intent to abandon, the right-of-way was not abandoned prior to the railroad\u2019s conveyance of the right-of-way to Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The first certified question asks whether the 1911 deed to the railroad from the land company conveyed a fee simple absolute or an easement. We have held that it conveyed an easement. The plain text of the instrument states that a right-of-way was conveyed and there is no indication that anything more than a right of passage was intended, particularly in light of the deed\u2019s separate conveyance in fee simple of the land on which a passenger station was to be located. This conclusion is confirmed by the circumstances of the conveyance, including the existing railway and the nominal consideration given by the railroad in light of its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Second, we addressed whether the use of the right-of-way as a hiker/biker trail is within the scope of the easement. Based on the absence of limitations on use of the right-of-way in the language of the deed, we concluded that the use is within the legally anticipated scope of the 1911 deed, in light of the railroad\u2019s status as a highly regulated public service corporation. The deed anticipated a means of transit over the right-of-way, and the trail use is consistent with what was anticipated. Moreover, the use of the right-of-way as a trail poses no unreasonable burden on the servient estate; indeed, the use is less burdensome than freight railroad use.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The third certified question asked us to examine whether the railroad had abandoned its state law property interest in the easement. The resolution of the abandonment question required that we assess the federal regulatory framework covering railroad \u201cabandonment,\u201d which is distinct from the property law concept of abandonment of an easement. We concluded that appellants failed to meet their burden of alleging a sufficiently decisive and unequivocal act evidencing an</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>intent to abandon, particularly given that most of the railroad\u2019s actions were taken in order to comply with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">CERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH.

We decline to entertain the Country Club\u2019s contention that it is the owner in fee simple absolute of a portion of the right-of-way that bisects two parcels of land conveyed to the Country Club by the land company in 1909. The Country Club did not argue before the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC) that it owned in fee simple the segment now claimed. Rather, it contended that it had ownership \u201d[p]ursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to the doctrine of adverse possession, or alternatively, lost deed.\u201d <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery v.

It made no claim of ownership in the right-of-way by virtue of the 1909 deed, as it does here. <em>See Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 587-88. The Country Club first made the argument that the 1909 deed conveyed to it the segment of the right-of-way in fee simple absolute to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals; however, under its rules, that court will not entertain arguments not raised below. <em>See Jay v. Secretary of DHHS, </em>998 F.2d 979, 983 n. 4 (Fed.Cir. 1993). Therefore, even if we were to entertain the Club\u2019s contention, that court nevertheless properly may refuse to consider that aspect of our decision in resolving the ultimate question of whether an unconstitutional taking occurred.

The deed in the instant case includes no such limiting language. Moreover, the issue decided in that case was not related to the scope of the easement, but whether a fee simple or an easement had been conveyed. In <em>D.C. Transit I </em>and <em>D.C.

Indeed, the CFC implicitly recognized the illogic of ignoring the comprehensive regulation scheme in determining the state law question of abandonment of an easement. In finding that the easement had been abandoned when the ICC issued its order of February 25, 1988, the court discussed at length an early decision of this court, <em>Benson v. Public Service Comm., </em>141 Md. 398, 118 A. 852 (1922), relating to state regulatory approval of abandonment of rail service. <em>Benson </em>involved a suit by citizens against the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) contesting the agency's authorization of abandonment of the railroad line. In that case, we upheld the PSC\u2019s abandonment order based on its uneconomical operation, declaring that \u201cthe only safe criterion [for evaluating whether to abandon service] ... is ... the measure of which is the ability of the [railroad] from its earnings to meet its operating expenses and fixed charges.\u201d <em>Benson, </em>141 Md. at 404, 118 A. at 854. The CFC concluded that the PSC standard is not as rigorous as the ICC\u2019s \"public convenience\u201d standard and, since the Februaiy 1988 ICC order concluded that abandonment was appropriate and conditioned abandonment only for inquity into a Rails-lo-Trails agreement, that the order \"provided ... the rough equivalent of the PSC abandonment authorization.\u201d <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. of Montgomery, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"A3y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>We agree with the CFC that the regulatory scheme under which the railroad operated is relevant to whether it intended to abandon the right-of-way, but we disagree with its reading of <em>Benson. Benson </em>did not involve a question of whether an easement had been abandoned, but rather whether the state agency had properly approved abandonment of <em>service. See </em>Part IV.B.l, <em>supra </em>(distinguishing between regulatory abandonment and the state law property concept of abandonment). We upheld an order of the PSC permitting a railroad to abandon service on a portion of its line based on a statute giving it the power \"to approve or disapprove of the abandonment or discontinuance ... by any common carrier, railroad corporation, or street railroad corporation of the exercise of the franchise or right conferred upon it by its charter.\" <em>Benson, </em>141 Md. a1 401, 118 A. at 853. The issue in the case concerned the validity of the PSC\u2019s order regarding the ceasing of service; we did not discuss nor did the case involve any property law issues such as easement abandonment. Therefore even if we were to agree with the CFC that the February 1988 order of the ICC was the \"rough equivalent of the PSC abandonment authorization,\" our agreement would have no bearing on the issue here related to abandonment of the railroad\u2019s property law interest in the right-of-way.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b218-5\">CATHELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZR\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I respectfully dissent from the portion of the majority\u2019s opinion holding that the railroad line at issue was not abandoned under Maryland property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The Court reaches its conclusion on the abandonment issue by answering a question not certified to us by the federal court\u2014the effect of <em>federal </em>law on the purported abandonment. In doing so, the majority seeks to answer the ultimate question before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Our task was to answer the third certified question based on <em>Maryland </em>law: \u201cIf the deed conveyed an easement ..., has that easement, as a matter of law, been abandoned at any time since its conveyance, and if so, when?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Recognizing this distinction, it is important to note the context of the federal case from which the certified question was presented. Plaintiffs, possible owners of real property interests, initiated an action in federal court claiming that those property interests had been the subject of an unconstitutional \u201cregulatory taking\u201d by operation of the federal statutes involved and were entitled to just compensation. They asserted that but for the effect of the federal statutes, they would be the owners of the interest in the property under the state law of abandonment. The federal statutes at issue are those described by the majority as forbidding, for the first time in Maryland, abandonment in the absence of compliance. The issue being litigated in federal court is whether the effect of the same statutes deprive the owners of all economically feasible uses of their property. The majority holds that the plaintiffs do not own an interest in the property because of the effect of the same federal statutes on the Maryland common law pertaining to abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The Federal Circuit has asked this Court to interpret the Maryland law on abandonment in the absence of the effect of the federal statutes. The majority tells that court what it already knows, not what it needs to know to resolve whether the statutes\u2019 impact is so severe as to cause a regulatory taking. Federal courts are able to assess the impact upon the property at issue resulting from the application of the federal statutes. The majority, in some type of reverse \u201cboot strapping\u201d beyond my logical comprehension, answers the certified question by incorporating the effect of the federal statutes into Maryland property law. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, if a federal regulatory statute abolishes a Maryland property right, the property right never existed. Under that theory, an unconstitutional taking of property never could occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The question should be answered, and I believe the federal court wanted it answered, as if the federal statutes did not exist. The majority alters an established doctrine of Maryland property law that has existed for one hundred years or more in an attempt to assist the federal government to avoid its constitutional obligation to compensate property owners if a federal statute so impacts the property as to leave the property owner with no viable economical use.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The majority also holds that the conveyances to the railroad in 1911 were conveyances of easements. The United States Court of Federal Claims found to the contrary, but opined that if the early conveyances had granted easements, those easements had been abandoned under Maryland law. <em>Chevy Chase Land Co. v. United States, </em>37 Fed.Cl. 545, 580 (1997). The majority\u2019s position in this case directly conflicts with that earlier ruling in the same case. The Court of Federal Claims was correct on the Maryland law of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>all parties agree that railway use of the land ceased and has remained inoperative for an appreciable period of time. As the briefs reflect, uncontested and substantial evidence exists that the railroad did not intend to operate rail service, did not operate rail service for an extensive period of time, and intended to abandon that service. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The facts are clear, at least to me, that on May 10, 1985, rail service ceased completely due to the deterioration of a bridge over Rock Creek Park and the prohibitive costs of repairing it. Thereafter, on July 22, 1985, the railroad passed a resolution abandoning railway service. That resolution was at least an expression of intent to abandon the right-of-way, notwithstanding the federal statutes at issue in the federal case. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, which had been operating the rail service prior to May 10, 1985, consented to that abandonment or intent to abandon, as the case may be. The railroad then filed appropriate abandonment petitions with the ICC. That agency made a determination that abandonment was appropriate, but held up formal approval for the apparent purpose of permitting Montgomery County (County) and the railroad to take advantage of the federal statutes involved in the federal \u201ctakings\u201d claims. The County entered into agreements under the statutes and acquired the right-of-way. The railroad cautiously executed only quit claim deeds to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The true issue to be determined by this Court was what property, if any, did the railroad own? If it owned nothing, it conveyed nothing. If it had abandoned its right-of-way prior to that time, the right-of-way would have reverted to the adjacent fee simple owners under Maryland law as the law existed prior to the majority\u2019s opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Turning to the Maryland law of abandonment, this Court said in a case involving a dispute over a right-of-way created as early as 1790, that rights-of-way can be abandoned by nonuse combined with an <em>intention </em>to abandon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">[I]t must follow, upon every principle, that the non-user of the right may be extinguished, by presuming a release of it for the purpose of quieting the possession. And the presumption of a release in this case is strongly fortified by the circumstance, that the parties, to whom the right of way in question was originally granted, and those claiming under them, had used another and distinct route over the land of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Wright v. Freeman, </em>5 H. <em>&amp;, </em>J. 467, 477 (1823). In <em>Vogler v. Geiss, </em>51 Md. 407, 410 (1879), we stated in clearer language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALi\">It is now very well settled, by authorities of the highest character, that a party entitled to a right of way or other mere easement in the land of another may abandon and extinguish such right by acts <em>in pais, </em>and without deed or other writing. The act or acts relied on, however, to effect such result, must be of a decisive character; and while a mere declaration of an intention to abandon will not alone be sufficient, the question, whether the act of the party entitled to the easement amounts to an abandonment or not, depends upon the intention with which it was done, and that is a subject for the consideration of the jury. <em>A cesser of the use, coupled with any act clearly indicative of an intention to abandon the right, ivould have the same effect as an express release of the easement, without any reference whatever to time. </em>[Second emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The law in Maryland with respect to the abandonment of easements has remained the same, with but one possible aberration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the law has always focused on <em>intent. </em>Applying the long-standing legal principle to the facts of this case, excluding the effect of the federal statutes, the railroad clearly abandoned its right-of-way: there was a cessation of use since at least 1985, resolutions to abandon by both railroad companies (consent to abandon by one), a petition to the appropriate agency for an approval of the abandonment, and a determination by that agency that abandonment was appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ate. In my view, this is a classic example of abandonment. If the right-of-way at issue were not subject to the federal statutes, and the landowners abutting the easement were able to present in federal court the evidence presented here, it is clear, probably even under the majority\u2019s position, that the traditional elements of abandonment have been met. Except for the actions of the federal entities in attempting to have the federal statutes impact upon that abandonment, the decision of this Court should be simple. Instead, in an attempt to further the environmental concerns of the County and federal governments, the majority changes the law of Maryland, but says that change has always been the law. It has not always been the law and it cannot be logically so asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The law has not changed since <em>Vogler. </em>We have maintained a consistent position until the majority\u2019s opinion in this case. In <em>Canton Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, </em>99 Md. 202, 217-19, 57 A. 637, 638-39 (1904), we found that no abandonment had occurred because there was only evidence of nonuse and no evidence of intent to abandon. Nonetheless, we restated the law of abandonment from <em>Vogler </em>that sufficient evidence of nonuse plus intent to abandon demonstrates an abandonment. <em>Id. </em>at 218, 57 A. at 639. We likewise reiterated the law in <em>Cityco Realty Co. v. Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp; Washington Railroad, </em>158 Md. 221, 226, 148 A. 441, 443-44 (1930):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">It is well settled ... that a party entitled to a right of way or other mere easement in the land of another may abandon and extinguish such right by acts <em>in pais. </em>The act or acts relied on, however, to effect such result, must be of a decisive character, and whether the act amounts to an abandonment or not depends upon the intention with which it was done. A cesser of the use, coupled with any act clearly indicative of an intention to abandon the right, would have the same effect as an express release of the easement, without any reference whatever to time. <em>Vogler v. Geiss, </em>51 Md. 407; <em>Stewart v. May, </em>119 Md. 10[, 85 A. 957 (1912) ]. * * * It seems to be generally agreed that in this matter no one case can be authority for another. Time is not a necessary element; it is not the duration of the non-user, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>but the nature of the acts done or permitted, and the intention which the one or the other indicates, that are important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>See also Millson v.

In that case, the \u201cMa &amp; Pa\u201d Railroad had used the subject property as a railroad until 1958. That year it ceased operations and removed the rails and ties. The trial court found that the railroad\u2019s title was to an easement only and that the easement had been abandoned. On appeal, this Court held that removal of the rails and ties from the easement constituted an abandonment of it, and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">The general rule is that the right and title to a <em>mere </em>easement in land acquired by a quasi-public corporation, either by purchase, condemnation or prescription, for a public purpose is dependent upon the continued use of the property for that purpose, and when such public use is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>abandoned the right to hold the land ceases, and the property reverts to its original owner or his successors in title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzC\"><em>Id. </em>at 39, 166 A.2d at 250.

Grove, </em>141 Md. 143[, 118 A. 167] (1922); <em>Smith v. Harris, </em>181 Kan. 237, 311 P.2d 325 (1957); <em>Sindler v. Wm. M.

Schaus, </em>[106 R.I. 795,] 264 A.2d 161 ([] 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 290 A.2d at 810 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">D.C. Transit System contended in that case that it never intended to abandon the right-of-way (a trolley line), but that its intent was \u201cthat of planning to use the land for a monorail system and alternatively for a high speed bus line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624, 290 A.2d at 809. By contrast, the uncontested evidence in the case <em>sub judice </em>was that railroad officials intended to abandon the right-of-way, passed resolutions as such, and filed petitions for abandonment. In <em>D.C. Transit II, </em>the trial judge had specifically found that \u201c[v]arious officers of the Transit Company testified that a monorail system has been under study since at least 1957.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Conversely, the uncontested evidence in the case <em>sub judice </em>showed that the railroad officials clearly contemplated the abandonment of service and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>that, only after arrangements were made for a quit claim deed to be delivered to the County by the railroad company, despite the ICC\u2019s preliminary finding that abandonment was appropriate, did the County acquire whatever the railroad had possessed. In <em>D.C. Transit II, </em>many documents supported the railroad\u2019s position that when it discontinued rail service and removed the rails, it did not intend to abandon the right-of-way, but to use it for future transit service by monorail or high-speed buses. The evidence supporting disclaimer of abandonment in <em>D.C. Transit II </em>is one hundred percent stronger than the evidence in the case at bar, in which <em>no </em>evidence exists of anything other than an intent to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In the present case, the railroad made a decision not to repair the bridge over Rock Creek Park. It then ceased use of the right-of-way in 1985. In that same year, it passed explicit resolutions stating its official intention to abandon. The railroad then filed a petition with the ICC informing that agency of its intention to abandon. <em>Cf. Thompson v. Maryland &amp; Pennsylvania R.R. Preservation Soc\u2019y, </em>417 Pa.Super. 216, 224, 612 A.2d 450, 454 (1992) (noting that an ICC certificate of abandonment is evidence of intent to abandon a property interest), <em>appeal denied, </em>533 Pa. 635, 621 A.2d 581 (1993). The ICC found that abandonment was appropriate. There was simply nothing more the railroad could do to prove abandonment. It used every means short of the Goodyear Blimp to announce its intent to abandon. The majority holds that because the ICC failed to approve the abandonment officially (while, coincidentally or intentionally, it was encouraging the railroad to quit claim its rights to the County, disregarding those who, under the Maryland law of abandonment, may have owned the property rights), there has been no abandonment. The majority fails to recognize that under Maryland law and the cases discussed, <em>supra, </em>abandonment is complete when two things exist: 1) cessation of use and 2) <em>intention </em>to abandon. Both of these elements exist in the case at bar. That is all the Federal Circuit wanted us to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The majority does at least recognize that \u201cabandonment\u201d under the federal railroad commerce statutes has a different meaning than under general state property law. <em>See </em>majority op. at Part IV.B.1. Under federal law, the term applies to abandonment of <em>service, </em>while under state law it refers to abandonment of the relevant <em>property interest. See, e.g., Burlington N. R.R. v. Kmezich, </em>48 F.3d 1047, 1050 (8th Cir.1995) (\u201cActual cessation of service extinguishes interests under the [state] statute. I.C.C. abandonment is not the triggering event.\u201d); <em>Penn Cent. Corp. v. U.S. R.R. Vest Corp., </em>955 F.2d 1158, 1159 (7th Cir.1992) (noting there are \u201ctwo senses of abandonment\u201d; one of service and one of title to property); <em>cf. Thompson, </em>417 Pa.Super. at 227, 612 A.2d at 455 (\u201cA [state] certificate granting permission to abandon railway crossings is not dispositive of whether or not a railroad has abandoned a right of way, as the certificate, without more, does not constitute abandonment.\u201d). What the majority fails to recognize, however, is that abandonment of the property interest can occur <em>before </em>abandonment of service is approved by the federal government. <em>See Preseault v. United States, </em>100 F.3d 1525, 1546-49 (Fed.Cir.1996) (affirming trial court\u2019s decision that a railroad abandoned its easement ten years before seeking ICC approval of service abandonment); <em>Burlington N. R.R., </em>48 F.3d at 1050 (holding that, under Iowa state law, railroad abandoned its right-of-way interest when it ended service \u201cprior to 1985,\u201d not when the ICC approved the abandonment of service in 1985); <em>Kansas City Area Transp. Auth. v. 4550 Main Assocs., </em>742 S.W.2d 182, 190 (Mo.Ct.App. 1986) (noting that the holders of a right-of-way abandoned their interest by selling it six days prior to ICC approval of rail service abandonment), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1063, 108 S.Ct. 1020, 98 L.Ed.2d 985 (1988). Thus, despite the majority\u2019s contention, the railroad in this case could and did abandon its right-of-way property interest even though the ICC had not formally approved abandonment of service. It follows that the scope of the original right-of-way is irrelevant because the evidence reflects that the railroad intended to abandon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>property interest entirely, long before its purported conveyance to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The majority also fails to see that, despite the federal approval of service abandonment, it is only the abandonment of the property interest that determines whether the purported reversionary property interests in this case vested and were subsequently \u201ctaken\u201d under the federal rails-to-trails law. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor recognized as much in her concurrence in <em>Preseault v. ICC, </em>494 U.S. 1, 21, 110 S.Ct. 914, 926, 108 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring), when she stated: \u201cDetermining what interest [the holders of the right-of-way] would have enjoyed under Vermont law, <em>in the absence of the ICC\u2019s recent actions, </em>will establish whether [the holders of the right-of-way] possess the predicate property interest that must underlie any takings claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by Justices Scalia and Kennedy, further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">the [ICC]\u2019s actions ... do not displace state law as the traditional source of the real property interests. The Commission\u2019s actions may delay property owners\u2019 enjoyment of their reversionary interests, but that delay burdens and defeats the property interest rather than suspends or defers the vesting of those property rights. Any other conclusion would convert the ICC\u2019s power to pre-empt conflicting state regulation of interstate commerce into the power to preempt the rights guaranteed by state property law, a result incompatible with the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 22-23, 110 S.Ct. at 927, 108 L.Ed.2d 1 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (citations omitted); <em>see also National Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. ICC, </em>850 F.2d 694, 706 (D.C.Cir.1988) (\u201cIn any individual case, the effect of trail use on the reversionary owner\u2019s property rights will depend, in part, on precisely what those rights are <em>under relevant state law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)). The position of Justices O\u2019Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy in <em>Preseault </em>is, in my view, the appropriate position. The majority\u2019s position in this case does <em>exactly </em>what Justice O\u2019Connor said would occur; it converts the \u201cICC\u2019s power to preempt conflicting state regulation of interstate commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>into the power to preempt the rights guaranteed by state property law, a result incompatible with the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Instead of recognizing the role of state property law, the majority creates a new, third element in the law of abandonment for Maryland. That is, in addition to cessation of use and intent to abandon a property interest, the easement holder also must receive approval of federal authorities of a service cessation, if statutes require such approval, prior to the vesting of reversionary property interests that traditionally would have occurred. In doing so, the majority refuses even to pay lip service to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s property rights provisions. The majority does for the federal government what the Supreme Court has said the federal government cannot do. I reiterate that the federal court was well aware of the federal regulations necessitating approval; the federal regulations and their \u201ctakings\u201d effect are the crux of the issue the federal court is deciding. It did not need that information from this Court. It merely wanted to know what, in the absence of the federal regulations, was the law of abandonment in Maryland governing the purported reversionary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The majority goes to some length to argue that the uses the County intends for the property are within the scope of the original right-of-way of the railroad company. I disagree. But, more importantly, that scope is not relevant to whether the railroad company abandoned its right-of-way. If it abandoned its right-of-way, it abandoned all of it and it abandoned it prior to transferring the quit claim deed to the County. As to the question certified to this Court, whether the right-of-way has been abandoned, the intentions of the County as to future uses have absolutely no relevance. If the withholding of abandonment approval pursuant to the federal statutes is the reason the majority proffers, as it appears to, as to why the right-of-way has not been abandoned, that approval is still being withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The County\u2019s intentions have nothing to do with this case. Its quit claim deed was extracted from the railroad after the point that abandonment had taken place under what, prior to this case, used to be the law. If the right-of-way was abandoned before the County bought its quit claim interest, it bought a lawsuit. If not, then the certified question is answered and additional questions as to what the County bought have nothing to do with the certified question and should be left to another case, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">This is the second time in this term that the Court has rendered decisions that constitute, in my view, drastic departures from the theretofore accepted legal doctrines and theories relating, directly or indirectly, to the law of real property. In the present case, the Court adds a new element, final regulatory approval, to the centuries-old Maryland law of abandonment of easements by merely stating that it is so, although the simplicity of the majority\u2019s position is subtly contained in the eighty-plus pages of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In the Court\u2019s departure from long-standing real property principles, the majority in <em>Matthews v. Amberwood Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>351 Md. 544, 719 A.2d 119 (1998), held that an unenforced \u201cno pets\u201d provision in a lease subjected a landlord to negligence liability for damages sustained by a tenant\u2019s guest, who was attacked within the tenant\u2019s premises by the tenant\u2019s dog. In my view, no prior Maryland case had ever held a landlord liable for the negligence of a tenant where the act complained of and the resulting injuries that occurred to a tenant\u2019s guest were completely within the confines of the leased premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The law of property, and its related fields such as landlord-tenant law, have been among the most stable areas of the law. In my view, that stability has, over the years, been a positive influence on the law. That body of law now may be perceived by real property practitioners as a field of law under attack as a result of the Court\u2019s decisions this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In my view, the majority\u2019s position is result-oriented. I have no quarrel with the idea that unused railway rights-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>way are potential resources for recreation and environmental protection. The elements of the law of abandonment are, in substantial part, judge-made law and, while I do not advocate such an approach, this Court presumably has the power to impose prospectively an additional element in respect to the doctrine. Instead of now imposing a new, prospectively applicable element, however, the majority holds that this new element, approval of federal agencies, has always been part of the Maryland law of abandonment. That simply is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Finally, the majority\u2019s opinion will leave members of the bar at risk who may have been advising clients on abandonment issues under the traditional cessation of use and evidence of intent standards. We owe it to the bar to acknowledge change, even if it means acknowledging a departure from precedent or from the holdings of prior cases, when change is what the Court is doing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\">. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Anne Arundel County v. Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Railroad, </em>46 Md.App. 350, 416 A.2d 777 (1980), though faced with a jurisdictional question in a case in which the remaining issue before it was the applicability of an express reverter, opined at length on the nature of the abandonment requirements under federal railway abandonment statutes. The opinion assumed that federal regulatory abandonment requirements were the same as the Maryland law of abandonment. Whether they were the same was not at issue; nor was there any question as to regulatory unconstitutional takings issues. The issues before this Court in this case go to fundamental principles of Maryland property law and whether takings issues can be avoided by using the impact of the federal statutes to divest Maryland property owners of property rights they otherwise would possess.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">. The railway\u2019s deed to the property had been preceded by a conveyance to another party. The trial court thus ruled that the railway\u2019s deed was invalid, but then found that because it had operated the rail line for the period necessary to obtain a prescriptive easement, it had a valid right-of-way. <em>East Washington Ry., </em>244 Md. at 289, 223 A.2d at 600-01. The issue, therefore, was whether it had abandoned the right-of-way it had obtained by prescription.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
