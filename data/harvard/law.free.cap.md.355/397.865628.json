Dr. Regan began to work for the Yalich Clinic of Bel Air in 1987 and, in 1991, became the owner of the chiropractic portion of the clinic. From 1989 through 1992, Dr. Regan supervised and hired workers at both the chiropractic clinic and the rehabilitation clinic. During this supervisory period, Dr. Regan practiced with, supervised, and aided several unlicenced individuals in the practice of chiropractic. These unlicenced persons consisted of recent chiropractic school graduates as well as persons with little or no training in chiropractic or physical therapy. The unlicenced workers engaged in the practice of chiropractic by performing consultations, taking patient histories, conducting examinations, deciding upon areas to be xrayed and taking x-rays, determining that physical therapy should be performed, applying physical therapy modalities, and filling out insurance report forms. Dr. Regan had no documented, standardized training program for these persons. The tests performed by them were used by Dr. Regan to form a diagnosis which was used to determine a treatment plan for a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In the spring of 1993 the Board commenced an investigation into Dr. Regan\u2019s practice of chiropractic. While under investigation, Dr. Regan allegedly asked the regional manager of the Yalich Clinic, Joan Gee, to seduce Dr. Howard Lewis and Dr. Brent Owens, both members of the Board at the time, and Dr. John Hughes, President of the Maryland Chiropractic Association, in order to jeopardize the Board\u2019s proceedings. Dr. Regan allegedly told Ms. Gee that, if she did not try to entice Dr. Lewis into having a sexual liaison with her, she would lose her job. Ms. Gee made an appointment at Dr. Lewis\u2019s clinic and went to his clinic but did not try to seduce him. Ms. Gee also made appointments with both Dr. Owens and Dr. Hughes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>at their respective offices, but she did not keep these appointments. In addition, Dr. Regan allegedly asked his sister, Aileen Regan, who worked for him, to go to the office of Dr. Lewis to entice him into having a sexual liaison with her. His sister declined this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">On July 7, 1994, the Board charged Dr. Regan with violations of the Maryland Chiropractic Act, Maryland Code (1981, 1994 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Health Occupations Article. In support of its charges, the Board alleged that Dr. Regan hired, supervised, and aided unlicenced persons in the practice of chiropractic by allowing unlicenced employees to conduct examinations and consultations, take x-rays, and -write reports. In addition to the unauthorized practice allegations, the Board averred that Dr. Regan made and submitted false reports when he billed for services not actually performed and instructed his employees to falsify reports submitted to third party payors in order to prolong treatment. The Board further charged Dr. Regan with \u201csoliciting employees for the sole purpose of obtaining information to use against the Board\u201d through the alleged seduction scheme. Finally, the Board charged Dr. Regan with advertising in a misleading manner because he submitted newspaper advertisements in 1993 for free pain evaluations at the Yalich Clinic without listing his name or the name of any licensed chiropractor associated with the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">According to the Board\u2019s charges Dr. Regan violated the following provisions of Code (1981, 1994 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-313 of the Health Occupations Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cSubject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 3-315 of this subtitle, the Board may deny a license to any applicant, reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the applicant or licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">(7) Solicits or advertises in a false or misleading manner or in any other manner not approved by the Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">(8) Is unethical in the conduct of the practice of chiropractic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>(12) Wilfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of chiropractic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">(18) Practices chiropractic with an unauthorized person or supervises or aids an unauthorized person in the practice of chiropractic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">(19) Violates any rule or regulation adopted by the Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">(20) Behaves immorally in the practice of chiropractic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">(21) Commits an act of unprofessional conduct in the practice of chiropractic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The Board also charged Dr. Regan with violating \u00a7 3-407 of the Health Occupations Article and COMAR 10.43.03, both of which concern misleading advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Prior to the administrative hearing, Dr. Regan moved to disqualify the entire Board. At the time, the Board of Chiropractic Examiners consisted of six members, and at least four members were required for a quorum. A quorum must be present in order to hear a matter. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-202(a) and 3-204(a) of the Health Occupations Article. Of the six members, one consumer member, David Carey, Esq., recused himself because his law firm had previously handled a criminal matter involving Dr. Regan\u2019s office manager, who was to testify at the proceedings. Dr. Regan argued that Dr. Lewis should recuse himself because of the Board\u2019s allegations that Dr. Regan orchestrated a seduction plot against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Regan also sought the recusal of Dr. Audie Klinger because Dr. Klinger purportedly telephoned Dr. Regan to inform him that one of Dr. Regan\u2019s 1993 newspaper advertisements did not comply with the Board\u2019s regulations. Dr. Regan immediately changed the advertisement in order to comply. Dr. Regan asserted in his motion that Dr. Klinger led him to believe that, if the advertisement was changed immediately, Dr. Regan would not be subject to disciplinary action because of the matter. Dr. Regan moved to recuse Dr. Florence Blanck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>because Dr. Regan intended to call her as a witness to testify as to the Board\u2019s proposed regulations governing chiropractic assistants. Dr. Regan further sought the recusal of Dr. Paul Goszkowski and Dr. Lewis on the grounds that these doctors operated offices in the same geographic area as Dr. Regan\u2019s office and would, therefore, \u201cbenefit economically by an adverse decision to Dr. Regan.\u201d Dr. Regan moved for the recusal of the entire Board because \u201cthe impartiality of the entire Board will be contaminated if it recuses\u201d the aforementioned members. Dr. Regan argued that the Board \u201cshould delegate its authority to conduct the evidentiary hearing\u201d to the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings, an independent agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The Board denied Dr. Regan\u2019s motion and declined to delegate its authority to the Office of Administrative Hearings. In response to Dr. Regan\u2019s arguments concerning Dr. Lewis, the Board held that \u201cDr. Lewis, like all other Board members, has pledged to carry out his responsibilities as a public official; part of those responsibilities, as a Board member, is to participate in hearings; in so doing, all of the members have pledged to listen to all of the evidence presented and render a fair and impartial decision.\u201d Additionally, the Board concluded that Dr. Regan\u2019s argument as to Dr. Lewis\u2019s and Dr. Goszkowski\u2019s financial interests was \u201cspeculative and baseless.\u201d The Board stated that Dr. Klinger would not testify at the hearing and that, if Dr. Klinger did in fact telephone Dr. Regan concerning the advertisement, \u201cthat [stipulation] can be arrived at or same can be contained in the Findings of Fact that will form part of the Board\u2019s Order following the hearing.\u201d The Board held that Dr. Blanck also would not testify at the hearing and did not need to recuse herself. Finally, in declining to refer the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings, the Board reasoned that the final decision will ultimately be the Board\u2019s regardless of which agency conducts the hearing, and that the Board is in a better position, because of its expertise, to determine what constitutes the practice of chiropractic.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>On November 2, 1994, Dr. Regan filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County a petition for interlocutory review of the Board\u2019s decision and a motion to stay the proceedings. On November 10, 1994, the circuit court denied the requested relief. Also, on November 10, 1994, the Board voted to dismiss all of the advertising charges, in part, because Dr. Regan \u201cwithdrew the advertisement immediately\u201d after \u201creceiving a telephone call from the Board\u2019s President, Dr. Audie Klinger, that said advertisement violated the Act [\u00a7\u00a7 3-313(19) and 3-407] and COMAR 10.43.03.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The Board conducted an evidentiary hearing which commenced on November 14, 1994, and continued over the course of seven days. The matter was heard by a quorum of the Board consisting of the following members: Dr. Klinger, Dr. Lewis, Dr. Blanck, consumer member Ivy Logan Harris, and Dr. Goszkowski. The Board, in a 92-page opinion containing detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, determined that Dr. Regan violated the following provisions of the Health Occupations Article: \u00a7 3-313(8) (unethical conduct in the practice of chiropractic); \u00a7 3-313(12) (filing a false report or record in the practice of chiropractic); \u00a7 3-313(18) (practicing chiropractic with an unauthorized person or supervising or aiding an unauthorized person in the practice of chiropractic); and \u00a7 3-313(21) (unprofessional conduct in the practice of chiropractic). The Board ordered that Dr. Regan\u2019s license be suspended for two years and that he be placed on probation for three years subject to specified conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The Board\u2019s factual findings, based on the testimony of witnesses, were as follows. The Board found that Dr. Regan \u201cpracticed with, supervised and aided several unlicenced individuals in the practice of chiropractic.\u201d In addition, the Board found that the testimony established that Dr. Regan delegated the following duties to unlicenced individuals: consultation with patients, taking patient history, conducting examinations, conducting tests, taking x-rays, performing physical therapy modalities, and writing reports for third party payors. The Board stated that the tests performed by the unlicenced persons were used by Dr. Regan \u201cto form a diagnosis which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>was used to make a treatment plan for his patients. Tests performed by unlicenced individuals posed a risk to patients that diagnoses and treatment plans would be inaccurate or erroneous, because same required professional skills, extensive training and clinical judgment.\u201d The Board found that Dr. Regan \u201cfailed to document a systematic training program for the unlicenced individuals that he supervised.\u201d The Board held that \u201cit is not consistent with sound chiropractic practice for a licensee to permit unlicenced staff to perform the entire consultation, determine areas that need to be x-rayed and position patients for same, conduct a full examination involving range of motion, orthopedic, sensory evaluations and neurological assessments, and to determine what types of physical therapy are needed based on those examinations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The Board also found that Dr. Regan \u201csubmitted false statements in the practice of chiropractic\u201d when he billed a patient\u2019s insurer for physical therapy which the patient\u2019s chart did not indicate that she received on the dates billed. Furthermore, the Board said that Dr. Regan \u201cdisguised non-covered services, such as manipulation, as a covered service in order to bill\u201d the insurer. The Board found that Dr. Regan established the billing policy for the office, was responsible for it, and instructed the employees to falsify records.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The Board\u2019s charges with respect to Dr. Regan\u2019s alleged attempt to have his employees seduce Board members were dismissed at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case pursuant to Dr. Regan\u2019s motion. The Board did not hear any evidence or make any findings regarding the alleged seduction scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Subsequently the parties agreed, by filing a consent order, to stay the suspension of Dr. Regan\u2019s license pending judicial review. Dr. Regan has continued to practice chiropractic while he awaits the review of the Board\u2019s action, and, according to the Board, he has complied with the Board\u2019s conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Dr. Regan filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City an action for judicial review of the Board\u2019s order. In February 1997 the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that the decision \u201cdoes not constitute a denial of [Dr. Regan\u2019s] rights to due process, does not constitute reversible error of law, is not arbitrary and capricious, and is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">On Dr. Regan\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, the appellate court upheld the Board\u2019s decision \u201cinsofar as it relates to violations of the Maryland Chiropractic Act\u201d but ordered that the administrative decision be vacated with respect to sanctions because \u201cDr. Regan has already served what is in effect a probationary period almost equal to that ordered by the Board.\u201d <em>Regan v. Board of Chiropractic, </em>120 Md.App. 494, 523-524, 707 A.2d 891, 905 (1998). The appellate court ordered that the case be remanded to the Board for it to \u201cconsider whether the sanctions previously imposed remain appropriate or should be modified.\u201d 120 Md.App. at 524, 707 A.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Dr. Regan challenged the participation in the Board\u2019s proceedings of only two Board members: Dr. Klinger because of his person\u00e1l involvement with the advertising charges, and Dr. Lewis because of the alleged seduction scheme. The Court of Special Appeals upheld the denial of the recusal motion as to both Dr. Klinger and Dr. Lewis, stating that recusal would have made a quorum of the Board impossible, thereby depriving the Board \u201cof its right to hear the matter involving Dr. Regan.\u201d 120 Md. App. at 513, 707 A.2d at 900. Additionally, the appellate court held that Dr. Regan failed to demonstrate any prejudice or actual bias on the part of the Board members. Instead, the court stated that Dr. Regan was merely arguing \u201cgeneralities and appearances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected Dr. Regan\u2019s arguments that he was not given adequate notice of new facts developed at the hearing and contained in the Board\u2019s findings but not set forth in the Board\u2019s charging document. The appellate court concluded that \u201c(1) the Board gave Dr. Regan adequate and reasonable notice of the nature of the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tions, and (2) that the notice provided to Dr. Regan enabled him to prepare an adequate defense.\u201d 120 Md.App. at 519-520, 707 A.2d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Dr. Regan filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Regan v. State Board, </em>350 Md. 488, 713 A.2d 981 (1998). In his certiorari petition, Dr. Regan presented the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201c1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erroneously held that Dr. Regan was required to demonstrate actual bias to succeed on a recusal motion based upon appearance of impropriety where the hearing panel included one member who was named in the charging document as the target of a blackmail-type scheme allegedly orchestrated by Dr. Regan and had personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning that charge and another who had personal knowledge of facts relating to an advertising charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201c2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals committed reversible error when it improperly upheld the Board\u2019s denial of Dr. Regan\u2019s recusal motion by reasoning that the right of the Board to assert jurisdiction was paramount to the right of the accused to an impartial tribunal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201c3. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erroneously decided that the Board provided Dr. Regan with legally adequate prior notice of the charges against him even though it prosecuted him based on allegations not set forth in the charging document?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">We shall treat the first and second questions together, as they are both concerned with whether the Board was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>impartial because of the failure of Drs. Klinger and Lewis to have recused themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Dr. Regan argues that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cimproperly imposed upon Dr. Regan the burden of demonstrating actual bias.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 15). Dr. Regan contends that actual bias is not necessary to recuse an administrative fact finder; instead, a \u201cfact finder may just as well be recused based on his appearance of impropriety in a particular case.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>emphasis omitted). Dr. Regan asserts that Drs. Klinger and Lewis should have recused themselves because their participation gave the appearance of impropriety. He contends that the dismissal of the advertising charge and the charge concerning the seduction plot did not cure this appearance of impropriety. Dr. Regan maintains that Dr. Lewis\u2019s participation is particularly improper because \u201cthere can be no reasonable dispute that someone who is allegedly the target of a blackmail plot may not sit in judgment of the individual accused of masterminding that plot without giving rise to an appearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We have often stated that \u201c[procedural due process, guaranteed to persons in this State by Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, requires that administrative agencies performing adjudicatory or quasi-judicial functions observe the basic principles of fairness as to parties appearing before them.\u201d <em>Maryland State Police v.

As previously mentioned, however, he argues that Dr. Klinger and Dr. Lewis should have recused themselves because of \u201cthe appearance of impropriety\u201d (petitioner\u2019s brief at 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Canon 3(C)(1) of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct, which is not applicable to members of the Maryland Board of Chiropractic Examiners, states that a \u201cjudge should not participate in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d With regard to the Maryland regulations applicable to administrative law judges employed by the Office of Administrative Hearings, COMAR 28.02.01.08(A)(1) requires a judge to \u201c[cjonduct a full, fair, and impartial hearing,\u201d and COMAR 28.02.01.08(C)(1)(a) states that an administrative law judge \u201cshall withdraw from participation in any proceeding in which personal bias or other reasons render the judge unable to provide an impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>hearing and decision, <em>or when an appearance of impropriety may reasonably be inferred from the facts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).

As Judge Bell observed for the Court in <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 107, 622 A.2d 737, 741 (1993),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201c[Tjhere is a strong presumption in Maryland ... and elsewhere ... that judges are impartial participants in the legal process, whose duty to preside when qualified is as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>strong as their duty to refrain from presiding when not qualified.... The recusal decision, therefore, is discretionary ... and the exercise of that discretion will not be overturned except for abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The Court in <em>Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107-108, 622 A.2d at 741, went on to discuss \u201cthe proper test to be applied\u201d in determining whether there is an \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d and quoted from <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 86, 581 A.2d 1, 9 (1990), where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he test to be applied is an objective one which assumes that a reasonable person <em>knows and understands all the relevant facts. </em>... We disagree with our dissenting colleague\u2019s statement that recusal based on an appearance of impropriety ... \u201crequires us to judge the situation from the viewpoint of the reasonable person, and not from a purely legalistic perspective.\u201d Like all legal issues, judges determine appearance of impropriety\u2014not by what a straw poll of the only partly informed man-in-the-street would show\u2014 but by examining the record facts and the law, and deciding whether a reasonable person knowing and understanding all the relevant facts would recuse the judge.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>In Re Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., </em>861 F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1102, 109 S.Ct. 2458, 104 L,Ed.2d 1012 (1989)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 468, 578 A.2d 745, 759 (1990) (\u201cUsing an objective standard precludes the necessity of delving into the subjective mindset of the challenged judge\u201d); <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 253, 533 A.2d 916, 920 (1987) (\u201cThe test generally used in the application of [the] standard is an objective one\u2014whether a reasonable member of the public knowing all the circumstances would be led to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Applying this standard to the present case, we conclude that Dr. Klinger and Dr. Lewis were not required to recuse themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Dr. Regan argued that Dr. Klinger should have recused himself because Dr. Klinger called Dr. Regan with respect to a newspaper advertisement and informed Dr. Regan that he should include his own name in the advertisement. Dr. Regan was under the impression that, once he cured this defect in the advertisement, he would not be subject to disciplinary action because of the advertisement. Despite this assumption, the charging document contained allegations of violations of advertising laws and regulations. Nevertheless, the advertising charges were dismissed prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Merely calling Dr. Regan about the advertisement does not rise to the level of an appearance of impropriety, especially with respect to an administrative body such as the Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Administrative agencies often combine investigative and adjudicative functions. Simply because an administrator may have some earlier knowledge of a case does not mean that he or she is precluded from rendering a fair decision after all of the evidence has been presented in an evidentiary hearing. <em>See, e.g., American Recovery Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>306 Md. 12, 25, 506 A.2d 1171, 1177 (1986) (\u201cthe mere recitation by an agency official of the underlying facts that are alleged to support the charges in question does not inherently manifest bias on the part of the agency official, so as to preclude such official from rendering a fair decision after all the evidence has been brought out through the adversarial process\u201d); <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 764, 501 A.2d 48, 65 (1985) (\u201cthe issuance of press releases announcing charges by the agency that will ultimately decide the case does not violate due process guarantees\u201d); <em>Board of Medical Examiners v. Steward, supra, </em>203 Md. at 583,102 A.2d at 252 (\u201can administrative agency is sometimes required to act as both prosecutor and judge, and it has never been held that such procedure denies constitutional right\u201d); Richard E. Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>\u00a7 30.5.4 (1996) (\u201cAdministrative decisionmakers do not automatically become biased merely because they have become familiar with the facts of a proceeding through the performance of their administrative duties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Moreover, we have held that a judge is not necessarily disqualified for having earlier expressed an opinion as to a case. <em>See Doering v. Fader, </em>316 Md. 351, 558 A.2d 733 (1989) (trial judge who had previously expressed an opinion as to the impropriety of death sentence in the particular case was not disqualified from presiding at the later capital sentencing hearing). In the present case, the advertising charge was dismissed, thereby diminishing any concern as to whether any previously formed opinion by Dr. Klinger might create an appearance of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">It is difficult to imagine that a reasonable person, knowing all of the facts, would believe that Dr. Klinger was biased, particularly since the charge was promptly dismissed before the hearing ever began and since no evidence was heard on the matter. Furthermore, the advertising charge was neither complex nor emotionally charged; it merely concerned a matter-of-fact question as to whether or not Dr. Regan included his name in an advertisement. Dr. Regan has failed to demonstrate any appearance of impropriety by Dr. Klinger\u2019s taking part in the hearing and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Similarly, we do not believe that a reasonable person, knowing and understanding all of the relevant facts, would believe that Dr. Lewis was prejudiced because of the alleged seduction plot. Dr. Lewis was not even aware of the alleged plot until it came to his attention during the course of the investigation. Assuming the truth of the allegations, Ms. Gee did not make any attempt to sexually entice Dr. Lewis and did not inform him of the purpose of her visit to his office. No evidence was taken concerning the alleged plot either before, during, or after the hearing. The charge based on the alleged misconduct was dismissed. The allegation remains merely an allegation of an attempt to orchestrate a seduction scheme. All of these factors diminish any likelihood that Dr. Lewis could not hear and decide the case impartially. A reasonable person, knowing and understanding all of the facts, would not conclude that Dr. Lewis was likely to have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In addition, the alleged seduction plot did not involve any conduct on the part of Dr. Lewis; rather, the allegations concerned the purported actions of Dr. Regan. Although an appearance of impropriety can result from many different factual scenarios, courts have been most reluctant to find an appearance of impropriety on the basis of a litigant\u2019s actions. For example, in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Hollis, </em>347 Md. 547, 559, 702 A.2d 223, 229 (1997), this Court was unwilling to disqualify a judge merely because a party had refused to support the re-election of the judge. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. 228, 241, 438 A.2d 501, 508 (1981), this Court was unwilling to disqualify a judge on the ground that the litigant had earlier written an article criticizing the judge. <em>See also, e.g., United States v. Hillsberg, </em>812 F.2d 328, 335 (7th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>481 U.S. 1041, 107 S.Ct. 1981, 95 L.Ed.2d 821 (the court held that recusal was not required where the defendant\u2019s mother had written to the judge before the defendant\u2019s trial, reasoning that \u201cany defendant who wished a change of judge would require no more than a note from his mother\u201d); <em>United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 940 (9th Cir.1986) (a \u201cjudge is not disqualified by a litigant\u2019s suit or threatened suit against him\u201d nor \u201cby a litigant\u2019s intemperate and scurrilous attacks\u201d); <em>United States v. Bray, </em>546 F.2d 851, 858 (10th Cir.1976) (\u201cPrior written attacks upon a judge\u201d are insufficient to support a charge of bias or prejudice); <em>Pote v. State, </em>733 P.2d 1018, 1020-1021 (Wyo.1987); <em>In re Martin-Trigona, </em>573 F.Supp. 1237 (D.Conn.1983), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>770 F.2d 157 (2nd Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1058, 106 S.Ct. 1285, 89 L.Ed.2d 592 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Thus, courts have been reluctant to allow litigants to utilize motions for recusal, based on the litigants\u2019 conduct, in order to \u201cjudge shop.\u201d In <em>United States v. Owens, </em>902 F.2d 1154, 1156 (4th Cir.1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201cParties cannot be allowed to create the basis for recusal by their own deliberate actions. To hold otherwise would encourage inappropriate \u2018judge shopping.\u2019 It would invite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>litigants to test the waters with a particular judge and then to take steps to create recusal grounds if the waters prove uncomfortably hot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>See also United States v. Dalfonso, </em>707 F.2d 757, 761 (3rd Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Bray, supra, </em>546 F.2d at 858; <em>In re Martin-Trigona, supra, </em>573 F.Supp. at 1243 (\u201cThe right to an impartial judge cannot be advanced so broadly as to permit the parties to engage in \u2018judge-shopping\u2019 under the guise of a motion to recuse\u201d). Motions for recusal are \u201cnot meant to be abused as elements of trial strategy.\u201d Richard E. Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, supra, </em>\u00a7 21.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">A litigant ordinarily should not be permitted to create an appearance of impropriety in order to disqualify a judge. <em>In re WHET, Inc., </em>33 B.R. 424 (D.Mass.1983). Courts have long \u201crecognized that this type of conduct should not be rewarded\u2014that is, that a party should not be permitted to cause the disqualification of a judge by its own intentional actions.\u201d Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, supra, </em>\u00a7 21.4.1. <em>See Wilks v. Israel, </em>627 F.2d 32, 37 (7th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1086, 101 S.Ct. 874, 66 L.Ed.2d 811 (1981); <em>State v. Jeffers, </em>135 Ariz. 404, 428, 661 P.2d 1105, 1129 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865, 104 S.Ct. 199, 78 L.Ed.2d 174 (holding that recusal was not required where a litigant made the trial judge the target of a scheme involving the receipt of unsolicited goods from several mail order firms, reasoning that this \u201ckind of conduct should not be rewarded\u201d); <em>Matter of Extradition of Singh, </em>123 F.R.D. 140, 149 (D.N.J.1988) (no recusal based on the receipt of a threat because recusal \u201cwould only encourage litigants to send threats in the hope of forcing recusal and obtaining a different judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In the present case, we are unwilling to require recusal based on Dr. Regan\u2019s own alleged actions. Prior to the hearing, Dr. Regan moved to recuse <em>all </em>of the Board members. A reasonable person might well conclude, based on all of the facts, that Dr. Regan was attempting to obtain what he may have viewed as a more favorable forum for his disciplinary hearing. In any event, we do not believe that a reason-</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>able person, knowing the facts, would conclude that Dr. Lewis was prejudiced against Dr. Regan because of the alleged seduction plot.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Dr. Regan argues that, in several respects, the Board failed to provide him \u201cwith adequate notice of the charges against him,\u201d (petitioner\u2019s brief at 26). Consequently, according to Dr. Regan, the Board violated the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-207(a) and (b) of the State Government Article. Section 10-207 states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u201c \u00a7 10-207. Notice of agency action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014An agency shall give reasonable notice of the agency\u2019s action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">(b) <em>Contents of </em>notice.\u2014The notice shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">(1) state concisely and simply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">(i) the facts that are asserted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">(ii) if the facts cannot be stated in detail when the notice is given, the issues that are involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABM\">(2) state the pertinent statutory and regulatory sections under which the agency is taking its action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">(3) state the sanction proposed or the potential penalty, if any, as a result of the agency\u2019s action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">(4) unless a hearing is automatically scheduled, state that the recipient of notice of an agency\u2019s action may have an opportunity to request a hearing, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-15\">(i) what, if anything, a person must do to receive a hearing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-16\">(ii) all relevant time requirements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-17\">(5) state the direct consequences, sanction, potential penalty, if any, or remedy of the recipient\u2019s failure to exercise in a timely manner the opportunity for a hearing or to appear for a scheduled hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>See Reed v. Baltimore, </em>328 Md. 175, 184, 592 A.2d 173, 177 (1991) (\u201cThe obvious purpose of the notice requirement ... is to apprise the [party] of the charges warranting disciplinary action in sufficient detail to enable the [party] to marshal evidence and arguments in defense of the assertions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">We agree with the Board and with both courts below that Dr. Regan received \u201creasonable notice\u201d of the charges and that, therefore, there was no violation of \u00a7 10-207 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Dr. Regan first challenges the adequacy of notice in the charging document regarding witness Deborah Tibbs Tillman. In the charging document, the Board alleged that Ms. Tillman, unlicenced and not a graduate of a chiropractic school, performed \u201cpatient examinations, consultations, and reports for workers compensation and personal injury patients.\u201d Also, the charging document alleged that Ms. Tillman falsified reports in order to prolong treatment. After conducting the hearing, the Board found that Ms. Tillman was an unlicenced high school graduate who applied physical therapy modalities, such as heat, ice, ultrasound and electrical stimulation. In addition, the Board found that Ms. Tillman conducted consultations, took patient histories, performed examinations, decided which areas needed to be x-rayed, decided what physical therapy should be performed on patients, and filled out reports to third party payors.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Dr. Regan argues that the Board did not adequately notify him that it would seek to hold him liable for Ms. Tillman\u2019s unauthorized practice of \u201cphysical therapy\u201d as opposed to the unauthorized practice of \u201cchiropractic.\u201d The short answer to this argument, as pointed out by the Board, is that the performance of physical therapy was within the scope of Dr. Regan\u2019s chiropractic license, that both services were provided at his clinics, and that Dr. Regan was not independently licensed as a physical therapist. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-301(c) of the Health Occupations Article. The gist of the charges concerning Ms. Tillman, and the gist of the Board\u2019s findings, was that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Regan improperly delegated duties to her which Dr. Regan was authorized to perform under his chiropractic license and which Ms. Tillman was not authorized to perform. Dr. Regan had ample notice of the charges relating to Ms. Tillman.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Dr. Regan next argues that the charges relating to the witness Karen Trotta did not afford adequate notice. Ms. Trotta was both an employee and a patient of Dr. Regan. In the charging document, the Board alleged that Ms. Trotta, an unlicenced chiropractic assistant, conducted patient consultations, performed patient examinations, and wrote reports. The Board\u2019s findings as to Ms. Trotta concluded that she was an unlicenced high school graduate who performed consultations, performed examinations, and completed insurance reports. The Board also found that Dr. Regan \u201cfailed to document that Trotta received a systematic training program for the activities which she performed.\u201d Dr. Regan contends that the Board exceeded the scope of the charges by questioning Ms. Trotta about whether Dr. Regan billed her for chiropractic services not rendered. He also asserts that the Board erred in finding that he failed to document whether Ms. Trotta had completed a required training program because such failure was not alleged in the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">With respect to billing Ms. Trotta for chiropractic services not rendered, the Board, in its findings concerning false reports and bills based on false reports, made no findings about false bills concerning Ms. Trotta. The Board also did not discipline Dr. Regan for this action. Similarly, the Board did not discipline Dr. Regan because of his failure to document whether Ms. Trotta had completed a required training program. In the detailed portion of its opinion entitled \u201cConclusions of Law,\u201d which sets forth the basis for the disciplinary action imposed, there is no mention of either of these matters relating to Ms. Trotta. Consequently, Dr. Regan was not disciplined for matters relating to Ms. Trotta which were not covered by the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Finally, Dr. Regan maintains that he was not given \u201cnotice of its [the Board\u2019s] intention to prosecute him for Laura <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Orem\u2019s role as a chiropractic assistant engaged in the unauthorized practice of chiropractic. The factual allegations in the Charging Document concerning Ms. Orem are limited exclusively to the Board\u2019s allegation that Dr. Regan \u2018billed Ms. Orem\u2019s insurance for physical therapy she never received.\u2019\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 28-29).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Laura Orem was both an employee and a patient of Dr. Regan. In the charging document, the Board alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cIn August 1991, the Respondent hired Laura Orem to work in the Bel Air Clinic as a front desk receptionist, chiropractic assistant, and examination assistant at the Bel Air Clinic. In January 1992, Ms. Orem became a patient of the Respondent. During the course of her treatment, the Respondent billed Ms. Orem\u2019s insurance for physical therapy she never received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The Board made the following statement in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cLaura Orem worked at the Bel Air Clinic from August 1991 to July 1992 where she worked as a front desk receptionist and then trained as a chiropractic assistant, providing physical therapy which consisted of electrical stimulation, hot packs and ultrasound. Orem also did patient consults, taking patient histories.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In a footnote, the Board continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u201cAlthough there are allegations in the charges regarding the fact that Orem performed as a chiropractic assistant, the specifics of those duties were not set forth in the type of detail that described the unlicenced activities of the others. Orem testified that she worked as a chiropractic assistant, which testimony is supported by that of Eid and the Respondent. Therefore, although the Board notes that Orem may have performed some duties for which either training, skills or competency were required, the focus of the Board\u2019s findings and subsequent discussion will be on the Respondent\u2019s charging Orem for services not rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The Board concluded that Dr. Regan \u201csubmitted false statements in the practice of chiropractic in that he billed Laura</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Orem\u2019s insurer for physical therapy which her chart did not indicate that she received on the dates billed\u201d and \u201cthat he provided physical therapy on her chart when she received manipulation.\u201d It is clear from the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions that Dr. Regan was not disciplined because he had Ms. Orem engage in the unauthorized practice of chiropractic. Instead, discipline insofar as it was based on matters concerning Ms. Orem, was based entirely on the fraudulent billing practices. Again, Dr. Regan was not disciplined for a matter not covered by the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The Board\u2019s findings and conclusions encompassed two primary areas of misconduct: improper delegation of chiropractic duties and fraudulent billing practices. Dr. Regan was given reasonable notice in the charging document of these matters. Furthermore, the Board\u2019s conclusions, forming the basis for the imposition of discipline, concerned matters specifically encompassed by the charging document. The Board and both courts below correctly held that Dr. Regan had reasonable notice of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
