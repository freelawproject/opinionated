Bloomfield, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AqD\">The Board of Tax Appeals, in modifying the order of the Tax Commissioner and finding that the above items were excepted from the Ohio sales and use taxes, used the following language in its decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u201cFrom the testimony and evidence in the record now before us it is clear that appellant could not operate its electric and steam plants without using the items here in issue. We therefore find that the items in dispute were essential in keeping the actual service in operation and therefore the purchased items here in dispute are excepted from sales and use taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The appellant argues that the issue now before this court is: \u201cWhether the items in question were purchased by appellee to be used directly in the rendition of a public utility service for purposes of Section 5739.01(E) (2), Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The pertinent part of R. C. 5739.01 is as fellows:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail Sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\"><em>i </em>\u00cd * # #</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u201c(2) * * # to use or consume the thing transferred * * * directly in the rendition of a public utility service * * * ? 5</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">The appellee takes the position, however, that the issue before this court is whether the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reasonable and lawful. We believe appellee\u2019s position to be a correct one, as stated in this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jewel Companies </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 97, at page 99:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">\u2018 \u2018 Our review of this type of case is limited to a determination as to whether the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable or unlawful. <em>Hoffmon-LaRoche, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Inc., </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 158; Section 5717.-04, Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Jewel, </em>at page 99, it is stated :</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u201cIt does not matter whether we might have weighed the evidence differently from the Board of Tax Appeals if we had been making the original determination. As long as there is evidence which reasonably supports the conclusion reached by the board, its decision mm-t stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARZ\">The law which the Board of Tax Appeals correctly applied was that which is to be found in <em>Athens Home Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1953), 158 Ohio St. 557; <em>Erie Rd. Co. </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 322; and <em>Warren Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Such cases, in construing the meaning of the public utility \u201cdirect use\u201d exception, applied similar tests, with the following descriptive language:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u201c* * * A substantial part of the rendition of the <em>service </em>is keeping the entire system in <em>continuous </em>operation. This requires the <em>immediate and direct use </em>of the concededly <em>indispensable </em>automotive facilities here involved,\u201d <em>Athens Home Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Peck, supra. </em>(Emphasis supplied, except as to word \u201cservice.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u201c* # * This court does not regard these provisions [requirements for depots and waiting buildings for the public use] as conclusive of the question here presented, but it does consider these expressions of the General Assembly and the Public Utilities Commission as of some evidentiary value in determining whether a passenger station is <em>necessary and used directly </em>in the rendition of public utility service by a railroad under present day conditions,\u201d <em>Erie Rd. Co. </em>v. <em>Peck, supra. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The question which must be determined in each case is whether the property is <em>used directly in and, as an indispensable part of keeping the actual public utility service in operation.\u201d </em>And the materials must be <em>\u2018\u2018a part of the rendering of the actual service,\u201d Warren Telephone Co, </em>v. <em>Rowers, supra. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The basic theme of the consideration in such cases is whether the purchased items were essential or indispensable in keeping the utility in continuous operation for the provision of service to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">In the instant case, the Board of Tax Appeals found from the evidence before it that Ohio Edison could not operate its electric and steam plants and provide the service to the public without using the items here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Upon review, we find that such decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
