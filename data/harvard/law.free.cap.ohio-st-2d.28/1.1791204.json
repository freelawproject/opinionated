They cite R. C. 3501.38(1), which states: \u201cNo alterations, corrections, or additions may be made to a petition after it is filed in a public office.\u201d Relators also cite <em>State, ex rel. Weaver, </em>v. <em>Wiethe </em>(1965), 4 Ohio St. 2d 1, in which relator was not permitted to file additional signatures after the board of elections had determined that an insufficient number had been filed. <em>Weaver </em>does not require a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>to issue where this addition (or deletion) does not affect the efficacy of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Relators argue that any result short of declaring the entire petition invalid would be contrary to the intent of the General Assembly. It is argued further that the only effective remedy to enforce the statute is to declare the entire petition invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Respondents point out that R. 0. 3311.22 requires a county superintendent of schools to submit a referendum petition to the board of elections to determine its sufficiency and argue that R. C. 3501.38(1) was enacted to prevent alteration of the petition between the time, of its filing and when it receives the consideration of the board of elections. Respondents suggest that if changes made on a petition after it has been found sufficient will invalidate it, then opponents of an issue could seek to deliberately alter, and thus invalidate, the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">Only one paragraph in R. C. 3501.38 (paragraph [F]) makes any reference to the rejection of an entire petition which is in instances where the circulator \u201cknowingly permits an unqualified person to sign.\u201d That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">It is not contended that there was fraud, deception or undue influence in connection with the preparation, circulation, signing, filing or validation of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b21-10\">O\u2019Neill, C.
