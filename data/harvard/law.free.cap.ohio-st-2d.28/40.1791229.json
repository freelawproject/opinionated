Essentially, considerations of public protection and the good name of an ancient and honored profession are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">While conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude does not automatically require permanent disbarment, but may under some circumstances warrant only the lesser penalty of indefinite suspension, we know of no case where such a conviction has been followed by a mere public reprimand by this court. See Lawyer Discipline: The Ohio Story, by Professor Oliver Schroeder, Jr., wherein our disciplinary cases are digested and summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Moreover, the degree of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is of vital concern in evaluating the damage done to the public confidence so essential to a working interrelationship between the bench, the bar, and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">From a careful review of the evidence it appears that, even now, respondent either does not fully appreciate or fails to acknowledge the extent to which he violated basic principles of professional conduct. He still insists that his relationship to Stassis was merely that of attorney and client, and that if only he had had the opportunity of another council meeting, sifter February 18, 1964, he could have \u201crevealed his position on representing of Stassis to council. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">A civilized society cannot long remain without implicit confidence in those who occupy responsible positions of public trust, including both public officials, and members of the bar who are \u201cofficers of the court.\u201d The solicita^ tion and acceptance of a bribe by such a person is, by its very nature, so serious as to warrant, if not to compel, permanent removal from such a position of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The General Assembly has prescribed disqualification from \u201cpublic office or appointment under this state\u201d for all persons convicted of a violation of B. C. 2917.01. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>respondent may never again occupy public office regardless of whether'he has otherwise \u201cpaid his debt to society\u201d by meeting the terms of his probation, and regardless of \u201crehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">While such disqualification from public office is not binding on this court in imposing discipline upon attorneys, the same considerations, except in the most unusual circumstances, should impel this court to permanently disbar those convicted of soliciting and accepting bribes to influence their public duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Applying those considerations to this case, the report of the board is confirmed, and judgment is rendered permanently disbarring respondent from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>Report confirmed and judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
