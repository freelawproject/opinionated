Board of Elections (1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 4.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b22-9\">(No. 71-580</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdA\">Decided October 6, 1971.)</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Mr. Albert L. Purola, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-6\"><em>Mr. John T. Corrigan, </em>prosecuting attorney, and <em>Mr. John L. Dowling, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b23-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">R. C. 3513.261 states, in pertinent part: \u201cA nominating petition may consist of one or more separate petition papers <em>* * *. </em>If the petition consists of more than one separate petition paper, the statement of candidacy of the candidate named <em>need </em>be signed by the candidate and his affidavit thereto <em>need </em>be subscribed by him and executed <em>on </em>only <em>one </em>of such separate petition papers, but the statement of candidacy so signed, subscribed, and executed, shall be copied on each other separate petition paper before the signatures of electors are placed thereon.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Relator contends that he has substantially complied with R. C. 3513.261, and therefore has a right to the relief sought. He relies particularly on <em>State, ex rel. Kroeger, </em>v. <em>Leonard </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 197, and <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Board of Elections </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St. 2d 175, both of which discuss substantial compliance. <em>Kroeger, </em>however, affirmed the Court of Appeals which had denied a writ of mandamus because the circulator\u2019s oath did not indicate his membership in a political party, noting that the board of elections did not violate \u201ca plain legal duty by refusing the petitions.\u201d In <em>Stern, </em>relator sought removal of names from the ballot by injunction because of a defective jurat. There, the board had approved the petitions, and, further, this court was not faced with the \u201cplain legal duty\u201d requirements of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">Respondent relies essentially on <em>State, ex rel. Ferguson, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 317, which we feel is dispositive of the case at bar. At page 319, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">\u201c* * * such declaration may be an <em>original one </em>at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>head of <em>each </em>petition paper circulated, signed by the candidate individually * * * or there may be a <em>single complete original declaration </em>with identical copies thereof heading all other separate nominating petition papers * * V\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Since relator failed to timely file his petition containing at least one originally signed and notarized statement of candidacy, as the statute requires, respondent is not under a clear legal duty to place his name on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is sustained and the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b24-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan and Leach, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b24-9\">Schneider, Duncan and Stern, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b24-10\">Schneider, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AA0\">dissenting. <em>Ferguson </em>(173 Ohio St. 317) involved clearly defective declarations of candidacy and petitions. Even so, the <em>per curiam </em>language of <em>Ferguson, </em>as quoted in the majority opinion in this case, does not require the result reached here. No statute and no judicial language presented to us forbids the use of identical copies of an original declaration or requires the original to be filed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b24-11\">Duncan and Stern, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
