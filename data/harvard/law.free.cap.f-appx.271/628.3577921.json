We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Hernandez-Gil v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 803, 804 n. 1 (9th Cir.2007). We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">The BIA determined that Ayvazian was statutorily barred from adjusting her status because she had failed to depart voluntarily. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B) (alien who fails to voluntarily depart shall be ineligible to adjust status for a period of 10 years). However, the BIA did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Barroso v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 1195, 1205-07 (9th Cir. 2005) (the timely filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider within the period of voluntary departure automatically tolls that period). Ayvazian filed her motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status on April 24, 2003, within the 30 days of voluntary departure granted by the BIA on April 2, 2003. Ayvazian was not statutorily barred from adjusting her status.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
