For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Until January of 2004, Huffaker worked for Pepperidge Farms, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, as a manager of a Pepperidge Farms thrift store. Huffaker was covered under the Campbell Soup Company\u2019s Long Term Disability Benefits Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d), for which MetLife processes benefits claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">On January 21, 2004, Huffaker applied for short-term disability benefits after fracturing one of her left ribs due to coughing. The Attending Physician Statement submitted in support of her claim noted that she was capable of working eight hours a day, but unable to perform heavy lifting, and could return to work on \u201cfull duty with no restrictions\u201d on January 27, 2004. MetLife tentatively approved Huffaker\u2019s claim for short-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">On February 24, 2004, Huffaker consulted Dr. Charles Bozeman, a primary care physician, after aggravating her rib injury. Dr. Bozeman prepared an Attending Physician Statement indicating a primary diagnosis of a fractured rib and secondary diagnoses of bronchitis and fibromyalgia, noting that Huffaker was \u201cable to perform most of her job part of the time,\u201d but was still recovering from a fractured rib. During an office visit one month later, Dr. Bozeman noted that Huffaker\u2019s pain had worsened to the point that \u201c[tjhere is really hardly any place that she doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d and diagnosed Huffaker with fibromyalgia, hypertension under good control, hyperli-pidemia, arthritis, myalgias, and an elevated level of creatine phosphokinase (\u201cCPK\u201d). He directed that she see a neurologist, a doctor of physical medicine, as well as a rheumatologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Dr. Darrell Thomas, a neurologist, examined Huffaker, and found that she was \u201cin no apparent distress,\u201d and felt that she \u201cdid not have fibromyalgia.\u201d A doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation found that she had generalized muscle pain, \u201ca constellation of symptoms not clearly identified\u201d and \u201cnot entirely consistent with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia,\u201d and that her \u201celevated CPK is suspicious for an underlying myopathic or metabolic process.\u201d A cardiologist examined Huffaker, and noted that he was \u201cactually not sure what is going on with this lady. It seems like it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>a little more than fibromyalgia. [Fibro-myalgia] should not cause abnormal CPK levels.\u201d He further noted that she \u201chas some of the features of fibromyalgia,\u201d but needed \u201ca full evaluation by a rheumato-logist] and neurologist] to see if we are not missing something.\u201d And a rheuma-tologist examined Huffaker and found \u201cno evidence of inflammatory arthropy or neurological focol or motor deficits,\u201d \u201ca few tender points that suggest a myofascial component of her symptoms,\u201d and that \u201cthe most likely diagnosis\u201d was fibromyal-gia or chronic fatigue syndrome, but he \u201cwould like to obtain additional records and additional laboratory tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">On June 1, 2004, MetLife arranged for a medical review of Huffaker\u2019s file by Dr. Tracey Schmidt, a physician board-certified in internal medicine and rheumatolo-gy, who recommended extending Huffaker\u2019s disability status pending consideration of further records and test results. In response to Dr. Schmidt\u2019s request for information, Dr. Bozeman repeated his opinion that Huffaker\u2019s pain was due to fibro-myalgia. The neurologist repeated his prior appraisal of Huffaker as \u201ca well-nourished individual in no apparent distress.\u201d The doctor of physical medicine submitted MRI results indicating the presence of some disc bulging and degenerative changes, and repeated her impression of \u201cgeneralized body pain\u201d with unclear etiology. And the cardiologist remarked that he was \u201ccertainly not sure what exactly is causing all [of Huffaker\u2019s] ills,\u201d and that Huffaker\u2019s condition \u201cfits along the line of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome with some type of mood disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">With her short-term disability benefits expiring on July 19, 2004, Huffaker submitted a longterm disability claim, complaining of chronic pain. Dr. Bozeman submitted an Attending Physician Statement diagnosing Huffaker with fibromyal-gia and myofascial pain, noting that Huf-faker could work one hour per day and had severe limitations in psychological functioning. MetLife again referred her medical file to Dr. Schmidt for review, who recommended an independent medical examination with a rheumatologist, and tentatively approved Huffaker\u2019s claim with continued benefits dependent upon the outcome of the independent medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In the interim, Huffaker submitted treatment notes from a \u201cnew patient consultation\u201d with a rheumatologist, Dr. Kenny Sizemore, who diagnosed Huffaker\u2019s condition as \u201cprobable fibromyalgia,\u201d noting that she was \u201cso tender diffusely, I think even control points are positive.\u201d He noted, however, that \u201cit was impossible to determine accurately\u201d whether Huffaker was \u201cseeking some type of \u2018secondary gain,\u2019 \u201d and that he believed Huffaker could improve. He encouraged her to follow up with a psychologist.'</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">On October 7, 2004, Huffaker underwent an independent medical examination with Dr. Jeffrey Uzzle, a physician specializing in orthopedic medicine. Dr. Uz-zle\u2019s physical examination found as normal Huffaker\u2019s: gait pattern; posture; spinal alignment; muscle tone in her upper and lower extremities; range of motion in her shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands; and her ability to walk on her heels and toes and tandem walk. He found her cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral range of motion normal and without pain. Dr. Uzzle noted that she described \u201cseveral episodes that sound psychological in nature.\u201d After reviewing her medical records, Dr. Uzzle noted that Huffaker \u201chas been thoroughly evaluated from the standpoint of multiple different specialties and in the end there has been no specific objective and verifiable anatomic problem to explain her varied symptomatology.\u201d He charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>terized Huffaker\u2019s ease as a \u201cdiagnostic dilemma\u201d and expressed concern that her pain disorder was largely psychologically based. He stated that he could not ascertain why Huffaker stopped working and could \u201cfind no objective basis why she cannot return to her work ... assuming she is psychologically capable.\u201d Huffaker later contested the validity of the Dr. Uz-zle\u2019s findings\u2014alleging that the examination consisted only of Dr. Uzzle\u2019s request that she walk on her toes and heels and touch her finger to her nose\u2014but MetLife did not investigate the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On December 22, 2004, MetLife denied Huffaker\u2019s claim, citing the findings of Dr. Uzzle. Huffaker appealed on December 27, 2004, and submitted treatment notes from a psychiatrist, who noted that Huf-faker complained of depression, but did not assign any cognitive or functional limitations to her condition. Dr. Bozeman submitted an updated Attending Physician Statement with treatment notes, now opining that Huffaker could work a total of zero hours per day on account of fibro-myalgia and chronic myofascial pain syndrome. But he also noted that Huffaker stated that she could consider trying to work, and he directed that she return to work for three hours per day, three days a week, for the next three weeks, and to follow up with him in order to determine whether she could further increase her hours. Huffaker also submitted a letter from her physical therapist, who rated Huffaker\u2019s pain as severe and consistent with fibromyalgia, and noted that she could not reasonably be expected to attend a forty-hour work week.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In response, MetLife sent Huffaker\u2019s medical file to two physicians for independent file reviews. Dr. Annette DeSantis, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, conducted the first review and concluded that there was no \u201cmedical documentation to substantiate functional limitations that would preclude\u201d Huffaker\u2019s \u201cability to perform the material duties\u201d of her job. Dr. DeSantis noted that Huffaker \u201chad extensive testing done, much of which was negative.\u201d While acknowledging that Huffaker had \u201csome mildly positive tests,\u201d Dr. DeSantis reiterated that she could find no \u201cactual physical medical condition that would keep [Huf-faker] from being able to physically perform her job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Dr. Edward Ewald, a rheumatologist, conducted the second review of Huffaker\u2019s file. He noted that the medical documentation demonstrated \u201cno evidence of any active synovitis,\u201d and that Huffaker had normal strength with \u201cno substantial limitation of motion of her joints.\u201d He noted that the findings described in Dr. Boze-man\u2019s reports \u201care consistent with but not diagnostic of fibromyalgia[,] since this is basically a diagnosis of exclusion.\u201d He stated he could \u201cfind no objective evidence in any of these records to substantiate functional limitations that would preclude her ability to perform in material duties of her medium exertion level job. However, it is clear that she does have persistent subjective complaints of muscle pains and joint pains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On February 10, 2005, MetLife denied Huffaker\u2019s appeal, citing the findings of Huffaker\u2019s physicians and the independent medical reviewers. Huffaker hired an attorney, who then sought to submit several hundred pages of additional information for consideration. MetLife advised that it would not consider the supplemental documentation, given that it had already made a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Huffaker filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking review of Metlife\u2019s decision. On August 2, 2006, the district court denied Huffaker\u2019s motion to permit discovery. On March 8, 2007, the district court issued an opinion granting MetLife\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>judgment on the administrative record. <em>Huffaker v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 3:05-CV-527, 2007 WL 760439 (E.D.Tenn. March 8, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Alz\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of MetLife\u2019s motion for judgment on the administrative record de novo, <em>Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare Sys. Inc., </em>150 F.3d 609, 613 (6th Cir.1998), applying the same standard of review of a plan administrator\u2019s action as the district court applies. <em>Moore v. Lafayette Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 416, 427 (6th Cir.2006). We employ an arbitrary and capricious standard to review MetLife\u2019s decision to deny long-term disability benefits because the Plan confers discretionary authority on the administrator to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>McDonald v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., </em>347 F.3d 161, 168 (6th Cir.2003). \u201cUnder this deferential standard, we will uphold a benefit determination if it is \u2018rational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gismondi v. United Techs. Corp., </em>408 F.3d 295, 298 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>88 F.3d 376, 381 (6th Cir.1996)). Thus, we will uphold a decision \u201cif it is the result of a deliberate principled reasoning process, and if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Killi-an v. Healthsource Provident Adm\u2019rs, Inc., </em>152 F.3d 514, 520 (6th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The arbitrary and capricious standard, however, is not entirely without \u201cteeth.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 F.3d at 172. Oftentimes, a plan administrator operates under a potential conflict of interest because it is both the decision-maker determining which claims are covered, and also the payor of those claims. <em>Calvert v. Firstar Finance, Inc., </em>409 F.3d 286, 292 (6th Cir.2005). In such circumstances, where \u201cthe potential for self-interested decision-making is evident,\u201d we will take the administrator\u2019s conflict of interest into account as a factor in determining whether the administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland v. Emerson Elec. Co., </em>202 F.3d 839, 846 n. 4 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">\u201cWhile several courts have altered the standard of review to something less deferential than the arbitrary and capricious standard where a benefits administrator is operating under a conflict of interest, this Court has not taken that approach.\u201d <em>Calvert, </em>409 F.3d at 293 (citation omitted). The inherent \u201cconflict of interest does not displace the arbitrary and capricious standard of review; rather, it is a factor that we consider when determining whether the administrator\u2019s decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Evans v. UnumProvident Corp., </em>434 F.3d 866, 876 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Kalish v. Liberty Mut./Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>419 F.3d 501, 506 (6th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">B. Plan\u2019s Appeal Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">We first consider Huffaker\u2019s argument that MetLife should have considered evidence she submitted to MetLife following its denial of her appeal on February 10, 2005. She contends that MetLife acted arbitrarily in closing the record, given that the Plan \u201cdoes not explicitly limit MetLife to considering only one appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Although Huffaker is correct that the Plan does not expressly limit MetLife to considering one appeal, the Plan con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>versely does not allow a claimant to take an unlimited or even a specified number of appeals. The Plan provides for \u201ca review of claims denied in whole or in part.\u201d Because the Plan treats a claimant\u2019s right to appeal as a singular noun (\u201ca review of claims\u201d), MetLife did not act arbitrarily in interpreting the Plan to permit only one appeal. We find persuasive the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201cthe complete description of the process for one appeal without mentioning a second appeal clearly implies that only one appeal is allowed.\u201d <em>Hilton v. Ashland Oil Inc., </em>No. 96-40100, 1996 WL 731858, at *8 (5th Cir. Nov. 11, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">MetLife\u2019s correspondence with Huffaker is consistent with its contention that Huf-faker was entitled to only one appeal. In its initial denial letter, MetLife advised Huffaker that she could appeal by filing a written request within 180 days, and that she should include \u201cany additional comments, documents, records or other information relating to your claim that you deem appropriate for us to give your appeal proper consideration.\u201d The denial letter goes on to state: \u201c[i]n the event that your appeal is denied in whole or in part, you will have the right to bring a civil action\u201d under ERISA. Thus, by the explicit terms of this correspondence, Huf-faker was advised that she must submit all evidence deemed relevant by her in her appeal of MetLife\u2019s benefits determination. The correspondence made clear that the next tier of review after her appeal was not a second internal appeal for MetLife\u2019s consideration, but an ERISA action in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">C. MetLife\u2019s Eligibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">1. Objective Evidence of Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We next consider Huffaker\u2019s argument that MetLife\u2019s denial of disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious. MetLife contends that its denial was based on Huffaker\u2019s failure to prove her disabled status under the terms of the Plan, namely because she provided insufficient objective evidence of disability. We first address whether the terms of the Plan allow Met-Life to require that Huffaker present objective evidence of her disabled status. We hold that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The Plan provides that a beneficiary will receive disability benefits once the beneficiary is disabled as defined by the Plan, after the completion of an elimination period. The Plan defines \u201cdisabled\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Disabled or Disability: You are Disabled if, due to sickness or pregnancy or accidental injury for which you are receiving Appropriate Care and Treatment from a Doctor on a continuing basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A81\">During the first 24 months that benefits under this Plan are paid to you, you are unable to perform each of the material duties of your Occupation. After benefits under this Plan are paid to you for 24 months, you are unable to engage in any business or occupation or to perform any work for compensation, gain or profit for which you are reasonably fitted by your education, training, background, or experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">This Court has previously held that a disability benefits plan employing similar eligibility requirements could require a claimant to provide objective evidence of disability. In <em>Cooper v. Life Ins. Co. of N. America, </em>we held that \u201c[Requiring a claimant to provide objective medical evidence of disability is not irrational or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Life Ins. Co. of N. America, </em>486 F.3d 157, 166 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Spangler v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., </em>313 F.3d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 2002)). The definition of \u201cdisability\u201d at issue in <em>Cooper </em>required that the claimant prove inability to perform \u201call the material duties of his or her Regular Occupation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>id. </em>at 159-60, and did not explicitly require the claimant to provide objective evidence of disability. We found the administrator\u2019s objective-evidence-of-disability requirement reasonable, explaining that \u201c[objective medical documentation of [the claimant\u2019s] functional capacity would have assisted [the administrator] in determining whether [the claimant] was capable of performing \u2018all the material duties of her Regular Occupation,\u2019 as required by the [long-term disability planj\u2019s definition of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Here, Huffaker must similarly prove she is \u201cunable to perform each of the material duties of [her] Occupation\u201d to satisfy the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d As in <em>Cooper, </em>MetLife could reasonably interpret the Plan\u2019s language to require objective evidence of disability. <em>See also Michele v. NCR Corp., </em>No. 94-3518, 1995 WL 296331, at *3 (6th Cir. May 15, 1995) (holding that the administrator did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying long-term disability benefits for chronic fatigue syndrome where the plan requires proof of total disability from \u201ca bodily injury or disease\u201d; and the claimant failed to present sufficient objective medical evidence of total disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A claimant could certainly find burdensome a requirement that she proffer objective evidence of fibromyalgia itself, the symptoms of which are largely subjective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But objective evidence of <em>disability </em>due to fibromyalgia can be furnished by a claimant without the same level of difficulty. <em>See Boardman v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>337 F.3d 9, 16-17 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003) (\u201cWhile the diagnoses] of ... fibromyalgia may not lend [itself] to objective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illness[ ] do lend themselves to objective analysis.\u201d). One method of objective proof of disability, for instance, is a functional capacity evaluation, a \u201creliable and objective method of gauging\u201d the extent one can complete work-related tasks. <em>Cooper, </em>486 F.3d at 176 (Sutton, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). In <em>Johnson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>437 F.3d 809 (8th Cir.2006), the Eighth Circuit held that a \u201cplan administrator [can] require objective evidence of a disability, even when the claimant\u2019s alleged disability stem[s] from fibromyalgia, so long as the administrator notified the claimant that her file lacked the required objective evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814 (citing <em>Pra-lutsky v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>435 F.3d 833, 838-40 (8th Cir.2006)). Here, MetLife notified Huffaker that her file lacked the required objective evidence in its December 22, 2004 letter denying benefits, which stated as its reason for denial: \u201cThere is no medical evidence provided by the treating sources to suggest a significant functional impairment or support the severity of this medical condition to prevent you from performing your job.\u201d Thus, MetLife did not act unreasonably in requiring objective evidence of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>2. Dr. Bozeman</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We now review whether MetLife\u2019s eligibility determination was supported by the evidence. Huffaker contends that she provided MetLife with objective evidence of disability, and refers to three sources: Dr. Thomas, the neurologist; Dr. Bozeman, her family practitioner; and Anita Ferris, the physical therapist. In her argument on appeal that she is disabled under the Plan, however, the documentary evidence that Huffaker relies on from these sources consists of forms submitted to MetLife <em>after </em>MetLife\u2019s February 10, 2005 denial of her internal appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to consider this evidence, because in our review of MetLife\u2019s decision, we are \u201cstrictly limited to a consideration of the information actually considered by the administrator.\u201d <em>Killian v. Healthsource Provident Admin., Inc., </em>152 F.3d 514, 522 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">MetLife argues that the evidence considered by MetLife prior to its denial of her internal appeal on February 10, 2005, supports its finding that Huffaker was not disabled under the Plan. MetLife argues that Dr. Thomas\u2019s findings do not support a finding of disability, referring to Dr. Thomas\u2019s physical examination of Huffaker on May 18, 2004, in which she is described as \u201ca well-nourished individual in no apparent distress.\u201d Although Dr. Thomas\u2019s treatment notes mention that the purpose of the consultation was to address Huffaker\u2019s complaints of muscle cramps and pain described as \u201cexcruciating,\u201d the medical documentation from Dr. Thomas under consideration by MetLife supports of its finding that she was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">MetLife explains that it failed to accord great weight to Dr. Bozeman\u2019s opinion that Huffaker was disabled because his opinion was \u201cbased on Huffaker\u2019s self-reported complaints of pain, nothing more.\u201d MetLife contends that his opinion is not supported by a functional capacity evaluation, and was contradicted by Dr. Bozeman\u2019s findings that Huffaker\u2019s muscle strength was normal in all extremities and that she had full range of motion in all joints, and by the negative results of the battery of tests that she underwent. MetLife did not discredit the findings of Anita Ferris, the physical therapist, on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In <em>Yeager, </em>we observed that \u201ccomplaints of fatigue and joint pain\u201d are \u201ctypes of subjective complaints [that] are easy to make, but almost impossible to refute.\u201d <em>Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>88 F.3d 376, 382 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that absent any \u201cdefinite anatomic explanation of [a claimant\u2019s symptoms,\u201d an administrator\u2019s decision to deny disability benefits due to fibromyalgia was not arbitrary and capricious); <em>cf. Cooper, </em>486 F.3d at 174 (Sutton, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (\u201c[S]ubjective complaints of back pain by themselves do not compel an administrator to grant disability benefits\u201d). MetLife did not arbitrarily refuse to credit Dr. Bozeman\u2019s findings given the inconsistency between Huffaker\u2019s subjective complaints of pain and Dr. Bozeman\u2019s findings of normal muscle strength and range of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">3. Dr. Uzzle</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Huffaker next argues that MetLife erred in its reliance on the independent medical examination of Dr. Uzzle. As her first reason, Huffaker argues that Dr. Uz-zle, a doctor of orthopedic medicine, is unqualified to diagnosis fibromyalgia. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>argues that a rheumatologist should instead have conducted the examination, because fibromyalgia is a rheumatologieal condition. But Huffaker cites no factual or legal authority for the proposition that only a rheumatologist may diagnose fibro-myalgia. Her insistence on such a rule is inconsistent with her demand that great weight be given to the opinions of Dr. Thomas, a neurologist; Dr. Bozeman, a family practitioner; and her physical therapist, a non-physician. In any event, Met-Life did in fact rely on the medical opinion of a rheumatologist, Dr. Ewald, who reviewed Huffaker\u2019s medical file.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Huffaker next challenges Dr. Uzzle\u2019s credibility by arguing that he failed to address whether she had fibromyalgia. Our review of the content of Dr. Uzzle\u2019s report, however, does not lead us to this conclusion. His report noted that he reviewed records from Dr. Bozeman and others, and that \u201c[Huffaker] is at a point one would characterize as a diagnostic dilemma.\u201d He specifically noted that \u201c[fi-bromyalgia has been considered,\u201d and concluded from his review of Huffaker\u2019s medical records that she \u201chas been thoroughly evaluated from the standpoint of multiple different specialties and in the end there has been no specific objective and verifiable anatomic problem to explain her varied symptomatology.\u201d And he diagnosed Huffaker with \u201c[c]hronic pain disorder.\u201d The critical question for purposes of Huffaker\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits is not whether she does or does not have fibromyalgia, but whether she is disabled under the plan. Dr. Uzzle\u2019s conclusion after conducting a physical examination was that he could \u201cfind no objective basis why she cannot return to her work as a thrift store outlet manager at this point assuming she is psychologically capable of doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Huffaker then argues that MetLife failed to investigate her allegation that Dr. Uzzle did not examine her. But two physician file-reviewers, Drs. Ewald and DeSan-tis, examined Huffaker\u2019s medical file, which included Dr. Uzzle\u2019s findings. Their review of Dr. Uzzle\u2019s findings indicates no basis for determining them unreliable. So even if MetLife did have a duty to investigate Huffaker\u2019s allegation, that duty would have been satisfied by the file review undertaken by Drs. Ewald and DeSantis.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Finally, Huffaker argues that MetLife erred in failing to investigate Dr. Uzzle\u2019s concern that her complaints of pain might be psychosomatic. However, Huffaker never claimed a psychiatric impairment during the administrative process, but rather claimed that her disability was due to fibromyalgia. In any event, the administrative record includes treatment notes from a psychiatrist, from as late as January 1, 2005. Although the psychiatrist prescribed the medication Cymbalta, he did not diagnose any cognitive or functional limitations precluding her from working.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Accordingly, we find that MetLife did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in relying on Dr. Uzzle\u2019s medical opinion as a basis for the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">4. Drs. Ewald and DeSantis</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Huffaker next argues that MetLife erred in relying on the opinions of Drs. Ewald and DeSantis because reliance on non-examining medical sources is \u201cdisfavored,\u201d and they ignored functional limitations diagnosed by Dr. Bozeman. But it is well-established that MetLife need not necessarily defer to the opinions of treating physicians. <em>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003). We have held that \u201c[generally, when a plan administrator chooses to rely upon the medical opinion of one doctor over that of another ... the plan administrator\u2019s decision cannot be said to have been arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>trary and capricious.\u201d <em>McDonald v. </em>W.-S. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>347 F.3d 161, 169 (6th Cir.2003). And we observed in <em>Calvert v. Firstar Finance, Inc., </em>409 F.3d 286, 295 (6th Cir.2005), that \u201creliance on a file review does not, standing alone, require the conclusion that [the administrator] acted improperly.\u201d Thus, we \u201cfind nothing inherently objectionable about a file review by a qualified physician in the context of a benefits determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Although \u201cthe failure to conduct a physical examination\u2014especially where the right to do so is specifically reserved in the plan\u2014may, in some cases, raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 295, this case does not present such an instance. Here, MetLife obtained an independent medical examination, namely that of Dr. Uzzle. Dr. Uzzle\u2019s examination of Huffaker, however, was unfavorable to her disability claim. He personally examined Huffaker and determined that she was not disabled, noting the absence of \u201cspecific objective and verifiable anatomic problem to explain her varied symptomatology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Our review of Drs. Ewald and DeSan-tis\u2019s reports indicates that they reviewed the findings of Dr. Bozeman, and each found that Huffaker\u2019s medical record did not show the existence of a functional limitation that would prevent Huffaker from doing her job. Dr. DeSantis\u2019s report mentions that she could find no \u201cactual physical medical condition that would keep [Huffaker] from being able to physically perform her job.\u201d Dr. Ewald concludes in his report that he could \u201cfind no objective evidence in any of these records to substantiate functional limitations that would preclude her ability to perform in material duties of her medium exertion level job.\u201d Because MetLife validly exercised its right to rely on the opinions of physicians other than the treating physician, <em>see McDonald, </em>347 F.3d at 169, we find Huffaker\u2019s claim of error with respect to Drs. Ewald and DeSantis without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">D. Discovery Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Huffaker argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for discovery beyond the administrative record for the purpose of showing a procedural violation. We review the district court\u2019s decisions on discovery matters for an abuse of discretion. <em>Green v. Nevers, </em>196 F.3d 627, 632 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">In the proceedings below, Huffaker filed a motion to adjust the scheduling order to allow her to take discovery. She sought discovery for the purpose of seeking information about the physicians who evaluated her claim relevant to the issues of due process and bias, including their employment relationship with MetLife, them compensation, and the number of claims they reviewed for MetLife. She supported her motion with information relating to three physician consultants not having involvement in her claim. The district court denied the motion, upholding the magistrate judge\u2019s memorandum and order, which held that \u201c[t]he mere fact that MetLife may have used three other physicians numerous times in other cases simply does not demonstrate good cause to engage in discovery with respect to the physicians who reviewed the plaintiffs claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">In an ERISA claim for benefits action, the district court\u2019s review is generally \u201cbased solely upon the administrative record.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare Sys., Inc., </em>150 F.3d 609, 619 (6th Cir.1998). Evidence outside the administrative record may be considered \u201cif that evidence is offered in support of a procedural challenge to the administrator\u2019s decision, such as an alleged lack of due process afforded by the administrator or alleged bias on its part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis also means that any pre-hearing discovery at the district court level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>should be limited to such procedural challenges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A claimant cannot obtain discovery beyond the administrative record\u2014even if limited to a procedural challenge\u2014merely by alleging a procedural violation. <em>See Likas v. Life Ins. Co. of N. America, </em>222 Fed.Appx. 481, 486 (6th Cir.2007) \u201c[A] mere allegation of bias is insufficient to \u2018throw open the doors of discovery\u2019 in an ERISA case.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted). Otherwise, the policy rationale for constrained district court review would be defeated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Putney v. Medical Mutual of Ohio, </em>111 Fed.Appx. 803 (6th Cir.2004), we determined that a claimant must make a predicate showing with respect to an alleged procedural violation to be granted further discovery. The claimant in <em>Putney </em>argued that the district court erred in denying discovery on a procedural challenge to the denial of a disability benefits claim. However, the <em>Putney </em>claimant \u201cpresented virtually no evidence of procedural violations,\u201d \u201cpresented absolutely no evidence of bias,\u201d and there were no facts in the record \u201cto support a claim that discovery might lead to such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. We concluded that \u201cmere allegation of bias is not sufficient to permit discovery under <em>Wilkins\u2019 </em>exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even though the claimant alleged that the administrator \u201crefused to permit him to submit information during his administrative appeal,\u201d we found this also to be a \u201cmere allegation,\u201d insufficient to require discovery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Here, Huffaker is like the <em>Putney </em>claimant. The only evidence offered in support of the allegation of procedural error is that MetLife has a \u201chabit\u201d of repeatedly using the same consultants. As MetLife notes, the evidence puts forward a \u201cgeneralized claim of financial conflict of interest on the part of MetLife and the independent physician consultants who reviewed\u201d her medical file. The consultants whom Huffaker alleges MetLife habitually use did not even review her medical file, so the evidence does not support her suggestion that the independent physicians in this case took adverse action regarding her disability claim. Huffaker presents no actual evidence of a procedural violation as to the claim, and because \u201cmere allegation of bias is not sufficient to permit discovery,\u201d <em>Putney, </em>111 FedAppx. at 807, the district court did not err in denying her discovery motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment on the administrative record for MetLife, and AFFIRM the denial of Huffaker\u2019s motion for discovery.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">.
