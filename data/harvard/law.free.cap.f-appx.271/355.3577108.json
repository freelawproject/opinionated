In the presentence report (PSR), the probation officer recommended a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(4) (2006) because the firearm was stolen, and a four-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) because the firearm was used in connection with another felony offense. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Moffitt\u2019s total offense level was twenty-seven, and his prior criminal conduct placed him in criminal history category IV. The resulting sentencing range was 100 to 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-23\">Moffitt filed several objections to the PSR. Among other arguments, he contested the enhancement for use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>firearm in connection with another felony. He argued that the assault that originated police involvement in his case was not a felony but a simple assault under North Carolina law, and he did not possess the firearm in connection with the assault because he did not exhibit the firearm until after the assault had ended. At sentencing, the district court concluded that Moffitt\u2019s conduct at his girlfriend\u2019s house prior to his arrest satisfied the elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3) (2000), which prohibits, as a felony offense, assault with a deadly weapon in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court also found that the firearm was used in connection with Moffitt\u2019s assault on his girlfriend, overruled his objection, and sentenced him to 102 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On appeal, among other arguments, Moffitt asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level for using the firearm in connection with another felony offense. The Government responds, urging affirmance. Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s basis for imposing this enhancement is legally insufficient, we remand for the court to consider whether the record provides any other grounds for imposing this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). A determination that there are sufficient facts to impose a \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) enhancement is a factual finding. <em>See United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001) (government has burden of proving facts to support \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5) enhancement by preponderance of the evidence and district court\u2019s fact finding is reviewed for clear error); <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1004 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.1996). This deferential standard of review requires reversal only if this court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Section 2K2.1 (b)(6) provides for a four-level enhancement if the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. This finding encompasses two requirements: that the defendant committed \u201canother felony\u201d and that he possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the other felony. <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 410 (4th Cir.2003). \u201c \u2018Another felony offense\u2019, for purposes of subsection (b)(6), means any federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(C)). The district court may find that \u201ca firearm is \u2018used in connection with\u2019 another felony offense if it facilitates or has a tendency to facilitate the felony offense.\u201d <em>Garnett, </em>243 F.3d at 829 (citing <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 237, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)); USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.14(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">In this case, the district court applied the enhancement based on its conclusion that the other felony offense was assault with a deadly weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3). We conclude that this finding is clearly erroneous. The question of whether a particular place is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States is an element of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u00a7 113(a) offense. <em>United States v. Bello, </em>194 F.3d 18, 22-23 (1st Cir.1999). In this ease, the parties do not dispute, and the district court recognized, that the assault committed by Moffitt on his girlfriend did not occur in an area of federal jurisdiction. We therefore conclude that, even if Mof-fitt\u2019s actions constituted an aggravated assault as described in \u00a7 113(a)(3), such actions do not constitute an offense that is punishable as a felony under federal law because there is no federal jurisdiction to prosecute Moffitt for those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Our review of the record indicates that there may be an alternate basis for imposing the \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Navarro, </em>476 F.3d 188, 190 &amp; n. 3 (3d Cir.2007) (finding that, although Government conceded the point, appellant\u2019s simple possession combined with prior drug conviction established another felony offense under \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5)). Because the PSR did not address this possible basis and the parties have not had an opportunity to assert any objections, we conclude that a remand to allow the district court to reconsider the enhancement is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Accordingly, we remand for reconsideration of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement. We decline to address Moffitt\u2019s other arguments at this time. Upon completion of the district court\u2019s reconsideration, the record will be returned to this court for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> The Government does not dispute that Mof-fitt's conduct at his girlfriend\u2019s residence is not a felony under North Carolina law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
