Weisel, which granted her voluntary departure on or before February 14, 2006, and in the alternative, ordered her removed. <em>In re Chrismiati Tjokrosudarmo Namarubessy, </em>No. A73 558 405 (B.I.A. Apr. 30, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A73 558 405 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-23\">Ms. Namarubessy conceded removability and applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Ms. Namarubessy was ineligible for cancellation because she failed to show that her removal would result in \u201cexceptional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>extremely unusual hardship\u201d to her United States citizen children, as required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In general, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of an application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Barco-San-doval v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 132, 136 (2d Cir.2007). We retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Noble v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.2007). However, we must examine a petition for review to assess whether it actually raises legal or constitutional questions, or simply takes issue with the agency\u2019s discretionary choices. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). Ms. Namarubessy urges us to reconsider our recent decisions holding that the BIA\u2019s \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determinations are discretionary judgments over which we lack jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Barco-Sandoval, </em>496 F.3d at 136; <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Ms. Namarubessy contends that her petition raises questions of law. She first argues that the IJ\u2019s factual findings \u201cunambiguously mischaracterize central elements of the record,\u201d thereby raising reviewable questions of law. She claims, for example, that the IJ erred by not finding \u2022that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights\u2019 2005 report entitled \u201cRights of the Child\u201d established that conditions for children had worsened in Jakarta, the city in which she and her children would reside upon her removal. Ms. Namarubessy also contends that the IJ was irrational to conclude that her son\u2019s experience of living in Indonesia between the ages of two and four undercut her fear for the safety of her now twelve-year-old daughter, and to find that her children would not be identified as American unless she \u201cflaunt[ed] their birth certificates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">These and Ms. Namarubessy\u2019s other arguments fail to raise a question of law and contest only \u201cthe correctness of [the] IJ\u2019s fact-finding\u201d underlying the determination that her children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship in Indonesia. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329; <em>see also Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 722 (2d Cir.2007) (concluding \u201cthat the IJ did not unambiguously] mischaracteriz[e] the record\u201d so as to raise a question of law) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review Ms. Namarubes-sy\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of her application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">In support of her appeal, Ms. Namarubessy asked the BIA to consider evidence that her husband died after the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for cancellation. The BIA correctly found that it lacked the authority to do so. BIA regulations expressly provide that \u201c[e]xcept for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts such as current events or the contents of official documents, the Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Finally, Ms. Namarubessy claims that the BIA engaged in impermissible fact-finding when it found, as a secondary matter, that \u201ceven if [it] were to consider [Ms. Namarubessy\u2019s] filing as a motion to reopen, [it][did] not find that this new evidence would have altered [its] decision.\u201d We need not reach this issue in light of our conclusion that the BIA was not required to consider this new evidence. However, we note that the BIA\u2019s determination that such a motion to reopen would not have been granted was not impermissible fact-finding. It instead reflected a determination that the petitioner \u201coffered only her unsupported assertion that [her husband\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>death is material to [the] issue\u201d of whether her children would suffer extreme and unusual hardship so as to support reopening, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), and that it would not grant her application even if proceedings were reopened for consideration of this evidence. Moreover, any hardship determination that the BIA hypothetically would have reached in reopened proceedings would have been a discretionary one, which we would lack jurisdiction to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
