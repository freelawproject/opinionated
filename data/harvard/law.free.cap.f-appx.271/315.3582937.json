We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">Huggins sought a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. In order to warrant a new trial on this basis, Huggins must show that: (1) the evidence is newly discovered; (2) he used due diligence to discover the evidence; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence is material; and (5) the evidence would probably result in his acquittal at a new trial. <em>United States v. Lofton, </em>233 F.3d 313, 318 (4th Cir.2000). With these criteria in mind, we have reviewed the record and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Huggins\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the order. <em>United States v. Adam, </em>70 F.3d 776, 779 (4th Cir.1995) (reviewing denial of Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 motion for new trial for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
