He argues the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred when it included a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 3C1.1 in calculating his sentencing range under the advisory guidelines, and erred in denying a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court applied an obstruction enhancement after finding he testified falsely at his sentencing hearing by denying he attempted to recruit a fellow inmate to kill the victim involved in the enticing charge. The district court also determined a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was inconsistent with his conduct in attempting to recruit a fellow inmate to kill the victim. The inmate he attempted to recruit also testified at the sentencing hearing; the district court credited such testimony and discredited Fleming\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">The determinations regarding both the obstruction enhancement and the denial of acceptance of responsibility turn on the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, an issue \u201cthat is virtually unreviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Craft, </em>478 F.3d 899, 902 (8th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Behler, </em>14 F.3d 1264, 1273 (8th Cir.1994)). Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, as there were here, the district court\u2019s choice of one over the other cannot be clear error. <em>United States v. Bolanos, </em>409 F.3d 1045, 1048 (8th Cir.2005). We therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-19\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-20\">. In a supplemental brief, Fleming argues the government breached the plea agreement by advocating for the obstruction enhancement and failing to move for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. That argument is without merit as the plea agreement specifically allowed the government \"to contest this adjustment [for acceptance of responsibility] should the defendant subsequently ... pro-vid[e] false information to the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
