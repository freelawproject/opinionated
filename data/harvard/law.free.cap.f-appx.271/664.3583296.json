Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we deny in part and dismiss in part petition No. 05-72423 and deny petition No. 05-73902.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-20\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gutierrez\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed almost a year and half after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of final administrative decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s underlying order denying his application for cancellation of removal because these petitions for review are not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gutierrez\u2019s motion to reconsider because he failed to identify an error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">We need not address Gutierrez\u2019s additional arguments raised for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Guevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1013, 1021 n. 4 (9th Cir.2005) (issues not raised in the opening brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-24\">No. 05-72423: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-25\">No. 05-73902: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b688-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
