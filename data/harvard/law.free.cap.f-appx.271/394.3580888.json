Because the Commissioner\u2019s determination is based on substantial evidence and applies the proper legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Robinson filed her application for DIB and SSI benefits claiming disability since June 1, 2003, on account of diabetes, hypertension, vision problems, and back pain. The application was denied initially and on reconsideration. She requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who heard testimony from Robinson and two expert witnesses. The ALJ decided that Robinson was not \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act and was not entitled to benefits. The Appeals Council denied Robinson\u2019s request for review. Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">Our review of a denial of disability benefits is limited. \u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s decision is granted great deference,\u201d and we will not disturb his finding unless it is unsupported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d or is based on an error of law. <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 565-66 (5th Cir.1995). After reviewing the record, we agree with the reasoning of the district court and the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-19\">Robinson argues that the ALJ disregarded evidence of her mental impairment, particularly of her low IQ scores. The ALJ\u2019s opinion explicitly discusses Robinson\u2019s test scores and the results of a psychological evaluation performed by Dr. Wong, but the ALJ deemed the test scores to be lower than Robinson\u2019s actual functioning level and deemed Wong\u2019s findings to be unreliable. The ALJ made that determination based on the opinion of Dr. Felkins, a qualified medical expert who testified at the hearing. Felkins, whom the ALJ characterized as \u201ccredible and compelling,\u201d stated that the IQ scores and Wong\u2019s assessment invalidly overstated Robinson\u2019s mental impairment and were not supported by evidence in the record. We agree with the district court and the magistrate judge that the ALJ properly considered Robinson\u2019s mental impairment and based his findings on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Robinson contends the ALJ failed to give proper weight to some of the opinions of Robinson\u2019s treating and examining doctors, Wong and Dr. Haji. Although the opinion \u201cof a treating physician who is familiar with the claimant\u2019s injuries, treatments, and responses should be accorded considerable weight,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201cmay be assigned little or no weight when ... the treating physician\u2019s evidence is conclusory, is unsupported by medically acceptable clinical, laboratory, or diagnostic techniques, or is otherwise unsupported by the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the district court and the magistrate judge that the ALJ properly considered the opinions of Wong and Haji. Wong performed a one-time consultative examination of Robinson and therefore is not due special deference as a treating physician. Although Haji was a treating physician, and the ALJ rejected some of his opinions, the ALJ relied on opinions of other examining physicians and medical experts in doing so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Robinson also avers that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Robinson had the residual functional capacity to perform a limited range of light work, including jobs as office helper, information clerk, and usher. The ALJ considered all the evidence and testimony and determined the impairments he found to be credible. The ALJ then posed a hypothetical to a vocational expert, setting forth those impairments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The vocational expert testified that Robinson was capable of performing jobs as office helper, information clerk, and usher, which exist in significant numbers in the national economy. Although Robinson disagrees with the ALJ\u2019s assessment of her impairments and her ability to perform the jobs suggested by the vocational expert, we cannot \u201creweigh the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999). We agree with the district court and the magistrate judge that the ALJ\u2019s findings are based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Robinson claims the ALJ failed properly to assess her credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ALJ determined that she was not credible in reporting her symptoms and that her claims were not supported by medical evidence. Robinson argues that the ALJ failed to conform to the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529 by neglecting to address the location, duration, frequency, and intensity of her self-reported symptoms. That was not necessary, however, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the medical evidence did not confirm that Robinson had a medically determinable impairment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s assessment of Robinson\u2019s credibility is based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Although the ALJ did not perform a detailed analysis based on 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d), he does not have to do so where there is \"reliable medical evidence from a treating <em>or examining physician </em>controverting the claimant\u2019s treating specialist.\" <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 453 (emphasis added). In rejecting some of Haji's opinions, the ALJ relied on the opinions of two examining doctors, Wong and Dr. Gupta, in addition to relying on the medical expert, Felkins. Moreover, although the ALJ did not seek clarification from a treating physician when he rejected some of Haji\u2019s opinions, the AU is not required to do so unless the evidence in the record is inadequate or insufficient to reach a conclusion about the applicant\u2019s disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(3), 404.1512(e).
