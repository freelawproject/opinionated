Only the first prong is developed in any depth in defendant\u2019s opening brief. Assuming that the second two prongs nevertheless warrant appellate review, <em>but see United States v. Zannino, </em>895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that undeveloped arguments are waived), they do not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-28\">Defendant\u2019s first argument is that he used the name of a fictitious person to cash one of the counterfeit checks that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>the subject of the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is true that the phrase \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as used in section 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) includes only means of identification of \u201can actual (ie., not fictitious) individual.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1., comment. (n.9(A)). However, the means used here included not only the fictitious name of one of the payees, but also the account number <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of Toys R Us and the payor name of Atlantic Coast Contractors, both actual entities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact that the name of a fictitious person was also used on one of the checks is immaterial since the applicable definition of \u201cmeans of identification\u201d includes \u201cany name or number that may be used, <em>alone or in conjunction with any other information.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) (emphasis added). Similarly, the fact that defendant also used a fake driver\u2019s license purporting to identify him as Steven Chapman, is equally immaterial. In fact, at the change of plea hearing, the prosecution expressly disavowed any reliance on defendant\u2019s production or use of that license.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Defendant\u2019s second argument focuses on the requirement that the means of identification used must be of persons \u201cother than the defendant\u201d himself. USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(A)). As already indicated, the means of identification used here were of two entities \u2014 Toys R Us and Atlantic Coast Contractors \u2014 other than the defendant himself. So that argument clearly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Defendant\u2019s third argument \u2014 if preserved and further developed \u2014 might have presented a closer question. That argument \u2014 in enhanced form \u2014 appears to be that section 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) requires that two means of identification be used, one to create the other, and that, here, the second means is absent. In other words, even if defendant used \u201cmeans of identification\u201d to produce the counterfeit checks, those checks were not \u201canother means of identification,\u201d like a credit card, a driver\u2019s license, or a bank loan, the examples used in the background note to section 2B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">What constitutes \u201canother means of identification\u201d for this purpose is far from clear under the guidelines themselves or existing caselaw. This court has never considered the question. In a case factually similar to this one, one circuit concluded that the enhancement applied to using other names and account numbers to produce counterfeit checks. <em>Scott, </em>448 F.3d at 1045. Other jurists have reached differing conclusions while agreeing that the \u201cconvoluted language\u201d of the guideline and commentary is difficult to parse. <em>See United States v. Melendrez, </em>389 F.3d 829, 831-37 (9th Cir.2004); <em>id. </em>(dissenting opinion) at 837-40; <em>see also United States v. Newsome, </em>439 F.3d 181, 187 n. 7 (3d Cir.2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>(declining to follow Melendrez). Given that state of the law, we cannot say that any error in applying that enhancement here was sufficiently \u201cplain\u201d to warrant correction in the absence of preservation. <em>United States v. Goodhue, </em>486 F.3d 52, 58 (1st Cir.2007). As we have previously explained, \u201c[t]he plain error doctrine is premised on the assumption that parties must take responsibility for protecting their legal rights and, accordingly, that only the clearest and most serious of forfeited errors should be corrected on appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>415 F.3d 211, 228-24 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc). The errors alleged here are not of that clarity or caliber.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\n<em>Ajfitmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-19\">. With the challenged enhancement, defendant\u2019s guidelines sentencing range was 24 to 30 months, and the court sentenced defendant to the bottom of that range. Without the enhancement, the range would be 9 to 15 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-29\">. The government argues that defendant not merely forfeited this argument but affirmatively waived it by not objecting to the enhancement at sentencing and assuming that it applied in arguing for a below-guidelines sentence. Such conduct, however, amounts to a forfeiture, not a waiver. <em>See United States v. Rivera, 448 F.3d 82, 86 </em>n. 1 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b26-5\">. The indictment, to which defendant pled guilty, charged him with obtaining money in the custody of a federally insured bank, the Bank of New York, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, and aiding and abetting his wife to do so, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Those pretenses, which defendant admitted to, involved creating and using counterfeit checks bearing the account number of Toys R Us and the payor name of Atlantic Coast Construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b26-6\">. Bank account numbers are clearly \"means of identification.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(A)) (incorporating the definition contained in \u00a7 1028(d)(7)); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(C) (defining means of identification to include \"any ... unique electronic identification number ... or routing code\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>448 F.3d 1040, 1045 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b26-12\">. In his reply brief, defendant argues, for the first time, that those entities were not \"individuals\u201d within the meaning of application note 9(A) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). We therefore do not consider that question here. <em>See United States v. Eirby, </em>515 F.3d 31, 37 n. 4 (1st Cir.2008) (deeming arguments raised for the first time in appellant's reply brief to be waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
