Finding that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Mr. Pevarnik was not disabled under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383f, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Because we write exclusively for the parties and the parties are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Federal court review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination is expressly limited. This Court must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s finding if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Rutherford v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2018does not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)). Even if we would have decided differently, we must not set aside the Commissioner\u2019s determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">Because the Appeals Council denied Mr. Pevarnik\u2019s request for review of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s determination, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner for purposes of judicial review. Thus, we will apply the substantial evidence standard to the ALJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">The Act defines disability in terms of one\u2019s ability to function in the workplace. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A). To meet the Act\u2019s definition of disability, a claimant must show that he \u201cis unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment ... which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commissioner has established a five-step process for evaluating disability claims. The process requires the Commissioner to determine sequentially whether the claimant: (i) is working; (ii) has a severe medical impairment; (iii) has a se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>vere medical impairment that meets or equals the criteria of an impairment listed in the regulations; (iv) can return to his past work; and (v) can perform other work based upon his residual functional capacity, age, education and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4). In this case, the ALJ found that Mr. Pevarnik \u201chas the severe impairments of bipolar depression/anxiety, a personality disorder, and a history of alcohol dependence, but that he does not have an impairment, or combination of impairments, that meets or equals one contained\u201d in the regulations. App. 18. In addition, the ALJ found that Mr. Pevarnik possessed the residual functional capacity to perform work available in the national economy and therefore did not meet the Act\u2019s definition of disability. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Mr. Pevarnik\u2019s own statements indicate that he had no limitations in performing a variety of personal care and household tasks. The ALJ also reviewed reports submitted by several mental health professionals who evaluated Mr. Pevarnik. Many of these reports indicated that Mr. Pevarnik could care for himself and his finances without limitation and possessed a global assessment of functioning score of 65. Although the report of a physician identified as Mr. Pevarnik\u2019s treating psychiatrist indicated a more severe impairment and a global assessment of functioning score of 45, the ALJ noted that this report was inconsistent with this same psychiatrist\u2019s own notes documenting Mr. Pevarnik\u2019s prior sporadic visits of short duration with the physician, the opinions and reports of other consultative psychiatrists, and Mr. Pe-varnik\u2019s own statements concerning his wide range of daily activities. Thus, the ALJ did not err in affording the treating psychiatrist\u2019s opinion only minimal weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The ALJ also heard testimony from a vocational expert concerning Mr. Pevar-nik\u2019s ability to perform a job in the national economy. The ALJ asked the vocational expert to identify jobs, if any, requiring simple, routine, repetitive tasks, not performed in a production-or quota-based environment; involving only simple, work-related decisions and, in general, relatively few workplace changes; requiring no more than occasional interaction with supervisors and avoiding interaction and communication with co-workers and the general public; and requiring no prolonged reading for content or comprehension that a hypothetical person of Mr. Pevarnik\u2019s age, education and work experience could perform. Based upon this limiting criteria, the vocational expert identified a number of jobs available locally that such a person could perform. Thus, the ALJ did not err in determining that Mr. Pevarnik possessed the ability to perform work based upon his residual functional capacity, and we are satisfied that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">We have considered all contentions of the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
