Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.2006). We also address any issues raised in the appellant\u2019s initial appeal that were not decided prior to the <em>Ameline </em>remand. <em>See United States v.

We also conclude that Holler has not raised any issues that are reviewable. <em>See id.; see also Thornton, </em>511 F.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-27\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
