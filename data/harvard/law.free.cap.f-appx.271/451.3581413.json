Gaytan filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that his sentence was unconstitutional in light of the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court denied Gay-tan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion but granted a certificate of appealability (COA). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-24\">(2) A certificate of appealability may issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-25\">(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-26\">The district court discussed <em>Fanfan </em>and <em>Booker </em>issues, as well as ineffective assistance of counsel, but concluded that the <em>Fanfan </em>and <em>Booker </em>error did not affect Gaytan\u2019s substantial rights and failed to indicate whether there was a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right with respect to the ineffective assistance issue. The court failed to clearly specify on which issue or issues a COA was granted. This court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Gaytan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Muniz v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 43, 45 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we order a LIMITED REMAND to the district court for the sole purpose of determining which issue or issues warrant the grant of a COA and entering an appropriate order. Once the record is supplemented with a certified copy of the order, the case shall be returned to this court for further proceedings. Pending the district court\u2019s compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>anee, this court retains jurisdiction of this case for all other purposes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be \u2022published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
