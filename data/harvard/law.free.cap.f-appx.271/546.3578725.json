He appeals, arguing that this classification was improper because his prior drug convictions should have been treated as a single criminal episode instead of three separate felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-22\">The Armed Career Criminal Act provides for enhanced penalties for defendants with three prior convictions for violent felony or drug offenses which were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Agwu contends that because his prior offenses were committed on three successive days, were charged in the same indictment, and resulted in concurrent sentences, they should be treated as a single prior conviction. Agwu\u2019s argument appears to be derived from the career offender provision in the federal sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than from \u00a7 4B1.4, the guideline under which he was sentenced as an armed career offender. The critical sentencing issue under \u00a7 924(e) is whether Agwu\u2019s prior offenses were committed on different occasions. <em>See United States v. Mason, </em>440 F.3d 1056, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Speakman, </em>330 F.3d 1080, 1082 (8th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. McDile, </em>914 F.2d 1059, 1061 (8th Cir.1990). Since Agwu\u2019s offenses were each committed on a different day, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 in sentencing him under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the Armed Career Criminal Act. The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-17\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
