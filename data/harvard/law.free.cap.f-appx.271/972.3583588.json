Subsequently, Vanmoor made a claim to the funds. Thereafter, the government filed a motion to dismiss Vanmoor\u2019s claim pursuant to the Fugitive Disentitlement Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2466. The government\u2019s motion was referred to a magistrate judge who issued a report and recommendation recommending that the government\u2019s motion to dismiss be granted. Vanmoor objected to the report and recommendation on the grounds that he is not a fugitive and that this forfeiture proceeding is not related to the criminal cases pending against him. The district court overruled Vanmoor\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Vanmoor\u2019s claim pursuant to the Fugitive Disentitlement Act. Alternatively, the district court dismissed Vanmoor\u2019s claim for discovery violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly denied Vanmoor\u2019s forfeiture claim based on the Fugitive Disentitlement doctrine. The district court correctly determined that (1) the civil forfeiture case and the pending criminal ease against Vanmoor were sufficiently related to invoke the authority to dismiss under \u00a7 2466; (2) Vanmoor had notice of the criminal charges against him; (3) Vanmoor declined to reenter the United States to defend against the civil forfeiture; and (4) Vanmoor was not held in custody in any other jurisdiction for commission of criminal conduct in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the district court somehow erred or otherwise abused its discretion in dismissing Vanmoor\u2019s forfeiture claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2466, we agree with the district court\u2019s alternative dismissal based upon Vanmoor\u2019s discovery violations. Specifically, Vanmoor first refused to appear for deposition after having been properly noticed by the government. Additionally, Vanmoor defied the district court\u2019s subsequent orders to appear after the government moved to compel his appearance at a deposition in the United States. Thereafter, Vanmoor and his counsel engaged in a campaign to avoid complying with discovery and to delay the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Initially, the district court considered Vanmoor\u2019s request for lesser sanctions. A district court has broad discretion in the imposition of sanctions. <em>Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., </em>427 F.3d 939, 944 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Sjanctions for discovery abuses are intended to prevent unfair prejudice to litigants and to insure the integrity of the discovery process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because lesser sanctions proved to be ineffective in this case, however, the district court was not required to impose additional futile sanctions before dismissing Vanmoor\u2019s claim. <em>See Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., </em>987 F.2d 1536, 1544 (11th Cir.1993); Fed.R.Civ.P. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">Vanmoor\u2019s remaining arguments in this appeal, that the district court erred in denying Vanmoor\u2019s own motion to dismiss the forfeiture complaint as moot and that the delay in the civil forfeiture proceedings violated his constitutional due process rights, are meritless. Because we conclude that there is no merit to any of the arguments Vanmoor makes in this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
