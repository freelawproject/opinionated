Videla, which denied her application for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Maria Cecilia Holguin De Cories, </em>No. A34 621 344 (B.I.A. Oct. 14, 2005), <em>affg </em>No. A 34 621 344 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 16, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">Holguin challenges the agency\u2019s decision on two bases:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) that the evidence is insufficient to support the IJ\u2019s finding regarding the likelihood that she would be tortured upon return to Colombia, and (2) that the agency erred in its application of the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-19\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">Holguin is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (relating to convictions for violation of laws related to controlled substances) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (relating to convictions for aggravated felonies). We are thus without jurisdiction to review Holguin\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir.2007) (applying \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) in the CAT context).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-21\">Application of the CAT</p>\n<p id=\"b138-22\">We retain jurisdiction to review Hol-guin\u2019s CAT argument because it raises a question of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Holguin contends that the IJ failed to consider the hardship that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Holguin would endure if she were forced to relocate within Colombia, and thereby erred in determining that she was ineligible for CAT protection. Holguin relies on a regulation applicable to withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B), but not to relief under the CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(3). The regulation implementing the INA\u2019s withholding-of-removal provision requires the IJ to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csocial and cultural restraints\u201d associated with internal relocation. The regulations implementing the CAT contain no such requirements. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1208.16(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We have considered Holguin\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED insofar as it challenges the IJ\u2019s factual findings, and DENIED in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-24\">. At oral argument, counsel withdrew a substantive due process claim presented in Hol-guin\u2019s briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
