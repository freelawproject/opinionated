DeFonzo, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yelly Tambadou, </em>No. A95 383 937 (B.I.A. Jul. 10, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A95 383 937 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-23\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>IJ\u2019s pretermission of Tambadou\u2019s application for asylum, the BIA assumed that he met an exception to the one-year bar. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). Thus, we consider Tambadou\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The agency\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), but we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its factfinding process was sufficiently flawed, <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We affirm the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in this case as supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 235 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). The IJ expressed concern about inconsistencies between Tambadou\u2019s written application and his testimony. Specifically, the IJ noted that Tambadou had failed to mention in his application that either he or any of his family members were mistreated on the truck that took them to a camp near the Senegal border. However, Tambadou later testified that his \u201cfather was whipped ... inside the truck in front of [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The IJ also noted that Tambadou had alleged in his written application that, when the Mauritanian soldiers took him to \u201ca place that looked like a camp,\u201d he \u201cwas beaten and mistreated by the guards.\u201d However, Tambadou testified that he \u201cwas not beaten,\u201d and that it was possible that \u201cthe person who wrote the application made an error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">We have held that, to form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). The inconsistencies noted by the IJ are \u201csubstantial\u201d as they concern the abuse he and his family members allegedly suffered on account of their ethnicity and, therefore, go to the heart of his claim. <em>See id. </em>Because the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, its denial of asylum was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Inasmuch as Tambadou based his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, and the IJ properly found that this evidence lacked credibility, his withholding of removal and CAT claims necessarily fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
