We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The agency\u2019s decision that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Tang v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 987, 989-90 (9th Cir. 2007). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Yang failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution due to her conversion to Christianity because Yang did not demonstrate that the evidence compels such a finding. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). Therefore, Yang\u2019s claim for asylum based on religion fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">Because Yang does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution, it necessarily follows that she does not qualify for withholding of removal based on religion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">The BIA also denied Yang\u2019s withholding of removal based on her alleged forced abortion without addressing the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The BIA decided this issue without the benefit of our recent decision in <em>Tang v. Gonzales, </em>in which we held that \u201cvictims of forced abortion, like victims of forced sterilization, are statutorily entitled to withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Tang, </em>489 F.3d at 988. Therefore, in light of <em>Tang, </em>we remand Yang\u2019s withholding of removal in light of her alleged forced abortion. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
