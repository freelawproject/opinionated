The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, and we do not repeat them here, except as necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to consider Hernandez\u2019s claims to the extent they raise legal and constitutional issues. We grant the petition and remand to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">Hernandez alleges a number of legal errors and due process violations. While many aspects of his hearing might have been conducted differently, we find only one due process violation that requires us to grant his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hernandez contends that the IJ and the BIA, when considering whether his mother would suffer extreme hardship, violated his due process rights by failing to consider psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>evidence indicating that his mother would likely attempt suicide were he deported. We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Due process requires that the agency \u201creview all relevant evidence.\u201d <em>See Larita-Martinez v. I.N.S., 220 </em>F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). We presume that the BIA reviews all evidence in the record, and have thus held that \u201can alien attempting to establish that the Board violated his right to due process by failing to consider relevant evidence must overcome the presumption that it did review the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1095-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We conclude that Hernandez has overcome this presumption with respect to the affidavits of psychiatrist Dr. John Wake-field. Dr. Wakefield\u2019s diagnosis stated that Hernandez\u2019s mother, Guillermina Avila, suffered from \u201csevere depressive disorder and an acute stress disorder.\u201d In his affidavit, Wakefield was of the opinion that Hernandez\u2019s removal to Mexico would severely affect his mother\u2019s mental health:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akx-dedup-1\">[Hernandez\u2019s mother] has a high level of severe anxiety ... with an on-going preoccupation with her son\u2019s potential deportation. This preoccupation contains a continual conclusion that her life will be over and that she cannot bear life without Mr. Hernandez staying in the United States as part of the family. She believes suicide would be her only alternative if her son were deported. Her demeanor is desperate, agitated and often frantic....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">My conclusion is that <em>as further permanent separation </em>between Mrs. Avila and Mr. Hernandez <em>appears now a possibility, Mrs. Avila is no longer able to remain hopeful and emotionally stable. </em>She now poses a serious risk of suicide as her health decreases. Her depression is increasing, along with acute anxiety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\"><em>In my professional opinion, Mrs. Avila is likely to attempt suicide if her son [] Ernesto Hernandez, is deported. </em>I would strongly recommend that he be allowed to remain with his family in order to care for his mother. It is outside the scope of my profession to comment on the legal definition of \u201cextreme hardship[,\u201d] however, I conclude that the psychological and emotional hardship Mrs-. Avila will endure if Mr. Hernandez\u2019s deportation takes place would be extreme and exceptionally detrimental to her in particular, and the family as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">(emphasis added). Dr. Wakefield also said that Mrs. Avila feels \u201ctrapped,\u201d which he believes to be \u201cone of the most dangerous signs for suicide patients.\u201d Consequently, Dr. Wakefield declared that if Hernandez is removed, he would recommend that his mother be hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">The evidence in the record indicates that neither the IJ nor the BIA considered Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits. A psychiatrist\u2019s opinion that Hernandez\u2019s mother will \u201clikely ... <em>attempt suicide </em>\u201d is so highly probative of extreme hardship that it is difficult to imagine why both the IJ and the BIA failed to address this evidence specifically. <em>See, e.g., In re Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 296, 303 (BIA 1996) (upholding an IJ\u2019s determination of extreme hardship where the alien\u2019s mother was disabled, had a history of depression, and had attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>suicide). The failure to mention such crucial evidence makes it unlikely that the IJ or BIA actually considered Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In addition to the failure to mention Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits, another aspect of the IJ\u2019s decision also suggests that the affidavits were not considered. The IJ\u2019s decision reflects a misconception about why Mrs. Avila would suffer hardship. As Dr. Wakefield explained in one of his affidavits, it was not the fact of temporary separation, but rather the prospect of a \u201cpermanent\u201d separation from her son that would cause Mrs. Avila to \u201cno longer [be] able to remain hopeful\u201d and that 'would likely trigger a suicide attempt. The IJ, however, never addressed the significance of <em>permanent </em>separation. Instead, the IJ noted that Hernandez\u2019s mother could visit her permanently deported son in Mexico and could write to him and telephone him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The BIA\u2019s decision likewise does not indicate that it considered Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits. In his brief to the BIA, Hernandez argued that \u201c[t]he IJ failed to evaluate the expert psychiatric opinion which establishes the atypically severe psychological effects Respondent\u2019s deportation would have on his mother.\u201d Despite the fact that Hernandez explicitly drew the BIA\u2019s attention to this evidence, the BIA\u2019s decision says nothing about Dr. Wake-field\u2019s affidavits. Instead the BIA\u2019s discussion of whether Hernandez\u2019s family would suffer extreme hardship simply concludes that Mrs. Avila did not need financial support from her son, and that the IJ\u2019s \u201cfactual findings were not clearly erroneous.\u201d The BIA\u2019s focus on this different, and clearly less extreme, element of hardship makes it unlikely that it considered Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits either.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">In sum, given the startling information contained in Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits, the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s failure to refer to the affidavits, the IJ\u2019s misconception about the nature and extent of Mrs. Avila\u2019s emotional hardship, and the BIA\u2019s mention of only financial hardship, we hold that Hernandez has overcome the presumption that Dr. Wakefield\u2019s psychiatric evidence was reviewed by the IJ or the BIA; therefore, Hernandez has established a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">To prevail on his due process challenge, Hernandez must also show prejudice. <em>Larita-Martinez, </em>220 F.3d at 1095. The prejudice resulting from the failure to consider the psychiatric evidence of extreme hardship to Hernandez\u2019s mother is clear. Extreme hardship is an eligibility requirement for \u00a7 212(h) relief, and it is also a factor in the IJ\u2019s balance of the equities. <em>See Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 301. Dr. Wakefield\u2019s opinion is compelling evidence that Hernandez\u2019s mother would experience hardship beyond the ordinary consequences of a relative\u2019s removal from the United States. Had the IJ considered Dr. Wakefield\u2019s views, \u201cthe outcome of the proceedings may have been affected.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. I.N.S., </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we find prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Hernandez also alleges a number of other due process and other constitutional violations. In particular, Hernandez challenges the decision to transfer venue from Boise to Seattle,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the treatment of his conviction and <em>Alford </em>plea, the admission and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>exclusion of certain affidavits and testimony, the IJ\u2019s consideration of allegedly irrelevant factors such as the use of a false social security number and his juvenile DUI arrest, the IJ\u2019s failure to credit him with not being a threat to national security, the IJ\u2019s disbelief of his stated reasons for leaving the United States in 1996, and the IJ\u2019s failure to keep a complete record of the proceedings. We conclude that any errors relating to these matters do not rise to the level of due process violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Thus, we grant Hernandez\u2019s petition with respect to his claim that his due process rights were violated by the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s failure to consider Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits. We deny his petition with respect to his other claims and remand to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-15\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that Hernandez does not have a cognizable due process claim because he is seeking discretionary relief. The government\u2019s position is foreclosed by <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602 n. 8 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">. Though we agree with Hernandez\u2019s hardship argument with respect to the failure to consider Dr. Wakefield's affidavits, we disagree with his argument that the IJ improperly focused on <em>past </em>rather than <em>future </em>hardship. The IJ does mention the past hardship experienced by Hernandez\u2019s mother and sister when Hernandez spent time in Mexico and during his incarceration. While Hernandez is correct that the proper focus is on future hardship, we cannot say that the IJ erred by using information about past hardship to draw conclusions about the future hardship Hernandez\u2019s mother and sister might suffer if Hernandez is removed from the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. The government argues that Hernandez\u2019s decision to permit his removal to Mexico pending appeal undermines his claim of extreme hardship. We disagree. His choice of removal pending appeal over his continued imprisonment has no bearing on the hardship experienced by his relatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-12\">. The IJ concluded that he lacked jurisdiction to transfer venue back to Boise because of the government's choice of detention location. This was an error. <em>See Garcia-Guzman v. Reno, </em>65 F.Supp.2d 1077, 1092 (N.D.Cal. 1999) (explaining that \u201c[w]hile it is true that an IJ cannot order the INS to change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>place of detention, a motion to change venue is analytically distinct from detention since venue concerns only the place where <em>hearings </em>in the case shall take place\u201d (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original)). Nonetheless, we conclude that Hernandez\u2019s statutory right to counsel was not violated, as Hernandez was ably represented by Monica Schurtman and the Legal Aid Clinic of the University of Idaho College of Law. The venue decision also did not violate his right to due process, as it did not deny him a \u201cfull and fair hearing of his claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b619-7\">IKUTA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AdW\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The majority here rules that Hernandez\u2019s right to due process was violated because the IJ and the BIA failed to consider Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavit. This conclusion is contrary to our case law, not supported by the record, and constitutes an intrusion \u201cinto the domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.\u201d <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Under our well-established case law, we presume that the IJ reviewed all the evidence in the record, even if the IJ and BIA do not mention every item. <em>Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe embrace the view of our sister circuits and hold that an alien attempting to establish that the Board violated his right to due process by failing to consider relevant evidence must overcome the presumption that it did review the evidence.\u201d); <em>see also Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir.2006) (rejecting due process claim based on the IJ\u2019s failure to discuss documentary evidence of torture); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006) (rejecting claim that petitioner\u2019s due process right was violated by the BIA\u2019s failure to discuss new evidence); <em>Barraza Rivera v. INS, </em>913 F.2d 1443, 1448-49 (9th Cir.1990). We have upheld this presumption of review except when an agency explicitly stated it was unwilling to consider petitioner\u2019s evidence. <em>See, e.g., Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 858, 872 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (\u201c[T]he BIA affirmatively and categorically rejected consideration of supplemental evidence.\u201d), <em>superseded by regulation, </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); <em>Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1164-65 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the IJ\u2019s explicit rejection of the validity of petitioner\u2019s evidence rebuts the presumption of review). This presumption of review is consistent with the rule in four of our sister circuits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The majority gives three reasons for holding that Hernandez rebutted the presumption of review in this case. First, the majority states that the Wakefield affidavit\u2019s discussion of the mother\u2019s suicidal tendencies was crucial, and the IJ\u2019s failure to discuss this crucial evidence raises the inference that the evidence was not considered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the majority notes that the Wakefield affidavit discussed the mother\u2019s concern about permanent separation from her son, but the IJ did not address the significance of this permanent separation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the majority notes that the BIA did not reference the affidavit\u2019s statements that Hernandez\u2019s deportation would have a severe psychological impact on Hernandez\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">In essence, the majority\u2019s three reasons boil down to a single point: neither the IJ nor the BIA mentioned Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavits and the purportedly crucial information it contains. As noted above, this is not enough to rebut the presumption of review. If a petitioner could rebut the presumption of review merely by showing that the IJ failed to mention a document that is important to the petitioner\u2019s claim for relief, the presumption would be meaningless. Under the majority\u2019s approach, <em>Larita-Martinez </em>would be limited to the presumption that the agency has reviewed only the <em>unimportant </em>parts of the record. Of course, no court could find a due process violation based on a charge that the IJ and BIA overlooked evidence that is immaterial, as there could be no showing of prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (there is a due process violation only if the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged error).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In ignoring the presumption of review, the majority erodes the bedrock principle of administrative law that \u201cagencies are entitled to a presumption that they \u2018act properly and according to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1068 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. 279, 296, 85 S.Ct. 1459, 14 L.Ed.2d 383 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>(1965)). \u201cThe presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.\u201d <em>United States v. Chem. Found., Inc., </em>272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926); <em>see also INS v. Miranda, </em>459 U.S. 14, 18, 103 S.Ct. 281, 74 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982). Our presumption that the agency properly reviewed the evidence in the record is based on this principle. <em>See Larita-Mar-tinez, </em>220 F.3d at 1095 (\u201c[I]t is so expected that a court would review all relevant materials in the record that reviewing courts have presumed it.\u201d). The majority here presumes instead that the IJ and BIA failed to act properly, despite no direct evidence supporting this conclusion and all signs to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In sum, there is no basis in this case for rebutting the presumption that the IJ and the BIA considered Dr. Wakefield\u2019s affidavit. Nor is there support for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the agency\u2019s failure to discuss the substance of the single affidavit made the proceeding \u201cso fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Reyes-Melendez v. INS, </em>342 F.3d 1001, 1006 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted). Here, Hernandez was represented by counsel who vigorously argued his case. He introduced a substantial amount of evidence, including testimony from witnesses, and received a full hearing from an IJ who is not alleged to be biased. Both the IJ and the BIA provided a complete and careful decision. An error that could turn this manifestly fair proceeding into a fundamentally unfair one would have to be egregious indeed. There is no such error in this case and therefore no due process violation here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\">. <em>See, e.g., Morales v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that the BIA and the IJ are not required to \u201c 'address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented' \") (quoting <em>Martinez v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 973, 976 (1st Cir. 1992)); <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 344 (2d Cir.2006) (holding there is \u201cno authority supporting petitioner\u2019s contention that an IJ errs unless he specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ly discusses, evaluates, and accepts or rejects each piece of documentary evidence submitted\u201d); <em>Kamara v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., </em>420 F.3d 202, 212 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cAgency action is entitled to a presumption of regularity, and it is the petitioner's burden to show that the BIA did not review the record when it considered the appeal.\"); <em>Man v. INS, </em>69 F.3d 835, 838 (7th Cir.1995) (\"[Ajbsent evidence to the contrary, we assume that the BIA reviewed the specific findings of the immigration judge in light of the record....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-6\">. The majority could not hold that the IJ failed to consider the <em>issue </em>of the mother's suicidal tendencies. The IJ discussed Hernandez\u2019s concern about this issue in some detail. The IJ also listed a declaration to that effect from Dr. Wakefield as being part of the record. However, the IJ found that the evidence did not establish the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d necessary to meet the standard in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B). The IJ reasoned that Hernandez \"has not lived with his mother for years and he has not provided her with meaningful emotional or financial support.... [Hernandez's] mother can legally travel to Mexico to visit her son which she did when he was living in Mexico.... [T]he court finds that the hardship suffered by [Hernandez's] daughter and mother is not different from the ordinary hardship of separation of a family member when that family member is deported or removed from the United States.\u201d The BIA affirmed the IJ's determination as being based on facts that were not clearly erroneous. These findings are binding on us. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Moreover, they are confirmed by Hernandez's subsequent decision to allow himself to be removed to Mexico (a fact admittedly not before the BIA when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s factual findings), which indicates that Hernandez's assessment of his mother's condition was similar to the IJ\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\">. Rather, the IJ may have rejected Dr. Wake-field\u2019s characterization of the separation as being permanent. The IJ noted that Hernandez\u2019s mother would be free to visit her son in Mexico and to communicate with him via telephone.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
