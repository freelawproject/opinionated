Spencer argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior conviction for felony child abuse was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and that he thus qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Spencer argues that the district court should not have relied on the predicate offense description from the PSI, but rather could only rely on the state\u2019s factual proffer of the offense from the sentencing transcript, which did not clearly indicate the use of physical force or infliction of physical injury, as required by \u00a7 4B 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-22\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Chavarriyar-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2004). The interpretation of Florida\u2019s statute for felony child abuse is a question of law and is also subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-23\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant qualifies as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d if he was at least 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the instant offense, the instant offense is a crime of violence or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>controlled substance offense, and he has at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (a). A \u201ccrime ' of violence\u201d is defined as any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-4\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). An application note in the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 clarifies that an offense is a crime of violence if \u201cthe conduct set forth <em>(i. e., </em>expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted ..., by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 comment, (n.l). The application notes also provide that the \u201coffense of conviction (i e., the conduct of which the defendant was convicted) is the focus of inquiry\u201d for determining whether an offense is a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>comment, (n.2). \u201cWe treat the commentary in the sentencing guidelines as authoritative.\u201d <em>United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1234 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">We have interpreted \u00a7 4B1.2(a) as providing two alternative approaches for classifying an offense as a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1196 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe first approach is to determine whether the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another is an element of [the offense].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second approach is to determine \u201cwhether [the offense] involves conduct that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">In determining whether an offense is a crime of violence, a district court can look to the conduct and circumstances underlying the conviction only if \u201cambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1995). In such a case, the district court \u201cmay rely only on the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 15, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). For purposes of sentencing, the district court may also base its factual findings on undisputed statements in the PSI. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006). Facts contained in a PSI are considered undisputed unless the defendant makes a challenge to those facts \u201cwith specificity and clarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832-33 (noting that an objection to the probation officer\u2019s use of <em>non-Shepard </em>materials in preparation of the PSI did not amount to a dispute of the facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">We have noted that, under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the definition of \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is broadly interpreted \u201cto include crimes that do not fit neatly into a category of hostile, aggressive acts.\u201d <em>United States v. McGill, </em>450 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). We have also noted that \u201cthe specific language of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) concerns the potential <em>risk </em>of physical injury rather than the actual <em>use </em>of force against another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281. We have emphasized that sexual offenses against minors \u201calways present a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure a child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>compliance with an adult\u2019s sexual demands.\u201d <em>Ivory, </em>475 F.3d at 1238 (holding that statutory rape, a \u201cnonconsensual act of sexual penetration,\u201d inherently involves some physical force and is a crime of violence) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Using this reasoning, we have held that \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s definition of a crime of violence includes lewd assault on a minor, <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899, 905 (11th Cir.1999), and persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity, <em>Sear-cy, </em>418 F.3d at 1197 (noting that the offense \u201cpresents the possibility of an encounter that could result\u201d in serious risk of physical injury and that \u201cphysical injury need not be [certain] for a crime to pose a serious risk of physical injury\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Under Florida law, the elements of the crime of felony child abuse are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-6\">(a) Intentional infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">(b) An intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-8\">(c) Active encouragement of any person to commit an act that results or could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 827.03(1). The Florida statute further provides that \u201c[a] person who knowingly or willfully abuses a child without causing great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement to the child commits a felony of the third degree.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">Because we conclude that Spencer\u2019s predicate conviction for felony child abuse involved a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, we agree with the district court\u2019s classification of that predicate offense as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and the application of the career offender enhancement to Spencer under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Accordingly, we affirm Spencer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
