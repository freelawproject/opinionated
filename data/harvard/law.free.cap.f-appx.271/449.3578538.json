The district court dismissed Barrow\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998). A complaint is frivolous \u201c \u2018if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Barrow\u2019s claim under the Eighth Amendment lacks merit. A prisoner must satisfy two requirements, consisting of an objective and subjective component, in order to establish a conditions-of-confinement claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1003, 1006 (5th Cir.1998). Barrow admitted in the district court that he had not suffered any physical injury from the purportedly contaminated food trays and that he was not aware whether other inmates or staff suffered physical injury. He fails to assert, and the record does not reveal, any other facts that would otherwise support an objective finding that the condition of the prison trays qualifies as an \u201cextreme deprivation [].\u201d <em>See id. </em>Likewise, because there is no evidence that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference, Barrow cannot establish the subjective requirement. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir.1999). Barrow has thus failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his Eighth Amendment claims as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Barrow also alleges that he was denied access to the courts because the defendants were not required to answer his claims. This claim is meritless. Section 1915A specifically allows for a dismissal prior to ordering a response from defendants. Barrow\u2019s two motions to supplement the record and his motion to allow attachments to the brief are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Barrow\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it should be dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous as well as the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Barrow has previously accumulated two strikes. <em>See Barrow v. Tex. Dept. Corr. et al, </em>No. C-04-496, 2006 WL 2987697 (S.D.Tex. Oct.17, 2006); <em>Barrow v. Swisher County, </em>No. C-04-455 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 16, 2005). As Barrow has now accumulated at least three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal while incarcerated unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
