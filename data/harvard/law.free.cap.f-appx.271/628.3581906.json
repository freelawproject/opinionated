We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Siqueira\u2019s untimely filing of his asylum application should be excused. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Siqueira\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Siqueira\u2019s fear of future persecution is not on account of a protected ground, but stems from his personal relationships with his former co-workers. <em>See Zayas-Marini v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 801, 806 (9th Cir.1986). We reject Siqueira\u2019s argument that his co-workers from the police department attributed an anti-government corruption view to him because he never refused to accede to the corruption. <em>Cf. Desir v. Ilchert, </em>840 F.2d 723, 727 (9th Cir.1988) (concluding that petitioner had established a nexus based on his refusal to accede to governmental corruption). Therefore, we deny the petition as to Siqueira\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because the evidence does not compel a finding that it is more likely than not that Siqueira will be tortured upon returning to Brazil. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir. 2006). Furthermore, Siqueira\u2019s contention that the IJ erred by failing to properly address his CAT claim is belied by the record. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430 (9th Cir.1995) (In determining whether the IJ provided a sufficient explanation for its findings, all that is required is that the IJ \u201cprovide a comprehensible reason for its decision sufficient for [this court] to conduct [its] review and to be assured that the petitioner\u2019s case received individualized attention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
