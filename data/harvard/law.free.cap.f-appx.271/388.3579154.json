Nunez was sentenced to a 37-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">For the first time on appeal, Nunez challenges the application of the above-referenced enhancement. Contending the New Mexico statute under which he was convicted encompasses activity outside the generic definition of a drug-trafficking offense, he maintains the statute is broad enough to criminalize the possession of a controlled substance with the intent to administer it to another. Nunez claims such conduct does not fall within the definition of a drug-trafficking offense under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">As Nunez acknowledges, his failure to challenge the enhancement in the district court results in our reviewing only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d.308, 310 (5th Cir.2002). For reversible plain error, Nunez must show clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001). Even if these factors are established, this court will generally not exercise its discretion to correct the plain error unless it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Under the categorical approach provided in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), a district court must look to the elements of a prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction, when classifying a prior offense for sentence-enhancement purposes. <em>E.g., United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.2005). In a \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d, such as when determining whether a prior conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d, a district court may look beyond the elements of the offense when classifying a prior offense for sentence-enhancement purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 273 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Even where the district court may look beyond the elements of the offense, however, the district court is \u201cnot free to consider any facts, but may consider the statutory definition of the offense, [and, <em>inter alia,] </em>the charging paper, and the jury instructions\u201d. <em>Id. </em>A district court may not rely solely on the presentence investigation report\u2019s (PSR) characterization of the offense for enhancement purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 273-74. The indictment for the New Mexico offense alleged that Nunez knowingly possessed with the intent to transfer, or did attempt to transfer, marijuana to another. Because the conduct described in Nunez\u2019s state-court marijuana indictment is equivalent to the offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, the district court did not plainly err in enhancing Nunez\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">In the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Nunez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Pinedar-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
