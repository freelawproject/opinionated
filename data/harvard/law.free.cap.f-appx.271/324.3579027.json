Reyes\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Reyes has not filed a pro se informal brief. The Government declined to file a brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">The only issue counsel raises is whether Reyes\u2019 sentence was reasonable. This court will affirm a sentence if it is \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence that falls within the properly calculated advisory Guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-19\">Reyes argues that the district court imposed a greater sentence than was necessary because he has lived in the United States for seventeen years, he has a family who needs his support, and faces certain deportation because he is without legal status. Because Reyes was sentenced within the properly calculated Guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. This court reviews his sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). After reviewing the record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Reyes\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
