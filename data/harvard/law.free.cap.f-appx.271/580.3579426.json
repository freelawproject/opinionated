The relevant statutory provision criminalizes \u201csexual contact\u201d with a person \u201cunder 13 years of age\u201d where \u201cthe actor is more than 36 months older than the complainant.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.343(l)(a). It provides that \u201cconsent to the act by the complainant\u201d is not a defense, and that \u201cthe state is not required to prove that the sexual contact was coerced.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">Wences-Alcaide contends that the statute reaches conduct that does not qualify as \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, because it does not require any proof that the \u201csexual contact\u201d was harmful or injurious. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He argues that the statute encompasses even consensual relations, which he maintains do not constitute maltreatment under our decision in <em>United States v. Bazar-Martinez, </em>464 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">In <em>Baza-Martinez, </em>we considered a statute that North Carolina courts had interpreted to punish \u201cmere words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1016. We held that a conviction for violating the statute was not categorically \u201cabuse of a minor\u201d because the courts had applied it to convict individuals for conduct, such as covertly filming a minor undressing, that the victim was not aware of and that therefore did not necessarily involve the infliction of either physical or psychological harm. <em>Id. </em>at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-20\">In contrast, the Minnesota statute punishes, only \u201csexual <em>contact\u201d </em>with a child under the age of 13 if the perpetrator is at least 3 years older than the victim. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.343(l)(a) (emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Sinerius, </em>504 F.3d 737, 741 (9th Cir.2007), we held that even \u201cconsensual sexual contact by a 16-year-old on a 13-year-old victim[] categorically quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fies as \u2018sexual abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.8d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir.1999) (minor\u2019s consent to sexual contact irrelevant because Congress did not intend the law \u201cto excuse an individual who preys upon a child too young to understand the nature of his advances\u201d). Accordingly, a conviction for violating section 609.343(l)(a) of the Minnesota Statutes categorically qualifies as \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Wences-Alcaide\u2019s conviction therefore constituted a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d justifying the imposition of a sixteen-level sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
