KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-25\">Defendant-Appellant Raoul Moreno appeals from his conviction for distributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>five grams or more of methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Mr. Moreno was sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 60 months\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, he argues that the district court improperly instructed the jury that it could not consider a prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence unless the statement was made under oath. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">On May 5, 2006, Detective Roger Nies-porek, accompanied by a cooperating state defendant, sought to purchase two ounces of methamphetamine and a firearm from Amber Ward. The detective saw a suspect, who he identified at trial as Mr. Moreno, walking on the sidewalk near Ms. Ward\u2019s home who motioned them to follow him. While driving by, the detective watched Mr. Moreno cross a grassy area and pull out of his pocket what appeared to be a gun, look at it, and then return it to his pocket. The cooperating state defendant and the detective parked in front of a market where Mr. Moreno approached the car and sat in the rear seat on the driver\u2019s side. The detective was seated in the passenger seat of the car. He testified he could see Mr. Moreno clearly and described his appearance as \u201ca male Hispanic, about average height, a little stocky, bigger guy ... wearing a black basketball jersey, a black-and-white jersey with the Number 32, and he had shorts on,\u201d III R. at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Mr. Moreno then passed the detective a sandwich bag which was later determined to contain methamphetamine, and the detective passed Mr. Moreno $1,700 in cash. According to the detective, he saw what appeared to be the outline of a semi-automatic handgun inside Mr. Moreno\u2019s pocket. After the transaction, the detective testified that Mr. Moreno said, \u201cif we wanted a 9 millimeter he could probably hook us up with one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. The detective further testified that he heard a metallic click that he believed to be the sound of a firearm being de-cocked or the safety being engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The detective prepared a police report including a physical description of Mr. Moreno. However, the police report did not mention Mr. Moreno\u2019s tattoos. During cross-examination of the detective, defense counsel asked Mr. Moreno to show his extensive tattoos on his arms, legs and the back of his head. The detective acknowledged that this omission was an error in his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">During the jury instruction conference, Mr. Moreno objected to jury instruction 10 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">The testimony of a witness may be discredited by showing that the witness testified falsely concerning a material matter, or by evidence that at some other time before trial the witness said or did something, or failed to say something, which is inconsistent with the testimony the witness gave at this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">If you find that a statement is inconsistent with the testimony the witness gave at this trial, you may consider the earlier statement in deciding the truthfulness and accuracy of the witness\u2019 testimony in this trial. <em>You may not, however, use it as evidence of the truth of the matter contained in that prior statement, unless that statement was made under oath. </em>If the prior statement was made under oath, you may also consider it as evidence of the truth of the matter contained in that prior statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">I R. Doc. 152 at 11 (emphasis added). Mr. Moreno objected to the emphasized sentence arguing that it was not applicable because the instruction went to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>detective\u2019s testimony regarding his police report. The district court overruled the objection on the grounds that the inconsistent statements could be used for impeachment, but not substantive evidence\u2014 \u201cyou can\u2019t get positive evidence out of a prior statement that isn\u2019t under oath [but] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [y]ou can impeach, you can beat them to death with it.\u201d IV R. at 13. During deliberation, the jury requested a transcript of the detective\u2019s testimony and the police report. II R. Doc. 151 at 1. The court declined the request with the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">No testimony of any witness is available during trial. It takes an enormous amount of time to prepare transcripts. You must rely on your memories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">Police reports are not usually admitted into evidence and were not in this case. You have all the exhibits that were admitted. You must rely on your notes and collective memory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">District courts must instruct the jury correctly on the law. Because Mr. Moreno objected to the jury instruction concerning inconsistent statements, we review the instruction de novo. <em>United States v. Jameson, </em>478 F.3d 1204, 1211 (10th Cir.2007). We review jury instructions as a whole and will reverse the conviction only if we have \u201csubstantial doubt that the jury was fairly guided.\u201d <em>United States v. LaVallee, </em>439 F.3d 670, 684 (10th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Mr. Moreno argues that the jury was incorrectly instructed that a witness\u2019s pri- or statement could not be used as substantive evidence because the witness was not under oath when he made the statement. Mr. Moreno contends that the instruction precluded the jury from considering the detective\u2019s omission of the suspect\u2019s tattoos from the police report as evidence of the suspect\u2019s true identity because police reports are not made under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1) provides that certain statements are not hearsay and therefore admissible as substantive evidence where \u201c[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition.\u201d If a witness\u2019s prior statements are not made under oath, the statements \u201care admissible only to impeach or discredit the witness and are not competent substantive evidence of the facts to which the former statements relate.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>973 F.2d 1509, 1512 (10th Cir.1992) (quotations omitted). In such a circumstance where the prior statement does not comply with Rule 801(d)(1)(A), the jury must be instructed that the statement is available for contradiction purposes only and not for the truth of the statement. <em>See id. </em>at 1514; <em>accord </em>1A Kevin F. O\u2019Malley, Jay E. Grenig &amp; William C. Lee, <em>Federal Jury Practice &amp; Instructions </em>\u2014 Criminal, \u00a7 15.06 (5th ed. 2000) (instruction that \u201c[t]he earlier inconsistent or contradictory statements are admissible only to discredit or impeach the credibility of the witness and not to establish the truth of these earlier statements\u201d should be included in the charge unless a Rule 801(d)(1)(A) statement is involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Even assuming that the police report was a prior statement inconsistent with the detective\u2019s trial testimony, it was not a statement \u201cgiven under oath ... at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). Consequently, Mr. Moreno could only use the police report to contradict the detective\u2019s evidence and not as substantive evidence. The jury instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>tion correctly and clearly stated the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Mr. Moreno\u2019s argues that if a jury cannot rely on a witness\u2019s prior statement as substantive evidence of what occurred, a jury is simply left with the witness\u2019s statements at trial. He argues that the police report ought to be considered evidence of what truly happened. In this case, the police report was not admitted into evidence, and Mr. Moreno did not even proffer the police report to the district court. <em>See United States v. Angelos, </em>433 F.3d 738, 749-50 (10th Cir.2006) (district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit police reports as they would have been cumulative of the officer\u2019s admission that he did not include certain information in those reports). In any event, Mr. Moreno was given broad latitude to emphasize the omission in the police report and did so during cross-examination and closing argument. The trial judge handled the situation correctly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-26\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
