Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1084-85 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), that it would not have imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>different sentence had it known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We conclude that the government has waived its right to enforce Almashleh\u2019s appeal waiver because the government failed to raise the argument during Al-mashleh\u2019s initial appeal. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Lopez, </em>309 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Almashleh\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines is not properly before this court because Al-mashleh failed to raise the issue in his brief prior to the <em>Ameline </em>remand. <em>See United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.2006); <em>cf. United States v. Thornton, </em>511 F.3d 1221, 1227 (9th Cir. 2008) (recognizing that the appellant\u2019s sentencing issues were properly before the court on appeal from an <em>Ameline </em>remand only because the appellant raised the issues in his initial appeal to this court).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Almashleh\u2019s motion to expedite this appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
