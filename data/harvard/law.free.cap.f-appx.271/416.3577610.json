Frank Melton was the director of the MBN at the time of the underlying events in this case. Pierce sued Melton. According to Pierce\u2019s complaint against Melton for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, gross negligence, and libel and slander, on April 17, 2003, Melton intentionally disseminated to the press a highly confidential MBN memorandum with false information about Pierce. Melton allegedly knew of the falsity of the information. On November 3, 2005, Defendant-appellee Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d) filed the present declaratory action requesting the district court to declare that as to Pierce\u2019s allegations, there is no coverage for, and no duty to defend, Melton under any of the three separate policies issued to him: a Mississippi home-owners policy, a Texas home-owners policy, and a personal umbrella policy. The district court dismissed the case on summary judgment in favor of Allstate. Pierce appeals the district court decision only as to coverage and duties under the Umbrella Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The Umbrella Policy has two related business exclusions. First, the Umbrella Policy states: \u201c[activities <em>related to </em>any business or business property of an insured are not covered.\u201d (emphasis added). The Umbrella Policy also excludes \u201cany occurrence <em>arising out of </em>a business or business <em>property.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The Policy defines \u201cbusiness\u201d as \u201cany full or part-time activity of any kind engaged in for economic gain.\u201d The district court concluded that the intentional leaking of a confidential memo was \u201crelated to\u201d Melton\u2019s business, which was his salaried job as the director of MBN. \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy, like any contract, is a legal question reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Leonard v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>499 F.3d 419, 428 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Melton\u2019s job was an activity engaged for economic gain, <em>i.e. </em>his salary, and therefore, by definition, a \u201cbusiness\u201d under the terms of the policy. Whether or not MBN is a itself business is not relevant. Even if one business exclusion may exclude more activity than the other, the business exclusions are compatible-they both exclude an overlapping set of personal activities-so, there is no conflict between the exclusions. As there is no ambiguity, the court is not required to interpret what is the plain meaning of these exclusions. <em>See Miss. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>908 So.2d 765, 769 (Miss.2005); <em>Aero Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>713 F.2d 1106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>1109 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201cWithout an affirmative expression of an overriding public policy by the Mississippi courts or legislature, we are constrained to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement according to its plain meaning.\u201d). As the appellant rightly concedes, \u201carising out of\u2019 is usually interpreted very broadly in the insurance context. <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Bailey, </em>133 F.3d 363, 370 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cWhen an exclusion precludes coverage for injuries \u2018arising out of described conduct, the exclusion is given a broad, general, and comprehensive interpretation. A claim need only bear an incidental relationship to the described conduct for the exclusion to apply.... The words are understood to mean \u2018originating from,\u2019 \u2018having its origin in,\u2019 \u2018growing out of or \u2018flowing from.\u2019 \u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Gonzaba v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>179 Fed.Appx. 218 n. 7 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Melton\u2019s actions that triggered Pierce\u2019s lawsuit flow from his occupation, and under a broad interpretation of \u201carising out of,\u201d his actions squarely fall within the business exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Therefore, the Umbrella Policy does not cover the underlying acts, and the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
