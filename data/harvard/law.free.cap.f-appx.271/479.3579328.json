Katt contends that it did in two ways: 1) his conviction based on residual hearsay violated his due process right to a fair trial; and 2) the hearsay testimony violated his Confrontation Clause rights. Finding that Katt procedurally defaulted his Due Process Clause claim and that he cannot show the Michigan courts unreasonably applied clearly established Confrontation Clause law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Katt shared a house with his landlord, the landlord\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, the fiane\u00e9e\u2019s five-year-old daughter, A.D., and seven-year-old son, D.D., and two other men.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Concerns about Katt\u2019s sexual abuse of the two children arose after Angela Bowman, a Children\u2019s Protective Services investigator, visited D.D. at school to investigate an anonymous report that his mother was physically abusing D.D. and his sister. Although D.D. did not corroborate any abuse by his mother, he spontaneously revealed during the interview that \u201cUncle Terry was doing nasty things to him\u201d and his sister. After further questions revealed D.D.\u2019s advanced sexual knowledge and use of adult terminology, Bowman contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The police arrested Katt and charged him with four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. At his trial both children testified via two-way closed-circuit camera, a procedure to which Katt stipulated. During the testimony, they demonstrated Katt\u2019s sexual abuse using dolls. Supplementing the children\u2019s testimony, Bowman gave a more specific and fresh account of the school interview with D.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Katt countered that his feud with the children\u2019s mother prompted her to coach her children to fabricate the story, but the jury evidently disbelieved him, returning guilty verdicts on all but one of the counts, which yielded three consecutive life sentences. <em>People v. Katt, </em>248 Mich.App. 282, 689 N.W.2d 815, 816 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">During Katt\u2019s Michigan appeals, the trial court\u2019s admission of Bowman\u2019s hearsay testimony sparked a prolonged legal battle over Michigan Rule of Evidence 803(24), the so-called \u201cresidual,\u201d or \u201ccatchall,\u201d hearsay exception. Bowman\u2019s recounting of the child\u2019s story failed to qualify for admission under the state\u2019s \u201ctender-years exception\u201d because D.D. told his mother about the abuse a few days before he met Bowman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the evidence was a \u201cnear-miss\u201d for that specifically applicable rule, Katt contended that sanctioning its admission under the general residual exception would be inappropriate as a sort of end-run around the more precise rule. In the end, both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the admission of Bowman\u2019s testimony under the residual exception as a matter of first impression. <em>See People v. Katt, </em>248 Mich.App. 282, 639 N.W.2d 815 (2001), <em>affd, </em>468 Mich. 272, 662 N.W.2d 12 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Having exhausted his Michigan remedies, Katt petitioned for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, setting forth four claims. Although the district court denied the petition, it was persuaded that reasonable jurists could debate the federal constitutional propriety of the admission of the hearsay testimony under Michigan\u2019s residual hearsay exception. With this appeal Katt maintains that the social work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>er\u2019s testimony violated his rights under the Due Process and Confrontation Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">A. <em>Due Process Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment denying habeas corpus relief. <em>Bey v. Bagley, </em>500 F.3d 514, 518 (6th Cir.2007). And because Katt filed his petition after the effective date of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), its provisions govern. <em>Stewart v. Erwin, </em>503 F.3d 488, 493 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">A habeas petitioner must \u201cfairly present\u201d federal claims in state courts and exhaust state remedies before seeking collateral relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A); <em>see Whiting v. Burt, </em>395 F.3d 602, 612 (6th Cir.2005). Exhaustion \u201cprotect[s] the state courts\u2019 role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent[s] disruption of state judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 518, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). More to the point, it gives state prisoners an incentive to \u201cseek full relief first from the state courts, thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of constitutional error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518-19, 102 S.Ct. 1198. The petitioner must make the same federal claim in state and federal courts because \u201c[t]he rule would serve no purpose if it could be satisfied by raising one claim in the state courts and another in the federal courts.\u201d <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 276, 92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">To \u201cfairly present\u201d a federal claim, the petitioner must plead both a factual and legal basis for the claim. <em>McMeans v. Brigano, </em>228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir.2000). We examine a petitioner\u2019s pleadings for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApV\">(1) reliance upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) reliance upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleging facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-11\"><em>Id. </em>Meeting the task of fair presentation does not require reciting \u201cchapter and verse\u201d of constitutional law, but only \u201cadequately appris[ing] the state courts of the constitutional theory to be relied upon at appellate review.\u201d <em>Franklin v. Rose, </em>811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">The Warden argues that Katt failed to do just that, depriving this court of jurisdiction. We agree as to Katt\u2019s Due Process claim. Katt offers only one sentence, accompanied by one citation, to show that he fairly presented a federal due process claim. In his Michigan Supreme Court brief, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">Admission of the hearsay not only violated the rules of evidence, it also denied Mr. Katt\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. US Const, Ams V, VI, XIV; <em>Const 1963, </em>art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 20; <em>Walker v. Engle, </em>703 F.2d 959, 962-963 (C.A.6, 1983)(errors in evidentiary rulings under state law may deny a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process if they render the trial fundamentally unfair).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">JA 23. Katt claims that this statement constituted \u201chis sole assignment of error,\u201d but in his brief to the Michigan Supreme Court seeking leave to appeal, he actually grounded the assignment of error in state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-15\">The trial judge committed reversible error in admitting under the catchall exception, MRE 803(24), and over defense objection the hearsay testimony of a social worker about what [D.D.] told her where the statement was inadmissible under the appropriate hearsay exception, the tender-years rule, MRE 803A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY-\">JA 136 (all letters capitalized in original). In turn, the Michigan Supreme Court ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>proached the question as one of state law: \u201cThe issue in this case is whether the trial court properly admitted under MRE 803(24) the victim\u2019s hearsay statement made to a social worker.\u201d <em>Katt, </em>662 N.W.2d at 14; <em>see also People v. Katt, </em>466 Mich. 889, 649 N.W.2d 72 (Mich.2002) (table) (granting leave to appeal \u201climited to the issue of whether the trial judge erred in admitting testimony from the protective services worker under MRE 803(24)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Our cases view Katt\u2019s isolated allusion to \u201cconstitutional rights to due process and a fair trial\u201d as failing to afford the Michigan courts adequate notice that Katt intended to invoke the Due Process Clause. <em>See, e.g., Slaughter v. Parker, </em>450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir.2006) (where a petitioner alleged that he had been deprived of \u201cdue process and a fair trial by an impartial jury\u201d and cited the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, he had not \u201cfairly presented\u201d a federal claim to the state courts); <em>Black-mon v. Booker, </em>394 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Gjeneral allegations of the denial of rights to a \u2018fair trial\u2019 and \u2018due process\u2019 do not \u2018fairly present claims\u2019 that specific constitutional rights were violated.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); see <em>also Riggins v. McGinnis, </em>50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir.1995) (\u201cA lawyer need not develop a constitutional argument at length, but he must make one; the words \u2018due process\u2019 are not an argument.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">And since Katt did not fairly present a due process claim to the Michigan courts, we analyze whether he can return to Michigan courts to exhaust his claim properly. <em>See Bell v. Bell, </em>512 F.3d 223, 231 n. 3 (6th Cir.2008) (en bane). Given that a Michigan \u201cdefendant may not file an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence if the defendant has previously taken an appeal from that judgment by right,\u201d Mich. Ct. R. 7.205(F)(2), as Katt did, Michigan rules foreclose proper exhaustion at this stage, rendering Katt\u2019s claim proeedurally defaulted. <em>See </em>Mich. Ct. R. 6.508(D)(3)(a). Katt makes no attempt to hurdle this barrier by a showing of cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment finding Katt\u2019s due process claim unexhausted and properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">B. <em>Confrontation Clause Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">As for Katt\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim, we assume, without deciding, that Katt \u201cfairly presented\u201d this because, regardless of exhaustion concerns, AEDPA deference dooms it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2) (authorizing a habeas court to deny \u201c[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus ... on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">AEDPA mandates deferential review of state-court judgments affirming the conviction of a habeas petitioner, allowing this court to grant relief only if the state adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Durr v. Mitchell, </em>487 F.3d 423, 432 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Nonetheless, Katt seeks de novo review of his Confrontation Clause claim. This escape from AEDPA deference is only possible if he fairly presented his claim, but the Michigan courts chose not to resolve it and made no decision to which we can defer. <em>See Vasquez v. Jones, </em>496 F.3d 564, 569 (6th Cir.2007). Our review of the Michigan decisions, however, confirms that the courts <em>did </em>adjudicate Katt\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim, albeit tailoring their dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>cussion to reflect his brief supporting argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">But because the Michigan Supreme Court ultimately resolved the claim in a footnote \u201cwith little analysis on the substantive constitutional issue,\u201d we apply modified AEDPA deference. <em>See Vasquez, </em>496 F.3d at 569. Under this modified approach, \u201ca federal habeas court must conduct an independent review of the record and applicable law to determine whether, under the AEDPA standard, the state court decision is contrary to federal law, unreasonably applies clearly established law, or is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Howard v. Bouchard, </em>405 F.3d 459, 467 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Nevertheless, \u201creview remains deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Katt seeks relief on the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong, contending that the Michigan courts identified the correct Confrontation Clause decisions but unreasonably applied them to the facts of his case. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 408, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We disagree; far from unreasonably applying the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, the Michigan courts were directly on point in rejecting Katt\u2019s Confrontation Clause challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We note at the outset that although Katt asks for retroactive application of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), a decision post-dating his state court proceedings, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), forecloses <em>Crawford </em>reliance. <em>See id. </em>at 1184 (holding that <em>\u201cCrawford </em>announced a \u2018new rule\u2019 of criminal procedure and that this rule does not fall within the <em>Teague </em>exception for watershed rules\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Courts knew before <em>Crawford </em>that the Confrontation Clause \u201cpermits ... the admission of certain hearsay statements against a defendant,\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 847, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990), so long as they exhibit \u201cadequate indicia of reliability,\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). Either a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or \u201ca showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d permit an inference of reliability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">In upholding the \u201cnear miss\u201d application of the state\u2019s residual hearsay rule, the Michigan courts primarily discussed <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 817, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). There, the Supreme Court held that the analogous federal residual hearsay exception is not a firmly rooted exception for Confrontation Clause purposes, but the Court then offered examples of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d that pave the path to admission: spontaneity and consistent repetition of the statement, the mental state of the declarant, the use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and the lack of a motive to fabricate. <em>Id. </em>at 821-22, 110 S.Ct. 3139.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">Both Michigan appellate courts found that the trial court thoroughly parsed the hearsay for \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d before admitting Bowman\u2019s account of the interview with D.D. Neatly tracking <em>Wright\u2019s </em>suggested factors, the Michigan Court of Appeals summarized the facts that made Bowman\u2019s testimony reliable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-14\">As the trial court noted, D.D. voluntarily and spontaneously told Bowman about the sexual abuse. Notably, Bowman was present at D.D.\u2019s school to question him about alleged physical abuse by his mother, and was only apprised of the sexual abuse when D.D. volunteered the information. Moreover, throughout his conversation with Bowman, D.D.\u2019s reci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>tation of the relevant facts concerning the sexual abuse remained consistent. D.D. also had personal knowledge of the sexual abuse of both himself and A.D. because he was present when it occurred. Bowman further stated that D.D. freely recounted the circumstances of the abuse without coaxing or leading questions on her part and that he frequently used terminology \u201cunexpected of a child of similar age.\u201d Likewise, Bowman indicated that she is trained and proficient in interviewing suspected victims of child abuse and used open-ended, nonleading questions to glean information from D.D. Finally, as the trial court correctly observed, there is absolutely no indication in the record that substantiates defendant\u2019s claim that seven-year-old D.D. had a motive to fabricate defendant\u2019s involvement in these heinous offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Katt, </em>639 N.W.2d at 823 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Although Michigan\u2019s residual hearsay rule required \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d as a matter of evidence law, then-existing Supreme Court Confrontation Clause precedent did not require any comparable showing \u201cwhen a hearsay declarant is present at trial\u201d and the defendant has \u201cthe traditional protections of the oath, cross-examination, and opportunity for the jury to observe the witness\u2019 demeanor.\u201d <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 560, 108 S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988). The Michigan Supreme Court therefore met the AEDPA test when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">If the declarant does testify at trial and is subject to cross-examination, corroborative evidence <em>may </em>be used to determine the trustworthiness of statements in criminal cases. The reason is that the Confrontation Clause is not implicated. <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 560, 108 S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\"><em>Katt, </em>662 N.W.2d at 24 n. 12. That is, the trial court\u2019s procedure mitigated Confrontation Clause concerns when D.D. and A.D. testified because Katt could and did cross-examine them. The Michigan Court of Appeals suggested as much when it observed after its discussion of guarantees of trustworthiness: \u201c[B]oth D.D. and his sister A.D. testified at trial and were subject to extensive cross-examination by defense counsel. Thus, \u2018the jury could weigh [D.D.\u2019s] statement and accord the statement whatever weight the jury deemed appropriate.\u2019\u201d <em>Katt, </em>639 N.W.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Katt argues that, even though they were present at trial, the children were reticent and gave nonresponsive answers, unconstitutionally depriving him of the opportunity for cross-examination. The Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Owens, </em>which arose from a prisoner who attacked his correctional counselor with a metal pipe. 484 U.S. at 556, 108 S.Ct. 838. The victim identified his attacker to an FBI agent, but by the time of the trial the victim was unable to remember the details of the assault. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the Confrontation Clause allowed the FBI agent to testify to the hearsay identification because the defendant had at least the opportunity to cross-examine the declar-ant-victim, even though cross-examination might not be fruitful. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 108 S.Ct. 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We have since applied <em>Owens </em>to permit four adult witnesses to relate a child de-clarant\u2019s statements and fortify the child\u2019s own testimony. <em>Bugh v. Mitchell, </em>329 F.3d 496, 501 (6th Cir.2003). Because the child \u201cwas present at trial and subjected to cross-examination ... an inquiry into the reliability of the statements [was] not needed to satisfy the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Finally, Katt complains that he could not effectively cross-examine the children be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>cause they testified via two-way closed-circuit television and not face-to-face -with Katt. But Katt stipulated to using this procedure, <em>see United States v. Kappell, </em>418 F.3d 550, 553 (6th Cir.2005), and never challenged it in the state courts or in the district court. The factual basis for this claim has not been exhausted in the state courts, and we do not consider habeas claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Seymour v. Walker, </em>224 F.3d 542, 561 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also Vasquez, </em>496 F.3d at 568. Even if we were to review the claim, no Supreme Court decisions available during the Michigan proceedings prohibited the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In light of our conclusions that the Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply then-existing Supreme Court Confrontation Clause decisions and that Katt procedurally defaulted his due process claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Katt\u2019s petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">.
