McCullough and Darrell Brown, Sr., (plaintiffs) appeal the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order remanding their attorney disciplinary proceedings back to Arkansas state court. We have jurisdiction to review the remand order because plaintiffs purported to remove their disciplinary proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (providing an order remanding a case is not renewable on appeal, except an order remanding a case which was removed pursuant to \u00a7 1443 shall be renewable); <em>Neal v. Wilson, </em>112 F.3d 351, 354-55 (8th Cir.1997) (renewing district court\u2019s remand order because disbarment proceedings were removed under \u00a7 1443).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-22\">We conclude the district court\u2019s remand was proper because plaintiffs did not allege facts showing a state law or other \u201cequally firm prediction\u201d has prevented or will prevent them from enforcing their rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1) (stating a civil action commenced in state court can be removed to federal court when an action is against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in state court any law providing for the equal rights of United States citizens); <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 800, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>803-04, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966) (explaining, for a case to be removable under \u00a7 1443, defendant must rely upon law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality, and must show that, due to a formal expression of state law or other equally firm prediction, he' would be denied or cannot enforce federal rights in state court); <em>Neal, </em>112 F.3d at 355 (concluding the district court properly remanded disbarment proceedings where the defendant failed to meet \u00a7 1443(1) requirements; agreeing with the district court that defendant\u2019s contentions \u201cboil[ed] down to little more than a belief by him that, since the state actors disagree with him and his lawyers, they must have racially discriminatory motives\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We also agree with the district court that plaintiffs were not entitled to a hearing to determine whether the disciplinary proceedings were removable. <em>See News-Texan, Inc. v. City of Garland, Texas, </em>814 F.2d 216, 218 (5th . Cir.1987) (deciding \u201cno evidentiary hearing is required if the section 1443 grounds purportedly justifying removal are patently invalid from the face of the removal petition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\">.
