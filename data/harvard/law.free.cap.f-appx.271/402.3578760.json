Bryson, Jr., federal prisoner # 95662-071, appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition and the denial of a series of pro se pleadings, which the district court also construed as requests for \u00a7 2241 relief. In both cases, the district court held that the claims raised by Bryson, which attacked his conviction and sentence, were more properly raised via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and, because Bryson was unable to show the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate, he was ineligible to proceed via \u00a7 2241. The pertinent issue before us therefore is whether the district court erred in determining that to the extent Bryson\u2019s claims attacked his conviction and the imposition of his sentence, he has failed to show the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-21\">The only argument Bryson arguably makes with regard to the pertinent issue on appeal is one contending that the district court erred in construing his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as raising habe-as claims. In that motion, he raised a sentencing-error claim, arguing that the district court sentenced him under the wrong edition of the Sentencing Guidelines. Bryson\u2019s sentencing-error claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c), which provides for modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence only if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The sentencing-error claim was properly construed by the district court as a request for collateral relief. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Errors that purportedly occurred at sentencing may not be asserted under \u00a7 2241 unless they arise under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Bryson has made no showing that his claim arises under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. Consequently, he has not shown any error on the part of the district court in denying his request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Bryson additionally asks us to rule on the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial of a second, but identical, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on January 9, 2007. That motion was summarily denied after the appeal of Bry-son\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition had been docketed in this court. Consequently, the appeal of that order is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
