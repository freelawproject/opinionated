The bankruptcy court granted the Changs\u2019 first Motion for Summary Judgment and denied discharge to the Parks on the basis that a state court had already determined that the Appellants committed fraud, which caused damages to the Changs, and collateral estoppel prevented relitigation of the fraud issue. In this first order, the bankruptcy judge set for trial the issue of damages. The Changs filed a second Motion for Summary Judgment/Motion to Reconsider on the damages issue. The Changs\u2019 summary judgment on damages was then granted by the bankruptcy judge in a second order, which the court treated as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 motion (\u201cRule 60(b) motion\u201d) pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9024.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this order, all debts arising from the fraud were awarded to the Changs. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court on all issues. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">I. Facts and Prior Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">This bankruptcy dispute arises from the Changs\u2019 purchase of two automobiles from the Parks\u2019 dealership, Auto Country, Inc. The Changs initially filed suit in state court, alleging that they fully paid for the vehicles in January of 2004 and received title documents for them, but the cars were repossessed by Toyota of Dallas in February 2004. The Changs alleged that Auto Country, Inc. and the Parks failed to pay Toyota of Dallas, which claimed ownership, and the Changs brought suit against the Parks, Auto Country, Inc., and others for breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">The case was tried before a jury in Texas state court in Dallas in July 2005, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Changs. The jury found that Auto Country, Inc. committed fraud against the Parks and that the Parks were personally responsible for the conduct of Auto Country, Inc. The Parks and Auto Country, Inc. were held jointly and severally liable to the Changs.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">In August 2005, the Parks filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. The Changs then filed a complaint pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), (a)(4), and (a)(6),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>seeking a denial of discharge of the judgment debt owed to them. The basis of this complaint was that the Parks committed fraud, as found by the state court, and, according to the doctrine of collateral es-toppel, should not be discharged from the judgment debt. In June 2000, the bankruptcy court granted the Changs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and denied discharge of this debt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that order, the bankruptcy court did not decide the issue of damages. However, in September 2006, Changs\u2019 filed a second Motion for Summary Judgment/Motion to Reconsider the damages issue, and the court treated the motion as a Rule 60(b) motion and granted it. The bankruptcy court found that all the damages awarded to the Changs by the state court arose from the fraud and were thus nondischargeable. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court on all issues. The Parks now timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AEb\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The Parks first challenge the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that collateral estoppel bars relitigation of the fraud issue in this case. The Parks allege that because the elements of fraud as found in the state court action were not the same elements required under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), collateral es-toppel should not apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Parks explain that under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), the Changs were required to establish that (1) the Parks made a representation, (2) which was knowingly false, (3) that was made with intent to deceive the Changs, (4) that the Changs actually and justifiably relied on, and (5) that the Changs sustained a loss as a proximate result of their reliance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Parks argue that the state court finding of fraud did not include a showing of intent or of actual and justifiable reliance as is required under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and that collateral estoppel is inapplicable. The district court pointed out, however, that the state court\u2019s charge to the jury explaining the elements of fraud contained elements that were identical to those required under \u00a7 523.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court did not err in finding that the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) were satisfied by the state court fraud proceedings. Additionally, the Parks argue that even if they were vicariously liable for the acts of Auto Country, Inc. in the state court action, such vicarious liability is an insufficient basis for collateral estoppel. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>district court explained, however, the Parks were found to be directly liable for the conduct of Auto Country, Inc. for the fraud committed on the Changs. We conclude that the district court did not err in holding that collateral estoppel applied to the fraud issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Parks argue next that it was error to award the Changs all damages from the state court action because they allege the damages arose from both dischargeable and nondischargeable claims. The bankruptcy court determined that pursuant to <em>Cohen v. de la Cruz, </em>all the damages awarded by the state court arose from the fraud finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the bankruptcy judge explained, the jury found that the Parks obtained money from the Changs by fraud, and the judgment awarded is the debt resulting from that fraud, which is wholly nondischargeable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court on the basis of <em>Cohen, </em>and we agree. The district court did not err in concluding that the damages found in the state court action arose from the Parks\u2019 fraud and were thus not dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The third issue raised by the Parks is that district court erred by affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s treatment of the Changs\u2019 second Motion for Summary Judgment/Motion to Reconsider as a Rule 60(b) motion. Although treatment of such a motion as a Rule 60(b) motion is allowed in bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9024, that rule applies to final judgments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first judgment of the bankruptcy court in this case was interlocutory,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and thus Rule 60(b) is inapplicable. To the extent the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b), it erred. However, as the district court correctly noted, the bankruptcy court was nevertheless still within its authority to reconsider its earlier interlocutory order and consider the issue of damages. Because the bankruptcy court was within its discretion in reconsidering the issue of damages following its interlocutory order, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>IV.
