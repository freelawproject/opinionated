R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b627-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-22\">Michael B. Williams appeals pro se the dismissal without prejudice, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action seeking damages from his defense attorney and other defendants for his confinement on a 1991 conviction. Williams contends that the district court erred in determining that his claims were barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and, alternatively, under applicable statutes of limitations. He also contends that the district court erred in holding that it lacked authority to construe his complaint as a coram nobis petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A(b). <em>Weilburg v. Shapiro, </em>488 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.2007). We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">Williams claims that his appointed defense attorney committed malpractice and negligence; the crime victim, the prosecution, and the City and County of San Francisco violated his constitutional rights in his prosecution; the defendants conspired to violate his constitutional rights; he was falsely imprisoned; and the City and County were negligent and committed malicious prosecution and abuse of process in his 1991 rape conviction. He has finished serving his sentence and is civilly detained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>as a sexually violent predator. His federal habeas corpus petition challenging the rape conviction was filed in 2008 and was dismissed as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Williams contends that the district court erred in determining that his claims were barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>which holds that \u201cin order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal ..., or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). He argues that the unavailability of habeas corpus nonetheless allows his suit. We disagree; the unavailability of habeas corpus is due to Williams\u2019s failure timely to pursue this remedy. <em>See Guerrero v. Gates, </em>442 F.3d 697, 704-05 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Williams also contends that the district court should have construed his complaint as a coram nobis petition. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that it lacked authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis with respect to a state court conviction. <em>See United States v. Crowell, </em>374 F.3d 790, 794 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
