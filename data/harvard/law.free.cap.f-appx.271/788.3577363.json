Seitter\u2019s sentence of probation was revoked, and a term of imprisonment was imposed, after Seitter violated the terms of his probation. Seitter challenges his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He argues the district court erroneously based the term of imprisonment solely on his need for rehabilitation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a), and his counsel was constitutionally deficient. We conclude a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) cannot be granted because Seitter has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Accordingly, this court DENIES Seitter\u2019s implied request for a COA and DISMISSES the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">Seitter received a sentence of probation after pleading guilty to receipt of child pornography. The district court revoked his probation after it found Seitter was in violation of its terms and conditions and sentenced him to twenty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court based the length of the term of imprisonment on the availability of a sexual offender treatment program in prison. Seitter, however, was not admitted to the treatment program because the program had placed a moratorium on new admissions in preparation for changes under the Adam Walsh Act. Pub. L. No. 109-248,120 Stat. 587 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">Seitter did not appeal the sentence, but challenged it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He argued before the district court, in relevant part, that the sentencing court had erred because it had fashioned the length of his term of imprisonment solely for rehabilitative purposes. Seitter argued the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a), which should have applied to his sentencing. Thus, he argued, he was enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>tied to relief under \u00a7 2255(a) because his sentence was \u201cimposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9y\">The district court denied Seitter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Operating under the assumption Seitter\u2019s sentencing flowed from a revocation of supervised release, the district court determined Tenth Circuit case law established \u00a7 3582(a) did not apply to revocations of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Tsosie, </em>376 F.3d 1210, 1217 (10th Cir.2004). Seitter\u2019s sentence, however, actually flowed from a revocation of probation rather than a revocation of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Seitter appeals the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing \u00a7 3582(a) does apply to the imposition of a term of imprisonment after the revocation of probation and the district court erred when it determined the length of his sentence solely for rehabilitative purposes. He also alleges his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to raise this argument at his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">To be entitled to a certificate of appeal-ability, Seitter must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In deciding whether Seitter has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Seit-ter need not demonstrate that his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a certificate of appealability, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">\n<em>A. Section 3582(a) Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Seitter\u2019s \u00a7 3582(a) claim asserts he was sentenced in violation of the laws of the United States. Statutory claims are cognizable in the district court under \u00a7 2255. A certificate of appealability, however, can only be granted if the movant has made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitution,al </em>right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (emphasis added). Because this issue does not have constitutional dimensions, we cannot grant a certif\u00edcate of appealability, regardless of the merits of the argument. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>454 F.3d 1075, 1079 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201c[N]o matter how clearly the \u00a7 2255 movant can show that the district court erred in denying a statutory claim in his habeas petition, he is not entitled to a COA to have his claim heard on appeal.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>172 F.3d 753, 755 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">\n<em>B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Seitter alleges his sentence was constitutionally defective because his counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to raise the issue of \u00a7 3582(a)\u2019s applicability to his sentencing hearing. Seitter did not, however, present this argument in his motion before the district court. Seitter argues his brief statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>in his </em>motion that \u201cdefense counsel glaringly failed to raise [the \u00a7 3582(a) issue]\u201d provided sufficient notice of his intent to raise an ineffective assistance claim. We cannot agree. This statement was without support or context sufficient to alert the district court that a Sixth Amendment claim was presented. \u201c[V]ague, arguable references to a point in the district court proceedings do not preserve the issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Lyons v. Jefferson Bank &amp; Trust, </em>994 F.2d 716, 721 (10th Cir.1993) (alterations and quotation omitted). This court generally does not address arguments presented for the first time on appeal and we see no reason to do so here. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">For the reasons stated above, this court DENIES Seitter a certificate of appealability and DISMISSES the appeal.. In so holding we express no opinion on whether a 60(b) motion urging the district court to reconsider its decision on the \u00a7 2255 motion based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the underlying proceedings would be considered a \u201ctrue\u201d 60(b) motion. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">. The district court was led to conclude the proceeding was a revocation of supervised release both by Seitter, who referred both to supervised release and probation in his motion, and the government, which labeled the proceeding as a revocation of supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">. Further, to prevail on this claim, Seitter must demonstrate his \"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201ca petitioner must show that his trial counsel committed serious errors in light of prevailing professional norms.\" <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). The case law concerning \u00a7 3582(a)'s application to a revocation of probation is far from settled, with no circuit court addressing the question directly. Based on the extant nature of the case law, Seitter\u2019s counsel did not fall below the prevailing professional norms in failing to raise the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
