Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review credibility determinations for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000), and we review de novo questions of law, <em>see Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2007). We deny in part, and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on material omissions and a lack of specificity in Singh\u2019s testimony with regard to the reasons for his arrest and detention, which are matters that go to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-64 (9th Cir.2004). Further, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s credibility finding that Singh provided inconsistent testimony regarding when he was arrested, and that he failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>adequately explain this fact when given the opportunity. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-1157 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same statements found not to be credible, and he does not point to any other evidence in the record that would compel a finding that it would be more likely than not that he would he would be tortured if returned to India, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Singh\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced because of an alleged defect in the Notice to Appear is foreclosed by <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d at 1066-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Singh failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003). We need not reach the remaining contentions because failure to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship is dispositive. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
