LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"atm-dedup-0\">Nixon Simatupang, a citizen of Indonesia and a Christian, seeks review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). That decision denied Sima-tupang\u2019s requests for asylum, restriction on removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b735-15\">During his elementary and middle school years, Simatupang attended private Christian schools in Indonesia. Because a private high school was not available on his home island, however, he enrolled in a government school in which 94 percent of the students were of the Islamic faith. Like other Christian students at that school, Simatupang was treated unfairly, because the \u201cteachers ignored him, and did not allow his participation in activities and competitions.\u201d Due to this discrimination, Simatupang chose to attend a private university.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-16\">After graduation in 1996, Simatupang sought employment at government businesses and banks, but he was not offered any positions, allegedly because of religious discrimination. He decided to come to the United States to study English and was accepted into a language program in Denver, Colorado. In March 1997, Sima-tupang entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa. That same month, an Indonesian court declared his father\u2019s business bankrupt and his parents could no longer pay his tuition. Simatupang was unable to attend classes, but after three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>months, he obtained employment in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">While Simatupang resided in this country, some of his relatives experienced difficulties in Indonesia. His aunt\u2019s house was burned during anti-Christian riots that occurred in May 1998. Simatupang\u2019s uncle was severely beaten and stabbed by three Muslims in November 2002 because he helped them relative convert to Christianity. The police arrested one of the individuals responsible for the beating, but the uncle dropped charges after receiving a threatening letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">On learning of his uncle\u2019s beating, Sima-tupang resolved to apply for asylum, restriction on removal, and CAT relief. On January 29, 2003, he filed his application, claiming past persecution and a well-founded fear of future, country-wide persecution, based upon his Christian religion. Simatupang offered the following evidence in support of his application. He testified that he fears that Muslims will harm him physically and psychologically if he returns to Indonesia and that the police will be unable to protect him. While Simatu-pang\u2019s application was pending, his brother\u2019s church in Indonesia was burned. Country-condition exhibits were also submitted, reporting attacks on Christians in various areas of the Indonesian archipelago.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">At the hearing, the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Simatupang\u2019s asylum application was not filed within the requisite one-year statutory period and that the record did not demonstrate extraordinary or changed circumstances sufficient to excuse the delay. Regarding restriction on removal and relief under the CAT, the IJ determined that Simatupang failed to show that he was persecuted or tortured in the past or that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to Indonesia. On this basis, the IJ denied asylum, restriction on removal, and relief under the CAT. In a brief written order issued pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), the BIA affirmed the IJ. In his petition for review, Simatupang argues that relief was wrongfully denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">An alien may not apply for asylum without demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within one year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The BIA may accept an otherwise untimely application, however, if it is convinced that the alien demonstrated either (1) \u201cthe existence of changed circumstances which materially affect [his] eligibility for asylum\u201d or (2) \u201cextraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">We have jurisdiction to review a denial of an asylum application due to untimeliness only if the petitioner raises constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>Ferry v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 1117, 1130 (10th Cir.2006). We have no jurisdiction over discretionary decisions or findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>There is no dispute that Simatupang failed to meet the one-year time limit. He argues, however, that we have jurisdiction to review the legal question of whether the IJ and, in turn, the BIA applied an incorrect definition of the term \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d We agree and proceed to review this legal question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">As an initial matter, we must determine whether the form of the BIA\u2019s order re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>quires us to consider alleged legal error by the IJ. When the BIA issues a \u201cbrief order[ ] affirming\u201d the IJ\u2019s order, as it did here, we review the BIA\u2019s written decision rather than the IJ\u2019s oral decision. <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 783, 789-90 (10th Cir. 2007). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s order, any application of an erroneous definition of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d by the IJ is irrelevant unless the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s error. \u201cWhere the BIA decision does not explicitly incorporate or summarize the IJ\u2019s reasoning and contains a discernible substantive discussion that stands on its own, our review extends no further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In its decision, the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s definition of \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d Rather, it reached its own determination that Simatupang\u2019s evidence did not \u201cestablish[ ] the existence of changed <em>or </em>extraordinary circumstances which materially affected the ability to file a timely application\u201d (emphasis added). We interpret this statement as an independent conclusion that Simatupang did not meet either basis for acceptance of an untimely application under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Moreover, we see no indication that the BIA\u2019s understanding of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d was erroneous. Thus, the BIA did not legally err in dismissing Simatupang\u2019s asylum claim as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Simatupang also seeks review of the denial of his request for restriction on removal. On appellate review of a BIA decision, \u201c[o]ur duty is to guarantee that factual determinations are supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole. Agency findings of fact are conclusive unless the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788-89 (quotations omitted). We do not reweigh the evidence or evaluate witness credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">\u201cTo qualify for restriction on removal, an alien must show a clear probability of persecution in the proposed country of removal,\u201d <em>Yan v. Gonzales, </em>438 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted), on grounds of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). A probability of future persecution is presumed if the alien \u201cis determined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). Otherwise, the alien must show that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that he would be persecuted upon removal, \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(iii), and must also demonstrate that future persecution could not reasonably be avoided by moving elsewhere within the county of removal, \u00a7 208.16(b)(2), (3)(i). This court has defined persecution as \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ ... entail[ing] more than just restrictions or threats to life or liberty.\u201d <em>Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1124 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Simatupang claims that the BIA denied restriction on removal based on inappropriate credibility determinations and impi\u2019oper evidentiary evaluations. Assuredly, the record may demonstrate that Simatupang experienced discrimination and difficult times in Indonesia, but it does not compel a reasonable factfin-der to conclude that he was subjected to persecution in the past or that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted upon removal. As for past persecution, the BIA found that the employment and educational discrimination Simatupang experienced does not rise to the level of persecution. This finding is supported by his own testimony about his past experiences in Indonesia. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>for a clear probability of future persecution, the BIA found that Simatupang had failed to adduce evidence that his fear of persecution was country-wide. This conclusion is supported by the IJ\u2019s finding that Indonesia contains some majority-Christian islands where Simatupang presumably would not be subject to religious persecution. We conclude that the BIA\u2019s findings underlying the denial of restriction on removal are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cThe Convention Against Torture prohibits the return of an alien to a country where \u2018it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yan, </em>438 F.3d at 1251 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2)). \u201cTorture\u201d must be \u201can extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d \u00a7 1208.18(a)(2). To warrant relief under the CAT, the treatment must be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). Even assuming that he has provided evidence of a likelihood of treatment amounting to torture, Simatupang has not shown that any public official would acquiesce in this treatment. To the contrary, the only evidence in the record suggests that rather than acquiescing, the government investigates any ill treatment. After all, police made an arrest following the beating of Simatupang\u2019s uncle and closed the case only at the uncle\u2019s request. We are compelled to conclude that the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b735-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">.
