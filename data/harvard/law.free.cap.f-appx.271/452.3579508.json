The Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (Commissioner) denied his application for benefits initially and on reconsideration. Vaught sought and received a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) in May 2004. Vaught, who had legal representation, testified at the hearing, as did a vocational expert and a medical expert. The ALJ denied Vaught\u2019s application for benefits. The Appeals Council denied Vaught\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Vaught then sought review in the federal district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A magistrate judge recommended that the ALJ\u2019s decision should be affirmed. Vaught timely objected, and the district court reviewed the magistrate\u2019s report <em>de novo. </em>The district court agreed with the magistrate and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Vaught appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">Our \u201creview is limited to (1) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standard; and (2) whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnI\">\u201c[sjubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d The court does not reweigh the evidence in the record, try the issues <em>de novo, </em>or substitute its judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s, even if the evidence weighs against the Commissioner\u2019s decision. \u201cConflicts in the evidence are for the [Commissioner] and not the courts to resolve.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABt\">The ALJ reviewed Vaught\u2019s claim under the familiar five-step analysis,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and concluded that Vaught foundered on step five.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">The ALJ determined that Vaught \u201chas the residual functional capacity to perform and maintain a limited range of \u2018sedentary\u2019 work,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here exist in significant numbers in the national economy other (unskilled) jobs that [Vaught] can perform, including the following: food/beverage or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>der clerk ...; charge account clerk ...; and document preparer____\u201d Thus, the ALJ determined that \u201c[Vaught] was not under a \u2018disability,\u2019 as defined in the Social Security Act, at any time through the date of this decision.\u201d As such, Vaught \u201cis not entitled to a period of disability or disability insurance benefits under ... the Social Security Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Vaught challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision on four grounds: (1) the ALJ failed to consider and discuss the medical examination done by Dr. Pushpavath Motaparthi of the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA); (2) the ALJ disregarded the VA\u2019s disability determination; (3) the ALJ\u2019s residual function capacity determination was in error; and, (4) the hypothetieals the ALJ gave to the vocational expert were inconsistent with Vaught\u2019s medical limitations. Both the magistrate and the district court admonished Vaught for making only con-clusory allegations of error; yet, in this appeal, Vaught has done so again. Nevertheless, we conclude that he has not abandoned all of his claims because of inadequate briefing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">First, Vaught contends that the ALJ did not consider the examination of him performed by Dr. Motaparthi of the VA; he bases his argument on the fact that the \u201cALJ did not mention the actual VA medical examination that supported the [VA] disability rating.\u201d An examination of the ALJ\u2019s decision, however, reveals that the ALJ did consider Vaught\u2019s VA medical records, which includes Dr. Motaparthi\u2019s report. Moreover, the ALJ specifically discussed the VA\u2019s disability determination, which specifically relied on, among other medical evidence, Dr. Mota-parthi\u2019s examination; thus, the ALJ necessarily considered Dr. Motaparthi\u2019s conclusions. Vaught\u2019s reliance on <em>Welch v. Barnhart </em>is misplaced, because there the district court concluded that \u201cit appears that the ALJ <em>totally disregarded </em>Welch\u2019s VA disability determination.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is clear that the ALJ considered Vaught\u2019s VA medical records, and we find no reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss Dr. Motaparthi specifically.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Next, we consider Vaught\u2019s claim that the ALJ \u201cdisregarded\u201d the VA disability rating. We have explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArT\">[a] VA rating of total and permanent disability is not legally binding on the Commissioner because the criteria applied by the two agencies is different, but it is evidence that is entitled to a certain amount of weight and must be considered by the ALJ.... Since the regulations for disability status differ between the SSA and the VA, ALJs need not give \u201cgreat weight\u201d to a VA disability determination if they adequately explain the valid reasons for not doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">The ALJ did take account of the VA\u2019s disability rating, but explained that the relevant VA\u2019s regulations were inconsistent with the Social Security regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The ALJ concluded, therefore, that it could not give \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the VA disability rating. The ALJ went on to explain that it was giving \u201cgreater weight\u201d to the \u201cother evidence including the actual VA medical records.\u201d Vaught does not explain why the ALJ\u2019s reasons for not giving the VA disability determination greater weight were erroneous, and therefore leaves us with no basis upon which to find error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Third, Vaught challenges the ALJ\u2019s residual function capacity determination. Specifically, Vaught says that the ALJ \u201cdid not relate the treating sources medical evidence to Vaught\u2019s ability to work as established by Dr. Allred.\u201d However, given that the ALJ discussed some of Dr. Allred\u2019s findings, we are not persuaded this is so. In the end, the ALJ was persuaded by Dr. Taubert\u2019s analysis of the evidence and his conclusion that Vaught can perform \u201csedentary\u201d work; we are not, therefore, confronted with a situation where the ALJ has rejected an uncontroverted medical opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Vaught offers no argument as to why the ALJ erred in crediting Taubert\u2019s opinion, and as it is for the ALJ to weigh the competing evidence,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Vaught further contends that the ALJ \u201cfailed to reconcile the differences between Dr. Beal and Dr. Wright,\u201d which led to an untrue \u201cpicture of Vaught\u2019s functional limitations.\u201d Vaught fails completely to elaborate on this argument, and the contours of it are not readily apparent. He does not say what the differences are. Nor does he explain how these differences actually affected the ALJ\u2019s weighing of the evidence. In short, he leaves us to conjure error, which we will not do.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We deem the argument abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Finally, Vaught claims that the ALJ failed to incorporate the VA evidence and Dr. Allred\u2019s opinion into the hypotheticals he presented to the vocational expert. We have explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag6\">Unless the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert by the ALJ can be said to incorporate reasonably all disabilities of the claimant recognized by the ALJ, and the claimant or his representative is afforded the opportunity to correct deficiencies in the ALJ\u2019s question by mentioning or suggesting to the vocational expert any purported defects in the hypothetical questions (including additional disabilities not recognized by the ALJ\u2019s findings and disabilities recognized but omitted from the question), a determination of non-disability based on such a defective question cannot stand.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Again, Vaught offers only a bare assertion of error. His argument amounts to a disagreement with the ALJ\u2019s residual function capacity determination, but that determination was supported by substantial evidence. Vaught does not contend that the ALJ\u2019s questions failed to reasonably incorporate the disabilities recognized by the ALJ, or that the hypotheticals were inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the ALJ provided Vaught with the opportunity at the hearing to question the vocational expert; that is, Vaught could have corrected any errors in the hypotheticals, or added additional disabilities, during the hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
