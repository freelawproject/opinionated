CYS fired DeLuzio in 1999, ostensibly for insubordination. DeLuzio then brought this action, alleging a host of constitutional and statutory violations in connection with his failure to be promoted while at CYS, his termination by CYS, and subsequent interference by CYS and its employees in DeLuzio\u2019s pursuit of other jobs. The procedural history of this case is long and complex, but the resolution of these appeals is simple. The District Court expended a significant amount of time and energy on this case, and navigated through multiple claims and motions with accuracy and aplomb. We will affirm its decisions in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">Sat Bahl became CYS\u2019s Administrator in July 1996. As Administrator, Bahl supervised all CYS employees, had authority to hire and suspend employees, and could recommend that employees be fired, although the final authority for termination rested with the Monroe County Commissioners. Despite his junior status, DeLuz-io often clashed with Bahl and others over CYS\u2019s provision of services to its clients and its internal policies and procedures. DeLuzio made his opinions on these mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ters known to his superiors at CYS repeatedly and insistently, often by writing memos outlining the problems he saw with CYS\u2019s operations and the treatment strategies for clients of other caseworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In November 1997, DeLuzio sought but was passed over for a promotion to become a higher-level caseworker. In November 1998, DeLuzio again sought promotion, this time to become a Program Manager. Again, he was rejected, and Christina Ia-cano was promoted instead, although she had been with CYS for just a few months. Moreover, on at least two occasions, Bahl recommended that DeLuzio be disciplined. On each occasion, however, the disciplinary action was reversed and expunged from DeLuzio\u2019s record because after DeLuzio challenged the actions, the reviewing authority found DeLuzio\u2019s underlying conduct to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">DeLuzio\u2019s memos (often written to Bahl) increased in frequency after Iacano\u2019s promotion to Program Manager, and began to include DeLuzio\u2019s opinions on how CYS\u2019s Family Preservation unit should be operated. On February 18, 1999, Bahl suspended DeLuzio without pay, \u201cpending investigation of possible misconduct.\u201d Bahl did not justify the suspension until over 30 days later, and then, on March 26, 1999, wrote DeLuzio a letter stating that the suspension had been related to DeLuzio\u2019s file-keeping methods and his \u201cdaily barrage of \u2018Memo\u2019s\u2019 demanding audiences, meetings, apologies, etc. [which had] become insubordination.\u201d DeLuzio, Bahl, and the union steward then had a meeting regarding Bahl\u2019s allegations, at which De-Luzio was given the opportunity to challenge the conclusions of the March 26, 1999 letter. By letter dated April 7, 1999, Bahl informed DeLuzio that he was terminated. This action followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">After several preliminary opinions by the District Court that narrowed the case\u2019s scope,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the remaining issues went to trial in March 2005. The District Court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Defendants on several claims at the close of DeLuzio\u2019s case and then sent four claims to the jury: two First Amendment retaliation claims against Bahl (for failure to promote and for termination); a Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim against Bahl, Bielat, and Iacano; and a claim that these three individuals conspired to deprive DeLuzio of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The jury found in favor of Bahl on the failure to promote retaliation claim, but rendered a verdict against the defendants on the other three claims and imposed punitive damages against Bahl on the termination retaliation claim. Defendants re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>newed their motions for judgment as a matter of law after trial, and the District Court granted relief to Bahl, Bielat, and Iacano on the due process and civil conspiracy claims. Thus, DeLuzio ultimately succeeded only on the First Amendment retaliatory discharge claim against Bahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Bahl and DeLuzio have now filed cross appeals. Bahl asserts, first, that the District Court erred by denying him judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether DeLuzio\u2019s speech was a protected activity. Bahl also claims that the District Court erred by finding that sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict on three issues: that DeLuzio\u2019s protected speech was a substantial factor in Bahl\u2019s termination recommendation; that Bahl\u2019s recommendation was a cause of DeLuzio\u2019s termination; and that punitive damages were warranted. DeLuzio appeals the District Court\u2019s post-trial grant of judgment as a matter of law on the procedural due process and civil conspiracy claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We deal first with the District Court\u2019s decisions on the parties\u2019 motions for judgment as a matter of law. In so doing, we exercise plenary review. <em>See Curley v. Klem, </em>499 F.3d 199, 205 (3d Cir.2007). First, we hold that the District Court properly denied Bahl\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law that DeLuzio\u2019s speech was not protected by the First Amendment. To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, a public employee plaintiff must allege: (1) that the activity in question is protected by the First Amendment, and (2) that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the alleged retaliatory action. <em>See Phyllis Hill v. City of Scranton, </em>411 F.3d 118, 125 (3d Cir. 2005). \u201cThe first factor is a question of law; the second factor is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, </em>455 F.3d 225, 241 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">A public employee\u2019s statement is protected activity \u201cwhen (1) in making it, the employee spoke as a citizen, (2) the statement involved a matter of public concern, and (3) the government employer did not have \u2018an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public\u2019 as a result of the statement he made.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1958, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006)). When a public employee makes a statement pursuant to his official duties, he does not speak \u201cas a citizen.\u201d <em>Cebados, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1960. \u201cWhether an employee\u2019s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Rankin v. McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 384, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">DeLuzio\u2019s speech was protected by the First Amendment. DeLuzio did not have professional responsibility, or \u201cofficial duties,\u201d over any of the topics covered in his memos. His superiors\u2019 problems with DeLuzio stemmed precisely from his frequent and unwelcome comments on matters that the supervisors felt were not within DeLuzio\u2019s purview \u2014 such as the course of treatment for other caseworkers\u2019 clients, or operating procedures that De-Luzio thought were harmful but was without power to change. Indeed, Bahl contends in his brief that \u201cDeLuzio engaged in a course of conduct wherein he routinely commented on anything and everything involving [CYS], whether or not he had any direct responsibility for those issues or the involved clients.\u201d DeLuzio\u2019s comments were directed towards the effect of CYS\u2019s actions and inaction regarding the welfare of children under the supervision of Monroe County and the potentially improper or dangerous operations of CYS. These are certainly on topics of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>concern, defined as those which \u201crelat[e] to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.\u201d <em>Green v. Phila Housing Auth., </em>105 F.3d 882, 885-86 (3d Cir.1997). Finally, Bahl has not provided any justification for his treating DeLuzio differently from any member of the public regarding DeLuzio\u2019s comments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Next, we hold that the District Court properly granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of Bahl, Bielat, and Iacano on the due process and civil conspiracy claims. To succeed on his Fourteenth Amendment claim, DeLuzio had to show that CYS deprived him of property without sufficient process by denying him \u201cnotice and an opportunity to respond.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). It is undisputed, however, that DeLuzio received written notice both of his suspension and of CYS\u2019s intent to terminate him, and had the opportunity to respond at a pre-termination hearing. <em>(See </em>JA 1073, 1090.) \u201cThe essential requirements of due process\u201d entitle a public employee \u201cto oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487. DeLuzio\u2019s suspension and termination process adhered to these requirements of due process, and, accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law on DeLuzio\u2019s procedural due process claim. Moreover, since the predicate unlawful act for the conspiracy claim was a purported due process violation, and there was no due process violation, we will also affirm the judgment entered as a matter of law on the conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Finally, we reject Bahl\u2019s three-pronged attack on the sufficiency of the evidence. We apply an exceedingly deferential standard of review to a District Court\u2019s finding that sufficient evidence supported a jury verdict. We must affirm unless, after reviewing the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d it is \u201ccritically deficient of the minimum quantum of evidence from which the jury might reasonably afford relief.\u201d <em>Kinnel v. Mid-Atlantic Mausoleums, Inc., </em>850 F.2d 958, 961 (3d Cir.1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Bahl does not meet this high burden. First, the jury could certainly have concluded that DeLuzio\u2019s protected speech was a substantial factor in Bahl\u2019s termination recommendation. DeLuzio testified that Bahl had been antagonistic towards him since 1996, and the jury also heard evidence that Bahl had twice been involved in reprimands of DeLuzio that were later overturned or expunged. The jury could have properly viewed any or all of these events as evidence of retaliatory animus. Second, there was at least a \u201cminimum quantum of evidence\u201d that Bahl\u2019s recommendation was a cause of DeLuzio\u2019s termination. It was well within the jury\u2019s purview to infer that since Bahl had authority to hire, suspend, and recommend firing CYS employees, and had day-to-day authority over these employees, that the County Commissioners, who had ultimate authority to fire DeLuzio, would have tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>en seriously Bahl\u2019s recommendation. Finally, record evidence supported the jury\u2019s imposition of punitive damages, which are appropriate where \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\u201d <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983). Here, the jury could have inferred Bahl\u2019s intent, or his disregard for DeLuzio\u2019s right to engage in protected speech, from testimony regarding Bahl\u2019s ongoing hostility towards DeLuzio, the improper negative evaluations, and Bahl\u2019s hand in \u201cmuddying the waters\u201d for DeLuzio when he sought work after leaving CYS.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decisions in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over the federal constitutional and civil rights claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343, and supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. DeLuzio originally asserted seventeen claims, in eight counts, against a total of seven defendants. On December 6, 2001, the District Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss completely Count I (DeLuzio\u2019s claims based directly on amendments to the U.S. Constitution), Count V (DeLuzio\u2019s wrongful discharge claim) and removed CYS as a defendant. The Court also dismissed parts of Count II (DeLuzio\u2019s \u00a7 1986 claim and the Fourth and Fifth Amendment aspects of his \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1988 claims) and dismissed the federal claims against Monroe County. On March 30, 2004, the District Court dismissed more of Count II (the substantive due process claim) and part of Count VI (the intentional interference with contractual relations claim as to Monroe County). On December 9, 2004, the District Court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count VIII (discrimination based on military preference).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\">. Bahl also fails in his argument that he cannot be held liable for First Amendment retaliation because, although Bahl was DeLuzio's ultimate supervisor throughout DeLuzio\u2019s tenure and could recommend that DeLuzio be fired, he did not wield final authority for termination of CYS employees. <em>See Kutz-town, </em>455 F.3d at 240 (\u201cA supervisor who lacks the power to terminate a subordinate\u2019s employment may nonetheless abuse his power with respect to that subordinate, and may even constructively discharge the subordinate, provided he (the supervisor) exercises <em>some </em>power over the employee.\u201d)(emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
