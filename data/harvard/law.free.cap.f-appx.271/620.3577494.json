Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Albino-Lopez\u2019s contentions that the agency violated his due process rights by crediting the smugglee\u2019s Record of Sworn Statement and by determining that Albino-Lopez was not fully candid with the immigration court do not amount to color-able constitutional claims. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Tjraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review Albino-Lopez\u2019s contention that the IJ exhibited bias and applied the wrong legal standard because he failed to raise these issues before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion or violate due process by denying Albino-Lopez\u2019s motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence he submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh, </em>295 F.3d at 1039 (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d); <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
