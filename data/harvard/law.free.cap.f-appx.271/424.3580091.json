Appellants also argue that in calculating compensation for the taking, the court erred by refusing to exclude the testimony of the Government\u2019s expert, by finding that the roadway was not a separate economic unit, and by denying their motion for reconsideration. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">As an initial matter, Appellants fault the magistrate judge, before whom the case was tried by consent, for ordering \u201cpossession\u201d of the property when the Government\u2019s notice and motion sought to take an easement, which is a non-possessory interest. However, the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cpossession\u201d to describe the easement is without consequence. The Order for Delivery, signed on December 9, 2005, granted possession \u201cto the extent of the property described in the [Government\u2019s] motion.\u201d The Government\u2019s motion described a perpetual road and utility easement. Appellants were therefore ordered to surrender the easement the Government requested, and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Appellants also contend that the court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of the Government\u2019s land-value expert, Burnell Cook. Appellants assert that Cook\u2019s testimony is unreliable because Cook calculated the value and determined the highest and best use of the entire parcel of land on which the roadway is located, as opposed to separately evaluating the roadway. The normal procedure for awarding compensation for an easement is to determine the highest and best use of the entire acreage within the property lines of the parent tract and then to calculate the difference between the market value of the tract before and after the taking. <em>United States v. 8.41 Acres of Land, </em>680 F.2d 388, 391 (5th Cir.1982). Cook\u2019s analysis is consistent with this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Appellants assert, however, that an exception to this general method of calculating compensation applies in this case because the gravel roadway is a \u201cseparate economic unit.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 393 (discussing separate economic units). Three factors are particularly helpful in ascertaining whether property taken is part of a single larger tract: physical contiguity, unity of ownership, and unity of use. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In this case, the district court carefully examined the three factors and concluded that the tract at issue was not separate from the parent tract. <em>See id. </em>The issue of unity or separateness of a tract is a question of fact, which this court will reverse only for clear error. <em>See id. </em>at 393. After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, we conclude that this factual finding is not clearly erroneous. Because the expert\u2019s calculations complied with the normal procedure for calculating damages and the district court did not clearly err in finding that the exception for separate tracts is inapplicable, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to admit the testimony of the Government\u2019s expert.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Finally, Appellants argue that the court \u201ccontinued to ignore the evidence and refused to vacate its erroneous findings of fact\u201d when it denied them objections to the decision and their motion for reconsideration. We disagree. Th\u00e9 court\u2019s four-page order carefully addresses the parties\u2019 arguments and reexamines the evidence. Moreover, the findings of fact the court declined to vacate are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">. Appellants also argue that Cook's testimony is unreliable because he failed to appraise the property as of the date of the taking. Because this basis for objection is different from the theory raised at trial, \"plain error\u201d is the standard of review. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>256 F.3d 330, 340 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that \"where the theory underlying the basis for an appeal is different from the one raised in the lower court, 'plain error\u2019 should be the standard of review\u201d); <em>Crawford v. Falcon Drilling Co., </em>131 F.3d 1120, 1123 (5th Cir. 1997) (reviewing unpreserved error in a civil case using the plain-error standard). To prevail under plain error review, Appellants must demonstrate that the admission of Cook\u2019s testimony affected their substantial rights or \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>See United States v. Longoria, </em>298 F.3d 367, 371 (5th Cir.2002). Because Appellants have shown neither, we reject this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
