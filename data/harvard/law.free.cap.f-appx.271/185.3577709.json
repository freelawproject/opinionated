Briefly, Willie Henry filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in which he argued that his federal sentence should be credited with time spent in state custody. He also contended that his sentencing court misapplied the sentencing guidelines. The District Court denied the petition, and Henry filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), a defendant can only receive credit towards a federal sentence for prior custody \u201cthat has not been credited against another sentence.\u201d Henry does not dispute that the time at issue was credited towards his state sentence. Thus, it cannot be credited towards his federal sentence. We also agree with the District Court that Henry\u2019s challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines is not properly raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s October 3, 2007 order, 2007 WL 2907811. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
