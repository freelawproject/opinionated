She was sentenced to 108 months of incarceration. On appeal, Wolford raises two issues: (1) whether the district court erred by failing to sua sponte order a competency hearing, and (2) whether she received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">First, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court for failing to order a competency hearing. <em>United States v. Mason, </em>52 F.3d 1286, 1289 (4th Cir.1995) (stating review standard). Second, Wol-ford has failed to meet the demanding burden of showing ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal, unless it conclusively appears from the record that counsel provided ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
