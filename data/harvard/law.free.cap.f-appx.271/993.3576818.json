Lee Patrick, Jr., appeals his 65-month sentence for embezzling and conspiring to embezzle from an organization receiving federal funds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 666, as well as the district court\u2019s order requiring him to pay $408,265.14 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-23\">Patrick argues that the district court erred when it imposed a 65-month term of imprisonment after finding that a loss amount of $408,265.14 was attributable to him and due as restitution. He contests the loss amount arguing that it was not supported by specific, reliable evidence and argues that the district court made a computation error in determining the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-24\">We review the district court\u2019s loss determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>172 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.1999). The loss amount is defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cactual loss,\u201d which in turn is defined as the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm resulting from the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i)) (2005). However, in <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2006), we held that where the district court indicates that, regardless of a disputed guideline calculation, it would have imposed the same sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a harmless-error analysis must be applied to avoid \u201cpointless reversals and unnecessary do-overs of sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>tence proceedings.\u201d <em>Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">In this case, the district court explicitly-stated that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the disputed guideline calculation. Moreover, we find that the record indicates that the district court imposed a reasonable sentence after considering the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, any guideline calculation error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm Patrick\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">However, as the government concedes, the district court erroneously attributed $65,000 in the calculation of loss to Patrick, which was contrary to the testimony of the government\u2019s witness at re-sentencing. Thus, we vacate the restitution order and remand to the district court, directing the court to subtract that amount from its restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
