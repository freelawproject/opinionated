Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). Where the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s factual finding that Singh\u2019s asylum application was not timely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that, even assuming credibility, the government rebutted the presumption that it is more likely than not that Singh will suffer future persecution in India through an individualized analysis of changed conditions in India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(A), (ii) (government may rebut presumption in withholding of removal cases by showing a fundamental change in circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b633-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
