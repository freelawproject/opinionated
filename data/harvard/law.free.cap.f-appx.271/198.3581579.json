For the following reasons, we will affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">In early 2005, the federal Defense Commissary Agency (the \u201cGovernment\u201d) issued a \u201crequest for proposal\u201d (\u201cRFP\u201d) seeking bids for a prime contract to install computerized \u201cpoint-of-sale\u201d checkstand equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ment at the approximately 280 military commissaries located in the United States and abroad. IBM, which possessed no prior experience in performing point-of-sale work at military commissaries, wished to submit a bid proposal as a potential prime contractor. IBM sought out Trian-co, which possessed considerable experience in performing point-of-sale work, as a \u201cteam member\u201d to prepare the bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In May 2005, IBM and Trianco entered into a \u201cTeaming Agreement.\u201d Under the Teaming Agreement, IBM was obligated to prepare the bid proposal for the prime contract. Trianco, in turn, was obligated to submit to IBM, prior to submission of the bid proposal, its \u201ceost/priee\u201d and \u201ctechnical\u201d proposals for the subcontract work. The Teaming Agreement further required Trianco to assist in drafting the bid proposal. In addition, the Teaming Agreement required Trianco to collaborate exclusively with IBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The crux of the present litigation is whether the Teaming Agreement required IBM to grant Trianco the subcontract, or whether IBM could grant the subcontract to a more affordable third party. A few provisions of the Teaming Agreement are relevant to our discussion. Several sections support Trianco\u2019s position, including Section 1.3 of the Teaming Agreement, which provides that \u201c[u]pon award to IBM of a prime contract for the [Project], IBM will award a subcontract to [Trianco].\u201d (App. 121.) Next, Section 5.0 of a document entitled \u201cScope of Work,\u201d which was attached to the Teaming Agreement, provides that \u201c[s]ubject to successful contract award from [the Government], IBM shall offer Trianco a Subcontract to support IBM by providing resources to perform under the contract.\u201d (App. 124.) Section 5.0 of the Scope of Work also states that \u201c[i]f Trianco offers competitive pricing, availability of competent resources, and an acceptable plan/strategy to perform the work in these areas, Trianco will have the right of first refusal to perform the work.\u201d (App. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">However, other sections of the Teaming Agreement support IBM\u2019s position that, if the Government awarded IBM the prime contract, IBM and Trianco would then negotiate the terms of a subcontract and, if such negotiations were unfruitful, IBM could award the subcontract to another party. For instance, Section 1.4 of the Teaming Agreement provides that \u201c[a]fter the successful award of a contract to IBM, the parties will in good faith negotiate mutually acceptable terms and conditions of the subcontract.\u201d (App. 121.) Furthermore, Section 5.1(f) of the Teaming Agreement provides that the agreement would terminate if \u201c[t]he parties fail to negotiate and execute a subcontract agreement containing mutually satisfactory prices and terms within a reasonable period after the award of the prime contract to IBM.\u201d (App. 122.) Moreover, Section 5.0 of the Scope of Work states that \u201cTrianco\u2019s support/participation is subject to the ability of the parties to negotiate mutually acceptable terms and conditions and Trianco offering competitive pricing.\u201d (App. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In the spring and summer of 2005, Trianco began preparing the technical plans and proposals responsive to the RFP. Trianco\u2019s work-product contained proprietary business information and reflected its years of experience working on similar proposals. In July 2005, Trianco submitted the proposal, which IBM used to prepare its bid for the prime contract. In addition, Trianco submitted a proposal to IBM for the pricing of the subcontract work. According to Trianco, IBM\u2019s bid proposal, which it submitted to the Government, confirmed that Trianco\u2019s pricing proposal was \u201ccompetitive\u201d and \u201cacceptable.\u201d (App. 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The Government awarded IBM the prime contract on December 30, 2005. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>December 31, 2005, IBM advised Trianco that its pricing proposals for the subcontract work were unacceptable and not competitive. IBM then asked Trianco to \u201crebid\u201d its initial pricing. (App. 106.) Trianco submitted a new bid \u201cunder protest,\u201d which IBM rejected. (App. 107.) IBM then revealed that it had solicited an alternative bid for the subcontract work from a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Trianco then filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Trianco alleged that IBM breached its fiduciary duty to Trianco and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Trianco also asserted claims of unjust enrichment, equitable estoppel, and promissory estoppel. IBM then moved to dismiss Trianco\u2019s complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On December 21, 2006, the District Court granted IBM\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. <em>See Trianco LLC v. Int\u2019l Bus. Mach. Corp., </em>466 F.Supp.2d 600 (E.D.Pa.2006). Trianco now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We have jurisdiction to review this matter under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will review the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Trianco\u2019s complaint <em>de novo. Edgar v. Avaya, Inc., </em>503 F.3d 340, 344 (3d Cir.2007). When reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, we must accept as true all factual allegations asserted in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Trianco. <em>Lum v. Bank of Am., </em>361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2004). In assessing the sufficiency of Trianco\u2019s allegations, we may consider the various documents referenced in the complaint, such as the Teaming Agreement and Scope of Work. <em>See Winer Family Trust v. Queen, </em>503 F.3d 319, 327 (3d Cir.2007). Furthermore, neither party disputes that this matter is governed by New York law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">The first issue before us is whether Trianco\u2019s complaint states a claim for breach of contract. The District Court dismissed Trianco\u2019s breach of contract claim because the Teaming Agreement, it held, was missing an essential term\u2014 namely, Trianco\u2019s price for performing the subcontract. According to the District Court, the Teaming Agreement left the award of the subcontract contingent on future negotiations, and thus, the Teaming Agreement did not require IBM to grant Trianco the subcontract. <em>Trianco, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">It is well-settled under New York law that a contract provision may be rendered an unenforceable \u201cagreement to agree\u201d if the parties left a material term for future negotiations. <em>See Joseph Martin, Jr. Delicatessen, Inc. v. Schumacher, </em>52 N.Y.2d 105, 109, 436 N.Y.S.2d 247, 417 N.E.2d 541 (1981). However, \u201cwhere it is clear from the language of an agreement that the parties intended to be bound and there exists an objective method for supplying a missing term, the court should endeavor to hold the parties to their bargain.\u201d <em>166 Mamaroneck Ave. Corp. v. 151 East Post Rd. Corp., </em>78 N.Y.2d 88, 91, 571 N.Y.S.2d 686, 575 N.E.2d 104 (1991). <em>Martin Delicatessen </em>sets forth two ways the \u201cobjective method\u201d can be identified: (1) where, within the four corners of the agreement, there exists a methodology for ascertaining the missing term; or (2) where the agreement \u201cinvited recourse to an objective, intrinsic event, condition or standard on which the amount was made to depend.\u201d <em>Martin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Delicatessen, </em>52 N.Y.2d at 110, 436 N.Y.S.2d 247, 417 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We find that IBM\u2019s promise to grant Trianco a subcontract, subject to the parties\u2019 future agreement on its terms, conditions, and pricing, is merely an agreement to agree. As such, it is unenforceable under New York law. While the Teaming-Agreement provided that Trianco \u201cwill\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d be awarded a subcontract, a material term of that promise was missing \u2014 namely, the price that IBM would pay Trianco for performing the subcontract. The agreement also contains no method for determining this price. While the Teaming Agreement states that Trian-co will have a right of first refusal to reject the subcontract if it submitted \u201ccompetitive pricing,\u201d the Teaming Agreement also does not define the term \u201ccompetitive\u201d nor does it refer to any extrinsic method for determining whether Trianco\u2019s pricing was, in fact, \u201ccompetitive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We are also not persuaded by Trianco\u2019s assertion that IBM accepted its pricing as competitive when it submitted its bid to the Government. Nothing in the Teaming Agreement states that Trianco\u2019s proposed pricing, when submitted by IBM to the Government, would constitute a definitive or even an approximate basis for determining Trianco\u2019s price.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, while the doctrine of definiteness is not a rigid concept, there must be some objective method for supplying a missing material term. <em>See, e.g., Clifford R. Gray, Inc. v. Le Chase Constr. Servs., LLC, </em>31 A.D.3d 983, 819 N.Y.S.2d 182 (2006) (holding that a subcontractor\u2019s pricing proposals submitted to the prime contractor to secure a bid did not, without more, supply the missing term of the subcontractor\u2019s pricing). No such method existed here. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that the Teaming Agreement, as it relates to Trian-co\u2019s right to receive the subcontract, is unenforceable as a matter of law. Thus, because Trianco had no contractual right to receive the subcontract, the District Court correctly dismissed Trianco\u2019s claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Next, we consider Trianco\u2019s unjust enrichment claim. Unjust enrichment is a \u201cquasi-contract claim\u201d and \u201cis an obligation the law creates in the absence of any agreement.\u201d <em>Goldman v. Metro Life Ins. Co., </em>5 N.Y.3d 561, 572, 807 N.Y.S.2d 583, 841 N.E.2d 742 (2005). The elements of an unjust enrichment claim are: (1) the defendant was enriched; (2) at the expense of the plaintiff; and (3) it would be inequitable to permit the defendant to retain that which is claimed by the plaintiff. <em>Cruz v. McAneney, </em>31 A.D.3d 54, 59, 816 N.Y.S.2d 486 (2006) (quotations omitted). The District Court dismissed Trianco\u2019s unjust enrichment claim on the ground that the Teaming Agreement was enforceable and thus precluded the unjust enrichment claim. <em>Trianco, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 609. However, the District Court did not analyze whether the Teaming Agreement was, in fact, enforceable in its entirety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Above we found that the Teaming Agreement did not bind IBM to grant Trianco the subcontract. However, Section 12.0 of the Teaming Agreement contains a severability clause providing that the unenforceability of any of its provisions does not render the remainder of the agreement unenforceable. (App. 123.) Thus, our holding that IBM\u2019s promise to award Trianco a subcontract is unenforceable does not require us to find the remainder of the Teaming Agreement to be unenforceable. The promise of each party to a bilateral agreement, such as the Teaming Agreement, must be supported by valuable consideration. <em>See, e.g., Curtis Props. Corp. v. Greif Cos., </em>212 A.D.2d 259, 264, 628 N.Y.S.2d 628 (1995) (citing Calamari and Perillo, Contracts \u00a7 70, at 134). As such, a promise obliging only one party to a contract to do something, without receiving any benefit in return, is illusory and creates no enforceable obligation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Here, the Teaming Agreement required Trianco to provide IBM with its proprietary information and industry expertise to assist in preparing the bid. However, without receiving a guaranteed subcontract in return, it appears that Trianco may not have received consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Accordingly, we will remand this matter to the District Court for a determination as to whether the remainder of the Teaming Agreement was valid and, if so, whether Trianco\u2019s complaint states a cause of action for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Next, Trianco challenges the District Court\u2019s dismissal of its breach of fiduciary duty claim. The District Court rejected this claim because the allegations in Trianeo\u2019s complaint described an \u201carms-length\u201d transaction between two parties possessing considerable industry experience. <em>Trianco, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 608. The District Court also held that IBM did not breach its fiduciary duty by awarding the subcontract to a third party because it was merely exercising its rights under the Teaming Agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 608-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Trianco argues that the District Court erred because IBM\u2019s \u201cdominant position\u201d in their relationship, and IBM\u2019s representations and assurances, created a \u201cspecial relationship of trust and confidence\u201d that IBM breached by not awarding the subcontract to Trianco. (App 111.) Trianco also argues that IBM breached its fiduciary duty when it secretly sought cheaper bids on the subcontract, and by using Trianco\u2019s proprietary business information and industry credentials contrary to Trian-co\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">To determine whether a fiduciary relationship exists, \u201cNew York law inquires whether one person has reposed trust or confidence in the integrity and fidelity of another who thereby gains a resulting superiority or influence over the first.\u201d <em>Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Assoc, of Am. v. Wometco Ent., Inc., </em>833 F.Supp. 344, 349-50 (S.D.N.Y.1993). Accordingly, a fiduciary duty exists where one assumes control and responsibility over another, or where one has a duty, created by his undertaking, to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking. <em>See id.; see also Mandelblatt v. Devon Stores, Inc., </em>132 A.D.2d 162, 168, 521 N.Y.S.2d 672 (1987). Fiduciary relationships, though, typically do not arise between parties engaging in arms length business transactions. <em>See EBC I, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., </em>5 N.Y.3d 11, 22, 799 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>N.Y.S.2d 170, 832 N.E.2d 26 (2005); <em>SNS Bank, N.V. v. Citibank, N.A., </em>7 A.D.3d 352, 355, 777 N.Y.S.2d 62 (2004). Absent an allegation of a special relationship, mere assertions of \u201ctrust\u201d in one party are insufficient to support a claim of fiduciary relationship. <em>See Freedman v. Pearlman, </em>271 A.D.2d 301, 305, 706 N.Y.S.2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">We agree with the District Court that this claim was appropriate for dismissal. As the District Court correctly ruled, Trianco\u2019s complaint merely reflects an arms length commercial transaction between two experienced business entities. <em>See Abercrombie v. Andrew Coll, </em>438 F.Supp.2d 243, 274 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (though claims alleging the existence of a fiduciary duty are not normally appropriate for dismissal at the 12(b)(6) stage, \u201cabsent an allegation of a special relationship, mere assertions of trust and confidence are insufficient to support a claim of a fiduciary relationship.\u201d) (quotations omitted); <em>SNS Bank, N.V., </em>7 A.D.3d at 355, 777 N.Y.S.2d 62 (affirming dismissal of breach of fiduciary duty claims where \u201cthe parties merely had an arm\u2019s length business relationship.\u201d). In fact, Ti'ianco concedes in its complaint that it is an \u201cexperienced electrical services contractor\u201d which has been the \u201csole [point-of-sale] site survey, site preparation and checkstand installation contractor (or subcontractor) for all military commissary installations\u201d for the past 20 years. (App. 92.) While Trianco alleges that IBM held a \u201cdominant position\u201d in their relationship, Ti'ianco does not allege that IBM possessed some \u201csuperior expertise or knowledge about some subject and misled plaintiff by false representations concerning that subject,\u201d thereby creating a fiduciary duty. <em>Talansky v. Schulman, </em>2 A.D.3d 355, 360, 770 N.Y.S.2d 48 (2003) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Next, Trianco challenges the District Court\u2019s dismissal of its claim that IBM breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The District Court dismissed this claim because it was \u201cbased on and incorporates the same allegations that the breach of contract claim is based on: that IBM stopped Trianco from getting a subcontract.\u201d <em>Trianco, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 609. We agree. Under New York law, a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must be separate from any breach of contract claim. <em>See Cerberus Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. BancTec, Inc., </em>16 A.D.3d 126, 127, 791 N.Y.S.2d 28 (2005) (\u201cThe claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was properly dismissed as duplicative of the contract claim.\u201d). Here, Trianco\u2019s allegations essentially duplicate the allegations in its breach of contract claim. Accordingly, dismissal was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Trianco also challenges the District Court\u2019s dismissal of its equitable estoppel claim. \u201cEquitable estoppel is defined as \u2018[t]he doctrine by which a person may be precluded by his act or conduct, or silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he otherwise would have had.\u2019 \u201d <em>Besicorp Group v. Enowitz, </em>235 A.D.2d 761, 764, 652 N.Y.S.2d 366 (1997) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 538 (6th ed. 1990)). To state a claim for equitable estoppel, a party must plead: (1) lack of knowledge of the true facts; (2) reasonable reliance on the conduct of the party es-topped; and (3) a prejudicial change in its position. <em>Broadworth Realty Assoc. v. Chock 336 B\u2019way Operating, Inc., </em>168 A.D.2d 299, 301, 562 N.Y.S.2d 630 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Even if IBM concealed its solicitation of a cheaper subcontractor, or failed to advise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Trianco that its pricing was not competitive, the Teaming Agreement nevertheless clearly stated that Trianco would only be awarded the subcontract if, after future negotiations, it was the cheapest bidder. As such, Trianco could not have reasonably relied on any alleged misrepresentation or concealment of fact by IBM that it its pricing was competitive, or that it was guaranteed the subcontract. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that dismissal of this claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Finally, Trianco challenges the District Court\u2019s dismissal of its promissory estoppel claim. The District Court dismissed this claim because Trianco did not allege that IBM made an express promise to award it a subcontract at the prices Trianco proposed. We agree with this conclusion. To state a claim for promissory estoppel, the complaint must allege a \u201cclear and unambiguous promise.\u201d <em>Richbell Info. Servs. v. Jupiter Partners, L.P., </em>309 A.D.2d 288, 304, 765 N.Y.S.2d 575 (2003). Here, Trianco\u2019s claim that IBM clearly and unambiguously promised Trianco a subcontract at a certain price is contradicted by the terms of the Teaming Agreement, which states in no uncertain terms that Trianco\u2019s receipt of a subcontract was subject to future negotiations on price. Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">. The Teaming Agreement contained a choice of law provision stating that New York law would govern its terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">. We note that Section 1.2(e) of the Teaming Agreement states that Trianco\u2019s pricing proposal would constitute the maximum it could be paid if a subcontracting agreement was reached. (App. 121.) This provision falls well short, though, of constituting an objective pricing mechanism. All this provision created was a price ceiling which Trianco could charge IBM. It did not provide any range or method for determining when a price would be considered \"competitive\u201d under the Teaming Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-12\">. The District Court did hold that \"[l]he Teaming Agreement was an enforceable contract to the extent that it bound the parties to negotiate for a subcontract price in good faith after the award of the prime bid.\u201d <em>Trianco, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 609. This holding, though, appears to contradict the District Court\u2019s earlier comment that \"The question of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the bid-preparation phase obligations of the Teaming Agreement are all enforceable \u2014 for example, Trianco's exclusivity agreement \u2014 is not reached by this case.\u201d <em>Trianco, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 607 n. 3. Regardless, as discussed below, the District Court did not discuss whether valid consideration existed for the Teaming Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
