Specifically, he contends the ALJ both improperly rejected the opinion of treating physician Dr. Zabiega and failed to consider the side effects of his medication. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we reverse and remand for reconsideration of both of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">In dismissing Dr. Zabiega\u2019s treating source opinion that Lozano was disabled, the ALJ largely relied on Dr. Barnett\u2019s contrary conclusion that Lozano likely only experienced a \u201cbrief psychotic reaction\u201d and \u201cwould be able to work regularly.\u201d Generally, a non-treating physician\u2019s opinion that is based on independent, objective clinical tests constitutes substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision to give limited weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750-51 (9th Cir.1989). Here, however, the substantial weight attributed by the ALJ to Dr. Barnett\u2019s opinion was unwarranted, as Dr. Barnett\u2019s admittedly \u201cguarded\u201d opinion relied on erroneous information. We therefore remand to allow the ALJ to reconsider the weight to be given to Dr. Zabiega\u2019s report and the opinions of other medical experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">The ALJ did not mention, let alone discount, the extensive evidence that Lozano suffered from fatigue as a side effect of his medication. \u201cThe ALJ must consider <em>all factors </em>that might have a significant impact on an individual\u2019s ability to work.\u201d <em>See Erickson v. Shalala, </em>9 F.3d 813, 817 (9th Cir.1993). Fatigue is a subjective symptom that the ALJ must consider. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1282 (9th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we remand to allow the ALJ to either incorporate fatigue into his residual functional capacity assessment or explicitly explain his reasons for declining to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-18\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
