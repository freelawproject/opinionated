We affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The bankruptcy court imposed both sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review all aspects of an imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A court abuses its discretion in imposing sanctions where its determination that a filing is frivolous is based on \u201ca materially incorrect view of the relevant law\u201d or clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 110 S.Ct. 2447. A filing is frivolous if it is \u201cboth baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Holman Consulting Corp., </em>929 F.2d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc). Attorney conduct is measured objectively against a reasonableness standard of the conduct of a \u201ccompetent attorney admitted to practice before the involved court.\u201d <em>Valley Nat\u2019l Bank v. Needler (In re Grantham Bros.), </em>922 F.2d 1438, 1441 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">A. Monetary Sanctions Imposed for the Adversary Proceeding Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">First, we address <em>Smyth v. City of Oakland, </em>05-16407 \u2014 Smyth\u2019s appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s imposition of monetary sanctions based on the Adversary Proceeding Complaint Smyth filed on Brooks\u2019 behalf in bankruptcy court. Smyth contends the claims in the Adversary Proceeding Complaint were not frivolous because they were not barred by either issue or claim preclusion, and his \u201cOne Action Claim\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>was not a frivolous legal argument. We agree the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions based on its conclusion the claims were barred by issue and claim preclusion, because its conclusion these arguments were frivolous was based on a materially incorrect view of preclusion law. We hold the district court did not abuse its discretion, however, in imposing sanctions based on the One Action Claim, because its conclusion the claim was frivolous was based on a correct view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">1. The Statutory Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In the Adversary Proceeding Complaint, Smyth contended that Oakland\u2019s liens on Brooks\u2019 property were illegal because the liens violated federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) rules (the \u201cStatutory Claim\u201d). The alleged violation of HUD rules also formed the factual basis for Brooks\u2019 tort claims against Oakland filed in federal district court, which the district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The bankruptcy court concluded issue preclusion barred re-litigation of the Statutory Claim based on the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brooks\u2019 federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">A dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not a final judgment on the merits, Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), but such dismissal does preclude re-litigation of the jurisdictional issue there presented, in a subsequent action. <em>Kendall v. Overseas Dev. Corp., </em>700 F.2d 586, 538, 538 n. 1 (9th Cir.1983). The bankruptcy court erred, however, in concluding the district court\u2019s finding of lack of subject matter jurisdiction adjudicated the merits of the Statutory Claim. The district court never reached the question whether Oakland\u2019s alleged violations of HUD regulations could provide an affirmative defense to enforcement of the liens. Rather, the district court held the HUD regulations created no private right of action, so there simply was no federal question jurisdiction over the tort claims arising out of the alleged violation of HUD regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Accordingly, the dismissal might not have resolved the question whether Oakland\u2019s alleged violation of HUD regulations could provide a defense to enforcement of the liens. Therefore, it was not frivolous to argue that the Statutory Claim was not barred by issue preclusion, and the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions for this claim based on its materially incorrect view of preclusion law.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">2. The Breach of Contract Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Smyth also sought declaratory relief in the Adversary Proceeding Complaint: that Brooks owed Oakland no money and Oakland\u2019s liens were invalid, based on Oakland\u2019s alleged breach of its contracts with Brooks and HUD by failing to disburse all loan money promised him (the \u201cBreach of Contract\u201d claim). Previously, Smyth filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint to Oakland\u2019s complaint against Brooks in California state court \u2014 to which the court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend for failure to state a claim \u2014 making nearly identical allegations. Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court erred in concluding Smyth\u2019s Breach of Contract claim in the Adversary Proceeding Complaint was frivolous because it was barred by claim preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">In state court, Oakland demurred on two grounds: (1) a violation of the relevant statute of limitations; and (2) failure to state a claim. The state court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer stated only it was for \u201cfailure to state a claim.\u201d Under California law, however, a general demurrer for \u201cfailure to state a claim\u201d also lies when a cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Kendrick v. City of Eureka, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 364, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 153, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>155 (2000). Although California law requires the trial court to specify the ground upon which a demurrer is sustained, Cal. Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 472d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court failed to do so. There is no rule in California that failing to specify the grounds upon which a general demurrer is sustained necessarily means the demurrer was sustained on all grounds noticed. Thus, it is possible the demurrer was sustained on only the statute of limitations ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Under California law, a dismissal based on statute of limitations is not considered a judgment on the merits for claim-preclusion purposes and does not bar re-litigation of that claim, <em>Koch v. Rodlin Enter., Inc., </em>223 Cal.App.3d 1591, 273 Cal.Rptr. 438, 441 (1990), but does bar re-litigation of the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Therefore, Smyth\u2019s assertion of the Breach of Contract claim in a second proceeding is not barred by claim preclusion if he could plead it to avoid the statute of limitations problem. Here, it was not frivolous for Smyth to attempt to plead the claim to avoid the statute of limitations problem. Under California law, a claim barred by statute of limitations can be asserted defensively. <em>Styne v. Stevens, </em>26 Cal.4th 42, 109 Cal.Rptr .2d 14, 26 P.3d 343, 347 (2001). Brooks alleged the Breach of Contract claim in seeking a declaration Oakland\u2019s liens were invalid and he owed Oakland no money, an action that could possibly be considered defensive to Oakland\u2019s proof of claim. <em>See, e.g., Coxson v. Commonwealth Mortgage Co. of Am. (Matter of Coxson), </em>43 F.3d 189, 194 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, the bankruptcy court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for the Breach of Contract claim was an abuse of discretion because it was based on a materially incorrect view of preclusion law.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">3. The One Action Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion, however, in concluding Smyth\u2019s One Action Claim \u2014 that Oakland\u2019s liens on Brooks\u2019 real property were extinguished when Oakland obtained a writ of possession on Brooks\u2019 personal property\u2014 was a frivolous legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">California\u2019s one action rule is an election of remedies statute. It requires a creditor seeking recovery of a debt secured by property to do so by foreclosing on the security; if a creditor chooses another form of action (remedy) for the recovery of the debt, for example by seeking a personal judgment against the debtor, the creditor waives his security interest in the property. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 726(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, if a creditor pursues a remedy inconsistent with foreclosure on the security, he has elected his remedy and is precluded from later seeking foreclosure of the secured property. <em>See Walker v. Cmty. Bank, </em>10 Cal.3d 729, 111 Cal.Rptr. 897, 518 P.2d 329, 331, 337 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">One of Oakland\u2019s loans to Brooks was secured by both Brooks\u2019 warehouse and its contents. In addition to initiating nonjudicial foreclosure on the warehouse, Oakland filed a complaint in California state court and obtained a writ of possession for the contents of Brooks\u2019 warehouse. A writ of possession is obtained through the provisional remedy of \u201cclaim and delivery,\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>which a party claiming the right of possession of property may obtain temporary possession, before a final judgment on title and possession is rendered. 6 Witkin, <em>Cal. Procedure, Provisional Remedies </em>\u00a7 247 (4th ed. 1997). Smyth claimed that Oakland, by obtaining a writ of possession for the warehouse contents, waived its security interest in the warehouse itself by operation of the one action rule \u2014 even though Oakland never enforced the writ and ultimately dismissed its complaint against Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in concluding Smyth\u2019s One Action Claim was frivolous, <em>ie., </em>\u201cboth baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>929 F.2d at 1362. The bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion the claim was baseless was not predicated on an incorrect view of the one action rule. The court correctly observed the one action rule applies where a creditor pursues an action to recover the underlying debt owed that is inconsistent with the remedy of foreclosure on its security; it has never been applied to actions in which the creditor merely acts \u201cin aid of its security interest.\u201d By obtaining a writ of possession Oakland sought temporarily to protect its security from Brooks taking action to sell or devalue it \u2014 a move entirely consistent with the one action rule\u2019s requirement that Oakland recover its debt by foreclosing on its security.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Moreover, a reasonable and competent inquiry would have revealed that as early as 1900, the California Supreme Court rejected the argument that an action to determine the right of possession of personalty to perfect a security interest in that security could trigger the one action rule. <em>Harper v. Gordon, </em>128 Cal. 489, 61 P. 84 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">In <em>Harper, </em>a mortgagor defaulted on a debt secured by a chattel mortgage; the mortgagee first brought a foreclosure action which was later dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 85. The mortgagee then brought an action for claim and delivery on the security seeking to gain possession of it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for non-suit based on defendant\u2019s claim the one action rule prevented the plaintiff-mortgagee from taking a second action to recover the debt through the claim and delivery suit. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of California reversed, holding the claim and delivery action was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">clearly not to recover the debt, nor do we think it an action \u201cfor the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage,\u201d in the sense intended by the [one action rule] restricting the action, upon a debt secured by mortgage, to foreclosure. The action of replevin determines only the right of possession.... The interest of the mortgagee is not enlarged or affected by the fact that he is in possession under the mortgage; he takes possession for the purpose of increasing his security, and whether he does this by the voluntary act of the mortgagor, or by action upon condition broken, the debt remains unpaid and the title still remains in the mortgagor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Finally, Oakland initiated only a claim of possession; it never executed the writ of possession and later voluntarily dismissed the action for possession against Brooks before a final judgment of possession was rendered. <em>See Buchanan v. Cal. Bank &amp; Trust (In re Buchanan), </em>303 B.R. 199, 200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(Bankr.N.D.Cal.2003) (\u201cthe mere filing of a lawsuit seeking recovery of money does not result in forfeiture of the creditor\u2019s security rights\u201d). The bankruptcy court was within its discretion in imposing sanctions on Smyth based on its conclusion this was a frivolous claim under the one action rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">4. Improper Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The bankruptcy court also found Smyth filed the Adversary Proceeding Complaint for an improper purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Improper purpose is determined by an objective standard, and a \u201ccourt confronted with solid evidence of a pleading\u2019s frivolousness may <em>in circumstances that warmnt it </em>infer that it was filed for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>929 F.2d at 1365 (emphasis added). The bankruptcy court held the Adversary Proceeding Complaint was filed for an improper purpose because it could conceive of no purpose for its filing. This holding, however, was based in part on its erroneous conclusion the Statutory and Breach of Contract claims were frivolous. Accordingly, we remand to the bankruptcy court to determine whether the circumstances warranted an inference the One Action Claim was filed for an improper purpose, given our holding \u2014 not known at the time of filing \u2014 the Statutory and Breach of Contract claims were not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Remand is also necessary for the bankruptcy court to determine the amount of sanctions warranted for filing only the frivolous One Action Claim. <em>Townsend, </em>929 F.2d at 1367 (\u201cbecause the district court erroneously believed that it had two reasons to sanction Wright and not just one, we must remand so that the court can consider whether the amount of its award was too high for the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">B. Suspension for Proof of Claim Objection</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Next, we address <em>Smyth v. United States Bankruptcy Court, </em>05-16409\u2014 Smyth\u2019s appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s imposition of a six-month suspension from practice in the bankruptcy court based on Smyth\u2019s filing of a frivolous proof of claim objection on Brooks\u2019 behalf. We hold the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions based on its determination the Proof of Claim Objection was frivolous. We vacate and remand, however, because the court\u2019s determination a suspension was necessary was based, in part, on its imposition of the $10,671 sanction for the Adversary Proceeding Complaint, which we have reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Smyth objected to Oakland\u2019s proof of claim on two bases: (1) although Oakland\u2019s claim was secured, the Chapter 13 Plan did not provide for the payment of any secured claims; accordingly, Oakland\u2019s claim could not be paid; and (2) Oakland\u2019s claim could not be paid as unsecured because Oakland had not filed an unsecured claim. The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in holding the Proof of Claim Objection was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">First, although the Chapter 13 Plan did not explicitly refer to Oakland\u2019s claim as secured, the Plan specifically provided for payment of Oakland\u2019s claim through the sale or refinancing of Brooks\u2019 real property. Moreover, Oakland was scheduled as a secured creditor in Brooks\u2019 Chapter 13 petition. The bankruptcy court correctly held there is no requirement a plan expressly refer to a claim as secured for a secured creditor to be paid. Oakland filed a timely proof of claim, and the plan pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>vides for Oakland\u2019s claim to be paid; accordingly, Oakland was entitled to payment under the plan. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(c) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in the plan or in the order confirming the plan, the trustee shall make payments to creditors under the plan.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Smyth relied on a footnote in <em>In re Avery, </em>272 B.R. 718, 723 n. 5 (Bankr. E.D.Cal.2002) which states: \u201cif the plan fails to provide for a secured or priority claim, the claim will not be paid even if the creditor files a proof of claim.\u201d The <em>Avery </em>court, however, was referring to a plan\u2019s failure to provide for a claim at all and thus is inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Smyth also relied on <em>Avery </em>in his second contention that Oakland could not be paid as an unsecured creditor because it had not filed an unsecured claim. There was no need for Oakland to file an unsecured claim, however, because it filed a secured claim. Nothing in <em>Avery </em>supports Smyth\u2019s contention Oakland would also have to file an unsecured claim. <em>Avery\u2019s </em>statement that a creditor cannot be paid through a chapter 13 plan unless it files a proof of claim is inapplicable; Oakland <em>did </em>file a proof of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The bankruptcy court was within its discretion in determining no \u201ccompetent attorney admitted to practice\u201d before it would make such an argument, <em>In re Grantham Bros., </em>922 F.2d at 1441, and did not abuse its discretion in determining Smyth\u2019s Proof of Claim Objections were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Smyth makes a series of arguments the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in imposing a sanction, all of which fail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions where it did not make a finding of bad faith; there is no requirement a court find bad faith to impose sanctions under Rule 9011. <em>Yagman v. Republic Ins., </em>987 F.2d 622, 628 (9th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Smyth\u2019s contention the order to show cause issued by the bankruptcy court failed to give him notice of the charges against him fails. The order to show cause explained in detail the conduct for which the court was considering imposing sanctions. The case upon which Smyth relies, <em>Nuwesra v. Merrill Lynch, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 87 (2d Cir.1999), actually supports this conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 92-93 (holding district court orders failed to give adequate notice where the orders failed to list the conduct alleged to be sanctionable).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Further, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by improperly considering Smyth\u2019s prior misconduct in determining whether to sanction him. It is apparent on the face of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision that the court considered Smyth\u2019s past misconduct only in determining the appropriate sanction to impose, not whether to impose a sanction at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">In No. 05-16407, the bankruptcy court\u2019s imposition of sanctions is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The amount of the sanctions award, $10,671, is vacated and remanded for the bankruptcy court to determine whether the One Action Claim was filed for an improper purpose, and for a redetermination of the amount of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">In No. 05-16409, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order imposing a six-month suspension is vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

R. Bankr.P. 9011(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b680-17\">. \"Because [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11] and Bankruptcy Rule 9011 use virtually identical language, we often rely on cases interpreting the former when construing the latter.\u201d <em>Marsch v.
