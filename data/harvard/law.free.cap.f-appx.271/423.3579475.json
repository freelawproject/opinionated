The court disbarred Bello pursuant to N.D. Tex.R. 83.8(b)(2) \u2014 (4), after finding that Bello\u2019s actions in his representation of his client in Cause No. 4:04-CV-246-Y and in other cases evinced a failure to comply with court orders, unethical behavior, and an inability to conduct proper litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">On appeal, Bello contends that the order disbarring him violated unspecified First Amendment protections. A federal court has the inherent authority \u201cto control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it.\u201d <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 82, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Bello has not established that Supreme Court case law addressing an attorney\u2019s First Amendment rights are applicable in the instant ease. <em>See, Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>486 U.S. 466, 472, 108 S.Ct. 1916, 100 L.Ed.2d 475 (1988). Bello\u2019s assertions of judicial bias are frivolous. <em>See Litcky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">Bello also asserts that the district court deprived him of due process. Because he received notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond, he received the process to which he was entitled. <em>See NASCO, Inc. v. Calcasieu Television and Radio, Inc., </em>894 F.2d 696, 707 (5th Cir.1990). Bello\u2019s contention that he was denied equal protection is meritless. <em>See Thompson v. Patteson, </em>985 F.2d 202, 207 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to disbar Bello is supported by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence sufficient to establish \u201cone or more violations warranting this extreme sanction.\u201d <em>In re Medrano, </em>956 F.2d 101, 102 (5th Cir.1992). As a result, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
