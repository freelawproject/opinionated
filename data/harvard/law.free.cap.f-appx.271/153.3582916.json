On appeal, McFadden challenges: (1) the constitutionality of the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) are to be regarded as advisory; (2) the computation of criminal history points that determine his Criminal History Category; and (3) the disparity between sentences recommended for offenses involving crack cocaine and those recommended for offenses involving powder cocaine. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">On April 25, 2006, although he had no plea agreement with the government, McFadden pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, contrary to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A), and in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The District Court accepted his guilty plea after an extensive plea colloquy, finding that McFadden had knowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights, and that the plea hearing satisfied the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">Although McFadden was considered a career offender under the Guidelines, the District Court granted his motion for downward departure and lowered his Criminal History Category from VI to V, determining that the applicable standard overstated McFadden\u2019s criminal record. The District Court also reduced McFad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>den\u2019s Total Offense Level from 84 to 31 for acceptance of responsibility. Based on these factors, McFadden\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 168 to 210 months. The District Court ultimately imposed a sentence of 168 months imprisonment. McFadden then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">McFadden\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no non-frivolous issues for review and requesting permission to withdraw as counsel. In response, McFadden submitted a <em>pro se </em>brief in which he raises three arguments in support of his appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Under <em>Anders v. California, </em>\u201cif counsel finds his [client\u2019s] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. \u201cThat request must ... be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review verifies that counsel for McFadden has satisfied the <em>Anders </em>requirements. We nevertheless discuss the arguments raised by McFadden in his <em>pro se </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">First, McFadden challenges the constitutionality of the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial ruling in <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, which effectively rendered the Guidelines advisory. Obviously, however, we are in no position to reverse the Supreme Court. \u201cThe reality is ... the same Court to strike down the judge-based, mandatory Guidelines system as unconstitutional also issued the remedy: a judge-based, advisory Guidelines scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 578 n. 23 (3d Cir.2007). In short, \u201cit cannot be unconstitutional under current doctrine for a sentencing judge to do exactly what the Supreme Court has instructed be done.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Second, McFadden asserts that, even though the District Court lowered his Criminal History Category from a VI to a V, his criminal history score remains overstated. Though McFadden disagrees with its conclusion, the District Court engaged in a thorough consideration of his prior felony offenses and even granted his request for downward departure. Its decision was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Finally, McFadden argues that he is entitled to re-sentencing under <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir. 2006), where this Court held that the District Court has the discretion to impose a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range for a crack cocaine offense if the District Court concludes that the higher penalties imposed for crack cocaine offenses versus powder cocaine offenses would not serve the goals of sentencing in a particular case. However, as we stated in <em>Gunter, </em>\u201c[t]he limited holding here is that district courts <em>may </em>consider the craek/powder cocaine differential in the Guidelines as a [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] factor, but not a mandate, in the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing process.\u201d 462 F.3d at 249 (emphasis added); <em>see also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that the trial judge may consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity in determining whether, \u201cin the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to serve the objectives of sentencing\u201d) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Here, the District Court gave careful consideration to all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and, in doing so, determined that the application of the harsher standard for crack cocaine offenses was appropriate in McFadden\u2019s case. Again, its determination was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">McFadden\u2019s counsel was correct in concluding that there are no non-frivolous bases for appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we will grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, and we will affirm the judgment of sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">. This Court reviews the calculations and application of the Guidelines by the District Court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Ali, </em>508 F.3d 136, 141 (3d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738). We exercise plenary review over McFadden\u2019s constitutional challenge to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Booker. Cf. United States v. Randolph, </em>364 F.3d 118, 121 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cWe apply a plenary standard of review to issues of statutory interpretation, and to questions regarding a statute\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-16\">. Pursuant to 3d Cir. L.A.R. 109.2 (2002), we find that counsel is not obligated to file a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-17\">. Our decision is rendered without prejudice to any right McFadden may have to pursue a reduced sentence in the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which sets forth the Sentencing Commission's policy statement adopting Amendment 706's reduction by two levels the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217-18 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
