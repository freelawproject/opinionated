Jan. 27, 2006), <em>affg </em>No.77 308 954 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Aug. 10, 2005). On appeal, Wu argues that (1) the BIA erred in holding that Wu did not qualify for an exception to the timeliness requirement because she had not shown changed circumstances arising in her country of nationality under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); and (2) that the BIA\u2019s decision deprived her of due process of the laws because she was ordered removed <em>in absentia. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Where the BIA decision adopts the reasoning of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34 (quoting <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">As we have previously noted, the birth of additional children constitutes a change of personal circumstances and does not establish changed country conditions required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). <em>See Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, the IJ and BIA properly concluded that the evidence petitioner submitted of enforcement of the family planning policies does not establish changed country conditions. <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir.2007). We, therefore, conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s order denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">We also conclude that Wu\u2019s due process claim is without merit. The record reflects that Wu was given a \u201cfull and fair\u201d opportunity to present her claims at a scheduled hearing, <em>see Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). Wu failed to attend that hearing or otherwise explain her absence. Because Wu was afforded all of the process due, we conclude that her due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED and the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
