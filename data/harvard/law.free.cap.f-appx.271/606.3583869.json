We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The agency properly determined that Ramiro-Murillo\u2019s actions constitute alien smuggling as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). According to the three 1-213 forms submitted in this case, Ramiro-Murillo arranged for his sister and niece to attempt to enter the United States in violation of law, thereby \u201cprovid[ing] some form of affirmative assistance to the illegally entering alien.\u201d <em>Altamirano, </em>427 F.3d at 592; <em>see also Hernandez-Guadarrama v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 674, 679 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cAn individual may knowingly encourage, induce, assist, abet, or aid with illegal entry, even if he did not personally hire the smuggler and even if he is not present at the point of illegal entry.\u201d). The agency was entitled to credit the I-213 forms and the two border officers\u2019 testimony over Ramiro-Murillo\u2019s testimony. <em>See Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe burden of establishing a basis for exclusion of evidence from a government record falls on the opponent of the evidence, who must come forward with enough negative factors to persuade the court not to admit it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Moreover, even if the questioning at issue violated <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the evidence obtained is not excludable from deportation hearings on that basis. <em>See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1050, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984) (holding that the exclusionary rule does not apply in civil deportation hearings); <em>Trias-Hernandez v. INS, </em>528 F.2d 366, 368-69 (9th Cir.1975) (rejecting the argument that a form 1-213 taken without <em>Miranda </em>warnings is inadmissible). Nor was Ramiro-Murillo\u2019s right to counsel violated when he was questioned by the officers. <em>See Trias-Hernandez, </em>528 F.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
