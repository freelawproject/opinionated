In the motion, he sought to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture following the denial of his application for cancellation of removal. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">Galindez Martinez contends that his motion to reopen was timely because there is no time limit for motions to reopen that seek relief under CAT and because he only recently became aware of government-sponsored torture in Mexico. Galindez Martinez filed his motion to reopen outside the ninety-day time limit set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). <em>Cf. Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1099 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.2000) (discussing exception to time limit for CAT applicants ordered removed before March 22, 1999). In addition, he failed to present material evidence of changed country conditions that was not available and could not have been presented at the previous proceeding. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1131-32 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">Galindez Martinez also contends that he established a prima facie case of eligibility for relief under CAT. The generalized evidence attached to his motion did not meet this standard. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that CAT applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to his native country); <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that motion to reopen must establish prima facie case demonstrating reasonable likelihood that requirements for relief have been satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
