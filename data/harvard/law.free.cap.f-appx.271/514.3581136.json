Because Thiel did not become disabled \u201cas a direct result\u201d of the accident \u201cand from no other cause,\u201d as the terms of the policy require, the district court correctly upheld the insurer\u2019s denial of benefits. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In 1967, Charles Thiel began working for a company now known as Avaya, Inc. Thiel participated in the Avaya Inc. Business Travel Accident Benefit Plan. (\u201cthe Plan\u201d), an accident-only policy insured by the Life Insurance Company of North America (\u201cthe insurer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">On August 6, 2002, while Thiel was in Chicago on a business trip, a hit-and-run driver struck him from behind as he attempted to cross the street. He filed a claim for accident-only disability benefits with Avaya, claiming he was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d under the policy. The insurer denied benefits because Thiel\u2019s disability was \u201cprimarily the result of his pre-existing degenerative [lumbar] disc disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Thiel filed this ERISA action against Avaya, the Plan and the insurer. The parties filed cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record. After dismissing Avaya and the Plan from the case, the district court entered judgment in favor of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">We need not enter the thicket created by the parties\u2019 debate over whether de novo review or arbitrary-and-capricious review governs this claim. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). Thiel\u2019s claim fails under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The policy provides benefits if a claimant is injured by a qualifying accident and \u201cbecomes totally disabled <em>as a direct result, and from no other cause, </em>within 365 days after the accident.\u201d (emphasis added). According to the insurer, this language means that, whenever a pre-existing condition played any role, no matter how small, in causing the disability, no coverage exists. <em>See Pirkheim v. First Unum Life Ins., </em>229 F.3d 1008, 1010-11 (10th Cir. 2000) (enforcing policy language requiring that the \u201closs must result directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injury\u201d and denying benefits where the insured\u2019s death \u201cdid not occur independent of all other causes\u201d) (emphasis omitted). According to Thiel, this language means that a claimant with a pre-existing condition may recover benefits unless the pre-existing condition \u201csubstantially contributed to\u201d the disability. <em>Tolley v. Commercial Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 92-6490, 1993 WL 524284, at *3 (6th Cir. Dec. 17, 1993) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Medford v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>No. 95-35163, 1996 WL 405055, at *3 (9th Cir. July 18, 1996); <em>Dixon v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>389 F.3d 1179, 1184 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Adkins v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>917 F.2d 794, 797 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">We need not take sides on this debate either. Even under the more lenient construction of this language, the one favoring Thiel, he cannot shake free from the record-compelled conclusion that his pre-acci-dent back problems \u201csubstantially contributed to\u201d his disability. The undisputed medical evidence, to begin with, confirms that Thiel had serious back problems before the accident. Doctors performed two lumbar laminectomies on Thiel at the L4-L5 level \u2014 one in 1986 and one in 1995. By 2002, the year of the accident and sixteen years after his first surgery, Thiel\u2019s back pain remained a serious problem. Just four months before the accident, an MRI showed \u201csevere degeneration of the L4-5 disc space,\u201d as well as \u201c[e]omponents of lumbar stenosis\u201d at L3-L4 and L5-S1. Three months before the accident, Dr. Si-dhu noted \u201cback pain in the lower back [and] radiation to the right buttock, thigh and leg\u201d that had been ongoing \u201cfor the past 1-1/2 years,\u201d as well as \u201closs of disk height at L4-5\u201d at a \u201clevel [that was] almost bone on bone.\u201d Sidhu recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>mended physical therapy and a series of epidural injections, and he prescribed pain medications. A little over two months before the accident, Dr. Macon diagnosed Thiel with \u201clumbar radiculopathy\u201d and noted that he had \u201c[sjensory decreased sensation [in the] right lower extremity [at] the L4-L5 distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">While the accident may have affected the degree of Thiel\u2019s physical ailments, it did not affect their kind. An EMG from August 28, 2002, three weeks after the accident, \u201cdemonstrat[ed] some chronic features of low grade S 1 radiculopathy and more subacute, but still low grade [r]ight sided L4-L5 radiculopathic features.\u201d In describing the condition as \u201cchronic,\u201d Dr. Giancarlo conveyed that it was an ongoing, not an accident-induced, problem, <em>see </em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 79120 (27th ed. 2000), and indeed the record shows that Thiel had suffered from lumbar radiculopathy since at least May 2002. In September, an MRI showed \u201cevidence of degenerative disc disease with mild bulging disc\u201d at L4-L5 and \u201cminimal bulging discs at L5-S1 and L3-L4 disc space levels\u201d but no \u201cevidence of recurrent or residual herniated disc.\u201d Before his accident, Thiel likewise had experienced disc degeneration at L4-L5 and likewise showed no signs of a herniated disc. In January 2003, a radiology examination revealed \u201cevidence suggestive of a small central disk herniation at L5-S1\u201d and \u201cpostoperative changes related to laminectomy surgery at the L4-L5 level,\u201d including \u201cextensive hypertrophic spurring of the facet joints bilaterally at L4-L5.\u201d The January 2003 examination thus connects his disability in part to spurring \u201crelated to\u201d his prior laminectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The physicians\u2019 post-accident opinions either show that Thiel\u2019s pre-existing back problem substantially contributed to his disability or are consistent with that conclusion. No physician took a contrary view, and one physician concluded that factors unrelated to the accident contributed at least 60 percent to the disability. In December 2002, Sidhu said that he \u201cd[id] not believe [Thiel was] able to work at all\u201d \u201c[b]ecause of [his current] symptomatology and his history of previous surgery.\u201d In April 2003, Thiel\u2019s chiropractor concluded that his \u201cmaximum capacity\u201d to perform basic functions was \u201champered by his spinal injuries\u201d without specifying the cause of those injuries. And in May 2004, after reviewing Thiel\u2019s file at the request of the insurer, Dr. Nakkache, a neurosurgeon, opined that \u201cat the very most [Thiel] suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing condition and as such, no more than 40% disability can be afforded as a result of the injury on August 6, 2002.\u201d No other physician gave an opinion on the degree to which the accident contributed to Thiel\u2019s disability, and no physician\u2019s findings contradict Nakkache\u2019s estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Thiel maintains that his disability \u201cdirect[ly] resulted]\u201d from the accident, \u201cand from no other cause,\u201d because his medical records show herniation and bulging only <em>after </em>the accident. That just shows, however, that Thiel\u2019s back problems may have worsened after the accident; it does not contradict the evidence that his serious pre-existing conditions \u201csubstantially contributed to\u201d his disabling back problems. It also remains unclear whether the disc herniation stemmed from the accident or represented a gradual progression of Thiel\u2019s pre-existing back problems, given that medical records before the accident (in May 2002) and shortly after the accident (in September 2002) showed no signs of herniation and that the first sign of herniation did not occur until four months after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Thiel adds that the insurer should have sought an independent medical examination and that we should discount Nak-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>kache\u2019s opinion because he never examined Thiel. \u201c[FJailure to conduct a physical examination ... may, in some cases, raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination.\u201d <em>Calvert v. Firstar Fin., Inc., </em>409 F.3d 286, 295 (6th Cir.2005). But that is not true here. Nakkache reviewed the relevant materials and relied on clinical tests and on physician opinions. <em>Cf. Kalish v. Liberty Mut/Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston, </em>419 F.3d 501, 510 (6th Cir.2005). Objective medical evidence supports his conclusion. <em>Cf. Calvert, </em>409 F.3d at 297. And his opinion did not contradict the opinion of Sidhu or of any other treating physician. <em>Cf. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Nor does the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cdisability\u201d or the fact that Thiel has qualified for disability benefits with the Social Security Administration change matters. The insurer does not dispute that Thiel was disabled, and it does not dispute that the policy provides a functional definition of disability. The question is what <em>caused </em>Thiel\u2019s current disability and to what degree. And the problem for Thiel is that none of these definitions of disability (and for that matter none of the opinions of Thiel\u2019s treating physicians) shows that his pre-existing back problems did not substantially contribute to his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Invoking our decision in <em>Tolley, </em>Thiel argues that, because he could work before the accident, but not after it, the accident must have caused his current disability. 1993 WL 524284, at *4. But in <em>Tolley, </em>there was no indication that the plaintiff suffered from any symptoms in the year and a half leading up to his disabling injury or that his condition \u201cmaterially impaired [his] health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, there is abundant evidence that Thiel received ongoing treatment for serious back problems in the months leading up to the accident \u2014 problems that were similar in kind to his post-accident conditions. Thiel\u2019s pre-accident conditions, in short, substantially contributed to his current disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The parties also debate our authority to resolve Thiel\u2019s appeal with respect to the Plan. Because counsel for Thiel sensibly acknowledged at oral argument that he did not wish to press this issue in the event we affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling as to the insurer, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
