We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s credibility and factual findings, and we deny the petition for review. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Singh\u2019s testimony lacked specificity and because he lacked knowledge regarding the leaders, members and structure of the Akali Dal Mann party. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Vera-Villegas v. INS, </em>330 F.3d 1222, 1232 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the adverse credibility finding because of the material inconsistencies regarding the number of rallies and demonstrations he attended. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938, 940 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Without credible testimony, Singh failed to carry the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. See <em>Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">Because Singh failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to India, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
