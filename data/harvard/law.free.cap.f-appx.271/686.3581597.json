We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s good moral character determination, <em>Ramos v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir.2001), and de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Madueno-Gonzalez provided false testimony for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit, thereby rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal for lacking the requisite good moral character. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(6); <em>see also, Ramos, </em>246 F.3d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Contrary to Madueno-Gonzalez\u2019s contention, the IJ did not violate his due process rights by admitting the 1-213 record of deportable/inadmissible alien, which documented his attempt to enter the United States by misrepresenting his identity and immigration status and which was supported by the preparing officer\u2019s testimony. <em>See Cuevas-Ortega v. INS, </em>588 F.2d 1274, 1278 (9th Cir.1979) (no due process violation because \u201cthe bare assertion that a statement is involuntary is insufficient\u201d to prove coercion); <em>see also Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe burden of establishing a basis for exclusion of evidence from a government record falls on the opponent of the evidence, who must come forward with enough negative factors to persuade the court not to admit it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
