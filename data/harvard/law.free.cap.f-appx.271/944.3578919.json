Altman, a former federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.CivF. 60(b)(4) motion for relief from his criminal judgment. Altman was sentenced to 87 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release for knowingly transporting and shipping child pornography in interstate and foreign commerce by computer. On appeal, Altman argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>term \u201cvisual depictions,\u201d as used in his statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(l), is unconstitutionally ambiguous because it can refer to both pornography that illegally shows actual children and pornography that permissibly uses images that only appear to be children. Alternatively, he argues that if relief is not available under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), this Court should address the merits of his claim under the plain error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We generally review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). However, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a judgment as void. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Rule 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding ... [if] the judgment is void.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). However, Rule 60(b) does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case. <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). In some limited circumstances, Rule 60(b) can provide relief from an earlier denial of a \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 533-36, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2648-50, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). In other circumstances, a Rule 60(b) motion is treated as a second or successive habeas corpus petition, and is therefore subject to the procedural requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). <em>See Felker v. Turpin, </em>101 F.3d 657, 661 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Altman\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to void his criminal judgment because such relief is not available under Rule 60(b). Construing the motion as a successive habeas petition does not afford Altman relief either.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Altman filed his Rule 60(b) motion after the denial of his \u00a7 2255 petition. Altman\u2019s subsequent motion for a certificate of appealability was also denied. Therefore, Altman has not fulfilled the procedural requirements necessary for a successive habeas petition to proceed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) (2006); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (affirming district court denial of a Rule 60(b) motion construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion when the defendant had not received authorization to file a successive habeas petition). Finally, because a Rule 60(b) motion is not the proper motion by which to attack a criminal judgment, we decline to address the merits of Altman\u2019s claim under the plain error standard of review. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\">. We note that Altman was released from prison while this appeal was pending. Altman is currently under supervised release, which would likely meet the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement of \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>117 F.3d 471, 475 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
