The district court sentenced him to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Defendant\u2019s counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, arguing that there are no legally viable issues for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The government has declined to file a response. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-19\">After Defendant pled guilty, the presen-tence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined that Defendant\u2019s base offense level was eight. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Defendant received a sixteen-level enhancement because of a previous conviction for a drug trafficking offense. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He also received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, which resulted in a total offense level of twenty-one. In addition, because Defendant\u2019s prior conviction had resulted in a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment, the PSR assessed him three criminal history points. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(a). This produced a criminal history category of II, which, when combined with Defendant\u2019s total offense level of twenty-one, resulted in a Guidelines range of forty-one to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">Defendant\u2019s court-appointed counsel, Noel Orquiz, filed a Sentencing Memorandum with the district court, agreeing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the PSR\u2019s calculations under the Guidelines but nonetheless requesting a variance under the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Mr. Orquiz explained that Defendant\u2019s prior conviction had occurred almost thirteen years earlier, when Defendant was only nineteen years old. Mr. Orquiz argued, therefore, that the Guidelines range was \u201cunreasonably harsh and greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of Section 3553.\u201d Sentencing Memorandum, Doe. 14, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court agreed with Mr. Orquiz and granted Defendant a downward variance from the Guidelines range. The court sentenced Defendant to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">I have reviewed the Presentence Report factual findings. I have considered the sentencing guideline applications and the factors under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)]. The guideline imprisonment range is 41 to 51 months. Sentence will be imposed, however, independent of the Guidelines under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)]. I have determined that a sentence of 33 months, to which the Government does not object, is a sentence that\u2019s sufficient but not longer than necessary to ... meet the goals of Section 3553(a)(1) and (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIR\">Sentencing Tr. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Mr. Orquiz has now filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, arguing that there are no legally viable issues for appeal. The government has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Under <em>Anders, </em>a court-appointed defense counsel who has \u201cconscientiously examine[d] a case,\u201d and concluded \u201cthat any appeal would be wholly frivolous,\u201d may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag5\">submit a brief to the client and the appellate court indicating any potential appealable issues based on the record. The client may then choose to submit arguments to the court. The Court must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If the court concludes after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-10\"><em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">We agree with counsel that no potentially meritorious issues exist on appeal. There is no reason to believe that Defendant\u2019s plea was anything other than knowing and voluntary. <em>See Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755-56, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). Defendant had the opportunity to object to any facts contained in the PSR, but did not do so, and, under Rule 32(i)(3)(A) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the district court was permitted to \u201caccept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">The record further indicates that Defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable. As the Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), \u201c \u2018reasonableness\u2019 is the standard controlling appellate review of the sentences district courts impose.\u201d First, we review for procedural reasonableness, asking whether the district court committed a procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We then review for substantive reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ableness \u201cunder an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d and, \u201c[w]hen conducting this review, [we] will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 804-11 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">There is no indication that the district court committed a procedural error here. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Defendant to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 eight months below the bottom of the Guidelines range. Defendant\u2019s prior conviction was relatively stale, and the district court\u2019s analysis of Defendant\u2019s sentence, under the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), is persuasive. Defendant\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We DISMISS Defendant\u2019s appeal and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
