Risinger\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits, finding that the Commissioner of Social Security properly found, at step four of the social security sequential analysis, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)-(f), that Risinger had the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work as a fast food worker. The Appeals Council denied further review, and the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmed the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">After carefully reviewing the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, <em>Hepp v. Astrue, </em>511 F.3d 798, 806 (8th Cir.2008) (de novo standard of review), we agree with the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The record reflects that Risinger\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Barton, gave two conflicting opinions about Risinger\u2019s physical abilities within the same document. Neither of Dr. Barton\u2019s conclusory opinions as to Risinger\u2019s physical abilities were supported by objective medical evidence. Risinger\u2019s description of his activities of daily living in his testimony before the ALJ, as well as his reports to other physicians, belie the level of restriction Dr. Barton\u2019s opinions place on Risinger. None of the other physicians who examined Risinger, at the request of either the Commissioner or Dr. Barton, found it necessary to so severely restrict Risinger\u2019s activities. The ALJ acknowledged Dr. Barton\u2019s opinions; however, the ALJ did not abuse his discretion in discounting these opinions in light of the inconsistent evidence of record. The ALJ correctly discounted the opinion of the treating physician. <em>Samons v. Astrue, </em>497 F.3d 813, 819 (8th Cir.2007) (ALJ is entitled to discount the opinion of treating physician when the opinion is conclusory or inconsistent with the evidence of record). Further, we find the district court properly concluded that the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Risinger\u2019s application for disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Flynn v. Astrue, </em>513 F.3d 788, 792 (8th Cir.2008) (Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits must be supported by substantial evidence based on the record as a whole).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
