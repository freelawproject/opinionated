R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-22\">Defendant Paula Aduddell was convicted of three criminal counts arising out of her involvement in a counterfeit check operation: conspiracy to commit access device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l); and possession of stolen mail, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. Aduddell was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eighty-four months in connection with those convictions. Following the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, Aduddell filed an appeal challenging her aggravated identity theft conviction, and raising two sentencing-related issues. Aduddell did not challenge her convictions for conspiracy to commit access device fraud or possession of stolen mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-23\">After briefing in this appeal was complete, but prior to oral argument, this court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Tatum, </em>518 F.3d 769 (10th Cir.2008), holding that counterfeit checks and account numbers printed on counterfeit checks are not \u201caccess devices\u201d within the meaning of that term as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1). The United States has now filed a motion conceding that, in light of <em>Tatum, </em>Aduddell was not properly charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud or aggravated identity theft. Specifically, . the government concedes \u201cthat since counterfeit checks are not ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>cess devices for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, Aduddell should not have been charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and such charge could not be a predicate offense for aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).\u201d Motion for Remand at 2. As a result, the United States seeks a remand of Aduddell\u2019s case with directions to the district court to vacate the conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity theft convictions. After examining the record on appeal in this case, we agree with the government\u2019s assessment of <em>Tatum </em>and its effect on Adud-dell\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We further conclude it is unnecessary to address the two sentencing issues raised by Aduddell on appeal. In the first of those sentencing issues, Aduddell challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(4). Notably, however, the district court\u2019s application of this enhancement rested, in pertinent part, on a finding that Aduddell\u2019s conspiracy \u201coffense involved the receiving and selling of stolen property, to wit: authentic checks and checkbooks.\u201d ROA, Vol. 3 at 12. Because Aduddell\u2019s conspiracy conviction does not survive <em>Tatum, </em>and because there is no indication in the record that the district court intended to apply the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(4) enhancement on the basis of Aduddell\u2019s possession of stolen mail conviction, the issue is now moot. In her second sentencing issue, Aduddell challenges the district court\u2019s application of a ten-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F) based on its finding that the amount of intended loss associated with Aduddell\u2019s conspiracy conviction was $147,500. In light of our disposition of Aduddell\u2019s conspiracy conviction, this enhancement issue is likewise moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">We GRANT the government\u2019s motion and REMAND this case to the district court with directions to VACATE Adud-dell\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity theft and RESENTENCE her on her remaining conviction for possession of stolen mail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
