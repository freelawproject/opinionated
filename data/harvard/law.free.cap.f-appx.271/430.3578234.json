Although the district court imposed a sentence that was substantially higher than the guidelines range, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Rico because it properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provided sufficiently detailed reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 812-13 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Rico has failed to demonstrate that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594, 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Rico also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
