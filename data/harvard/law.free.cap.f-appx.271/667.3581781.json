Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1078 (9th Cir.2002), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 contention, the agency did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Petitioners failed to overcome the presumption of delivery created by regular mail. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1079-80; <em>see Sem-biring v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir.2007) (adopting a \u201cpractical and commonsensical\u201d test to determine whether proper notice was provided).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review Petitioners\u2019 contention that they failed to appear at their hearing due to exceptional circumstances because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s March 7, 2006, order denying Piliposyan\u2019s motion to reconsider because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">In No. 05-76104, PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">In No. 06-70381, PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
