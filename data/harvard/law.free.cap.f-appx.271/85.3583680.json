The Honorable Carol Bagley Amon, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">On October 12, 2005, <em>pro se </em>plaintiff David Jacobs, a former tenured schoolteacher, filed suit against his past employer school district, the corresponding Board of Education, the State of New York, state agencies, and various individuals under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of constitutional rights relating to his employment, as well as under state law for corresponding torts. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). We review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting all factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019n, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir.2007). A complaint should be especially liberally construed when it is submitted <em>pro se </em>and alleges civil rights violations. <em>See Fernandez v. Chertoff, </em>471 F.3d 45, 51 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">Jacobs\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to New York\u2019s three-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions. <em>See Pearl v. City of Long Beach, </em>296 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir.2002). Thus, to the extent Jacobs complains of actions that occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>before October 12, 2002, those claims are time-barred whether or not the district court specifically dismissed them for that reason. <em>See Bertin v. United States, </em>478 F.3d 489, 491 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cWe may, of course, affirm on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law, including grounds upon which the district court did not rely.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The claims are not saved by equitable tolling or by delayed accrual, as Jacobs has not shown that \u201cit would have been impossible for a reasonably prudent person to learn about his or her cause of action.\u201d <em>Pearl v. City of Long Beach, </em>296 F.3d at 85 (specifying eligibility requirements for equitable tolling and delayed accrual). Nor has Jacobs convincingly pleaded that the actions of which he complains constitute a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d that would avoid the statute of limitations, as he has not demonstrated that they \u201ccollectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.\u201d <em>Washington v. County of Rockland, </em>373 F.3d 310, 317 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Regarding those claims in Jacobs\u2019s complaint that concern events occurring after October 12, 2002, we preliminarily observe, as did the district court, that New York State and its agencies, the New Yoi'k State Teachers Retirement System and the New York State Department of Education, are protected from suit by sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, regardless of whether the relief sought from them was legal or equitable in nature. <em>See Dube v. State Univ. of New York, </em>900 F.2d 587, 594-95 (2d Cir. 1990). We also note that Jacobs\u2019s charges of negligence and malpractice against various defendants including, <em>inter alia, </em>Dr. Schlesinger, New York State United Teachers, and Jaspan Schlesinger Hoffman LLP, do not state federal claims, as mere negligence cannot violate due process. <em>See Pabon v. Wright, </em>459 F.3d 241, 250 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[S]imple lack of due care does not make out a violation ... of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d); <em>Shaul v. Cherry Valley-Springfield Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>363 F.3d 177, 187 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cIt is well established that mere negligence is insufficient as a matter of law to state a due process violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We now turn to Jacobs\u2019s remaining claims, which stem from his hearing pursuant to New York Education Law \u00a7 3020-a in late 2003 and early 2004. First, we agree with the district court that any claims for damages against the arbitrator are barred by that individual\u2019s absolute immunity \u201cfor all acts within the scope of the arbitral process.\u201d <em>Austern v. Chicago Bd. Options Exch., Inc., </em>898 F.2d 882, 886 (2d Cir.1990). While absolute judicial immunity does not bar claims for prospective injunctive relief, such relief is not available under \u00a7 1983 absent an allegation of a violation of a prior declaratory decree, which is not this case. <em>See Montero v. Travis, </em>171 F.3d 757, 761 (2d Cir. 1999). Second, to the extent Jacobs complains of ineffective assistance of counsel, he fails to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 because no state or federal law guaranteed him counsel in his arbitration proceedings, <em>see Janvier v. United States, </em>793 F.2d 449, 451 (2d Cir.1986) (noting that \u201cSixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only to criminal proceedings\u201d), and, in any event, his complaint fails to identify any state actor, or person acting under color of state law, against whom \u00a7 1983 liability may attach, <em>see Spear v. Town of West Hartford, </em>954 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1992). Finally, we address Jacobs\u2019s claim that he was deprived of due process by having only a single arbitrator, rather than a three-member panel, preside at his \u00a7 3020 hearing. This cause of action appears barred by the Eleventh Amendment, as the only defendants sued on this claim are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>state parties. <em>See Dube v. State Univ. of New York, </em>900 F.2d at 594-95. [A35] Even if the claim were filed against defendants not shielded by the Eleventh Amendment, it fails as a matter of law. For reasons stated by the district court, <em>i.e., </em>that the terms \u201cpedagogical incompetence\u201d and \u201cpedagogical judgment\u201d clearly describe teaching ability and exclude other issues such as insubordination or mental fitness, \u00a7 3020-a is not void for vagueness and does not provide Jacobs with the right to a three-member panel. <em>See DeMichele v. Greenburgh Central Sch. Dist. No. 7, </em>167 F.3d 784, 791-92 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>cf. Zhang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 157-58 (2d Cir.2004) (concluding that due process does not require decisions by three-member panels of Board of Immigration Appeals). Nor do we identify any other argument in the complaint as to why \u00a7 3020-a, which provides a \u201cfull-blown adversarial hearing,\u201d <em>Strong v. Bd. of Uniondale Free Sch. Dist., </em>902 F.2d 208, 211 (2d Cir.1990), would in this case be inadequate to satisfy the requirements of due process, especially given Jacobs\u2019s failure to utilize the process afforded him by state law to appeal the arbitrator\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see </em>New York Educ. Law \u00a7 3020-a(5). <em>See generally Locurto v. Safir, </em>264 F.3d 154, 173-75 (2d Cir.2001) (describing the relationship between pre- and post-deprivation process).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">. Although Jacobs claims on this appeal that he was not informed of the arbitrator's decision in time to appeal, because he did not raise that argument in the district court, we consider it waived. <em>See Greene v. United States, </em>13 F.3d 577, 586 (2d Cir. 1994) (\"[I]t is a well-established general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
