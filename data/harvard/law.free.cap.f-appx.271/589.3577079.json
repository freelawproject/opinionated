Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations. <em>See Moli-no-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We deny in part, dismiss in part, grant in part and remand the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-24\">The BIA properly determined that Man-cilla Salazar was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he lacked a qualifying relative. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D); <em>see also Molina-Estrada, </em>293 F.3d at 1093-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-25\">Mancilla Salazar\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 852 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">We lack jurisdiction over Mancilla Salazar\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process by preventing him from presenting his asylum claim, and over his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, because Man-cilla Salazar failed to exhaust these claims before the BIA. <em>See Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cFailure to raise an issue in an appeal to the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to that question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-27\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA affirmed without opinion and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d Pursuant to the government\u2019s request, we therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the original voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Mancilla Salazar\u2019s pending motion to stay his removal is denied as moot. The currently effective stay of removal will expire when this court\u2019s mandate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
