LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6B\">Timothy DeWayne Kinchion appeals his sentence of 352 months\u2019 imprisonment. Kinchion was convicted on one count each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine powder in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1), possession with intent to distribute cocaine powder in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 2), and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">On appeal, Kinchion urges (1) that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court applied a presumption of reasonableness to the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) sentencing range, and (2) that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because it was increased based upon the judge-found fact that he intended to convert the cocaine powder into cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we conclude that Kinchion\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable, and REVERSE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Kinchion and a codefendant, Jackie Nash, purchased one kilogram of cocaine from a police informant in a reverse sting operation in June 2003. Both were arrested after a chase by police. The pair went to trial and were convicted by a jury on all counts charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By special interrogatory, the jury found that Kinchion possessed between 500 grams and 50 kilograms of cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Kinchion was initially sentenced before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), under the then-mandatory Guidelines. To calculate Kinchion\u2019s offense level on Counts 1 and 2, his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) applied \u00a7 3D1.2(d) of the Guidelines. This subsection allows \u201ccounts involving substantially the same harm,\u201d including counts based on \u201cthe quantity of a substance involved,\u201d to be grouped together for calculation of a single offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Relying on witness testimony establishing that Kinchion \u201cwas aware that the cocaine powder he possessed during the pursuit was to be cooked by Nash into cocaine base,\u201d the PSR calculated Kinchion\u2019s offense level based on possession of one kilogram of crack rather than cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Under the version of the Guidelines then in effect, equal quantities of crack and cocaine powder were treated with drastically different severity. Using one kilogram of crack as the basis for its calculation, the PSR established a base offense level of 36. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). Utilizing a two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3C1.2, the PSR calculated a total offense level of 38. Together with a criminal history category of III, the Guidelines calculation yielded a sentencing range of 292-365 months\u2019 imprisonment for Counts 1 and 2. Title 18, section 924(c) of the United States Code mandates a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count 3, to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed. Because the sentence was fixed by statute, the PSR included no offense level calculation for that count. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. Prior to his first sentencing hearing, Kin-chion filed an objection to the PSR, arguing that his offense level should be calculated based on cocaine powder rather than crack. Under a powder-based calculation, Kinchion\u2019s final offense level would be 28, and his sentencing range, 97-121\" months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">At sentencing on September 9, 2004, witness Rosheldon Jenkins testified that he had engaged in crack transactions with Kinchion several times in the past but never bought powder from, or sold powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>to, Kinchion. For the court\u2019s benefit, the government also reviewed relevant testimony from four trial witnesses who stated that Kinchion and Nash routinely purchased powder and converted it into crack. Based on this testimony, the government argued, Kinchion and Nash \u201cwould have rocked [the kilogram of cocaine] up into crack cocaine and that\u2019s how it would have been distributed.\u201d Therefore, Kinchion \u201cshould be held accountable for [crack cocaine] in calculating the base offense level,\u201d just as Nash, who was sentenced earlier, had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In response, Kinchion argued that the crack cocaine sentencing calculation was inappropriate because the jury found that he had possessed only cocaine powder. The court asked Kinchion\u2019s counsel whether the Guidelines allowed a defendant to \u201cbe held accountable for the intended use of the powdered cocaine,\u201d adding that \u201c[i]t seems routine in these cases that that is a part of the consideration for sentencing.\u201d Counsel responded by stressing that the jury specifically found that he had possessed only cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The court overruled Kinchion\u2019s objection and sentenced him at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range \u2014 a concurrent 292 months on Counts 1 and 2, and a consecutive 60 months on Count 3, for a total term of imprisonment of 352 months. Concerned that the Supreme Court might soon rule the Guidelines unconstitutional, the court also imposed an alternative sentence of 120 months\u2019 concurrent imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2 and a consecutive 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3, for a total of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In Kinchion\u2019s first appeal, we remanded for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Booker. United States v. Kinchion, </em>201 Fed.Appx. 606, 612 (10th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Kinchion appeared before the district court for resentencing on March 5, 2007. He renewed his argument that his Guidelines range should be calculated based on cocaine powder rather than crack, and the government reminded the court of the evidence presented at trial and at the original sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">After hearing this argument, the court indicated its intent to impose the alternative sentence from Kinchion\u2019s first sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-13\">[T]he court feels that, having made the judgment originally that the lower sentence given in the alternative way was sufficient to satisfy the goals of sentencing, the court not only feels that it is still a valid position but feels, indeed, honor-bound to give Mr. Kinchion the benefit of that lower sentence, and I know of no reason why my judgment at that time of the lower sentence wouldn\u2019t be as valid today as it was then. The statutory minimum, in this court\u2019s opinion, is sufficient to address the various factors of sentencing....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">The court calculated the same Guidelines sentencing range that it reached at the first hearing, summarized the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and concluded \u201cthat those factors and those goals of sentencing are satisfactorily met\u201d by a 180-month sentence of imprisonment, consisting of a concurrent 120 months as to Counts 1 and 2 and a consecutive 60 months as to Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">After the district c'ourt declared its intention to impose this sentence, however, the government objected. Citing a series of Tenth Circuit cases establishing a \u201csliding scale\u201d of appellate reasonableness review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the government argued that a 180-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>month sentence was substantively unreasonable. Counsel told the court that \u201cunder the guidance that we have from the [Tenth] Circuit, it would be determined to be an unreasonable departure outside the calculated guideline range.\u201d In order to further consider the appropriate sentence, the court called a recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Several days later, on March 13, 2007, the court reconvened sentencing. Having studied the issue further, and after hearing argument from Kinchion, the court reversed its earlier course and reimposed the original within-Guidelines sentence. As the court explained, its decision resulted from its conclusion that the prior intended sentence would be invalid under Tenth Circuit caselaw:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">The court\u2019s feeling or evaluation of the matter when the alternative sentence was imposed ... was that it was enough, under all the circumstances, to satisfy the various factors alluded to by [Kin-chion] and appearing at Section 3553 of Title 18, with which this court is very familiar....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">But ... the government\u2019s correct under the law. It was the very substantial degree of variance that simply is impermissible in this case under the case law now applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">Put another way, the level of the court\u2019s originally intended alternative sentence compared to the advisory guideline range was so significant and substantial that such a variance would require a sufficient explanation and justification, with compelling reasons, under later established case law. In this case no such justification, explanation, or compelling reason can be made. None exists. Therefore, the court will impose a guideline sentence____ <em>A guideline sentence is presumed to be reasonable, </em>takes into account the various factors of all cases, and, being presumptively reasonable, the court must find that, though it perhaps would have preferred a different sentence, that ... the bottom of the guideline range cannot be said to fail to address ... the various factors found in that cited section.... <em>[T]his court just simply cannot say that the bottom, of the guideline range ... is not reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">(emphases added). Accordingly, the court reached the same 352-month sentence it had originally imposed. Kinchion objected at length, arguing that a district court\u2019s duty after <em>Booker </em>is to independently balance the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and warning of the dangers of creating \u201ca mandatory advisory guideline.\u201d Kinchion now timely appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing determination for reasonableness, asking whether the district court abused its discretion in selecting the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 804-06 (10th Cir.2008). \u201cOur appellate review for reasonableness includes both a procedural component, encompassing the method by which a sentence was calculated, as well as a substantive component, which relates to the length of the resulting sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">At the appellate level, we apply a presumption of substantive reasonableness to those sentences falling within a properly calculated advisory Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006). This presumption, however, is a tool for the use of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>courts alone: A district court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97; <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 208 (2007). Rather, sentencing courts have a duty to \u201csubject!] the defendant\u2019s sentence to the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A presumption that the Guidelines sentence is reasonable as applied to each individual defendant would undermine this process. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Accordingly, we have repeatedly recognized that a sentencing court commits procedural error if it presumes that the advisory Guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Angel-Guzman, </em>506 F.3d 1007, 1016 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201cA district judge may not simply rest on the authority of the Sentencing Guidelines, but must weigh all relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); <em>United States v. Conlan, </em>500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Arrevalo-Olvera, </em>495 F.3d 1211, 1213 (10th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Begay, </em>470 F.3d 964, 975-76 (10th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 32, 168 L.Ed.2d 808 (2007). Such an error occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s statements at the March 13 hearing, it is abundantly clear that the court erroneously applied a presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines sentence. Indeed, the court explicitly stated as much. It apparently thought that it could not vary from the Guidelines without first demonstrating that the Guidelines sentence would be unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a). This understanding flips the sentencing court\u2019s statutory duties on their head: Although the Guidelines calculation must provide a \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark\u201d for the crafting of a reasonable sentence, <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596, the other factors encompassed by \u00a7 3553(a) must also be considered, <em>id. </em>at 597 n. 6. The sentencing court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 although perhaps understandable given the rapid evolution of federal sentencing law \u2014 was proeedurally in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Because Kinchion preserved this argument by asserting generally that the district court erred in failing to exercise the full range of its sentencing discretion, we must reverse unless the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See Conlan, </em>500 F.3d at 1169-70. \u201cHarmless error is that which did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d and the burden of proving harmlessness \u201cis on the beneficiary of the error\u201d \u2014 here, the government. <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>439 F.3d 1260, 1263 (10th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Arguing that the procedural error was harmless, the government points to the court\u2019s statement that no \u201cjustification, explanation, or compelling reason\u201d for a variance exists. But this statement is too ambiguous to meet the government\u2019s burden of showing that the district court\u2019s erroneous presumption of reasonableness had no effect on the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>It may be, as the government suggests, that the district court meant that no factors which could support a lower sentence exist in this case. Nonetheless, the district court\u2019s statement could just as plausibly mean that no justification <em>sufficient to rebut a presumption of reasonableness </em>exists. The latter interpretation is bolstered by the court\u2019s explicit finding at the March 5 hearing that the \u00a7 3553(a) goals of sentencing would indeed be met by a lower sentence, and by its statement at the March 13 hearing that it \u201cwould perhaps have preferred a different sentence.\u201d We may not enter a \u201czone of speculation and conjecture\u201d by concluding that the district court would impose the same sentence on remand absent application of a presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>tion of reasonableness. <em>Cern\u00edan, </em>500 F.3d at 1170 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">We are sympathetic to the very conscientious trial Judge, who got caught in a rapidly evolving area of the law. Because the court\u2019s error was not harmless, however, we remand this ease yet again for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Kinchion also argues that his sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment, because the district court increased his sentence based on a judge-found fact: Kinehion\u2019s intent to convert the cocaine into crack.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">This court has repeatedly held that \u201cafter <em>Booker, </em>a district court is not precluded from relying on judge-found facts in determining the applicable Guidelines range so long as the Guidelines are considered as advisory rather than mandatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Townley, </em>472 F.3d 1267, 1276 (10th Cir.2007). In fact, \u201c[ujnder an advisory Guidelines regime, a conviction, by itself, authorizes a sentence up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>United States v. Crockett, </em>435 F.3d 1305, 1319 (10th Cir. 2006). Kinchion\u2019s sentence was well within the statutory maximum for each of his counts of conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We thus conclude that his Sixth Amendment argument fails.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. The events leading to Kinchion's arrest are set forth in greater detail in our decision in <em>United States v. Nash, </em>482 F.3d 1209, 1211-13 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">. Specifically, the government referred the court to our decisions in <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050 (10th Cir.2006), <em>United States v. Valtierra-Rojas, </em>468 F.3d 1235 (10th Cir.2006), <em>United States v. Cage, </em>451 F.3d 585 (10th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Bishop, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>469 F.3d 896 (10th Cir.2006). Under the \u201csliding scale\u201d approach, which was substantially invalidated in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we \"use[d] the percentage of a [variance] as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. To the extent that Kinchion asserts that the district court's finding regarding Kinchion and Nash's intended use of the cocaine is in direct <em>conflict </em>with the jury\u2019s finding that they possessed powder cocaine, he is mistaken. There is no logical inconsistency between a person possessing powder cocaine, and that same person having the intent to convert the powder to crack at some point in the future. <em>Cf. United States v. Magallanez, </em>408 F.3d 672, 683-85 (10th Cir.2005) (allowing a sentencing court to increase a sentence based on drug quantities that it found by a preponderance of the evidence, even though a jury had found a lower quantity by special interrogatory). Moreover, \"when a district court makes a determination of sentencing facts by a preponderance test under the now-advisory Guidelines, it is not bound by jury determinations reached through application of the more onerous reasonable doubt standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">. The maximum sentence for possession of 500 grams to 5 kilograms of cocaine powder with intent to distribute is 40 years' imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). Fora conviction of conspiracy to commit this same offense, the maximum penalty is also 40 years' imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">. Kinchion does not argue that the district court misinterpreted the Guidelines when it concluded that intent to convert powder cocaine into crack authorizes a sentencing calculation based on crack, and we express no opinion on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">We note that Kinchion was sentenced prior to an amendment to the Guidelines which lowered the advisory sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses. If Kinchion is again sentenced based on possession of crack, this amendment will apply to his resen-tencing proceeding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (2008); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (setting an effective date of Nov. 1, 2007 for the revised \u00a7 2D 1.1 sentencing ranges). Amendments to the Guidelines are applied to all sentences imposed after their effective date unless doing so would raise ex post facto concerns. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.11. In this case, application of the new sentencing range would be beneficial to Kin-chion and thus would not violate ex post facto principles. <em>United States v. Gerber, </em>24 F.3d 93, 95-96 &amp; n. 4 (10th Cir.1994). Moreover, a separate amendment to the Guidelines provides that the revisions to \u00a7 2D 1.1 apply retroactively to all defendants sentenced under the Guidelines, even those (unlike Kin-chion) sentenced before the effective date of Amendment 706. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
