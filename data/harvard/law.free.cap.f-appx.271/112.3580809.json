July 11, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A95 673 374 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 22, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-24\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (En Banc). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We note at the outset that in her brief to this Court, Zou challenges only the denial of her applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief. In addition, to the extent that Zou argues that she is likely to be persecuted on account of her mother\u2019s forced sterilization, her beliefs regarding the family planning policy, or her general opposition to the Communist regime, we decline to review those arguments where they were not exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20, 124 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">To the extent that the agency denied withholding of removal and CAT relief based on Zou\u2019s claims regarding her illegal departure from China, we find no error in the agency\u2019s decision. However, we have held that any harm an applicant may face based on her illegal departure would constitute prosecution, not persecution. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[pjunishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution.\u201d); <em>see also In re Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354 (B.I.A. 1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus find no error in the agency\u2019s denial of Zou\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Zou also contends that the agency erred in denying her application for CAT relief. We have held that without any particularized evidence, an applicant cannot demonstrate that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased <em>solely </em>on the fact that she is part of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China\u201d and on generalized evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasis in the original). Here, Zou l\u2019efers to documents indicating that some repatriated individuals are imprisoned and that Chinese prisoners are tortured. Such evidence, however, provides no basis for the agency to conclude that she, or someone in her \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d faces an elevated risk of torture. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Zou\u2019s application for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. This case must be distinguished from those in which an individual faces \u201clong years of imprisonment\u201d simply for having fled a cruel dictatorship. <em>Cf. Sovich v. Esperdy, </em>319 F.2d 21, 29 (2d Cir.1963). Here, the agency evaluated the record and found that Zou had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to show that she would face \"particularly harsh punishment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
