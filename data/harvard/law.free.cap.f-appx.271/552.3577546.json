Following careful review, we conclude that the district court\u2019s section 4245 finding was not clearly erroneous given the unanimous opinion of the mental health professionals, and Parham\u2019s reported delusions and his past aggressive behavior. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (determination of mental illness and treatment need, and burden of proof); <em>United States v. Bean, </em>373 F.3d 877, 879 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Eckerson, </em>299 F.3d 913, 914-15 (8th Cir.2002) (per cu-riam) (upholding commitment order based on opinion of prison hospital staff, despite inmate\u2019s denial of mental illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-26\">.
