Leighton, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Appellants Jerome \u201cJeru\u201d Hall (\u201cHall\u201d) and Taasen Sumeru (\u201cSumeru\u201d) appeal their convictions for securities fraud, wire fraud, and in Sumeru\u2019s case, money laundering conspiracy and failure to file an income tax return as well. Appellants contend that the trial court participated in their trial to such an extent as to render it unfair. Having conducted a thorough review of the record, we agree that Hall and Sumeru were prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s excessive and biased interventions. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this case for a new trial before a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">While a district court judge has considerable discretion in the management of his courtroom, the judge \u201cmust be ever mindful of the sensitive role [he] plays in a jury trial and avoid even the appearance of advocacy or partiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>501 F.2d 1, 10 (9th Cir.1974). A trial court\u2019s participation in the proceedings warrants reversal \u201cif the record ... leaves the reviewing court with an abiding impression that the judge\u2019s remarks and questioning of witnesses projected to the jury an appearance of advocacy or partiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Mostella, </em>802 F.2d 358, 361 (9th Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). At Appellants\u2019 trial, the court accorded such preferential treatment to the Government that the jury could only have concluded that the court disfavored the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">The catalog of inappropriate behavior by the trial court is long, so we merely summarize it here. The court persistently interrupted Appellants\u2019 presentation of their evidence, <em>sua sponte </em>interposing adverse evidentiary rulings with such frequency that the Government was effectively relieved of its responsibility to make objections. By contrast, the court allowed the Government to examine witnesses and move exhibits into evidence without the same degree of scrutiny and intervention. The court overruled most defense objections without explanation, and admitted evidence offered by the Government that it had previously excluded when offered by the defense. The court made several intemperate remarks to defense counsel while in the jury\u2019s presence. The court also terminated Sumeru\u2019s cross-examination of a prosecution witness without valid reason, and refused to permit Hall to cross-examine the witness. Finally, the court aggressively questioned two witnesses in a manner that crossed the line between clarifying the evidence, which is permissible, and aiding the Government, which is not. <em>See Id. </em>at 361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">Taken together, the trial court\u2019s biased evidentiary rulings, disparaging remarks, and lengthy interrogations of witnesses \u201ccreated an atmosphere in which an objectively fair trial could not be conducted.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>501 F.2d at 11 n. 20. \u201c[T]he cu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>mulative effect was so pervasive and prejudicial as to require a new trial.\u201d <em>United, States v. Pena-Garcia, </em>505 F.2d 964, 967 (9th Cir.1974). We therefore REVERSE Appellants\u2019 convictions, VACATE their sentences, and REMAND for a new trial with instructions that the Clerk of the Court for the Central District of California reassign this case to a different judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
