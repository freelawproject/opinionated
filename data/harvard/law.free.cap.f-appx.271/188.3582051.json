Following sentencing, notices of appeal were filed. We have jurisdiction to review the judgments of sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-26\">Appellants, in them joint brief, raise a host of issues on appeal. Rather than paraphrase those issues, we will set them forth verbatim as they appear in the Table of Contents of appellants\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-27\">\u201cPOINT 1 THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE AN IRRELEVANT AND UNDULY PREJUDICIAL INTERNAL MEMORANDUM BY A MORTGAGE COMPANY THAT ALSO CONSTITUTED INADMISSIBLE LAY OPINION TESTIMONY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-28\">POINT 2 THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY ADMITTING AN ANONYMOUS FAX SOLELY AGAINST DEFENDANT LUNDY WHICH FAX WAS IRRELEVANT AND UNFAIRLY PREJUDICIAL AS TO LUNDYS CODEFEN-DANTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-29\">POINT 3 THE DISTRICT COURT UNFAIRLY PREJUDICED THE APPELLANTS WHEN IT BOLSTERED THE GOVERNMENT EXPERTS\u2019 CREDIBILITY BY TAKING JUDICIAL NOTICE OF DOCUMENTS ABOUT WHICH THE EXPERTS HAD ALREADY TESTIFIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-30\">POINT 4 THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED WHEN IT TOOK JUDICIAL NOTICE OF THE SUNDRY FREE MOORS ACT OF 1790 AND THE MOORS FED FINANCIERS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ACT BECAUSE THE COURT HAD NO BASIS TO DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF THE JUDICIALLY NOTICED FACTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">POINT 5 THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY PRECLUDING ADMISSION IN EVIDENCE OF CO-DEFENDANT HARRIS\u2019 OUT OF COURT STATEMENT TO ALINE BENNETT TO TELL THE TRUTH DURING HER GRAND JURY TESTIMONY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">POINT 6 THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY PERMITTING THE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF GOVERNMENT WITNESS KERR AS IT WAS NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S INITIAL WRITTEN SUMMARY AS REQUIRED BY RULE 16(a)(1)(G) AND WAS UNFAIRLY PREJUDICIAL UNDER FED. R. EVID. 403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">POINT 7 THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED WHEN IT HELD DOCUMENTS THAT WERE ATTACHED TO A CERTIFICATION WERE SELF-AUTHENTICATING DESPITE NO REFERENCE TO THE DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE CERTIFICATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">POINT 8 APPELLANTS WERE NOT FOUND GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OF CRIMINAL CONTEMPT CONSTITUTING OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">A. The Right to an Independent Tribunal is Fundamental</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">B. Distinguishing Civil versus Criminal Contempt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">POINT 9 THE DEFENDANTS CONVICTIONS MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THEY HAD A VALID GOOD FAITH DEFENSE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">We have reviewed the record and the submissions of the parties and conclude, without further discussion, that each of the issues raised by appellants is without merit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gomez, </em>237 F.3d 238, 239 (3d Cir.2000). We will, therefore, affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
