We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Perez-Soto\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to establish exceptional circumstances where Perez-Soto contended that he misunderstood or was confused as to the time of the scheduled hearing, the submitted evidence of his medical conditions predated the hearing by more than a decade, and Perez-Soto sought to reopen in order to seek relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d include those beyond the alien\u2019s control, such as the serious illness of the alien, or the death or serious illness of an immediate relative, but not less compelling circumstances); <em>Valencia-Fragoso v.
