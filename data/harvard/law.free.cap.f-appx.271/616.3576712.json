To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-21\">Maldonado-Mendoza claims that she did not know that the passenger she attempted to drive across the border lacked proper documentation to enter the United States. However, the immigration official who conducted Maldonado-Mendoza\u2019s sworn interview testified that the I-213 form accurately reflected her statement that she did know this information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Maldonado-Mendoza has pointed to no evidence that the statement in the 1-213 form was the result of coercion. <em>See Cuevas-Ortega v. INS, </em>588 F.2d 1274, 1278 (9th Cir.1979) (\u201cthe bare assertion that a statement is involuntary is insufficient\u201d to prove coercion); <em>see also Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe burden of establishing a basis for exclusion of evidence from a government record falls on the opponent of the evidence, who must come forward with enough negative factors to persuade the court not to admit it.\u201d). Moreover, the IJ articulated specific and cogent reasons for crediting the official\u2019s testimony and Maldonado-Mendoza\u2019s statements contained in the 1-213 form over her testimony at the hearing. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002). Substantial evidence supports the Id\u2019s determination that Maldonado-Mendoza was inadmissible for assisting alien smuggling as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). <em>See Moran, </em>395 F.3d at 1091-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review Maldonado-Mendoza\u2019s contention that she was denied a full and fair hearing due to the government\u2019s inability to identify a potential witness because she did not raise that issue to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
