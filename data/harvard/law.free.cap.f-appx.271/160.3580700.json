The Government has filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, for summary affirmance. For the reasons that follow, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion to the extent it requests summary affirmance, and will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">Garcia, who adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident in 2003, was convicted in 2005 of the offense of distribution, conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute MDMA (ec-stacy) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1) and 843(b)(1)(C) and 846. Garcia was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with being removable as an aggravated felon. An Immigration Judge (IJ) found Garcia removable as charged, and found that the only relief he would potentially be eligible for would be protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Garcia conceded that he was not likely to be tortured upon his return to the Dominican Republic; thus he was not eligible for any relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">Garcia also argued, however, that he was a \u201cnational,\u201d and not an alien, because he had applied for United States citizenship. The IJ found that Garcia was not a national, and the BIA agreed, holding in its decision that United States citizenship \u201cmay be acquired only through birth or naturalization. It cannot be acquired sole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ly by applying for naturalization.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garcia filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Government argues that we lack jurisdiction over the petition because Garcia is an aggravated felon. Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) provides that no court has jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined by statute, the REAL ID Act provides that nothing in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) \u201cwhich eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We thus have jurisdiction to consider Garcia\u2019s legal claim that he is a national. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A), we have jurisdiction to review a claim of nationality if there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to that claim. The parties do not dispute the underlying facts of the case. We exercise plenary review over Garcia\u2019s claims. <em>Jordon v. Attorney General, </em>424 F.3d 320, 328 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">There is no reason for us to disturb the BIA\u2019s order in this case as this issue is well-settled. A national is either a citizen of the United States, or \u201ca person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(22) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(22) ]. For a citizen of another country, \u201cnothing less than citizenship will show \u2018permanent allegiance to the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salim v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 307, 310 (3d Cir.2003). Garcia\u2019s statement that he applied for naturalization does not render him a citizen or national of the United States. Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">For the above reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">. Garcia mistakenly states in his petition for review that the BIA affirmed without opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. In his petition for review, Garcia also states that the evidence concerning his conviction \"offered by the Government does not rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence required to sustain the charge of removability as set forth in the \u2018Notice to Appear.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 He gives no further explanation regarding why he believes the evidence was insufficient, and the BIA explicitly found that evidence of his conviction was established by clear and convincing evidence. Further, according to the IJ's opinion, Garcia conceded the charges in the Notice to Appear. We find no basis to overturn the BIA\u2019s finding that Garcia was convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
