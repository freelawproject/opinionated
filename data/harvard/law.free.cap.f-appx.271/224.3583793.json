Neff, by and through the Administrator of his Estate, Joyce A. Landauer, appeals from the District Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order denying Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granting the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the underlying declaratory judgment action. The Complaint alleged that Neff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>died as the result of injuries sustained while in the care of an Alterra Healthcare assisted living facility insured by the Ap-pellees, and sought a declaration of coverage. For the reasons below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Because we write solely for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and procedural history of the case, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis. Alterra Healthcare Corporation owned, operated, controlled, and managed a personal care home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where William J. Neff was a patient. In September of 2000, Mr. Neff was badly injured while in the care of Alterra employee Heidi Tenzer. During the next several days, three other Alterra employees, Patricia Policino, Anne McClintock, and Linda Murray, became aware of Mr. Neffs injuries but did not render treatment or report his condition to his family or his doctor. Mr. Neff died approximately one week after he was injured. As the result of an investigation initiated by the coroner\u2019s office, Ms. Tenzer was convicted of criminal charges. The three other Alterra employees pled guilty to neglect of a care dependent person, a misdemeanor. The question before the District Court was whether Alterra\u2019s primary liability insurance policy provided through Liberty Surplus Insurance and/or the first excess insurance policy provided through American Empire Surplus Lines Insurance cover the personal injury claims Neff filed against Alterra and its four employees (the \u201cAlter-ra defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The District Court found that the policies at issue contained the following exclusionary language: \u201cThis insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 \u2018property damage\u2019 or \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019 arising out of ... [t]he actual or threatened abuse or molestation by anyone of any person while in the care, custody or control of any insured.\u201d (A-172.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court determined that the \u201cabuse or molestation exclusion\u201d precluded coverage in the Neff case, regardless of whether the laws of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or Massachusetts applied because this was a ease of false conflict. Because a conflict of laws issue was raised, however, the District Court, in an abundance of caution, performed a choice of law analysis and determined that Pennsylvania law would apply, and clearly would give effect to the abuse or molestation exclusion to preclude coverage. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment <em>de novo. Pennsylvania Coal Ass\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>63 F.3d 231, 236 (3d Cir.1995). \u201c[T]he interpretation of the scope of coverage of an insurance contract is a question of law properly decided by the court, a question over which [this court] exereise[s] plenary review.\u201d <em>Medical Protective Co. v. Watkins, </em>198 F.3d 100, 103 (3d Cir.1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Under Pennsylvania law, which Appellant acknowledges applies in construing insurance policy language, an insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>company is obligated to defend an insured when the complaint filed by the injured party may potentially come within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>Pacific Indem. Co. v. Linn, </em>766 F.2d 754, 760 (3d Cir.1985) (citing Pennsylvania eases). In construing an insurance policy, the court must give unambiguous terms their \u201cplain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lewis, </em>935 F.2d 1428, 1431 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting <em>Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n Ins. Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Ins. Co., </em>426 Pa. 453, 233 A.2d 548, 551 (1967)). On the other hand, terms in an insurance contract which are ambiguous are to be construed strictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mohn v. American Cas. Co., </em>458 Pa. 576, 326 A.2d 346, 351 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The District Court correctly found that the terms and conditions of the insurance policies preclude coverage for the claims against the Alterra defendants. The Liberty Surplus commercial general liability policy excludes coverage for claims of injury \u201carising out of ... [tjhe actual or threatened abuse or molestation by anyone of any person while in the care, custody or control of any insured.\u201d (A-172.) While Appellant concedes that this provision would preclude coverage under the laws of all three states considered, it argues that reading the \u201cseparation of insureds\u201d provision <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in connection with the abuse or molestation exclusion creates an ambiguity in the policy obligating the Appellees to provide coverage in the Neff personal injury lawsuit with respect to the claims against the Alterra defendants other than Tenzer. This Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The plain and ordinary meaning of the exclusion is that there is no coverage if a plaintiffs injury arises out of abuse or molestation.3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The abuse or molestation does not have to have been committed by \u201cthe insured\u201d or even \u201can insured,\u201d but by \u201canyone.\u201d Invoking the separation of insureds provision does not narrow the broad reach of the exclusion. The abuse or molestation exclusion precludes coverage for the claims as to each of the four Alterra employees and Alterra, and would do so even if each is sued separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The suggestion that Massachusetts law creates an ambiguity is not persuasive. Massachusetts law does not create an ambiguity in the contract language here. In 1986, the Massachusetts Supreme Court gave effect to a severability of insurance provision to conclude that an automobile exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy precluded coverage for personal injury claims caused by the drunk driving of the homeowners\u2019 son, but did not preclude coverage for a claim against the homeowners for negligent supervision of their son. <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 496 N.E.2d 158 (1986). In the Massachusetts case, coverage did not apply to bodily injury arising out of the ownership or use of a vehicle owned or operated by any insured. The court reasoned that the claim of negligent supervision in the home by the homeowner parents was \u201cseparate and distinct from use or operation of an automobile\u201d by the homeowners\u2019 intoxicated son, and so it did not arise out of such use excluded by the policy. <em>Id. </em>More recent Massachusetts case law apparently has characterized <em>Mamell </em>as applying only where homeowner\u2019s and automobile insurance are in conflict. <em>See, e.g., Hingham Mut. Fire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. Smith, </em>69 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 865 N.E.2d 1168 (2007) (\u201cthe result in <em>Mamell </em>turned on the allocation of risks between homeowner\u2019s coverage and automobile liability insurance\u201d); <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Churchwell, </em>57 Mass.App.Ct. 612, 785 N.E.2d 392, 395 (2003) (determinative factor in deciding coverage in <em>Mamell </em>was the allocation of risks between an insured\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy and automobile insurance). <em>Mamell </em>is inapplicable here, and there is no conflict of laws to be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The severability clause in this case simply does not affect the applicability of the exclusion for bodily injuries arising out of abuse or molestation. There is no duty to defend or indemnify the Alterra defendants under the terms and conditions of the policies at issue with respect to the injuries sustained by Mr. Neff.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the Order of the District Court denying summary judgment for Appellant and granting summary judgment in favor of the Appellees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. The exclusion also precludes coverage for claims of negligent employment, investigation, supervision, \"reporting to the proper authorities, or failure to so report,\u201d or retention \"of a person ... whose conduct would be excluded by\u201d the above-quoted language. (A-172.) Appellant concedes that this clause applies to negate any of the Alterra employees' claims of coverage in defending negligent employment, supervision, or reporting causes of action. It appears that the District Court relied on this clause in finding that the employees were \"not insured for their neglectful actions.\u201d (A-9.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. \"[T]his insurance applies ... [separately to each insured against whom claim is made or 'suit' is brought.\u201d (A-125.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\">. Appellant does not argue that the injuries did not arise out of the abuse of Mr. Neff by Tenzer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
