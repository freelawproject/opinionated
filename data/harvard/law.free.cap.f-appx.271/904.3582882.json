Garcia argues that the district court erred when it permitted the government to impeach Garcia\u2019s co-defendant Junior Rafael Corrales with Corrales\u2019s convictions regarding the same conspiracy that was the basis of the charges against Garcia. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-24\">WRen the government cross-examined Corrales about his convictions, Garcia ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>jected that the subject was \u201cbeyond the scope\u201d of his direct examination. Garcia now argues that the district court undermined his mistake-of-fact defense when it allowed the government to impeach Cor-rales with his conspiracy convictions. Garcia\u2019s failure to raise this argument in the district court bars relief unless Garcia establishes a plain error that \u201cseriously jeopardized [his] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. King, 505 </em>F.2d 602, 605 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The district court did not plainly err by permitting the government to question Corrales about his convictions. Evidence of the convictions allowed the jury to assess fairly Corrales\u2019s testimony and corrected the impression that Corrales was acting as a confidential informant and was not a participant in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. DeLoach, </em>34 F.3d 1001, 1004 (11th Cir.1994). Although the court did not instruct the jury about the limited use of the convictions, \u201cthe absence of a cautionary instruction alone does not warrant a conclusion of plain error.\u201d <em>King, 505 </em>F.2d at 607. The government briefly inquired into Corrales\u2019s convictions to establish that Corrales\u2019s actions were not sanctioned by the government, and the government did not insinuate that Cor-rales\u2019s guilt incriminated Garcia. <em>See King, </em>505 F.2d at 609 (citing <em>United States v. Rothman, </em>463 F.2d 488, 490 (2d Cir. 1972)); <em>DeLoach, 34 </em>F.3d at 1004. The evidence did not preclude Garcia from presenting his mistake-of-fact defense that he believed he was acting in concert with Corrales to build a drug trafficking case for the Drug Enforcement Agency. <em>See King, </em>505 F.2d at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Garcia\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
