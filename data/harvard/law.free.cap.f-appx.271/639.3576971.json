Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Sidhu\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than 20 months after the BIA\u2019s December 4, 2002 decision dismissing his direct appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Sidhu\u2019s contention that the 90-day filing deadline for a motion to reopen should be tolled because he failed to raise that claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
