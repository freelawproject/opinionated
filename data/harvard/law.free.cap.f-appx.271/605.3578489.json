We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review adverse credibility findings under the substantial evidence standard, <em>Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741 (9th Cir.2007), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-26\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on evidence that Abrahamian fled Armenia because of financial difficulties rather than to avoid religious persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 742 (inconsistency undermining a petitioner\u2019s claim that he fled to escape persecution goes to the heart of the claim and is sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-27\">As the record does not compel the conclusion that Abrahamian\u2019s testimony was credible, he has not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-28\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b629-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
