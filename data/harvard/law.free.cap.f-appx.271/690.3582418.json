We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>see United States v. Pirro, </em>104 F.3d 297, 299 (9th Cir.1997), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-22\">Aderhold contends that his constitutional rights were violated when the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) calculated his sentence without including credit for time he spent subject to conditions of pretrial supervision after he was released on his own recognizance pending trial. Aderhold concedes that he did not attempt to exhaust available administrative remedies regarding this claim with the BOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-23\">A federal prisoner is required to exhaust federal administrative remedies before bringing a habeas petition in federal court. <em>See Martinez v. Roberts, </em>804 F.2d 570, 571 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam). We reject Ad-erhold\u2019s contentions that he is excused from the exhaustion requirement because the BOP\u2019s administrative remedy is inadequate and because the BOP is biased against him. The authority to grant sentence credits pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) rests with the BOP, rather than the sentencing court. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); see <em>also Martinez, </em>804 F.2d at 571 (noting that difficulties a prisoner may experience in meeting the time requirements for an administrative appeal are properly first brought before the BOP). Further, Aderhold has not demonstrated that the BOP was biased or failed to follow its own regulations in calculating his sentence. <em>See Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 56-57, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995) (holding that time spent under restrictive conditions while released on bail is not \u201cofficial detention\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3585(b)). We conclude that the district court properly dismissed Ader-hold\u2019s petition for failure to exhaust ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ministrative remedies with the BOP. <em>See Martinez, </em>804 F.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Aderhold\u2019s motion to expedite this appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
