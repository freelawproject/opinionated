We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order), and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-21\">The district court did not err in dismissing Hancock\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because Hancock\u2019s amended complaint did not allege more than a difference of opinion between the physician and the prisoner concerning the appropriate course of treatment. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that a difference in opinion over proper medical treatment does not establish deliberate indifference).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-22\">The district court did not err in dismissing Hancock\u2019s due process claim regarding the administrative grievance procedure because Hancock\u2019s amended complaint did not allege facts sufficient to show a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest was at stake. <em>See Mann v. Adams, </em>855 F.2d 639, 640 (9th Cir.1988) (order) (holding that prisoners do not have a protected property interest in an inmate grievance procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Hancock\u2019s amended complaint without leave to amend after first advising Hancock of the deficiencies of his original complaint and providing him an opportunity to amend. <em>See Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that a district court must provide the litigant with notice of the deficiencies in his complaint prior to dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
