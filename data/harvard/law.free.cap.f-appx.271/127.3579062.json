Straus ordering petitioner removed based on a prior conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>In re Kevin R. Creary, </em>No. A38 575 536 (B.I.A. July 23, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A38 575 536 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Feb. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">The IJ found Creary removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because of Creary\u2019s prior conviction for second degree larceny under Connecticut law. In his appeal to the BIA, Creary argued that he was denied his constitutional rights when he was ordered removed because the underlying conviction that rendered him removable was constitutionally infirm. Specifically, he claimed that his guilty plea to that offense had not been knowing and voluntary because his attorney at the time did not properly inform him of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding of removability and, as to Creary\u2019s constitutional argument, concluded that the agency could not entertain a collateral attack on an underlying judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-23\">Creary petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s decision to this Court, asserting that he was deprived of due process by being removed based on a conviction for which he was unable to challenge the effectiveness of his counsel, because he did not know his counsel was ineffective until removal proceedings were initiated against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although we lack jurisdiction to review final removal orders for petitioners like Creary who have committed aggravated felonies, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>claims or questions of law\u201d raised upon a petition for review, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We do not reach the question of whether Creary has been deprived of due process for failure to obtain judicial review of his underlying conviction because Creary has not raised a colorable constitutional claim that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel in his underlying conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Creary argues that his counsel in state court was ineffective because at his change-of-plea proceeding, his attorney told him that \u201ca conviction \u2018could\u2019 or \u2018possibly\u2019 have immigration consequences.\u201d He argues that this was ineffective assistance because his lawyer should have informed him' that pleading to a larceny charge would be \u201ccertain\u201d to have immigration consequences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To establish ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a guilty plea, a defendant must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>United States v. Couto, </em>311 F.3d 179, 187 (2d Cir.2002). We have held that an attorney\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see United States v. Santelises, </em>509 F.2d 703, 704 (2d Cir.1975) (per curiam), but that an attorney\u2019s affirmative misrepresentation about the deportation consequences of a guilty plea can constitute ineffective assistance, <em>see Couto, </em>311 F.3d at 188. In this case, Creary\u2019s attorney did not affirmatively misrepresent the consequences of a guilty plea. In fact, his statement that Creary\u2019s guilty plea could have immigration consequences was accurate. <em>See Sean Zhang v. United States, </em>506 F.3d 162, 168 (2d Cir.2007) (concluding that the district court\u2019s statements that Zhang was subject to \u201cpossible post sentence deportation,\u201d that his conviction \u201ccould result\u201d in deportation, and that he \u201cmay be deported,\u201d were not misleading, but rather were an accurate statement about his situation). Counsel\u2019s statements to Creary, therefore, cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">We have considered all of Creary\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-20\">. Creary argues that he can no longer challenge the validity of his Connecticut conviction through the usual post-conviction avenues because the time has run on those remedies and because he is no longer in custody of the state. We assume, without deciding, that such avenues are indeed foreclosed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">. Creary was not new to the notion that a state conviction could have immigration consequences. In 2000, the government had initiated removal proceedings against Creary for a different Connecticut state conviction. Creary appeared before an IJ and was ultimately not ordered removed because the state court withdrew his guilty plea to that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
