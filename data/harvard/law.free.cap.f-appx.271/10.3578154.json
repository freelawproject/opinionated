Straus, denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), and ordering him removed to Brazil. <em>In re Procopio, </em>A98 038 901 (B.I.A. Apr. 3, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 038 901 (Immig.Ct.Hartford, Conn. Sept. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Procopio argues that the BIA erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal because it applied the wrong standard for \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Although we lack jurisdiction to review \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determinations by the BIA because they are discretionary judgments, <em>see Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 39 (2d Cir.2008), we retain jurisdiction under the REAL ID Act to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). \u201c[T]he argument that a discretionary decision was \u2018based on a legally erroneous standard\u2019 raises a \u2018question of law\u201d.... \u201d <em>Barco-Sandoval, </em>516 F.3d 35, 40. However, as we held in <em>Barco-Sandoval, </em>Procopio\u2019s legal argument that the IJ erroneously applied the standard from <em>Matter of Monreal-Aguinaga, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56 (B.I.A.2001), and not the standard from <em>Matter of Reci\u00f1as, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 467 (B.I.A.2002), \u201cis so insubstantial and frivolous as to be inadequate to invoke federal-question jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Barco-Sandoval, </em>516 F.3d 35, 40 <em>(\u201cReci\u00f1as </em>is so obviously an application of <em>Monreal-Aguinaga, </em>leaving the latter\u2019s standard intact, that [the petitioner\u2019s] argument that the agency incorrectly relied on <em>Monreal-Aguinaga </em>rather than <em>Reci\u00f1as </em>in denying his application for cancellation of removal does not even reach the level of being colorable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We likewise lack jurisdiction to review Procopio\u2019s next argument that, in making its discretionary determination, the agency failed to properly consider all of his evidence, including testimony from his expert witness, such that he was denied due process of law. In certain circumstances, an IJ\u2019s fact-finding may be flawed by an error of law, \u201csuch as might arise where the IJ states that his decision was based on petitioner\u2019s failure to testify to some pertinent fact when the record of the hearing reveals unambiguously that the petitioner did testify to that fact.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). However, \u201cregardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition,\u201d where, as here, the petitioner \u201cmerely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Procopio\u2019s contention that a three-member panel of the BIA, rather than a single member, should have decided his case before the agency. <em>See Kambolli v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 454, 465 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e lack jurisdiction to review a claim that a single BIA member erred in deciding to resolve unilaterally an appeal of an IJ\u2019s order and not to refer the case to a three-member BIA panel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. The motion for stay of deportation is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
