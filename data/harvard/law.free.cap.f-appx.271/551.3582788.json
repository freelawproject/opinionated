We conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants. <em>See Anderson v. Larson, </em>327 F.3d 762, 767 (8th Cir.2003) (de novo review). First, Mills\u2019s challenge to his commitment is not properly brought in this section 1983 action, <em>cf. Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (state prisoner\u2019s challenge to fact or duration of confinement must be brought through habeas corpus after exhaustion of state remedies); and second, the medical records show that Mills received reasonable testing and medication for his medical complaints, <em>see Logan v. Clarke, </em>119 F.3d 647, 649-50 (8th Cir.1997) (prison doctors were not deliberately indifferent where they treated prisoner on numerous occasions and offered sensible medication and treatment); <em>Kayser v. Caspari, </em>16 F.3d 280, 281 (8th Cir.1994) (plaintiffs self-diagnosis alone will not suffice to establish serious medical condition); <em>Coleman v. Rahija, </em>114 F.3d 778, 784 (8th Cir.1997) (failure to establish \u201cthe detrimental effect of delay in treatment precludes a claim of deliberate indifference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">. The Honorable George Howard, Jr., late a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable J. Thomas Ray, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
