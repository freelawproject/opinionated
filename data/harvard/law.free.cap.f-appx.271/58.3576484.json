Apr. 27, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 75 933 297 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Oct. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms, without opinion, the decision of the IJ, we review the I J\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Iouri v. Ashcroft, </em>487 F.3d 76, 81 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). We have jurisdiction to review a decision that an alien is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 135, 138 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 60, 62 (2d Cir.2006). To the extent this question requires us to construe a provision of the INA, our review follows the two-step process outlined in <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). If the statutory text \u201cis unambiguous, no further inquiry is necessary.\u201d <em>Mizrahi v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 156, 158 (2d Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted). Where \u201cthe issue on appeal involves the proper application of legal principles to the facts and circumstances of the individual case at hand, our review [is] <em>de novo.\u201d Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">The IJ found Wong removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(A) because he was an alien who was inadmissible \u201cat the time of entry or adjustment of status.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A). Specifically, the IJ found that Wong was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, which renders inadmissible any alien \u201cconvicted of, <em>or who admits having committed </em>... a violation of ... any law or regulation of ... a foreign country relating to a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">The record reflects that Wong testified that he was twice convicted for heroin offenses in Hong Kong and placed in a rehabilitation program. In addition, when asked about a letter from the Criminal Intelligence Bureau of the Hong Kong Police, which stated that Wong had seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>convictions in Hong Kong between 1982 and 1994, six involving \u201cpossession of dangerous drugs,\u201d Wong admitted that there were at least two such convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute is clear that this is an appropriate basis for a finding that an alien is inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae. <em>See Francis v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 131, 139 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)\u00ae the government must \u201cmerely\u201d prove \u201cthat [the alien] admitted to the underlying criminal conduct\u201d); <em>see also Mizrahi, </em>492 F.3d at 159 (noting that \u201cthe statutory language [of \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)\u00ae ] indicates Congress\u2019s intent to sweep broadly\u201d in defining what will render an alien inadmissible). Therefore, the IJ did not err in finding that, based on his admissions, Wong was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(A) and could not adjust status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A). The IJ\u2019s finding that Wong was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) for having \u201cremained in the United States for a longer time than permitted\u201d was also not in error as Wong admitted that he overstayed his visa. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\">. Wong\u2019s counsel originally objected to the admission of the letter from the Hong Kong Police Criminal Intelligence Bureau on the ground that it was not relevant. The IJ nonetheless marked the letter for identification as exhibit 6, and when the government asked Wong about the contents of the letter, petitioner's counsel did not object to the question or to admission of the document. Whether the document was formally admitted into evidence or not, however, is not dispositive, as the IJ's finding was based on Wong\u2019s admissions and not the document itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
