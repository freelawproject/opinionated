Gordon, Sr., now former federal prisoner # 10255-035, fried a complaint against the assistant warden and others at his prison unit wherein he alleged that the defendants violated his civil rights by retaliating against him after he failed to drop a formal complaint he had filed against them. Gordon sought both monetary damages and injunctive relief. The magistrate judge determined that Gordon\u2019s complaint should be liberally construed as a complaint pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">Gordon argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). He argues that his lack of financial resources rendered administrative remedies \u201cunavailable\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under \u00a7 1997e of a civil rights complaint when the dismissal is for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 865 (5th Cir.2003), <em>overruled by implication on other grounds by Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920-21, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Exhaustion is mandatory, and since \u00a7 1997e was amended, this court has \u201ctaken a strict approach to the exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866. Courts may no longer read a \u201cfutility\u201d exception into the exhaustion requirement. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 739-41 &amp; n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-20\">Gordon has not established that the magistrate judge erred in concluding that he had the financial resources to complete the exhaustion requirement. Contrary to his assertion otherwise, the Bureau of Prisons did not \u201celiminate\u201d Gordon\u2019s appeal and further administrative remedy was available. Gordon has not shown that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-16\"> Pursuant \"to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
