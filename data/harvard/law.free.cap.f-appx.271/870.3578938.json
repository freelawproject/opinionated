On appeal, Guerra argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney misinformed him that he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, and he ultimately rejected a plea offer of a 10-year term. Guerra says that but for counsel\u2019s alleged error he would have accepted the offer. Therefore, Guerra asserts that the district court erred in its analysis of his ineffective-assistance claim under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Habeas peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tions premised on ineffective assistance of counsel present \u201ca mixed question of fact and law requiring application of legal principles to the historical facts of the case.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1503 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law ... or resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018contrary to\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are separate bases for reviewing a state court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). The Supreme Court has held that a state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d established law if: (1) the state arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law; or (2) a state court confronts facts \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from relevant Supreme Court precedent, but reaches an opposite result. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established law if the state.court unreasonably applies controlling law, or unreasonably extends, or fails to extend, a legal principle to a new context. <em>Id. </em>at 407,120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">For a state court\u2019s adjudication to be an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented, \u201c[n]ot only must the factual determination have been unreasonable, but the state court\u2019s factual findings must be shown unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Campbell, </em>427 F.3d 897, 926 (11th Cir. 2005). Credibility determinations are factual findings and therefore \u201care presumed to be correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. If a defendant cannot meet one of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prongs, a court does not need to address the other prong. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">In determining whether counsel gave adequate assistance, \u201ccounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient <em>only </em>if it falls below the wide range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal eases. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cThe test for reasonableness is not whether counsel could have done something more or different; instead, we must consider whether the performance fell within the broad range of reasonable assistance at trial.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>476 F.3d 1193, 1209 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">An attorney\u2019s \u201caffirmative misrepresentation in response to a specific inquiry from the defendant may, however, under certain circumstances, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764, 768-69 (11th Cir.1985). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that an attorney has a duty to advise a defendant, who is considering a guilty plea, of the available options and possible sentencing consequences. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 756, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number><em>Beckham v. Wainwright, </em>639 F.2d 262, 267 (5th Cir.1981) (holding counsel\u2019s misrepresentation that the defendant could only be sentenced to five years incarceration on withdrawal of his guilty plea fell \u201coutside of the range of competence of attorneys in criminal cases\u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Finch v. Vaughn, </em>67 F.3d 909, 915-16 (11th Cir.1995) (holding counsel\u2019s misrepresentation that the defendant\u2019s state sentence would be served concurrently with his federal sentence constituted erroneous advice and ineffective assistance of counsel). Also, we have recognized that counsel may owe a greater duty to a client who proceeds to trial than one who decides to plead guilty. <em>See Wofford v. Wainwright, </em>748 F.2d 1505, 1508 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The Supreme Court has defined prejudice as a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>St\u00f1ckland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To establish prejudice, the petitioner must show more than that the error had \u201csome conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>476 F.3d at 1209 (quotation omitted). Rather, the petitioner must show that, without the erroneous actions of his counsel, the outcome of his case would have been different. Str<em>ickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Where a defendant challenges a not-guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Coulter, </em>60 F.3d at 1504 (quotation and alterations omitted). In <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1991), we held that the defendant, who had rejected the government\u2019s plea offer, failed to establish prejudice where he had cited \u201cno evidence to indicate that prior to his conviction he expressed any desire to plead guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s \u201cafter the fact testimony concerning his desire to plead, without more, [was] insufficient to establish that but for counsel\u2019s alleged advice or inaction, he would have [pled guilty].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson v. Duckworth, </em>793 F.2d 898, 902 n. 3 (7th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">We have commented that \u201c[t]he right to competent plea bargain advice is at best a privilege that confers no certain benefit\u201d because a defendant \u201cmay make a wise decision\u201d without assistance of counsel or a \u201cbad one despite superior advice from his lawyer.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>748 F.2d at 1508. Further, plea considerations \u201cfrequently present imponderable questions for which there are no certain answers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">In the instant case, we proceed directly to the second step of the <em>St\u00f1ckland </em>analysis, since at that step it is clear that habeas relief properly was denied, given Guerra\u2019s failure to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice from the alleged deficiency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no indication in the record, and certainly no clear and convincing evidence, that Guerra would not have accepted the 10-year offer absent trial counsel\u2019s advice concerning a 20-year sentence. Trial counsel did not testify that Guerra would have accepted the 10-year offer at any point in the proceedings. Rather, counsel described that Guerra had limited doubts regarding his defense and had rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>prior offers. On this record, Guerra has not shown that he would have pled guilty had counsel told him that he could receive a 34-year, as opposed to a 20-year, term. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Guerra\u2019s habeas petition after finding that the state habeas court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable applicable of federal law <em>(Strickland) </em>and that the decision was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">. We pause to note that on this record, Guerra\u2019s habeas petition fails at the first step of <em>Strickland </em>since, contrary to Guerra's claim in this appeal, there is <em>no </em>indication that trial counsel affirmatively misinformed him that he faced a 20-year maximum sentence. Rather, counsel advised Guerra that he had a \u201cwinnable case\u201d and was \"looking at twenty years.\u201d Moreover, Guerra was previously advised that he faced a potential maximum sentence of <em>life </em>imprisonment, if convicted of second-degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
