For the following reasons, this Court will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">Because we write solely for the parties, we will only address those facts necessary to our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">This case concerns a $1,000,000 accidental death benefit clause contained in a life insurance policy issued by Defendant Greah-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company (\u201cGreat-West\u201d). The deceased, Dr. David Feit, was a practicing dentist and a member of the American Dental Association (\u201cADA\u201d), which maintained the life insurance benefits at issue. Plaintiff Frani Feit is the surviving spouse of Dr. Feit and is one of two designated beneficiaries of the life insurance policy. Mrs. Feit is proceeding in this action individually and as the assignee of the rights of Irwin Feit, Dr. Feit\u2019s father, the other designated beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">Dr. Feit died on July 22, 2002, in Rock-land County, New York. The cause of Dr. Feit\u2019s death was the central dispute at trial. At the time of his death, Dr. Feit was a 44-year-old non-smoker with no history of significant cardiac disease or illness. Dr. Feit had elevated cholesterol, but was taking medicine to address this problem at the time of his death. Prior to his death, Dr. Feit walked five miles four-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to-f\u00edve times per week, and regularly played basketball on Sundays.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Dr. Feit had a $1,000,000 group term life insurance policy at the time of his death and had an additional $1,000,000 accidental death benefit. The accidental death benefit clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">If a Member sustains bodily injury which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">(1) is caused solely by accidental means; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">(2) is sustained while he is insured under the Group Policy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">(3) results in his death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">then the Company will pay an additional amount of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">Payment [of additional amount of insurance] will be made only if death:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">(a) occurs within 90 days after the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">(b) is a direct result of the accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">(c) is unrelated to any other cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-14\"><em>App. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">During the morning of July 22, 2002, Dr. Feit\u2019s car drove off the southbound lane of a Rockland County highway, crashing through the guardrail and damaging ten feet of the rail. The vehicle proceeded 670 feet down a grassy slope, struck a chain-link fence, and stopped after \u201cburrowing into a loose mound of dirt.\u201d <em>App. </em>at 265. During this crash, the car damaged a sign and part of the chain-link fence, and parts of the vehicle were scattered throughout the car\u2019s path. Police found Dr. Feit dead, in the front seat area of the car, clutching his chest and biting his shirt. Dr. Feit was not wearing his seatbelt at the time the police arrived, and the airbags were not deployed. Joseph Segelbacher, the investigator for the County of Rockland\u2019s Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, reported that it appeared as though Dr. Feit \u201cbounced around\u201d inside the car. <em>Id. </em>at 266. The car was declared \u201ctotaled\u201d in the crash by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">After learning of the crash, Mrs. Feit and Dr. Feit\u2019s dental assistant, Joan Van Peenen, went to the Medical Examiner\u2019s office and identified the body. While at the Medical Examiner\u2019s office, Mrs. Feit gave statements to Segelbacher, and the contents of these statements were contested. Mrs. Feit claims that she told Segel-bacher only that Dr. Feit experienced back pain in the past. However, Segelbacher reported that Mrs. Feit told him that Dr. Feit complained of chest and back pain about one week prior to the crash. Mrs. Van Peenen corroborated Mrs. Feit\u2019s version of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">Dr. Feit\u2019s body was examined at the scene of the crash by several people. Trooper Darryl Polite testified that he did not notice any cuts, lacerations, abrasions, or bruises on Dr. Feit\u2019s body. Segelbacher made visual observations of Dr. Feit\u2019s body both at the scene and at his office, and did not note any trauma to the body. In addition, Segelbacher inspected the car\u2019s interior for possible evidence of impact with the body but found no evidence of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">Dr. Marcello Zappi performed an autopsy and prepared an autopsy report. <em>App. </em>at 256-61. The autopsy lists as the cause of death: \u201cMyocardial infarction, old due to atherosclerotic obstruction of coronary arteries.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 259. The report also notes atherosclerotic obstruction in the right and left coronary arteries which reaches a maximum of 50% blockage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>at 257. The autopsy states there are \u201cno discernible bony fractures nor signs of trauma,\u201d and Zappi made no findings of any injuries, fractures, abrasions, lacerations, or anything else \u201cunusual that would raise suspicion of any type of trauma.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256-59. In addition, Dr. Zappi put Dr. Feit\u2019s joints and extremities through movements, and this examination caused him to rule out trauma to the vertebral column, including the base of the skull and the extremities. After an internal examination of Dr. Feit\u2019s body, Dr. Zappi concluded that there was no trauma or injury to Dr. Feit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Frani Feit\u2019s initial claim for the additional $1,000,000 in accidental death benefits was denied by Great-West on August 15, 2002, because the death certificate listed \u201cnatural cause\u201d as the cause of death. Frani Feit responded to this denial by seeking reconsideration, and provided Great-West with the autopsy report, the accident report, an EKG report from Dr. Feit\u2019s cardiologist, and evidence that the car was totaled. Great-West provided this information to a consulting physician, who reaffirmed the autopsy findings. After considering this new evidence, Greab-West again rejected Frani Feit\u2019s accidental death benefit claim. <em>App. </em>at 250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Frani Feit commenced this lawsuit on May 15, 2008, in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Passaic County. Great-West removed this case to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey based on diversity jurisdiction. During discovery, Frani Feit named two experts, Dr. Arthur Fisch (Cardiologist) and Dr. Due Duong (Pathologist). Greab-West deposed these experts. <em>See App. </em>at 79-153.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">At trial, Dr. Fisch and Dr. Duong both testified that the autopsy\u2019s stated cause of death, a myocardial infarction, did not actually cause Dr. Feit\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both doctors gave several reasons for this conclusion, and did so after examining the autopsy report, the police accident report, the death certificate, and Dr. Feit\u2019s medical records. First, they noted a lack of findings of clots or thrombus, which would generally be present in the case of an acute myocardial infarction. Next, they noted that 50% blockage generally does not result in a heart attack. Then, the experts stated that the small scar in the left ventricle noted in the autopsy report reflects an old, small injury, unrelated to Dr. Feit\u2019s death. Finally, the experts noted that the normal EKG four months before the crash demonstrated that Dr. Feit did not suffer from heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">Both experts also testified that the autopsy was incomplete and deficient due to the insufficient internal examination of the head and neck. Dr. Duong was even prepared to testify, as his expert report stated, that \u201cI can state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty [that] Dr. Feit died of head and neck injuries during the car accident.\u201d <em>App. </em>at 157. Greab-West filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of the experts, and this motion was granted by the District Court only with respect to Dr. Duong\u2019s conclusion that head and neck injuries caused Dr. Feit\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>In granting the motion <em>in limine, </em>the District Court first noted that a hearing was unnecessary because there was already a substantial evidentiary record consisting of the expert report, deposition, and letter brief filed by Frani Feit in opposition to the motion. <em>App. </em>at 11. In examining the reliability of Dr. Duong\u2019s head and neck injury conclusion, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">Thus, Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion on cause of death can be summarized as proceeding from a rejection of myocardial infarction as the cause of death, acknowledgment that a fatal car accident may, in the absence of external injuries, suggest head and neck injury as a possible cause of death, recognition that the autopsy did not include an examination of Dr. Feit\u2019s head or an internal examination of the neck or spine, and a conclusion that head and neck injury is in fact the actual cause of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 14. Therefore, the District Court granted the motion in limine with respect to Dr. Duong\u2019s conclusion that a head and neck injury was the cause of death, stating that \u201cDr. Duong\u2019s opinion that Dr. Feit died of a head or neck injury is pure speculation, devoid of any discernible evidence or scientific method.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Frani Feit filed a motion to reconsider, and attached a Certification from Dr. Duong. <em>App. </em>at 160-63. This Certification explained Dr. Duong\u2019s \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d methodology, and sought to clarify how he arrived at his conclusion as to the cause of death. <em>Id. </em>The District Court denied this motion, and in doing so reviewed the \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d case law and \u201cfound Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion wanting and inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168. Specifically, the District Court pointed out that Dr. Duong failed to offer a reasonable explanation for eliminating a new fatal arrhythmia as an alternative theory of causation, despite acknowledging an arrhythmia as a possibility at his deposition. <em>Id. </em>at 169-70. In addition, the District Court generally regarded Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion as \u201csubjective beliefs or unsupported speculation,\u201d due to the insufficient facts regarding the possibility of a head or neck injury. <em>Id. </em>at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">At trial, after Frani Feit rested, Greats West moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cFRCP\u201d) 50(a) and renewed their previous summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Court reserved decision on these motions, and Great-West proceeded to present its case. At the close of its evidence, Great-West renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law, and the District Court once again reserved its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">On October 20, 2006, after two days of deliberations, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Frani Feit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On November 14, 2006, the District Court stated that it \u201ccarefully considered\u201d Great-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>West\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and denied it. <em>Id. </em>at 213. The District Court thereafter entered judgment for Frani Feit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">On January 26, 2007, the District Court granted Great-West\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to FRCP 50(b), and conditionally granted GreatWest\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>App. </em>at 21-50. In granting Great-West\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the District Court found that Frani Feit failed to present sufficient evidence that Dr. Feit suffered <em>any </em>\u201cbodily injury,\u201d a prerequisite for a jury to find in Frani Feit\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>at 38. As a result of granting Great-West\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Great-West. <em>Id. </em>at 50. Frani Feit filed a timely Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 because Frani Feit (Appellant/Plaintiff) is a resident of New Jersey, Great-West (Respondent/Defendant) is a Colorado corporation, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. This Court has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\n<em>A Granting of Rule 50(b) Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4rR\">This Court exercises plenary review over the District Court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b). <em>Delli Santi v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>88 F.3d 192, 200 (3d Cir.1996). In determining whether this motion for judgment as a matter of law was properly granted, we must \u201cinquire whether there is any legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [Frani Feit].\u201d <em>Weisgram v. Marley Co., </em>528 U.S. 440, 453-54, 120 S.Ct. 1011, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (2000) (internal quotations omitted). In making this determination, we \u201cmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of [Frani Feit], and [we] may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). However, \u201c[t]he question is not whether there is literally no evidence supporting the party against whom the [Rule 50(b) ] motion is directed but whether there is evidence upon which the jury could properly find a verdict for that party.\u201d <em>Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </em>4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir.1993) (citing <em>Patzig v. O\u2019Neil, </em>577 F.2d 841, 846 (3d Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">In this case, the jury found that Frani Feit proved the following two elements for recovery under an accidental death benefit clause: (1) Dr. Feit suffered some type of bodily injury and (2) said bodily injury activated or excited a preexisting medical condition which was passive or dormant prior to the crash, and which in conjunction with the bodily injury caused Dr. Feit\u2019s death. <em>App. </em>at 173-74. Therefore, this Court must examine whether there was sufficient evidence presented at trial for a reasonable jury to make these two findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Frani Feit offered no direct evidence of any bodily injury suffered by Dr. Feit as a result of his car crash. However, Frani Feit argues that she presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow a jury to infer that Dr. Feit suffered <em>some </em>bodily injury during the crash. Effectively, her theory is as follows: it is well within the jury\u2019s province to infer that bodily injury resulted from a car crash where an unrestrained driver\u2019s car left the road in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>violent fashion and came to rest 670 feet from the road after colliding with an embankment. <em>Appellant\u2019s Br. </em>at 32. We agree -with Frani Feit that the District Court erred in determining that she failed to provide sufficient evidence of a bodily-injury suffered by Dr. Feit, as the circumstantial evidence about the nature of the car crash provided a legally sufficient basis for the jury to find that Dr. Feit suffered at least some bodily injury, even if only minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">However, this Court will still affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to grant judgment as a matter of law because we are compelled to conclude that Frani Feit presented virtually no evidence to permit a jury to find that Dr. Feit had an underlying heart condition or that some unspecified bodily injury triggered or activated an underlying heart condition, which in conjunction with the injury caused Dr. Feit\u2019s death.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In fact, Feit argued just the opposite in her opening appellate brief, claiming that Dr. Feit \u201chad no cardiac disease or illness.\u201d <em>Appellant\u2019s Br. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Generally, expert testimony is needed to prove causation of a medical condition. <em>See J.W. v. L.R., </em>325 N.J.Super. 543, 740 A.2d 146, 149 (1999) (citing <em>Allendorf v. Kaiserman Enters., </em>266 N.J.Super. 662, 630 A.2d 402 (1993)); <em>see also Bushman v. Halm, </em>798 F.2d 651, 659 (3d Cir.1986). Here, Frani Feit\u2019s experts testified that a heart condition was <em>not </em>the cause of Dr. Feit\u2019s death, and thus them testimony does not support the jury\u2019s finding that an underlying condition was triggered by the crash. Dr. Zappi was the only expert who addressed this \u201ctriggering\u201d issue at trial, and he simply conceded upon cross examination that given Dr. Feit\u2019s old heart attack and the nature of the crash, it was \u201cpossible\u201d but not likely that Dr. Feit\u2019s preexisting condition could have been triggered. Circumstantial evidence is defined as \u201ca preponderance of probabilities according to the common experience of mankind.\u201d <em>Fedorczyk v. Caribbean Cruise Lines, Ltd., </em>82 F.3d 69, 74 (3d Cir.1996) (citing <em>Bornstein v. Metropolitan Bottling Co., 26 </em>N.J. 263, 139 A.2d 404, 411 (1958)). However, \u201cthe possibility of the existence of an event does not tend to prove its probability.\u201d <em>Fedorczyk, </em>82 F.3d at 75. Because Dr. Zappi only testified in terms of possibilities, there was insufficient medical testimony to support a jury finding on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Even if we were to conclude that an expert did not need to testify about causation in order for Frani Feit to prevail, the evidence in support of the \u201ctriggering\u201d theory of causation is insufficient to permit the jury to infer causation. Frani Feit offered no evidence of a triggering of an underlying heart condition. Frani Feit argues that it \u201cis a matter of common knowledge that a stressful event like a violent car accident can cause bodily injury that triggers a cardiac event.\u201d <em>Reply Br. </em>at 9. This argument is far too speculative, as it speaks again only of possibilities rather than probabilities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a whole, the evidence offered by Frani Feit does not provide a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a jury to find in her favor on the issue of causation. Therefore, this Court will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision granting Great-West\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\n<em>B. Conditional Granting of New Trial Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Because this Court will affirm the District Court\u2019s granting of Great-West\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion, it is unnecessary to determine whether the new trial motion was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>C. Exclusion of Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">This Court reviews the decision to exclude expert opinions for abuse of discretion. <em>General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 143, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). In addition, we review the District Court\u2019s decision of whether a hearing was required before ruling on the admissibility of an expert\u2019s opinion for abuse of discretion. <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (\u201cThe trial court must have the same kind of latitude in deciding <em>how </em>to test an expert\u2019s reliability, and to decide whether or when special briefing or other proceedings are needed to investigate reliability, as it enjoys when it decides <em>whether or not </em>that expert\u2019s relevant testimony is reliable.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We first must address whether the District Court abused its discretion in determining that no hearing was required before ruling on the reliability of Dr. Duong\u2019s conclusion that a head and neck injury caused Dr. Feit\u2019s death. Although it is true that this Court has \u201clong stressed the importance of <em>in limine </em>hearings under Rule 104(a) in making the reliability determination required under Rule 702 and <em>Daubert,\u201d </em>it is within the discretion of the District Court to determine whether a hearing is necessary. <em>Padillas v. Stork-Gamco, Inc., </em>186 F.3d 412, 417-18 (3d Cir.1999). In <em>Padillas, </em>this Court determined that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to hold a hearing where the evidentiary record before the District Court was insufficient to allow the District Court to determine what methodology was used by the expert in arriving at his conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">In this case, the District Court decided that it did not need to conduct a hearing on the reliability of Dr. Duong\u2019s proposed testimony because there was an adequate factual record. <em>App. </em>at 11. The District Court noted that \u201c [t]he parties have briefed the issues of admissibility of expert testimony in both the summary judgment context and in the instant <em>in limine </em>motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition to these briefs, the District Court also had the deposition testimony of Dr. Duong, which the District Court noted \u201creveal[s] that Plaintiffs expert ] ha[d] ample opportunity to respond to Defendant\u2019s challenges to [his] conclusions, analyses and methodologies, and to explain [his] methods and opinions.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>It should also be noted that in Frani Feit\u2019s Letter Brief in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine, </em>Frani Feit\u2019s attorney specifically stated that \u201cduring the course of their deposition testimony, [the experts] have further stated the bases of their opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Therefore, when the District Court granted Great-West\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and excluded certain portions of Dr. Duong\u2019s testimony, the District Court had a sufficient factual record before it to ascertain Dr. Duong\u2019s methodology.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Oddi v. Ford Motor Co., </em>234 F.3d 136, 154 (3d Cir.2000) (concluding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in not holding a hearing where the District Court had before it the depositions and affidavits of the plaintiffs experts); <em>see also Kumho, </em>526 U.S. at 142, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (approving of District Court\u2019s denial of hearing where the District Court determined that the two depositions before it were sufficient to allow an inquiry under <em>Dau-</em>bert). Because the factual record was sufficient to allow the District Court to make a proper reliability determination under <em>Daubert, </em>we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in deciding the motion <em>in limine </em>without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The District Court also did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion that a head and neck injury caused Dr. Feit\u2019s death. Frani Feit argues that the District Court should not have excluded Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion on the cause of death because Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion was based upon a properly conducted differential diagnosis. However, although this Court generally recognizes differential diagnosis as a reliable methodology, <em>Heller v. Shaw Indus., Inc., </em>167 F.3d 146, 156 (3d Cir.1999), the differential diagnosis must be properly performed in order to be reliable. <em>See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., </em>35 F.3d 717, 758-59 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">To properly perform a differential diagnosis, an expert must perform two steps: (1) \u201cRule in\u201d all possible causes of Dr. Feit\u2019s death and (2) \u201cRule out\u201d causes through a process of elimination whereby the last remaining potential cause is deemed the most likely cause of death. <em>See Creanga v. Jardal, </em>185 N.J. 345, 886 A.2d 633, 639 (2005). Here, the District Court noted several aspects of Dr. Duong\u2019s differential diagnosis that rendered it unreliable. First, the District Court, in initially granting Great-West\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>stated that \u201cDr. Duong did not consider any other possible cause of death besides the rejected myocardial infarction theory and the conclusion of head or neck injuries that he espouses.\u201d <em>App. </em>at 16. Dr. Duong\u2019s differential diagnosis was therefore unreliable because he failed adequately to \u201crule in\u201d potential causes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The District Court also noted in its denial of Frani Feit\u2019s motion for reconsideration that Dr. Duong failed to rule out the possibility- of a new fatal heart' arrhythmia, <em>id. </em>at 169-70, despite Dr. Duong\u2019s acknowledgment that a new fatal heart arrhythmia could have possibly caused death and was undetectable by autopsy. <em>Id. </em>at 117; <em>see Creanga, </em>886 A.2d at 640 (stating that a court can exclude evidence if an expert fails to offer an explanation for why a proffered alternative cause was ruled out).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In addition, even if the District Court determined that the underlying methodology (i.e. the differential diagnosis) was reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>able, the District Court could still determine that the conclusion reached by Dr. Duong did not reliably flow from the data and methodology. <em>Heller, </em>167 F.3d at 159; <em>see also General Elec. Co., </em>522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. 512 (\u201cA court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d). Here, the District Court determined that the allegedly insufficient autopsy report prevented Dr. Duong from ever being able effectively to \u201crule in\u201d or \u201crule out\u201d head and neck injury as the cause of Dr. Feit\u2019s death. <em>App. </em>at 170. Although we acknowledge that it is not fatal to a differential diagnosis that Dr. Duong could not affirmatively point to autopsy findings showing an injury to the head or neck, <em>see Creanga, </em>886 A.2d at 642, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that in this particular case Dr. Duong\u2019s opinion that a head and neck injury caused Dr. Feit\u2019s death was based on nothing more than speculation. <em>See App. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We have considered all other arguments made by the parties on appeal and conclude that no further discussion is necessary. For the above reasons, we will affirm the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-16\">. At trial, Dr. Zappi admitted that if Segel-bacher had provided incorrect or incomplete information about chest pains allegedly experienced by Dr. Feit prior to the crash, it would affect his opinion about the cause of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-24\">. However, the microscopic portion of the autopsy report lists \"[c]oronary atherosclero<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sis, moderate to severe,\u201d <em>App. </em>at 260, which Dr. Zappi testified means 70-75% blockage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">.

Moreover, Dr. Fisch's expert report concludes that neither \u201can acute cardiac event such as a myocardial infarction [nor] a chronic cardiac condition contributed to [Dr. Feit\u2019s] death.\u201d <em>App. </em>at 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">.

In addition, Feit failed to provide sufficient evidence that any injury suffered by Dr. Feit in the accident was \"standing alone, the direct, efficient and predominant\" cause of death. <em>App. </em>at 173.

Although Frani Feit argues that \u201ca fair reading of the discovery deposition indicates that Dr. Duong attempted to explain his differential diagnosis, but that defense counsel interrupted him or asked him limiting questions,\u201d she cites no examples of such conduct. <em>Appellant\u2019s Br. </em>at 48. We therefore will not address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. Although the District Court did not directly reference the term \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d in its opinion granting Great-West's motion <em>in limine, </em>the District Court nonetheless understood the basic methodology Dr. Duong utilized. <em>See App. </em>at 14 (summarizing the process at which Dr. Duong arrived at his conclusion). Later, when the District Court denied Frani Feit\u2019s motion to reconsider, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>District Court explicitly addressed the \"differential diagnosis\u201d methodology by name. <em>Id. </em>at 164-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Frani Feit argues that there were only two possible causes of death, and that the District Court was wrong in stating that Dr. Duong failed to consider any other possible causes. <em>Appellant\u2019s Br. </em>at 45. However, the New Jersey Supreme Court states that it is error to \"fail[ ] to consider a plausible hypothesis that would explain the condition.\u201d <em>Creanga, </em>886 A.2d at 639. Here, it appears as though Dr. Duong simply picked the two most likely causes of death, and eliminated one based upon the available data. This error by Dr. Duong renders his opinion unreliable, because he failed to consider other <em>possible </em>causes of death (i.e., stroke, drug overdose, etc.), even if these other possible causes of death could have been ruled out through analysis of the autopsy report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
