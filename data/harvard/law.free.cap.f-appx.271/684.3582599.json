We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of motions to reopen and review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion or violate petitioners\u2019 due process rights because it mailed its December 14, 2004 decision to the address listed on the change of address form. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(f), 1003.13; <em>see also Singh v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir.2007) (BIA fulfills its statutory duty of service if a decision was properly mailed). Petitioners contend that their nonreceipt is attributable to their former counsel because he submitted a change of address form with an incorrect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>address. Petitioners recourse would be to file an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 969, 979 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
