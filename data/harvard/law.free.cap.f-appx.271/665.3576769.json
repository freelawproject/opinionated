We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The government did not waive its current contentions when it requested a remand to the BIA in Mao\u2019s prior petition for review. <em>See Li v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 913, 918-19 (9th Cir.2007) (order) (acknowledging that government should retain flexibility to voluntarily remand in order to correct prior actions that have been subsequently called into question by emerging case law).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">In the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding by the IJ, the BIA erred by resting its denial of relief on Mao\u2019s failure to provide corroborating evidence. <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">In light of our conclusion regarding the issue of adverse credibility as determined by the BIA, Mao\u2019s due process contention is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review, and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
