(\u201cCobalt\u201d) stipulated that it would be bound by the district court\u2019s final judgment order in the related ongoing litigation <em>Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. Mylan Laboratories Inc., </em>Case No. 04-cv-1689 (SRC) (D.N.J.) <em>(\u201cOrtho v. Mylan\u201d). </em>Accordingly, when the district court entered its judgment permanently enjoining Mylan from infringing Ortho McNeil\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 4,513,006 (\u2019006) covering topira-mate, it also entered final judgment against Cobalt. Cobalt retained its rights to appeal to this court, but stipulated that such an appeal would be based on the record of the <em>Ortho v. Mylan </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">For the reasons set forth in the simultaneously issued opinion <em>Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. Mylan Laboratories, </em>No.2007-1223, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment against Cobalt. Because Cobalt\u2019s argument that claim 1 is rendered indefinite by the inclusion of the phrase \u201cmay be\u201d in the second clause that describes R2 and R3 and/or R4 and R5 when they are together was not presented to the district court, and because Cobalt stipulated that its appeal be based on the record in <em>Ortho v. Mylan, </em>this court declines to consider that argument now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
