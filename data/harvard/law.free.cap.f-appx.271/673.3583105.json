We granted a certificate of ap-pealability as to three ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition. <em>Tanner v. McDaniel, </em>493 F.3d 1135, 1139 (9th Cir.2007). To obtain habeas relief, Romero must demonstrate that the Washington state court\u2019s decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Where the state court makes \u201cmistakes in reasoning\u201d or adopts \u201cthe wrong legal rule or framework,\u201d however, this court evaluates <em>de novo </em>petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims in an inquiry that is not limited to the reasoning of the state court. <em>Frantz v. Hazey, </em>513 F.3d 1002, 1012, 1016 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc). Accordingly, we ask with respect to each of Romero\u2019s claims whether the state court properly applied the prejudice prong from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>such that our review should be <em>de novo. See </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (holding that a petitioner must show \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d); <em>see also Jackson v. Calderon, </em>211 F.3d 1148, 1155 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Strickland </em>for the proposition that we \u201cneed not decide whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when the claim of ineffectiveness may be rejected for lack of prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">With respect to Romero\u2019s claim that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to present a diminished capacity defense constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, the Commissioner correctly applied the standard set forth in <em>Strickland. </em>Romero\u2019s testimony regarding his actions immediately before and after the shooting suggests that he understood that his actions were reckless and that he was concocting an elaborate alibi. Accordingly, habeas corpus relief is not warranted on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">As to Romero\u2019s counsel\u2019s use of an excusable homicide defense, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent because the Commissioner utilized Washington\u2019s \u201cactual and substantial prejudice\u201d standard rather than the standard under <em>Strickland. Frantz, </em>513 F.3d at 1012; <em>Barker v. Fleming, </em>423 F.3d 1085, 1095 n. 5 (9th Cir.2005) (noting the conflict between Washington\u2019s \u201cactual and substantial prejudice\u201d standard and other federal prejudice standards). We apply <em>de novo </em>review, but conclude that Romero cannot demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his trial would have been different if counsel had not submitted a jury instruction setting forth the statutory defense of excusable homicide and also stipulated to facts making the defense legally impossible. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The evidence against Romero was substantial. Additionally, the excusable homicide jury instruction indicated that excusable homicide was a defense to the charge of second degree murder and both charges of manslaughter. Romero suffered no prejudice because the jury acquit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ted him of second degree murder, demonstrating that it did not mistakenly believe that it must convict Romero of the most serious charge against him if it rejected the excusable homicide defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Likewise, the Commissioner\u2019s decision regarding trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview the state\u2019s expert witness was also \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent because the Commissioner applied an incorrect legal standard. <em>See Frantz, </em>513 F.3d at 1012; <em>Barker, </em>423 F.3d at 1095 n. 5. Even applying <em>de novo </em>review, however, Romero cannot show that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if trial counsel had interviewed the state\u2019s pathologist pri- or to trial. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. During his testimony, the state\u2019s pathologist clarified that his characterization of Russian roulette was not a legal definition and might not even extend to other pathologists. Additionally, even assuming that the pathologist\u2019s testimony made the version of events in Romero\u2019s videotaped interview more likely, Romero expressly refuted his videotaped statement at trial. As a result, Romero cannot demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Lewis, </em>489 F.3d 993, 1002 (9th Cir.2007). In this case, that decision was rendered by the Commissioner of the Washington Supreme Court because the Washington Supreme Court summarily denied Romero's Motion to Modify the Commissioner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
