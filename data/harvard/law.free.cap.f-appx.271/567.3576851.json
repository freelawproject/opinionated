Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Lo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.2003), we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">We reject the government\u2019s contention that Espino was not ordered deported <em>in absentia. </em>Espino successfully appealed <em>pro se </em>from his 1995 deportation order, and the BIA remanded for further proceedings. The 1995 order therefore did not become final. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B) (defining finality of deportation order). The IJ issued the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>deportation order on October 14, 1997, after deciding \u201cto proceed <em>in absentia.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The agency abused its discretion in con- . eluding that the notice of hearing sent to counsel was sufficient. Espino\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA stated that he was proceeding <em>pro se, </em>as did the BIA\u2019s remand order of August 1, 1997 that was sent to Espino at his home address. Therefore, subsequent hearing notices on remand, sent only to Espino\u2019s former counsel, cannot be construed as notice to Espino. <em>See Dobrota v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (agency \u201cmay generally satisfy notice requirements by mailing notice of the hearing to an alien <em>..., or, </em>if she is represented, to her attorney\u2019s address of record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The BIA also erred in concluding that Espino falsely claimed that he appeared in immigration court on October 17, 1997. His affidavit states only: \u201cIn October 1997, I appeared at the Immigration Court. I was advised by the court that my case would be transferred to another courtroom.\u201d Accordingly, we remand with directions that the agency reopen Espino\u2019s proceedings. <em>See Sembiring v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 991 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b591-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
