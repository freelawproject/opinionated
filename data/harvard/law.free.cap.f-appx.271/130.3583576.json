Mar. 23, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A71 338 981 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo, June 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard and treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">As a preliminary matter, the Government correctly argues that many of Poplavskiy\u2019s arguments on appeal were not properly raised before the BIA and are, thus, unexhausted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 124 (2d Cir.2007). Indeed, as a statutory, and, thus, jurisdictional matter, we are without jurisdiction to review Poplavskiy\u2019s claim that his case should be remanded for consideration of a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, pursuant to the judicially imposed, but mandatory, issue exhaustion requirement, we decline to consider Poplavskiy\u2019s arguments that: (1) the IJ failed to consider his eligibility for asylum under 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(B) due to his statelessness; and (2) the IJ erred by not placing the burden of proof on the government to show he no longer meets the definition of a refugee. <em>See Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 124. However, we do not agree with the government that Poplavskiy failed to exhaust his arguments that: (1) his case should be remanded for the IJ to consider whether the continued renewal of the Lautenberg Amendment precludes the IJ from finding that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Ukraine; and (2) substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that he did not suffer past persecution. Accordingly, we proceed to consider those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Poplavskiy\u2019s argument that the agency failed to consider the cumulative significance of his past experiences is without merit. The IJ considered the harm suffered by Poplavskiy\u2019s family members and enumerated the various instances of bullying, verbal abuse and taunts that Poplavskiy claimed he suffered at the hands of teachers, fellow students, and communists at his public school and found that \u201cthe evidence here\u201d failed to establish that his experiences amount to persecution. Indeed, Poplavskiy does not identify any portion of the IJ\u2019s decision in which his alleged experiences were evaluated in isolation and deemed insufficient to amount to persecution. <em>Cf. Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 290 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that \u201c[a]s a general principle, an asylum applicant cannot claim past persecution based solely on harm that was inflicted on a family member on account of that family member\u2019s political opinion or other protected characteristic.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Poplavskiy also challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that he did not suffer past persecution. As we have held, the difference between harassment and persecution is one of degree, which must be assessed with regard to the context in which the mistreatment occurs. The incidents described, while doubtlessly traumatic for a child, do not rise above mere harassment. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to conclude that Poplavskiy\u2019s past mistreatment rises to the level of persecution. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Euse-bio v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1088, 1091 (8th Cir.2004) (upholding agency\u2019s finding of no persecution where applicant was chased or beaten, and briefly detained by authorities while participating in rallies).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Furthermore, Poplavskiy argues that the IJ erred by requiring him to show physical harm to establish past persecution. We disagree that the IJ required him to show physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Poplavskiy further argues that the IJ erred in finding a fundamental change in circumstances in light of Congress\u2019s repeated renewal of the Lautenberg Amendment, providing refugee status to, <em>inter alios, </em>certain evangelical Christians from Ukraine. The Lautenberg Amendment provides that a covered alien \u201cmay establish, for purposes of admission as a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157], that the alien has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... religion ... by asserting such a fear and asserting a credible basis for concern about the possibility of such persecution.\u201d Pub.L. No. 101-167, Title V, \u00a7 599D, 103 Stat. 1261 (1989) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157 note (as amended) (Establishing Categories of Aliens for Purposes of Refugee Determinations)). As Poplavskiy concedes, he is in removal proceedings and is therefore applying for asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, as opposed to refugee status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157. As a result, the Lautenberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Amendment is inapplicable to Poplavskiy\u2019s application for relief. <em>See Halaim v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe plain meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, as evinced by its unambiguous text, limits its application to section 207 [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157] proceedings only.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">As to his argument that the Lautenberg Amendment should be considered in the context of whether there has been a \u201cfundamental change\u201d in Ukraine, we find that Congress\u2019s repeated renewal of the Lautenberg Amendment is not determinative of whether country conditions have changed for purposes of Poplavskiy\u2019s individual asylum application. Indeed, the cases Poplavskiy relies on to support his argument are minority opinions. In this case the agency conducted an individualized analysis and found the background evidence sufficient to establish a fundamental change in circumstances, which undermined the objective reasonableness of Poplavskiy\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The Lautenberg Amendment itself requires \u201ceach applicant to \u2018establish\u2019 a particularized well-founded fear, even if the applicant\u2019s evidence pertains to co-religion-ists generally.\u201d <em>Halaim, </em>358 F.3d at 1134. The IJ found that Poplavskiy failed to demonstrate a \u201ccredible basis for concern\u201d based on the background material on Ukraine in the record. Because substantial evidence supports this determination, the IJ did not err by failing to consider the Lautenberg Amendment in context of whether there has been a \u201cfundamental change.\u201d <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Poplavskiy did not challenge the Id\u2019s denial of CAT relief to the BIA or to this Court. Accordingly, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Because Poplavskiy was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The stay of removal that the- Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
