He contends that he was entitled to specific performance of his original plea agreement, even though the original agreement provided for a sentence that was illegal under California law. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">We review a denial of a habeas petition de novo. <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006). As this petition was filed after April 24, 1996, it is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 335-36, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">To grant the writ of habeas corpus under AEDPA, Womack must show that the California State Court unreasonably applied clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A criminal defendant has a due process right to enforce the terms of his plea agreement. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 261-62, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). When a promise on which a plea rests is violated, the remedy is either specific performance of the plea agreement or the opportunity to withdraw the plea. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495. In choosing between the two, state courts are in a better position to select the appropriate remedy. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">Here, Womack refused the opportunity to withdraw his plea and demanded specific performance. However, he failed to show the California Court of Appeal unreasonably applied <em>Santobello </em>because he was still given the option to withdraw his plea. We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
