R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b676-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Welli Budi Santoso and his wife are natives and citizens of Indonesia. They petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying their claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part, and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioners\u2019 asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, because the record does not compel a finding that it is more likely than not that petitioners will be persecuted on account of their religion if they return to Indonesia. <em>See Hak-eem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1179-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Substantial evidence further supports the denial of CAT relief, because petitioners did not show it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if they return to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Lastly, petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated their right to due process by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Falcon Carriche v. INS, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
