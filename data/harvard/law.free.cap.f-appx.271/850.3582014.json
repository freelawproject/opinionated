On appeal, Cervera argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court overemphasized his criminal history to the exclusion of any consideration of the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Additionally, Cervera contends that appropriately weighing his innocuous motivation for reentry, the minor nature of most of his prior offenses, and the overly severe guideline treatment of the offense, his 48-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Recently, the Supreme Court clarified that courts of appeal are to review sentences for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-26\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><em>Id. </em>To that end, the district court \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally reasonable, our analysis then turns to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d and \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d rather than reviewing each individual decision made during the sentencing process. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and alteration omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). We have noted that \u201ca district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one Section 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179 (11th Cir.2008). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-16\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-17\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (summarizing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in reviewing sentences for reasonableness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), a federal appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence imposed within the guideline range. <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 2462. Although we do not apply such a presumption, we will ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>see United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007) (declining to apply a presumption of reasonableness to within-guideline sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Cerv-era\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable because the district court specifically stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, thoroughly explained its reasoning for sentencing Cervera within the guideline range, considered Cervera\u2019s arguments for a below-guideline sentence, and addressed several of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. We also conclude that Cervera fails to meet his burden of showing that his 48-month sentence, which is near the low end of the advisory guideline range, is substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Cervera\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-11\">. <em>United States v.
