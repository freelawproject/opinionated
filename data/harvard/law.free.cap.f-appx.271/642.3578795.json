Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part, and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-18\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the government rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution through an individualized analysis of changed conditions in India. <em>See id. </em>at 998-1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-19\">Because Singh does not have a well-founded fear of persecution, it necessarily follows that he does not qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-20\">Singh\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is unavailing because the BIA\u2019s merits determination is dispositive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-21\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Singh has not shown it is more likely than not that he will suffer torture if he returns to India. <em>See El Himri v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-22\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Singh\u2019s humanitarian asylum claim, because he did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
