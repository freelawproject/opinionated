Telesca, Judge) denying, in part, Leitner\u2019s motion for return of property, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the procedural history, facts, and relevant issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u201c \u2018[Wlhere no criminal proceedings against the movant are pending or have transpired,\u2019 relief under Rule 41(g) is equitable in nature.\u201d <em>De Almeida v. United States, </em>459 F.3d 377, 379-80 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Mora v. United States, </em>955 F.2d 156, 158 (2d Cir.1992)). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s fashioning of an equitable remedy for abuse of discretion. <em>See Abrahamson v. Bd. of Educ. of Wappingers Falls Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>374 F.3d 66, 76 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Onwubiko v. United States, </em>969 F.2d 1392, 1397 (2d Cir.1992), <em>overruled cm other grounds by Polanco v. U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin., </em>158 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The District Court did not exceed its allowable discretion in denying Leitner\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. The affidavit of Special Agent Jarod Koopman established probable cause to believe that evidence of criminal tax offenses and conspiracy to defraud the government would be found at Leitner\u2019s residence. <em>See United States v. Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 95, 126 S.Ct. 1494, 164 L.Ed.2d 195 (2006) (\u201cProbable cause exists when \u2018there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)); <em>see also United States v. Singh, </em>390 F.3d 168, 181 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cIn reviewing a magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination, we accord substantial deference to the magistrate\u2019s finding and limit our review to whether the issuing judicial officer had a substantial basis for the finding of probable cause.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Leitner\u2019s argument that the warrant was impermissibly broad is without merit. The Fourth Amendment \u201cspecifies only two matters that must be \u2018particularly describ[ed]\u2019 in the warrant: \u2018the place to be searched\u2019 and \u2018the persons or things to be seized.\u2019 ... The Fourth Amendment does not require that the warrant set forth the magistrate\u2019s basis for finding probable cause....\u201d <em>Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. at 97-98, 126 S.Ct. 1494. Leitner does not challenge the sufficiency of the description of his residence. As for the description of the things to be seized, the warrant listed types of records relating to Leitner\u2019s finances, correspondence with the IRS, safe deposit box records, client lists, and financial records and correspondence relating to PQI/ SPI. In addition, the warrant specified a time-period, from the present back to 2002. (According to Koopman\u2019s affidavit, Leitner said he had \u201cbeen involved in PQI/ SPI since its inception in 2002.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Under the circumstances, we find that the warrant was sufficiently specific to \u201cenable the executing officer to ascertain and identify with reasonable certainty those items that the magistrate has authorized him to seize.\u201d <em>United States v. George, </em>975 F.2d 72, 75 (2d Cir.1992). The list of items was neither generic nor so wide-ranging as to authorize the seizure of any \u201cevidence.\u201d Accordingly, there was no need to identify the particular criminal activities under investigation. <em>See id. </em>at 77. And because we find no overbreadth, the warrant\u2019s failure to incorporate Koop-man\u2019s affidavit is immaterial. <em>Cf. Groh v. Ramirez, </em>540 U.S. 551, 557-58, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004) (noting that an incorporated affidavit\u2019s specificity may cure an overbroad warrant); <em>George, </em>975 F.2d at 76 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>In his pending motion for \u201cmandatory judicial notice,\u201d Leitner challenges the authority of Special Agent Koopman and the agents involved in the search and argues that Koopman\u2019s failure to respond to Leitner\u2019s correspondence constitutes an admission of the unlawfulness of the search and seizure. Leitner did not challenge the agents\u2019 authority in the District Court, and thus, he has waived this argument on appeal. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (\u201cIt is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d); <em>Guilbert v. Gardner, </em>480 F.3d 140, 146 n. 4 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In any event, we have considered all of Leitner\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court is AFFIRMED and Leitner\u2019s motion for mandatory judicial notice is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
