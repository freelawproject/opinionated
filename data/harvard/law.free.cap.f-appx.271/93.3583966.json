Donnelly (\u201cRespondent\u201d), Superintendent of the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (John F. Keenan, <em>Judge) </em>granting Petitioner-Appellee Carlos Rodriguez\u2019s petition for a writ of habe-as corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Rodriguez v. Donnelly, </em>No. 01 Civ. 9374(JFK), 2006 WL 2563824 (S.D.N.Y. Sept.5, 2006). Respondent concedes that Rodriguez\u2019s counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance insofar as he failed to file a timely notice of appeal and thus deprived Rodriguez of the opportunity for direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>at *4. However, Respondent argues that Rodriguez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>procedurally defaulted his only remedy for this constitutional violation by failing to make a timely <em>pro se </em>motion for an extension of time to take an appeal, as allowed by New York Criminal Procedure Law (\u201cN.Y.C.P.L.\u201d) \u00a7 460.30(1). Because we find this case to be controlled by our decision in <em>Restrepo v. Kelly, </em>178 F.3d 634 (2d Cir.1999), we reject Respondent\u2019s argument regarding Rodriguez\u2019s procedural default and affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of habeas corpus <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Clark v. Perez, </em>510 F.3d 382, 389 (2d Cir.2008). A federal court normally may not review a habeas petition based upon state claims that have been procedurally defaulted where the relevant procedural bar is an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state ground. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). However, the Supreme Court has instructed that a federal habeas court may nonetheless review such defaulted claims if the petitioner can \u201cdemonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">On appeal, Respondent argues only that Rodriguez has failed to demonstrate cause for his procedural default and makes no argument based upon prejudice resulting therefrom. Respondent concedes that Rodriguez\u2019s trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to file a notice of appeal under N.Y.C.P.L. \u00a7 460.10(1) despite Rodriguez\u2019s request, and we have held that ineffective assistance in precisely the same context was also \u201ccause\u201d for the ensuing procedural default of the habeas petitioner\u2019s claim based on that constitutional violation. <em>See Restrepo, </em>178 F.3d at 640-41. Despite our conclusion in <em>Restrepo, </em>Respondent argues that the ineffective assistance of Rodriguez\u2019s counsel should not serve as <em>both </em>the \u201cunderlying constitutional error\u201d and the \u201ccause\u201d of the procedural default of the section 460.30(1) remedy. In doing so, Respondent relies on Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that cause depends on whether the habeas petitioner can show that an objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the procedural rule at issue. <em>See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 283 n. 24, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (holding that the defendant met such a showing where the prosecutor suppressed exculpatory evidence and the defendant reasonably relied on the prosecutor\u2019s representation that all discovery material had been provided, despite the fact that the prosecutor also maintained an \u201copen file discovery policy\u201d). While <em>Strickler </em>involved prosecutorial misconduct instead of the ineffective assistance of defense counsel, <em>Coleman </em>stated, in dicta, that attorney error that qualifies as constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel would suffice to demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d justifying a petitioner\u2019s procedural default. <em>See Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 753-54, 111 S.Ct. 2546 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). Furthermore, <em>Restrepo </em>explicitly concluded that ineffective assistance of counsel met the <em>Strickler </em>standard of an \u201cexternal\u201d factor. 178 F.3d at 641 (\u201c[A]s stated in <em>Coleman, </em>a violation of the constitutional right to counsel must be considered an external error.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). To the extent that Respondent is arguing that a finding of cause in this context should somehow depend on the diligence or lack thereof on the part of the petitioner, we are not persuaded by such an attempt to urge us, in effect, to overturn <em>Restrepo. </em>Indeed, even if there were grounds to do so, only the Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>would have the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>To the extent that Respondent seeks to add another factor \u2014 a petitioner\u2019s diligence or lack thereof \u2014 to a habeas court\u2019s consideration of procedural default, we reject such an argument. <em>Restrepo </em>explicitly rejected the argument that a petitioner\u2019s failure to timely request leave to file a late notice of appeal could bar federal habeas relief based upon his counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective assistance in failing to file any notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[T]he proceeding at issue is Restrepo\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction. As to that appeal, he had a constitutional right to be represented by counsel, a right that would be denied if the State were allowed to hold him in default for not seeking an extension of time <em>pro </em>se.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We have considered all of Respondent\u2019s arguments and have found them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
