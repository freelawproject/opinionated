After learning that he had not been selected, he filed two informal complaints with the Office of Resolution Management (ORM). The Equal Opportunity Employment (EEO) counselor working on Bowers\u2019 case claims that she could not reach Bowers, so she sent him an Unreachable Notice, a Notice of Rights and Responsibilities, an Alternative Dispute Notice, and a Notice of Withdrawal for each of his complaints and allegedly placed bright green sticky notes on the withdrawal forms, indicating that he should only sign the withdrawal forms if he did not want to follow through with his complaints. Bowers argues that there were not any green notes attached to the forms. Bowers signed the withdrawal forms and sent them back to the EEO counselor, who then notified Bowers that his complaints were closed because he had withdrawn them. Bowers called the counselor asking why the complaints were closed and stating that he had mistakenly signed the withdrawal forms. She then sent him forms for formal complaints, which he filed. ORM dismissed the complaint, finding that Bowers had withdrawn his informal complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Bowers appealed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which also dismissed Bowers\u2019 complaint, refusing to accept that Bowers had mistakenly signed the withdrawal forms. Bowers appealed to the district court, claiming that the DVA discriminated against him in reprisal for his former EEOC complaints and that this violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He requested damages of $300,000 for each alleged discriminatory denial. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss or alternatively for summary judgment and attached to the motion exhibits on matters outside of the pleadings. The district court found, \u201cAlthough defendant has not identified the procedural basis on which he seeks dismissal, his assertion that this action was untimely filed indicates that he seeks dismissal for failure to state a claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finding that more than ten days had passed since Defendant filed the exhibits and that Bowers had not objected to the exhibits, the court found, \u201cRule 12(b) directs the court to treat the motion as one for summary judgment and to dispose of it under Rule 56,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> citing Rule 12(b) and <em>Washington v. Allstate Insurance Co.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court held that Title VII, the ADEA, and the Rehabilitation Act all require exhaustion of administrative remedies and that Bowers had failed to exhaust by knowingly and voluntarily withdrawing his claims before the completion of the EEO process. It dismissed Bowers\u2019 claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">On appeal, Bowers argues that the district court erred in treating Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as a 12(b)(6) motion when Defendants failed to identify the procedural basis for their motion for dismissal and alternatively for summary judgment. He also argues that the district court erred in dismissing the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, since Bowers mistakenly signed the withdrawal forms and indicated to his counselor that he wished to continue pursuing his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims de novo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">When a district court treats a Rule 12(b)(6) motion as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(c) because matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, we review the grant of such a motion just as we would any other grant of summary judgment-that is, we review the grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same legal standards as the district court. Accordingly, summary judgement is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Further, we construe all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party without weighing the evidence, assessing its probative value, or resolving any factual disputes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">We are not persuaded that the district court erred in its decision. As the district court found, all three of the statutes that support Bowers\u2019 discrimination claims require exhaustion of administrative remedies,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Bowers failed to exhaust his remedies by withdrawing his claims. Bowers does not argue that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>coerced into signing these forms, but rather that he mistakenly signed them. Even assuming, as Bowers argues, that there were no green sticky notes alerting Bowers to the fact that he would withdraw his claims if he signed the forms, the text of the forms provided a clear warning. On top, in large bold print, the withdrawal form states, \u201cNOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF EEO COMPLAINT.\u201d The text directly above the signature line reads, \u201cI hereby withdraw this complaint of discrimination and wish to close the complaint at the informal level. I am making this decision of my own free will and without coercion.\u201d As the district court found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cA person who signs a written instrument is presumed to know its contents and cannot avoid its obligations by contending that he did not read it, or that it was not explained or that he did not understand it.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Because Bowers withdrew his claims, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; the district court did not err in dismissing his claims on this basis. Although Bowers appealed the ORM\u2019s dismissal of his initial complaints and obtained a final agency decision, the decision did not address the merits of his discrimination case due to his earlier withdrawal of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Nor do we find error in the district court\u2019s treatment of Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and alternatively for summary judgment as a 12(b)(6) motion, which the court then converted to a Rule 56(c) motion. Bowers does not contest the conversion of the motion from a 12(b)(6) to a Rule 56(c) motion but rather the initial treatment of the motion as a 12(b)(6) motion, despite Defendants\u2019 failure to label the motion as such. Defendants argued in the motion that Bowers had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that his complaint was untimely. \u201cRule 12(b)(6) forms a proper basis for dismissal for failure to exhaust,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as well as a claim that a complaint was untimely filed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the court ultimately dismissed the claims under Rule 56(c), it correctly initially construed the motion as a 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Bowers also disputes various dates, such as the timing of the Agency\u2019s decision regarding Bowers\u2019 withdrawal forms as well as the dates when he spoke with the EEO counselor. None of these disputed facts are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
