His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Harris\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We conclude that Harris\u2019s within-Guidelines-range sentence is not unreasonable, because nothing in the record indicates the court overlooked a relevant factor, gave significant weight to an improper factor, or made a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors. <em>See United States v. Denton, </em>434 F.3d 1104, 1113 (8th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005). Counsel argues that Harris\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because the increase in his statutory maximum sentence, pursuant to the government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 information, unfairly bumped up Harris\u2019s Guidelines career-offender imprisonment range. This argument is unavailing: the district court heard this argument at sentencing and declined to vary from the Guidelines range on this basis, and relevant Guidelines commentary specifically authorizes such an increase in calculating the career-offender offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, comment. (n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-28\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
