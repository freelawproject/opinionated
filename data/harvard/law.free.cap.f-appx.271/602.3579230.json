We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-20\">Because the BIA streamlined this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>See Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 925 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ articulated specific reasons to support her adverse credibility determination, emphasizing inconsistencies in each of the three acts of persecution that Kaur described. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). The pervasive contradictions and ambiguities in Kaur\u2019s descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tions go to the heart of her asylum claim, thus substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>See id. We </em>do not address Kaur\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in streamlining her appeal because she abandoned this claim by failing to provide any supporting authority. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Given that counsel who represented Kaur in the administrative proceedings has since been disbarred by this court, and new counsel has advised us that he is reviewing the record regarding possible translation inadequacies and ineffectiveness of counsel, we stay the mandate for 60 days to provide Kaur the opportunity to file with the BIA a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
