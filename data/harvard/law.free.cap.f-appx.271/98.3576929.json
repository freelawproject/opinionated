Sand, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b123-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">Defendant-Appellant Terry Battiste appeals from the September 7, 2006 judgment of the District Court for the Northern District of New York (Kahn, J.) sentencing him to 79 months\u2019 imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute less than fifty kilograms of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">We review sentencing decisions for reasonableness, asking \u201cwhether the sentencing judge exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion, committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Battiste first argues that the district court did not adequately consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Section 3553(a) identifies factors that the district court \u201cshall consider\u201d when deciding upon a defendant\u2019s sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[W]e have imposed no ... requirement that a sentencing judge precisely identify either the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) or specific arguments bearing on the implementation of those factors in order to comply with her duty to consider all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors along with the Guidelines applicable range.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 29. \u201cAs long as the judge is aware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable, and nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such materials or misperception about their relevance, we will accept that the requisite consideration has occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Rose, </em>496 F.3d 209, 213 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our presumption of compliance with the requirement has particular force when \u201cthe sentencing judge makes abundantly clear that she has read the relevant submissions and that she has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We have no difficulty concluding that the district court complied with the consideration requirement here. The district court stated at the sentencing hearing that it had \u201cconsidered all the pertinent information, including ... the factors outlined in the law, USC 3553, 18 USC.\u201d The district court also evinced its awareness of the applicable advisory Guidelines range by restating it for the record. These statements amply show that the district court \u201c[was] aware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable,\u201d <em>Rose, </em>496 F.3d at 213, and Battiste has not pointed to anything in the record that would \u201cindicate[] misunderstanding about such materials or misperception about their relevance,\u201d <em>id. </em>Accordingly, we find that the district court complied with the requirement, and Battiste\u2019s claim to the contrary therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Battiste further argues that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), which requires the district court to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d He suggests that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), abrogated this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. James, </em>280 F.3d 206 (2d Cir.2002), which held that when the applicable Guidelines range is less than 24 months and the sentence imposed is within that range, \u00a7 3553(c) is satisfied if the district court \u201cstat[es], either explicitly or by adopting an adequately explained analysis in the PSR, the basis for the adjusted offense level and criminal history category that combined to prescribe the applicable sentencing range,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">We need not consider whether Battiste is correct in claiming that <em>Booker </em>abrogated <em>James. </em>Battiste\u2019s claim rests on his assertion that the district court \u201cfail[ed] ... to give any reason why the court imposed a Guidelines sentence.\u201d This assertion is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The district court addressed Battiste\u2019s concerns and gave reasons for its imposition of the sentence it chose. The district court began its sentencing of Battiste by noting that \u201cover the years, you\u2019ve made some bad choices .... [a]nd, obviously, you have to be responsible and accountable for what you did.\u201d No matter \u201c[h]ow it all happened,\u201d continued the court, \u201cit happened.\u201d It also acknowledged that Bat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>tiste \u201cmay have turned a corner\u201d and had \u201cfamily [that] you\u2019ve got in your life, good people who support you and do love you.\u201d Finally, the court observed that \u201cit isn\u2019t over for [Battiste],\u201d as Battiste was \u201cstill <em>young\u201d </em>and would \u201chave choices to make\u201d in the future. Read in its totality and in light of the district court\u2019s statement that it had considered Battiste\u2019s sentencing submissions, which presented mitigation arguments relating to Battiste\u2019s cooperation, family situation, and post-offense conduct, the district court\u2019s explanation of Battiste\u2019s sentence satisfies the \u00a7 3553(c) requirement that the court \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d No greater \u201clength\u201d and \u201cdetail\u201d is required by these \u201ccircumstances.\u201d <em>See United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 210 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Battiste\u2019s final claim is that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of his unique circumstances. We \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In conducting this review, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d Id. \u201cThe fact that [we] might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In support of his substantive reasonableness argument, Battiste mentions \u201cthe dire financial circumstances that fueled his participation in this offense,\u201d his lack of a history of robbery, his post-offense conduct, the effect that incarceration would have on his family, and his cooperation with the Government. Battiste made these arguments to the district court, however, and as discussed above, it is clear that the district court took them into consideration when imposing a sentence. We must defer to its judgment that these factors did not warrant imposing a shorter term of imprisonment. Battiste has not shown that the district court abused its discretion or imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences that were available to it, and his substantive reasonableness challenge therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">We have considered all of Battiste\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
