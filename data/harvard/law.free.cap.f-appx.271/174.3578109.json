For the reasons that follow, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-27\">Inasmuch as we are writing primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not set forth the factual or procedural background except insofar as is helpful to our discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>After Richards waived his right to a jury trial, both he and the government filed motions <em>in limine </em>to preclude certain evidence from being admitted based upon competing interpretations of the willfulness element of \u00a7 879. Richards contended that the statute requires a showing of subjective intent; <em>ie. </em>proof that he actually intended his statements to be perceived as a threat. However, the government argued it need only establish that a reasonable observer would have perceived the statements as a threat to satisfy its burden under of \u00a7 879. Inasmuch as this was to be a bench trial, the court decided to reserve ruling on the motions and hear the disputed evidence with the understanding that it would only consider the relevant evidence after determining whether \u00a7 879 required proof <em>of </em>subjective intent as argued by Richards, or objective intent as argued by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The evidence at trial included the conflicting psychiatric testimony of Dr. Robert Sadoff who testified for Richards, and Dr. Timothy Michals, who testified in rebuttal for the government. Despite their disagreement on some issues, they agreed that Richards was psychotic at the time of the incident that lead to his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Dr. Sadoff concluded that Richards\u2019 \u201cthreats\u201d \u201cwere a product of his psychotic thought disorder [and] were not clearly thought through.\u201d App. 204. In his written report, Dr. Sadoff had diagnosed Richards with \u201cchronic schizophrenia, with paranoid features.\u201d App. 353. He opined that Richards\u2019 statements were delusional, not specifically directed toward anyone, and concluded that Richards did not intend to threaten Mrs. Clinton or cause concern for her safety. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Although Dr. Michals agreed that Richards was psychotic and \u201cseverely mentally disabled,\u201d he disagreed with the diagnosis of schizophrenia with paranoid features. App. 271-72. Dr. Michals believed that Richards made his statements about Mrs. Clinton knowingly, and concluded that Richards had \u201csome awareness\u201d of his actions because he stopped chanting about Hillary Clinton whenever Miller was in his line of sight. App. 250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The district court convicted Richards of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 879(a)(1). The court reasoned that although some at the shelter were laughing at Richards, staff members were sufficiently concerned to remove Richards from the shelter. <em>United States v. Richards, </em>415 F.Supp.2d 547, 550-52 (E.D.Pa.2005). The district court found that the statements were \u201cknowingly\u201d made insofar as they were made voluntarily and intentionally, and not as the result of mistake, duress or coercion. <em>Id. </em>at 552-53. It also concluded that the willfulness element was satisfied. The court believed that the test for willfulness is an objective one as the government had argued. Thus, the government only needed to prove that a reasonable person would perceive Richards\u2019 statements as a threat. <em>Id. </em>at 553-58. Because the district court found that the test for willfulness is an objective one, it did not consider the psychiatric testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 559 n. 6. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">The district court concluded that the willfulness element of \u00a7 879 only requires objective intent. More specifically, the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">[T]he phrase \u201cwillfully\u201d as used in \u00a7 879 requires only that the Government dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>onstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that \u201ca reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm upon or take the life of\u2019 Senator Clinton.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJd\">415 F.Supp.2d at 558 (citing <em>United States v. Kosma, </em>951 F.2d 549, 557 (3d Cir.1991)) (interpreting the term \u201cwillfully\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871, threats against the President).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In explaining how the evidence satisfied that standard, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">It is clear that the people at the shelter who heard Defendant\u2019s threats perceived them as serious ... Miller notified the shelter security personnel. Miller also remained close at hand when Blitman spoke to Defendant in case she needed further assistance. The people in the dinner line moved away from Defendant as he made these threats ... and, at one point, Miller himself registered fear. All of these reactions are evidence that reasonable people perceived Defendant\u2019s statements to be serious threats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">Most significantly, the staff at the shelter decided to remove Defendant from the shelter. They did not want to allow someone who was talking about shooting Hillary Clinton and killing white people to remain at the shelter overnight. They were afraid that he might lose control. Defendant was involuntarily committed at the Hall Mercer Clinic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At3\">415 F.Supp.2d at 558-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Although Richards still contends that \u00a7 879 requires subjective intent, he assumes <em>arguendo </em>for purposes of this appeal that the court\u2019s objective test is correct, and he argues that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy even that standard. We agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The only two people who testified that they heard Richards chanting about putting \u201cbullets into Hillary Clinton\u201d were case manager Miller and mental health clinician Blitman. Miller testified that he did not consider Richards\u2019 chanting to be a serious threat to Hillary Clinton, App. 131, and both testified that they saw no reason to be concerned for Hillary Clinton\u2019s safety. App. 113, 146. Therefore, their reaction does not satisfy the objective test. We simply can not agree that the evidence establishes an objective test for willfulness if the only people who heard Richard\u2019s utterances about Hillary Clinton did not regard them as serious threats and saw no reason to be concerned for Hillary Clinton\u2019s safety. The court\u2019s finding that \u201c[i]t is clear that the people at the shelter who heard Defendant\u2019s threats perceived them as serious,\u201d 415 F.Supp.2d at 558, is simply not supported by the record and is therefore clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The district court ignored testimony that neither Miller nor Blitman saw any reason to be concerned for Senator Clinton\u2019s safety. Instead of addressing that testimony, the court relied upon five \u201cfacts\u201d that it believed established that the willfulness element of \u00a7 879. First, the district court noted that \u201cMiller notified the shelter personnel.\u201d 415 F.Supp.2d at 558. However, Miller made it clear that he notified security pursuant to normal operating procedure, and not because he viewed anything Richards said as a serious threat to anyone, let alone Hillary Clinton. In fact he emphasized that he did not regard Richards as a threat. He explained: \u201cI went to tell security just that here was a potential issue, nothing to be worried about, ... [T]his wasn\u2019t all that abnormal up to this point ... I don\u2019t think I stressed that where was anything major going on.\u201d App. 79-80. Miller clarified that \u201csimilar incidents\u201d requiring him to alert security \u201cwere quite common at the shelter.\u201d App. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Second, the district court wrote that \u201cMiller also remained close at hand when Blitman spoke to Defendant in case she needed further assistance.\u201d 415 F.Supp.2d at 558. However, the district court failed to note that Miller was once again simply following the shelter\u2019s protocol. Miller testified that his reaction was: \u201c[j]ust kind of standard ... we just basically back each other up in whatever capacity we can. So, if he didn\u2019t respond well to her or something like that, I would be right there.\u201d App. 20. Given Miller\u2019s explanation, we do not believe that his remaining \u201cclose at hand\u201d can support an inference that he took Richards\u2019 chanting as a serious threat to Hillary Clinton. Rather, as Miller testified, his concern was for Richards\u2019 mental health. App. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Third, the district court noted that \u201c[t]he people in the dinner line moved away from Defendant as he made these threats.\u201d 415 F.Supp.2d at 558. However, that hardly supports the inference that the district court drew, even given our differential standard of review. Miller testified: \u201cI think some people sitting close to him were ... keeping a little distance from him,\u201d App. 69, and \u201cI think they were moving away from him a little bit, yes.\u201d App. 129. However, given Richards\u2019 disheveled and malodorous state, it is not surprising that people moved away from him when he became loud. People normally keep their distance from a disheveled, homeless person engaging in psychotic behavior. The fact that some people in the line moved away from Richards does not, without more, support an inference that a reasonable observer would believe Richards was threatening Hillary Clinton. Moreover, any such inference is seriously undermined not only by the totality of the circumstances including Richards\u2019 disheveled state, but by the testimony of Blitman and Purdie that some people near Richards were actually laughing at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Fourth, the district court also noted that a \u201cmember of the staff was alarmed by the statements and, at one point, Miller himself registered fear.\u201d 415 F.Supp.2d at 558. However, that was not in response to Richards\u2019 chants about Hillary Clinton. Rather, that occurred after dinner, when Purdie and Miller spoke with Richards. At that point, Richards did not make any statements about Hillary Clinton. \u201cHe was just ranting about white people.\u201d App. 162. He started screaming about \u201ccutting heads off\u2019 and \u201chating white people.\u201d App. 86-87. The alarm that certain people registered was a reaction to Richards\u2019 racist and psychotic ranting. Rich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ards was no longer talking about shooting Hillary Clinton, and there was no evidence that Brian heard the earlier statements about Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Lastly, the district court explained: \u201cMost significantly, the staff at the shelter decided to remove Defendant from the shelter. They did not want to allow someone who was talking about shooting Hillary Clinton and killing white people to remain at the shelter overnight. They were afraid he might lose control.\u201d 415 F.Supp.2d at 558. Far from being the most significant aspect of the government\u2019s proof, we feel the reasoning behind removing Richards from the shelter establishes conclusively that objective observers did not take his ranting about Hillary Clinton seriously. Miller testified that they removed Richards and had him committed solely based on a concern for Richards\u2019 health and safety, not because of <em>any </em>concern for the safety of Hillary Clinton. App. 102. The fact that Hillary Clinton is a white woman in no way establishes that Richards\u2019 generalized rants about white women constitute threats to her within the meaning of \u00a7 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Miller testified, \u201cI would not have felt comfortable, at the end of my shift, knowing that somebody had just screamed things about, you know, killing people.\u201d App. 118. Miller immediately clarified that the screaming he was referring to did not involve the statements about shooting Hillary Clinton. The statements about Clinton were \u201cthe mumbling and chanting to himself; and those were not the subject of the screaming.\u201d App. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Furthermore, the fact that the staff would simply have put Richards out on the street if it had not been too cold to do so clearly establishes that they saw no reason to be concerned for Hillary Clinton\u2019s safety. Miller testified that they opted for involuntary commitment because it was cold outside and Miller \u201cdidn\u2019t like the chances of [Richards] finding a heating grate.\u201d App. 90. Had the staff perceived his chanting about Hillary Clinton to be a serious threat, they certainly would not have put him back on the street where he would have access to all manner of weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Interestingly, the government does not directly address the fact that the only people who heard Richards\u2019 statements about Hillary Clinton were Miller and Blitman and that they did not consider those statements to be serious. Instead, the government suggests that Miller\u2019s and Blitman\u2019s testimony is not that reliable because they work in a homeless shelter and they hear people making threatening statements all the time. In the government\u2019s view, they are much more tolerant than the average observer in reacting to threats. However, we believe the reverse to be true. Their background puts them in a far better position to make an objective assessment of Richards\u2019 behavior and utterances than the average person who is unfamiliar with psychotic behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to sustain Richard\u2019s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 879(a)(1). Therefore, we will reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand with instructions to vacate the judgment of conviction and instruct the district court to enter a judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-17\">.
