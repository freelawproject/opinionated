Dow Chemical Co., </em>517 F.3d 104, 115-16 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The complaint alleges that GSK violated the Exchange Act in four ways: (1) by making false statements and omissions regarding the viability of GSK\u2019s patents for its drugs Paxil and Augmentin, and engaging in a course of frivolous litigation with respect to those patents (the \u201cPatent Claim\u201d); (2) by suppressing information about Paxil\u2019s addictiveness and withdrawal effects (the \u201cPaxil Withdrawal Claim\u201d); (3) by violating the Federal False Claims Act by overcharging Medicare and Medicaid for GSK\u2019s pharmaceutical products, resulting in multiple lawsuits against GSK (the \u201cOvercharge Claim\u201d); and (4) by misrepresenting the safety and efficacy of the use of Paxil in children and adolescents (the \u201cPaxil Pediatric Claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The district court dismissed all but the Paxil Pediatric Claim on statute of limitation grounds. Section 804 of the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), extended the statute of limitations period applicable to section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 to the <em>earlier of </em>\u201c(1) two years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation; or (2) 5 years after such violation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b). The two-year limitations period \u2014 referred to as the \u201cinquiry notice\u201d period \u2014 is triggered when \u201c \u2018circumstances would suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she has been defrauded.\u2019 \u201d <em>LC Capital Partners LP v. Frontier Ins. Group Inc., </em>318 F.3d 148, 154 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., </em>12 F.3d 346, 350 (2d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Although the triggering of inquiry notice is an issue \u201coften inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss,\u201d where \u201cthe facts needed for determination of when a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have been aware of the existence of fraud can be gleaned from the complaint and papers ... integral to the complaint, resolution of the issue on a motion to dismiss is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156 (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also Dodds, </em>12 F.3d at 352 n. 3. For the reasons below, we agree with the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>trict court that, based on the allegations in the complaint, Masters was on inquiry notice with respect to the Paxil Withdrawal, the Patent, and Overcharge Claims no later than two years prior to when he filed his original complaint on April 12, 2005; thus, these claims were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">With respect to the Paxil Withdrawal Claim, in August 2001, GSK was sued in class action lawsuits by consumers of Paxil claiming adverse effects upon ceasing Paxil\u2019s use, and related fraudulent behavior by GSK, news of which was made available not only in the press but also in GSK\u2019s 2001 year-end Form 20-F filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, Masters alleges that the disclosure of the lawsuits caused a drop in the price of GSK\u2019s securities on September 6, 2001. Moreover, in December 2001, GSK after consulting with and securing approval from the Federal Drug Agency (\u201cFDA\u201d), changed the labeling of Paxil to include a warning about its discontinuation effects. Masters\u2019 assertions that the foregoing disclosures were not adequate \u201cstorm warnings\u201d to trigger inquiry notice are meritless. <em>See LC Capital, </em>318 F.3d at 154. Notwithstanding Masters\u2019 assertion that the class actions did not allege claims of fraud, the complaints in the class actions sufficiently made known the underlying factual allegations forming the basis of Masters\u2019 securities fraud claim. <em>Cf. Menowitz v. Brown, </em>991 F.2d 36, 42 (2d Cir.1993). In addition, notwithstanding Masters\u2019 assertion that the warning label approved by the FDA itself mischaraeterized or understated the full extent of Paxil's alleged withdrawal effects, the warning label was not the type of \u201creassuring statement []\u201d that might allay a reasonable investor\u2019s concern. <em>See LC Capital, </em>318 F.3d at 155. Accordingly, the Paxil Withdrawal Claim was properly dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">So was the Patent Claim. No later than March 2002, GSK announced that at least one court had invalidated certain of GSK\u2019s patents covering Augmentin. Moreover, in July 2002, GSK announced that it had lost one patent case involving Paxil, and in December 2002, announced that it was having mixed results in other litigation over its patents. Meanwhile, in July 2002, the Federal Trade Commission made public a report that was critical of GSK\u2019s conduct in pursuing its Paxil patent. In addition, the complaint alleges that GSK stock price dropped numerous times between March 13, 2002 and March 4, 2003 in response to developments in the patent litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Masters\u2019 assertions that the limitations period was not triggered because the trial courts\u2019 patent decisions were on appeal, and because the price declines in GSK\u2019s securities were not sufficiently \u201csharp\u201d to put an investor on inquiry notice, are unavailing. We have held that district court filings and opinions may suffice to trigger the limitations period, <em>LC Capital, </em>318 F.3d at 155; <em>Menowitz, </em>991 F.2d at 42, and we are aware of no case requiring a certain degree of price decline before the limitations period may commence, especially where, as here, there were multiple drops in price. Equally unavailing is Masters\u2019 reliance on Garnier\u2019s statements in the press that \u201cWe are very confident we can defend our patents!,]\u201d and \u201cwe feel that the courts eventually will recognize the letter of the law and give us the added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>protection for Augmentin.\u201d As the district court found, these statements were not the type of \u201creassuring words\u201d that might negate inquiry notice, <em>see LC Capital, </em>318 F.3d at 155; rather, they were of a type a reasonable investor would view as mere expressions of hope. Accordingly, the Patent Claim was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The Overcharge Claim fares no better. The complaint acknowledges that lawsuits were filed against GSK starting in November 2001 as a result of its alleged violations of the False Claims Act, and that public disclosure of these lawsuits caused GSK\u2019s share price to decline on December 11, 2001. We reject Masters\u2019 claim that it was the settlement of the litigation in April 2003 that triggered inquiry, rather than the filing and reporting of the litigation itself. <em>See, e.g., LC Capital, </em>318 F.3d at 155 (knowledge of a lawsuit may be sufficient to trigger inquiry notice); <em>Menowitz, </em>991 F.2d at 42 (same). Thus, the district court properly dismissed all but the Paxil Pediatric Claim as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">But that remaining claim fails on other grounds; namely, a lack of materiality and failure to allege loss causation. With respect to materiality, section 10(b) of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful to \u201cuse or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\u201d in violation of SEC rules and regulations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). The SEC implementing rule, Rule 10b-5, prohibits the making of untrue material statements of fact or the misleading omission of material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. An omission is material only if there is \u201ca substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact could have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information available.\u201d <em>Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 352, 357 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Masters complains that GSK violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) and Rule 10b-5 by not timely disclosing allegedly adverse results of certain research trials, and by sponsoring researchers to publish false and misleading materials, concerning the safety and efficacy of Paxil for treatment of children and adolescents. We have held that reports of harmful drug effects are immaterial \u2014 and thus need not be disclosed\u2014 unless those reports (1) show statistically significant evidence of an adverse effect, (2) establish that the adverse effect threatens the \u201ccommercial viability\u201d of the drug; and (3) show that the effect poses a significant risk to the company\u2019s future earnings. <em>In re Carter-Wallace, Inc. Securities Litig., </em>150 F.3d 153, 157 (2d Cir.1998); <em>accord Oran v. Stafford, </em>226 F.3d 275, 284 (3d Cir.2000). The complaint does not explain how the results of the research trials at issue could be deemed statistically significant in light of the test results from another trial that GSK did disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Even assuming that the non-disclosed test results were statistically significant, they were financially immaterial. The same is true with respect to the alleged misstatements by those who were allegedly sponsored by GSK. According to the complaint, less than <em>3% </em>of GSK\u2019s revenues from Paxil came from prescriptions to children because the drug was neither FDA-approved nor directly marketed for that use. The potential loss of that small amount of \u201coff-label\u201d sales did not threaten the commercial viability of Paxil, much less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>pose a significant risk to the total future earnings of GSK, which sold several other drugs in addition to Paxil. <em>See In re Carter-Wallace, </em>150 F.3d at 157; <em>cf. Acito v. IMCERA Group, Inc., </em>47 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir.1995) (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 securities fraud claim where alleged omission affected less than 1% of defendants\u2019 total products); <em>Pames v. Gateway 2000, Inc., </em>122 F.3d 539, 547 (8th Cir.1997) (finding alleged 2% overstatement of assets immaterial in light of company\u2019s financial prospects).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The district court cases relied upon by Masters are inapposite, as each involved a development stage company that failed to disclose negative studies that threatened not only the product\u2019s commercial viability, but also the company\u2019s viability. <em>See, e.g., In re Regeneron Pharms., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 03 Civ. 3111, 2005 WL 225288 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2005); <em>In re Sepracor, Inc., Sec. Litig., </em>308 F.Supp.2d 20 (D.Mass.2004); <em>In re Viropharma, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 02 Civ. A 1627, 2003 WL 1824914 (E.D.Pa. Apr. 7, 2003). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Paxil Pediatric Claim for failure to adequately allege materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In addition, the complaint fails as a matter of law to allege loss causation with regard to the Paxil Pediatric Claim. <em>See Dura Pharm,. Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 342-43, 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005) (explaining that a securities fraud plaintiff must demonstrate \u201ca causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss\u201d). Although the complaint alleges two stock losses, on June 24, 2004 and December 9, 2004, Masters fails to demonstrate a casual link between these alleged losses and the alleged misconduct. The price prior to the first negative market reaction was $42.77, while the price after the second negative market reaction was $44.82, or $2.05 higher, and Masters pleads no facts supporting a conclusion that he was nevertheless adversely affected. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (concluding allegation of inflated purchase price alone insufficient to plead relevant loss causation). Moreover, as GSK points out, the December 9, 2004 stock drop occurred after the close of the class period and thus cannot be relied upon for loss causation. Accordingly, the Paxil Pediatric Claim was properly dismissed for failure to plead loss causation as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Finally, we reject Masters\u2019 claim that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint without granting leave to amend. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); <em>see also Ellis v. Chao, </em>336 F.3d 114, 126-27 (2d Cir.2003). Prior to filing this complaint, Masters was \u201cdirected to serve a consolidated amended complaint, [defendants\u2019 were to advise [Masters] of perceived deficiencies, i.e., grounds for motion to dismiss, and [Masters] was given the opportunity to file a second amended complaint with the understanding that no further amendments would be permitted.\u201d The district court, in dismissing the complaint, did not abuse its discretion in holding Masters to his side of the bargain. That is especially so given the lack of any indication that the complaint\u2019s shortcomings could be cured by amendment. <em>See Yerdon v. Henry, </em>91 F.3d 370, 378 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cWhere it appears that granting leave to amend is unlikely to be productive, it is not an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend.\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. The district court also dismissed Masters\u2019 additional claim that Gamier was liable as a control person of GSK under Section 20(a) of the 1994 Act. Masters has waived any challenge to the dismissal of this claim on appeal. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\">. The relevant portion of this Form 20-F was not in the record but was annexed to GSK\u2019s reply brief before the district court. Masters has no objection to our consideration of this document. As we are not relying on any other publically available filings that were not in the record, we need not address Masters\u2019 objection to our consideration of the publically available documents submitted to us by GSK post-argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. Because we affirm the district court's dismissal of the Paxil Withdrawal, Patent, and Overcharge Claims on statute-of-limitation grounds, we do not reach the district court's alternative bases for dismissing these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Paxil Pediatric Claim for failure to adequately allege materiality and loss causation, we do not reach the district court's alternative basis for dismissing this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
