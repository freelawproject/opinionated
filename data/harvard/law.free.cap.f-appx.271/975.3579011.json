Davis argues that the district court erred when it determined that the \u201cfactual predicate\u201d which began the statute of limitations period was the Board of Pardons and Paroles\u2019 (\u201cBoard\u201d) initial May 23, 1997 decision to deny Davis parole and not its subsequent June 2, 2005 denial on reconsideration. Without reaching the issue of which event triggered the limitations period with respect to Davis\u2019s claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-20\">We previously have held that \u00a7 2241 petitions brought by individuals in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court are subject to the exhaustion requirements of \u00a7 2254 \u2014 including exhaustion of state remedies. <em>Dill v. Holt, </em>371 F.3d 1301, 1302-03 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1059 (11th Cir. 2003)); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). It is firmly established under Georgia law that a parole decision can be challenged by filing a petition for writ of mandamus. <em>Brown v. Barrow, </em>512 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Lewis v. Griffin, </em>258 Ga. 887, 376 S.E.2d 364 (1989); <em>Justice v. State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, </em>234 Ga. 749, 218 S.E.2d 45 (1975)). Davis did not present his claim in a state court mandamus proceeding or in any other state judicial proceeding. Therefore, even assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>arguendo that Davis could not have known the factual predicate for his claim until the board denied him parole for the second time in June 2005, hid petition was nonetheless properly denied because Davis failed to exhaust remedies available to him in the Georgia state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The dismissal of Davis\u2019s habeas petition by the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
