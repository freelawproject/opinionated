Reyna also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying her motion to remand proceedings. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000) and we review de novo questions of law, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny in part, and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Reyna\u2019s experiences in the Phillippines did not amount to past persecution. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936-37 (9th Cir.2000). Furthermore, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Reyna\u2019s fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable. <em>See Mendez-Gutierrez v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Because Reyna failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Reyna\u2019s contention that the BIA should be estopped from denying her request to remand proceedings to the IJ fails because she has not shown that the agency\u2019s delay in commencing proceedings amounts to affirmative misconduct. <em>See INS v. Miranda, </em>459 U.S. 14, 18-19, 103 S.Ct. 281, 74 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Reyna\u2019s due process contention fails because she did not show that the delayed commencement of removal proceedings prejudiced the outcome of her asylum claim. <em>See Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971-972.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">We dismiss Reyna\u2019s contention regarding the agency\u2019s decision when to commence proceedings because the court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 598 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b639-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
