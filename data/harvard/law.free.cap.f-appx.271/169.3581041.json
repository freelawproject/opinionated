Stabler appeals his conviction and subsequent sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(2). Those charges arose from his driving a kitchen knife into the side of his former probation officer\u2019s house. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-26\">I<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-27\">The prosecution and defense agreed to have Stabler enter a conditional guilty plea and preserve his right to argue that the conduct he would admit to did not amount to a violation of \u00a7 115(a)(2). In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the government agreed to make a nonbinding recommendation that Stubler\u2019s sentence not exceed imprisonment for one year and one day. However, the district court refused to accept the sentencing recommendation because the court did not believe it complied with Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 11(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Accordingly, Stabler waived his right to a jury trial and went to trial based on stipulations of fact supplemented with limited testimony from an FBI agent and Stubler\u2019s former probation officer, Mel Hoover. The district court convicted Stabler. The advisory guideline range for the offense, as calculated by the probation office, was 46-57 months. The district court granted a downward departure which reduced that range to 30-87 months imprisonment. After calculating the guideline range, the court sentenced Stabler to 33 months imprisonment over defense counsel\u2019s objection. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Stabler argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Thus, our review is \u201cparticularly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>286 F.3d 173, 175 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cIt is not our role to weigh the evidence or determine the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201c[w]e ... view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and sustain the verdict if any rational juror could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Stabler also challenges the calculation of his sentence. To the extent that we review the district court\u2019s legal rulings or interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, our review is plenary. <em>United States v. Lennon, </em>372 F.3d 535, 538 (3d Cir.2004). However, to the extent that the court\u2019s selection of the appropriate offense level under the guidelines is based upon findings of fact, the district court is entitled to deference. <em>Cothran, </em>286 F.3d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(2), makes it a crime to \u201cthreaten[ ] ... [a Federal law enforcement officer] ... with intent to retaliate ... on account of the performance of official duties ... \u201d. Stabler argues that the evidence does not support his conviction because he did not intend to retaliate against Hoover or threaten him. Rather, he claims he made a \u201csnap decision\u201d to stab Hoover\u2019s house out of frustration. He also argues that his conduct could not have been \u201con account of performance of official duties\u201d because his term of supervision with Hoover had ended approximately eight years earlier. We can not agree with either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Stubler\u2019s supervised release ended in April of 1997, and all agree that Hoover was not involved in any surveillance of Stubler\u2019s home, nor was Hoover supervising Stabler. Nevertheless, it is clear that Stabler was angry with \u201cthe government\u201d and he considered Hoover to be an agent of the government. Given our limited standard of review, that is sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Stabler thrust a knife into Hoover\u2019s house because Stabler believed he was under government surveillance and either blamed Hoover, or faulted Hoover for not intervening to stop the perceived intrusion. We believe that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Stubler\u2019s conduct was therefore \u201con account of\u2019 Hoover\u2019s official duties within the meaning of \u00a7 115(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Similarly, we must reject Stubler\u2019s claim that he acted impulsively on a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d impulse rather than out of a retaliatory motive. We realize that Stu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>bier used a weapon more closely associated with meatloaf than mayhem, but that does not negate the fact he was armed with a knife when he traveled across town to visit Hoover. That suggests advance planning and intent. Similarly, although we see no reason to doubt Stubler\u2019s statements that he actually liked Hoover and would not have hurt him, Stubler also stated that he was \u201cangry with\u201d Hoover and \u201cwanted to scare him.\u201d That is sufficient for a reasonable fact finder to infer the required retaliatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Stubler also argues that the district court erred in categorizing him as a Career Offender under the Guidelines. The two prior reckless endangerment convictions the court relied on appear from the sentencing transcript to be related to Stu-bler\u2019s driving. The district court concluded those convictions constituted past crimes of violence for purposes of classifying Stubler a Career Offender. The Sentencing Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">(a) The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">While we are sympathetic to Stubler\u2019s argument that reckless endangerment offenses should not be considered \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d Stubler\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Parson, </em>955 F.2d 858 (3d Cir.1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, we questioned the wisdom of the possibly inadvertent adoption of a definition for \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that can include offenses that do not involve the intentional use of force. <em>Id. </em>at 860-61, 874-75. However, neither Congress nor the Sentencing Commission has seen fit to revise that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Moreover, <em>Tran v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 464 (3d Cir.2005) and <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 533 (3d Cir.2006) do not help Stubler. There, we had to determine what qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of convictions for \u201caggravated\u201d felonies under immigration law. Our analysis was governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). In 1989, the Guidelines were revised and no longer track 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). In fact, the panel in <em>Tran v. Gonzales </em>explicitly reconciled its decision with <em>Parson, </em>but did not overrule it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 414 F.3d at 470 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">Stubler claims the district court should have used U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.3 (\u201cMinor Assault\u201d) with a base offense level that does not exceed 7 rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1, (\u201cThreatening or Harassing Communications; Hoaxes\u201d) with a base offense level of 12. Appendix A lists several possible base offense sections which could apply to a violation of \u00a7 115 including \u00a7 2A6.1. Accordingly, the court did not err in selecting \u00a7 2A6.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">Stubler next argues that the district court should not have applied a 6-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>enhancement to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2 based on the victim being a former federal employee, because Hoover\u2019s status as a federal employee \u201cis counted once as an essential element of the crime of conviction and counted a second time by application of the enhancement.\u201d We have already rejected that argument. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>25 F.3d 206, 210 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court committed no legal error in convicting or sentencing Stubler. Nevertheless, we feel compelled to express our concern about the sentence imposed here. Stubler has a history of paranoid schizophrenia and all concerned agree that he suffers from a very profound mental illness. All concerned also agree that Stu-bler generally had a good relationship with Hoover, and that Stubler\u2019s mental illness rather than malice or a predisposition towards violence led to this transgression.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Neither the government nor the victim wanted Stubler to receive a sentence of more than a year and a day, which would have been tantamount to a \u201ctime served\u201d sentence. We assume that all would agree that prison is not the most effective environment for the treatment of mental illness. Accordingly, a shorter sentence could have allowed Stubler to receive the mental health treatment he so desperately needed. It also would have been more consistent with the command of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that courts impose the minimum sentence necessary to comply with the sentencing objectives that must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The reasonableness of that sentence is not before us. Nevertheless, it is difficult for us not to conclude that the district court could have reasonably exercised its discretion to impose a sentence more consistent with treatment of the mental health aspects of Stubler\u2019s behavior rather than imposing the sentence it selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Although we are not privy to all of the dynamics and factors that went into this prosecution, it certainly appears that this entire matter could have been handled much more appropriately by the mental health system rather than the criminal justice system. That is, of course, \u201cwater under the bridge.\u201d Stubler\u2019s transgression has now been prosecuted as a criminal matter, a criminal conviction has been obtained, and a sentence imposed. It is indeed regrettable that state and federal authorities could not have cooperated in a manner that would have resolved this regrettable incident in the mental heath system where it belongs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-15\">. Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not set forth the factual or procedural background except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-12\">. The district court did grant a downward departure because the guideline calculation overstated the seriousness of Stubler's prior record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-20\">. <em>United States v. Otero </em>is similarly distinguishable because it addressed a different section of the Guidelines that contains its own definition of crime of violence. 502 F.3d 331 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
