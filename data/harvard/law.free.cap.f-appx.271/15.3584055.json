Rohan, denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Fatime Avdimetaj, </em>No. A98 402 587 (B.I.A. Apr. 27, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A98 402 587 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Sep. 6, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We find that the agency\u2019s finding that Avdimetaj failed to establish eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief is supported by the record. The BIA found that Avdimetaj \u201cfailed to establish that the harm she suffered in the former Yugoslavia rises to the level of persecution.\u201d In determining whether an applicant has demonstrated persecution, the agency must view events cumulatively, rather than addressing the severity of each event in isolation. See <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 290 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 79-80 (2d Cir.2005). Although the BIA found that the 1991 gas attack Avdimetaj suffered and the subsequent destruction of her home due to the \u201cravages of war\u201d did not rise to the level of persecution, the BIA appears to have \u201cconsidered each of the incidents separately without determining how they affected the significance of other incidents.\u201d <em>Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 290. In particular, the BIA analyzed Avdimetaj\u2019s 1991 gas attack and concluded she \u201cfailed to state what consequences she reportedly suffered as a result of the poison gas attack, to show that the attack was directed against her, or to provide any corroborating evidence in support of her claim.\u201d The BIA then found that although Avdimetaj was \u201ca witness to the ravages of war,\u201d nothing else happened to her until she left in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">It is unclear, however, that the BIA took the cumulative effect of Avdimetaj\u2019s experiences into account in determining whether she suffered past persecution. <em>See Po-radisova, </em>420 F.3d at 80. As a result of the BIA\u2019s practice of dividing Avdimetaj\u2019s harm \u201cinto isolated incidents and disposing of each on different grounds, without explaining the cumulative significance \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of these harms,\u201d we have been deprived of the opportunity to review meaningfully any aggregate analysis the BIA may have conducted. <em>Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Despite the BIA\u2019s erroneous finding as to past persecution, because the IJ explicitly relied \u201con a valid alternative ground for denying relief that is not tainted by error,\u201d remand is futile. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir.2006); see <em>also Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). In this regard, the IJ found that even assuming Avdimetaj\u2019s experiences constituted past persecution, the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was rebutted by evidence of changed country conditions in the record. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). Substantial evidence supports this finding because the 2004 State Department Country Report in the record reveals that the Serbian government \u201cgenerally respected the human rights of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>citizens.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of this record evidence, no \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\u201d contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding that Avdimetaj\u2019s presumption of well-founded fear of persecution was rebutted due to \u201ca fundamental change in circumstances\u201d in Serbia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We also find no error in the agency\u2019s finding that Avdimetaj does not have an objective fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Indeed, as the BIA noted, Avdimetaj remained in Kosovo, Serbia from 1999 until 2004 without suffering any harm. In fact, besides the 1991 gas attack, Avdimetaj was never arrested, harmed, or detained by anyone in Kosovo, Serbia. Moreover, as the agency pointed out, her mother and sister continue to live in Kosovo, Serbia without harm. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999) (finding that where asylum applicant\u2019s mother and daughters continued to live in petitioner\u2019s native country, claim of well-founded fear was diminished). Although the 2004 Country Report indicates that \u201cviolence against women ... remained a serious and persistent problem\u201d in Kosovo, Avdimetaj was never harmed in any way on account of her gender. Hence, Avdimetaj failed to present \u201creliable, specific, objective evidence\u201d to support her allegation that she possesses an objectively reasonable fear of individualized persecution if she returns to Serbia. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Because Avdimetaj was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Finally, we find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Avdimetaj failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief. Indeed, Avdimetaj has failed to present any evidence that she was tortured in the past or that she would likely be tortured in the future. <em>See Mu Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003) (finding that \u201cWang has in no way establish that someone in his particular alleged circumstances is <em>more likely than not </em>to be tortured\u201d). The 2004 Country Report in the record indicates that there were no reports of torture taking place in Kosovo. Hence, no \u201creasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude,\u201d contrary to the BIA, that Avdimetaj established eligibility for CAT relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-5\">. Accordingly, despite the agency\u2019s error in analyzing Avdimetaj's claim of past persecution, because the U assumed that Avdimetaj had established past persecution but nonetheless found that any presumption of a well-founded fear was rebutted by \"a fundamental change in circumstances\u201d in Serbia, the IJ\u2019s denial of her asylum application was proper. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-11\">. We note that since this appeal was filed, Kosovo has declared its independence from Serbia. We take no stand on what the effect of that is on the petitioner\u2019s situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
