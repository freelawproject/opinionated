In exchange for his plea of guilty to one of those counts, the government promised to recommend that Ford receive a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility unless he engaged in future misconduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. At sentencing the district court noted that Ford, who was detained, had incurred seven misconduct reports since pleading guilty. The court suggested that these reports were enough to free the government from recommending acceptance points, but the government made the recommendation anyway with the caveat that Ford\u2019s misconduct warranted a sentence at the top of the guidelines range. The district court rejected that recommendation because it concluded that Ford\u2019s misconduct was inconsistent with a finding that he had accepted responsibility. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1., cmt.l(b). The court assigned a base offense level of 26 based on the 12.4 grams of crack cocaine involved in the three drug buys. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (2006). That offense level, combined with Ford\u2019s criminal history category of III, yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of 78 to 97 months. Ford argued for a reduced sentence based on the greater sentences for crimes involving crack versus powder cocaine, but the district court responded that it was not free to ignore the guidelines. The court then imposed a sentence of 88 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-19\">On appeal Ford first argues that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea when the district judge refused to award him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. As Ford accurately reports, the district court told him during the plea colloquy that he would be able to withdraw the plea if the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cfollow the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d Ford argues that the district court reneged on this promise when it did not invite him to withdraw his plea after rejecting the government\u2019s recommendation for acceptance points. But rejecting a recommendation that the government made under the terms of the plea agreement is not the same as rejecting \u201cthe terms\u201d of the agreement. \u201cOur case law has clearly established that a district court is not required to follow the government\u2019s sentencing recommendations.\u201d <em>United States v. Marty, </em>450 F.3d 687, 691 (7th Cir.2006). In fact, during the plea colloquy the court explained to Ford that the government\u2019s recommendations did not bind it; they were merely \u201crecommendations that the Court can reject without permitting [Ford] to withdraw\u201d his plea, and that is exactly what the court did. Ford points out that the court all but told the government that it could decline to recommend a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction due to his misconduct, but we do not understand Ford\u2019s contention that doing so was equivalent to rejecting the plea agreement. Ford concedes, as he must, that the district court was justified in finding that he did not accept responsibility, so he must also concede that the government would have been justified in withholding its recommendation. All the district court did, then, was state the obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Ford\u2019s second argument on appeal, that he deserves a remand because the district court believed it was not free to impose a reduced sentence based on a policy disagreement with the crack-to-powder ratio, is much better than the first. The government concedes that Ford preserved this argument by objecting at sentencing and is entitled to a remand for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United </em>States, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The district court thought itself bound by the ratio, but after <em>Kimbrough, </em>even in a \u201cmine-run case,\u201d district courts may impose lower sentences based on a determination that the ratio produces a sentence greater than necessary for a particular defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 575. Accordingly, we REMAND for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>We note that under the new guidelines that will apply at Ford\u2019s resentencing, <em>see United States v. Demaree, </em>459 F.3d 791 (7th Cir.2006), his 12.4 grams of crack cocaine now translate into a lower base offense level. Instead of 26, Ford\u2019s base offense level at a new sentencing hearing should be 24, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(8) (2007), which yields a guidelines range of 63 to 78 months.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
