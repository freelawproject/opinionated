He appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him release on bail pending his sentencing. Because Mr. Wages has not shown \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d for release pending sentencing, as required by the applicable statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Release on bail pending sentencing is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8143(a) and 3145. The \u201cconditions set forth in section 3143(a)(1)\u201d are met, as the magistrate judge found \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [Mr. Wages is] not likely to flee or pose a danger to any other person in the community.\u201d Aplt. App., Doc. 4 at 44-45. However, as Mr. Wages properly concedes, his conviction is statutorily classified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and thus initially is governed by \u00a7 3143(a)(2), which imposes a presumption of detention unless certain conditions are met. Since those conditions are not satisfied here. Mr. Wages relies on \u00a7 3145(c), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">A person subject to detention pursuant to section 3143(a)(2) ... who meets the conditions set forth in section 3143(a)(1) ... may be ordered released, under appropriate conditions, by the judicial officer, if it is clearly shown that there are exceptional reasons why such person\u2019s detention would not be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The only question on appeal is whether Mr. Wages has shown \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d justifying release on bail. \u201c[W]e review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that appellant failed to demonstrate an \u2018exceptional reason\u2019 justifying his release, while accepting the district court\u2019s findings of fact which support that determination, unless \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Kinslow, </em>105 F.3d 555, 557 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">\u201cExceptional\u201d is defined as \u201cbeing out of the ordinary: uncommon, rare.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary (Unabridged.) </em>791 (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1976). Courts have agreed that \u201ca ease by ease evaluation is essential.\u201d <em>United States v. DiSomma, </em>951 F.2d 494, 497 (2d Cir.1991) (referring to \u201ca unique combination of circumstances giving rise to situations that are out of the ordinary\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Koon, </em>6 F.3d 561, 564 (9th Cir. 1993) (Rymer, J., concurring); <em>United States v. Herrera-Soto, </em>961 F.2d 645, 647 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Mr. Wages relies on his (1) age (53); (2) lack of prior criminal record; (3) use of a wheelchair and need for a special mattress to avoid pain;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (4) limited ability to hear, \u201cmaking communication impossible through the 6 b[y] 8 inch visitation window at the Muskogee County jail,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 14; and (5) need to care for his elderly mother, who also is deaf and has only a limited ability to see. He also notes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>he \u201ccannot be a threat to the community as he is not allowed on a computer\u201d and \u201c[i]f he were allowed to self-report, it would relieve the Marshal of a special transport of a very sick and feeble man.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Having considered Mr. Wages\u2019 arguments and the particular circumstances of this case, we do not find that these circumstances, either singly or in combination, constitute \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d requiring release pending sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Various courts have rejected the majority of Mr. Wages\u2019 asserted reasons. <em>See United States v. Lea, </em>360 F.3d 401, 403-04 (2d Cir.2004) (stating that lack of criminal record is not unusual); <em>United States v. Mellies, </em>496 F.Supp.2d 930, 937 (M.D.Tenn.2007) (rejecting need to care for other family members); <em>Koon, </em>6 F.3d at 564 (Rymer, J., concurring) (noting that potential danger of the community is a predicate condition of \u00a7 3143(a)(1), and thus it does not establish an \u201cexceptional reason,\u201d at least without some degree to make it extraordinary); <em>United States v. Mostrom, </em>11 F.3d 93, 94 (8th Cir.1993) (rejecting the convenience to the Marshal as an \u201cexceptional reason\u201d). His most compelling reasons are his lack of hearing (and resultant difficulties in communicating with visitors at the jail) and need for a wheelchair. But it is a rare case in which health conditions present an \u201cexceptional reason.\u201d <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>368 F.3d 992, 993 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (stating participation in treatment for depression was not exceptional); <em>Mellies, </em>496 F.Supp.2d at 936-37 (ongoing extensive dental treatment not sufficient); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>50 F.Supp.2d 717, 722 (N.D.Ohio 1999) (stating that treatment for illness was available in prison). We are not persuaded that Mr. Wages\u2019 circumstances require release for the time remaining before his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\">. Contrary to the representations on appeal, it does not appear that Mr. Wages is \"wheelchair bound,\" Aplt. Br. at 4, or \"confined to a wheelchair,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13. On appeal, the government presented an affidavit from a court security officer who observed Mr. Wages, on the date of his plea hearing, walking down the handicap ramp at the federal courthouse, pushing an elderly lady in a wheelchair. After the party cleared security, Mr. Wages sat down in the wheelchair and pushed the chair down the hallway with his feet. The affidavit is supported by a DVD of the court\u2019s security-camera footage from outside the building, in the security area, and in the court hallways.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
