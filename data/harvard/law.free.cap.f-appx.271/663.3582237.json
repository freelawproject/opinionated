We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1078 (9th Cir.2002), and we review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir. 2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-21\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Tjhai\u2019s motion to reopen because it is undisputed that the hearing notice was mailed to his address of record and Tjhai presented no evidence that its return to the immigration court was the result of improper delivery by the postal service. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(c) (notice by mail to most recent address provided by alien sufficient); <em>cf. Salta, </em>314 F.3d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-22\">Moreover, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Tjhai\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to establish \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d include those beyond the alien\u2019s control such as the serious illness of the alien, or the death or serious illness of an immediate relative, but not less compelling circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-23\">It follows that the denial of Tjhai\u2019s motion to reopen did not violate due process. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
