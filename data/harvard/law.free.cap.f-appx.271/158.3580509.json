In his petition, he claimed that exhaustion of his administrative remedies was futile. Before the petition had been served on the respondent, <em>see </em>Rule 4 foil. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the Magistrate Judge recommended that Lindsay\u2019s petition be denied for failure to exhaust administrative remedies or, in the alternative, for lack of merit. Over Lindsay\u2019s objections, the District Court denied the petition for failure to exhaust. Lindsay appeals and requests the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will summarily affirm the District Court because no substantial issue is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-18\">Ordinarily, federal prisoners must exhaust available administrative remedies before filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Moscato v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir.1996). In claiming exhaustion was futile, Lindsay admitted in his petition that he never exhausted his administrative remedies. Although he alleged in his petition that the BOP did not appropriately exercise its discretion and transfer him, he did not indicate that he even registered an informal complaint with prison officials, let alone followed all of the procedures available under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">Lindsay claimed that exhaustion was futile because the BOP cannot be \u201cexpected to follow other rules if they have already violated the current rules.\u201d However, his legal conclusion based on speculation is not enough to excuse his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">Citing <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), in his objections, Lindsay also claimed that his petition should not be denied <em>sua sponte </em>because exhaustion is an affirmative defense, not a pleading requirement. As the District Court noted, <em>Jones </em>interpreted the Prison Litigation Reform Act, holding that \u201cinmates are not required to specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 921. Lindsay proceeds under a different statute. Even if <em>Jones </em>applied here, the absence of a requirement to specifically plead exhaustion does not bar a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal where a concession on the face of a petition exposes a bar to suit. <em>See Ray v. Kertes, </em>285 F.3d 287, 293 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Because the District Court could determine from the face of Lindsay\u2019s petition that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies, a prerequisite to suit, the District Court properly dismissed Lindsay\u2019s petition. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Also, we deny Lindsay\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-21\">.
