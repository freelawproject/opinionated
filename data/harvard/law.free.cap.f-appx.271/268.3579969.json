We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">As we write for the parties alone, we recount only the facts necessary to our decision. We review the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, as the verdict winner. <em>United States v. Haddy, </em>134 F.3d 542, 544 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">Antolini owned Executive Cash Services, Inc. (ECS), which contracted with banks to keep their automated teller machines (ATMs) operational and funded. Banks wired money to an ECS transit account from which ECS withdrew cash to fill ATM cassettes. ECS then removed depleted cassettes from ATMs and replaced them with replenished ones. The cash remaining in the old cassettes was transported to ECS, counted, and returned to the banks via check.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">This process provided ECS (and Antoli-ni) with a substantial cash float because ECS required its customers to wire funds to the transit account 48 hours prior to ATM replenishment and the unused cash was not returned until several days later. From 1995 to 1999, Antolini withdrew $972,729 from the transit account that he used to purchase a gas station, a company airplane, a motorcycle, and a boat; he paid off a mortgage on his New Jersey home, made a down payment on a Florida home, and invested more than $350,000 in brokerage accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">Antolini\u2019s scheme began to unravel when CoreStates Bank hired ECS to replenish its ATMs. CoreStates entrusted ECS with over $118 million in February of 1997, but after only a few months, ECS could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>account for over $4 million. CoreStates terminated the contract and sued ECS in federal court. Antolini\u2019s counsel, Eric Browndorf, told CoreStates that the shortfall occurred because banks owed ECS money. Without mentioning Antolini\u2019s misappropriations, Browndorf told CoreS-tates that ECS\u2019s books were \u201ca mess\u201d and that Antolini was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">On September 4, 1997, CoreStates agreed to team with ECS in a \u201cjoint recovery effort,\u201d and ECS hired the accounting firm of Capaldi, Reynolds &amp; Associates (Capaldi) to lead the effort. After Antoli-ni\u2019s counsel informed CoreStates that An-tolini could no longer afford Capaldi\u2019s retainer, CoreStates assumed payment out of a trust account created in furtherance of the joint recovery effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Browndorf memorialized this unusual three-way relationship in a series of letters to Capaldi. First, he instructed Capaldi to share with CoreStates only the information necessary to recover funds from other banks, writing: \u201cWe are not sharing all of your work papers, findings or reports with them.\u201d Second, Browndorf informed Ca-paldi that CoreStates\u2019 counsel was to be excluded from a meeting with ECS\u2019s insurer (Lloyd\u2019s of London) at which the parties verified CoreStates\u2019 loss. Third, on March 10, 1998, Browndorf wrote Capaldi: \u201cHow did the meeting go with CoreStates? Please be cooperative, but cautious. At the end of the day it is still likely that [Antolini] will have a battle with them over the deficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In February of 1998, ECS and CoreS-tates entered into a settlement agreement in which CoreStates agreed to pursue ECS\u2019s customers and Lloyd\u2019s of London before turning to ECS to recover its loss. After CoreStates\u2019 requests for records were rebuffed by ECS, however, CoreS-tates terminated its participation in the joint recovery effort with $2 million remaining unrecovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">A grand jury indicted Antolini on 13 counts: (a) seven counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and \u00a7 2, (b) one count of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 and \u00a7 2, (c) one count of structuring transactions to evade reporting requirements in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(a)(3) and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.22 and 103.27, and (d) four counts of tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">During trial, Antolini\u2019s counsel (who was not Browndorf) noted during his closing argument that Antolini\u2019s former colleague, Barry Chesla, had pleaded guilty to stealing ATM funds while working at ECS and other companies. The defense introduced the plea to suggest that Chesla \u2014 not Anto-lini \u2014 was responsible for CoreStates\u2019 loss. In response, the government argued that Chesla was a \u201cred herring\u201d because he stole very little from ECS. The government recounted Chesla\u2019s fraudulent activities and asked the jury: \u201csound familiar?\u201d The District Court ordered the jury to disregard this remark by the prosecutor and explained the purpose for which they could consider Chesla\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Antolini first argues that the attorney-client privilege should have protected the letters Eric Browndorf sent to Capaldi. We reject this argument at least two independent reasons. First, Antolini cannot waive the privilege with respect to Capaldi\u2019s efforts to identify banks that ECS should pursue while preserving the privilege with respect to Capaldi\u2019s efforts to discern ECS\u2019s debt to CoreStates. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Republic of the Philippines, </em>951 F.2d 1414, 1426 n. 13 (3d Cir.1991). Because both issues relate to the joint recovery effort, a partial waiver would allow Antolini \u201cto present a one-sided story to the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Antolini waived whatever privilege may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>have existed between himself and Capaldi when he invited CoreStates to join the recovery effort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1424.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Second, the letters were only relevant to Count 8 of the superceding indictment (bank fraud), and therefore, their admission was harmless vis-a-vis the other eight counts of conviction. <em>Marshall v. Hendricks, </em>307 F.3d 36, 73 (3d Cir.2002). Moreover, as the letters were duplicative of other, substantial evidence of Antolini\u2019s bank fraud, their admission was harmless vis-a-vis Count 8. <em>See id. </em>at 73-74.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in permitting disclosure of Brown-dorfs letters. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>429 F.3d 450, 452 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Antolini also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about Barry Chesla during closing arguments entitle him to a new trial. We find that even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments were prejudicial \u2014 and we do not decide that they were \u2014 the following curative instruction vitiated any prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">[I]n the government\u2019s closing argument they refer to Barry Chesla ... and [his] guilty plea in the Western District of Pennsylvania. The evidence was offered by the defense in accordance with the defense theory of the case, which is set forth at Page 19 of my instructions. That is the only purpose for which the defense offered it. * * * The government was responding to that and asserting that it was a red herring. * * * The government said, talking about [Barry Chesla], \u201cDoes that sound familiar?\u201d Disregard that remark. * * * [A] person\u2019s decision to plead guilty is a personal decision about their own guilt and is not evidence of any sort against any person here on trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Antolini\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>See United States v. Gambino, </em>926 F.2d 1355, 1365 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Finally, in light of the Rule 28(j) letter in which Antolini withdrew his initial request for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we do not address that claim and- will affirm the judgment of the District Court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\">. Indeed, we question whether the attorney-client privilege existed here in the first instance. There is no accountant-client privilege. <em>See Couch v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 322, 334, 93 S.Ct. 611, 34 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). Rather, where the client, or the client's attorney, retains an accountant for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice, the <em>attorney-client </em>privilege may attach. <em>See United States v. Kovel, </em>296 F.2d 918, 922 (2d Cir.1961); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>519 F.2d 1036, 1045 (3d Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>500 F.2d 683, 691-92 (3d Cir.1974). However, \"[i]f what is sought is not legal advice but only accounting service ... or if the advice sought is the accountant\u2019s rather than the lawyer's, no privilege exists.\u201d <em>Kovel, </em>296 F.2d at 922. Here, Browndorf hired Ca-paldi primarily for accounting services and advice, which calls into question whether <em>Kovel </em>applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-17\">. We also reject Antolini\u2019s argument that the letters were irrelevant to the question of whether he knowingly defrauded CoreStates. As discussed, the letters showed that Antolini knew that material information was being withheld from CoreStates. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding this evidence relevant and not unfairly prejudicial. <em>See Elcock v. Kmart Corp., </em>233 F.3d 734, 754 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
