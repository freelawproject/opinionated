He contends that the detainer is unlawful because he was not serving a special parole term on a 1985 conviction for heroin possession and other crimes when in 2000 the Parole Commission issued a warrant for his arrest for violating the terms of his special parole. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">The sentencing court ordered Bond\u2019s 10-year special parole term to commence upon his release from custody and to run concurrently with a 5-year term of probation. On October 12, 1990, Bond was released on parole pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4163, and he signed a special parole term certificate stating that he would begin serving the special parole term on May 21, 1993. His 5-year term of probation also began on October 12, 1990. The Parole Commission issued the warrant on October 16, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">Bond contends that the Board acted outside its statutory authority in commencing a special parole term while he was serving a federal term of probation because, as stated in <em>Russie v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>708 F.2d 1445, 1447 (9th Cir.1983), former 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c) (1980) provided that special parole is \u201cin addition to, and not in lieu of,\u201d any other parole available to a prisoner. As explained by the district court, this means that special parole, unlike regular parole, follows a term of imprisonment. <em>See Robles v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>146 F.8d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir.1998). Similarly, probation, unlike regular parole, is an alternative to a term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Belgard, </em>894 F.2d 1092, 1100 (9th Cir.1990). The sentencing court properly ordered both Bond\u2019s special parole and his probation to commence upon release from custody. <em>See United States v. Levitt, </em>799 F.2d 505, 507 (9th Cir.1986) (probation commences when imposed unless otherwise ordered by court).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-24\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
