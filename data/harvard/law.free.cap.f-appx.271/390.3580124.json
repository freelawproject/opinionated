First, Hays argues that the district court erred by failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review before denying his Rule 60(b) motion. The record contradicts that argument. Relatedly, Hays asserts that the record fails to demonstrate that the district court conducted a <em>de novo </em>review when it denied his \u00a7 2255 motion in September 2000. He also asserts that review of the merits of his ineffective assistance claim was deferred on direct appeal and, thus, the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentia-ry hearing on that claim. Hays\u2019s claims are without merit. And, to the extent Hays is challenging the underlying judgment denying his \u00a7 2255 motion, he is precluded from doing so. <em>See Hess v. Cockrell, </em>281 F.3d 212, 216 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, Hays\u2019s first argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-24\">Second, Hays argues that the District Court should have held an evidentiary hearing in considering his Rule 60(b) motion. Hays has not cited any authority for the proposition that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his Rule 60(b) motion. We likewise find none. Accordingly, Hays\u2019s second argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-25\">Third, Hays argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir. 1981). Having considered the record and relevant law, we find no abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tion. Accordingly, Hays\u2019s third argument fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
