The facts of Herrera\u2019s arrest are simple and straightforward. Detective Jonathon Streetzel (\u201cDetective Streetzel\u201d) of the Miami-Dade police department observed as Herrera parked a sports utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d) a few feet from the detective\u2019s unmarked car in a shopping center parking lot. Within minutes, another man parked alongside Herrera, approached the driver\u2019s side of Herrera\u2019s SUV, and handed Herrera what appeared to be a bag of crack cocaine in exchange for money. Detective Streetzel followed Herrera as he left the parking lot and stopped the SUV soon thereafter. Detective Streetzel smelled burning marijuana as he approached the SUV, and officers uncovered marijuana in the ashtray, marijuana and crack cocaine in Herrera\u2019s pocket, and a loaded handgun jutting out from underneath the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">On appeal, Herrera argues that the district court erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress evidence that was seized pursuant to the stop of his vehicle, (2) enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), and (3) enhancing his offense level under the sentencing guidelines for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we find it necessary to address his first two issues only, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">\n<em>I. Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"axz-dedup-0\">Herrera argues first that Detective Streetzel\u2019s observations provided an insufficient basis for the subsequent stop of Herrera\u2019s vehicle. He contends that the officer observed nothing more than the everyday actions of presumably innocent patrons of a shopping center, and the subsequent discovery of contraband does not justify an initially unlawful detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress under \u201ca mixed standard of review, reviewing the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotations and citations omitted). On review of the denial of a motion to suppress, we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>443 F.3d 772, 774 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">The stop of a motor vehicle may be justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1290-91 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 438, 169 L.Ed.2d 306 (2007). \u201cTo have reasonable suspicion, an officer conducting a stop must have a reasonable, articulable suspicion based on objective facts that the person has engaged in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290 (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cWe examine \u2018the totality of the circumstances\u2019 to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>mine whether the police had \u2018a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)). Further, \u201c[a] reasonable suspicion of criminal activity may be formed by observing exclusively legal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 754 (11th Cir. 2000). \u201cIn examining the totality of the circumstances, a reviewing court must give due weight to the officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>United States v. Briggman, </em>931 F.2d 705, 709 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Under the totality of the circumstances, including Detective Streetzel\u2019s experience observing similar drug transactions in the same location, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the detective had reasonable suspicion to stop Herrera\u2019s SUV. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\n<em>II. Armed Career Criminal Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Next, Herrera argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior conviction in Florida for high-speed chase constituted a violent felony for purposes of enhancing his sentence as an armed career criminal, per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He contends that the statutory elements of this offense, along with the charging document, demonstrate that it is not a violent felony, as it neither requires damage to persons or property nor has as an element conduct that presents a serious risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction constitutes a violent felony for purposes of the \u00a7 924(e) armed career criminal enhancement. <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006). The ACCA requires a minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment for a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has 3 previous convictions for \u201ca violent felony or serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). To that end, the ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">[A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-11\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). At the time of Herrera\u2019s conviction, Florida law provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-13\">Any person who, in the course of unlawfully fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle ... having knowledge of an order to stop by a duly authorized law enforcement officer, causes the law enforcement officer to engage in a high-speed vehicle pursuit commits a felony of the third degree ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">\u201cIn determining whether a particular offense falls within [\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) ], the Supreme Court has directed trial courts to pursue a categorical approach, \u2018looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>286 F.3d 1324, 1325 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). Further, we have held that \u201cour cases interpreting \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 4B1.2 provide important guidance in determining what is a \u2018violent felony under the ACCA[,] because the definitions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>both terms are virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>489 F.3d 1112, 1113 (11th Cir.) (quotations and citations omitted), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 16, 2007) (No. 07-668). In this regard, we have held that felony fleeing and eluding in Florida constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), as \u201c[t]he dangerous circumstances surrounding a person\u2019s attempt to flee from law enforcement coupled with the person\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle most assuredly presents a \u2018potential risk of physical injury\u2019 to others.\u201d <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1182-83 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 673, 169 L.Ed.2d 527 (2007) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and interpreting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Here, although <em>Orisnord </em>involved a separate provision of Florida\u2019s fleeing and eluding statute, our reasoning is equally applicable to the statute under which Herrera was convicted, as both offenses similarly proscribe conduct involving motorists who flee from or attempt to elude law enforcement officers. <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) (1996) (\u201cAny person who, in the course of unlawfully fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer ... causes the law enforcement officer to engage in a high-speed vehicle pursuit commits a felony in the third degree.\u201d), <em>with </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a) (2004) (\u201cAny person who willfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer ... and during the course of the fleeing or attempted eluding ... [djrives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, commits a felony of the second degree.\u201d). Accordingly, the fleeing motorist who causes a high-speed chase in violation of former \u00a7 316.1935(2) creates the very same serious risk of potential injury to pedestrians, other drivers, and police officers. Further, as with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual definition of a crime of violence, the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) \u201cmakes clear that the potential risk of injury, rather than actual violence or actual injury, is the touchstone of a [violent felony].\u201d <em>Oris-nord, </em>483 F.3d at 1182; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Therefore, we hold that the district court did not err in finding that Herrera\u2019s prior conviction for high-speed chase constituted a violent felony and, in turn, enhancing his sentence under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Moreover, as a result of our holding, we do not address Herrera\u2019s third issue regarding the enhancement of his guidelines offense level for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Herrera\u2019s offense level with the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was 28. However, after finding that Herrera qualified as an armed career criminal, the court was required to apply an offense level of 33. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Herrera\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\">. Herrera also argues that the court erred in enhancing his sentence under ACCA based on his prior convictions that were neither charged in the indictment nor proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, he acknowledges that the law of the Supreme Court allows for such use of his prior convictions. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (\"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
