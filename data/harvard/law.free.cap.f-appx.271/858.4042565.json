On appeal, Ghee argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to proceed IFP on grounds that each claim in his appeal of the bankruptcy proceedings was frivolous. Specifically, Ghee argues that the following claims are not frivolous: (1) that the bankruptcy court erred by finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d); (2) that the bankruptcy court erred by finding that his allegation that the acts of fraud indirectly violated his discharge injunction, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a), failed to state a claim; and (3) that the bankruptcy court erred by denying his motion for reconsideration on grounds that it failed to consider his argument in the complaint that a billing statement violated his discharge order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to proceed IFP ... for [an] abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1306 (11th Cir.2004). Although the trial court \u201chas wide discretion\u201d in denying an application to proceed IFP, and \u201cthe courts should grant the privilege sparingly,\u201d in denying such applications, the court must not act arbitrarily or act on erroneous grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1306-07. IFP proceedings are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. IFP status should be granted where the appellant is indigent unless \u201cthe trial court certifies in writing that [the appeal] is not taken in good faith.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1), (3). A party demonstrates good faith by seeking appellate review of any issue that is not frivolous when examined under an objective standard. <em>See Coppedge v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 438, 445, 82 S.Ct. 917, 921, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962). An issue is frivolous when it appears that \u201cthe legal theories are indisputably merit-less.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Gross, </em>984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). In other words, an IFP action is frivolous, and thus not brought in good faith, if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>\u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). More specifically, \u201carguable means capable of being convincingly argued.\u201d <em>Sun v. Forrester, </em>939 F.2d 924, 925 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Nevertheless, where a \u201cclaim is arguable, but ultimately will be unsuccessful,\u201d it should be allowed to proceed. <em>Cofield v. Alabama Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n., </em>936 F.2d 512, 515 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">A Chapter 7 debtor'receives a discharge \u201cfrom all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b). Pursuant to \u00a7 524(a)(2), a discharge in bankruptcy \u201coperates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2). A discharge in bankruptcy does not affect the liability pf a third party on the same debt. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(e); <em>see also In re Sure-Snap Corp., </em>983 F.2d 1015, 1019 (11th Cir.1993) (same, relating to third-party guarantor). Under \u00a7 541(a)(2), certain \u201ccommunity property\u201d of a non-debtor spouse may be included in the property of the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(2). \u201cThe nature of a bankrupt\u2019s interest in property is determined by state law.\u201d <em>In re Sinnreich, </em>391 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2004). Georgia is not a \u201ccommunity property\u201d state. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u25a0 19-3-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">A. <em>Bankruptcy court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over RICO claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334, the district court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases under the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a). Moreover, the district court has original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction over \u201call civil proceedings arising under [Tjitle 11, or arising in or related to cases under [Tjitle 11.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). Nevertheless, the district court may refer such cases and civil proceedings to the bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a). The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to hear and determine- cases in three categories: (1) civil proceedings under Title 11, (2) core proceedings arising under Title 11, and (3) core proceedings arising in a case under Title 11. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(1). A non-exclusive list of core proceedings is found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2). We have defined a core proceeding as a proceeding \u201cinvolv[ing] a right created by the federal bankruptcy law,\u201d that \u201ccould [not] exist outside of bankruptcy,\u201d- and that implicated the property of the bankrupt estate. <em>In re Toledo, </em>170 F.3d 1340, 1348 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">A bankruptcy court also may hear, but not submit, a final judgment on non-core proceedings that are related to a case under Title 11. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1). In order for jurisdiction to exist under the \u201crelated to\u201d language, \u201cthere must be some nexus between the related civil proceeding and the Title 11 case.\u201d <em>Matter of Lemco Gypsum, Inc., </em>910 F.2d 784, 787 (11th Cir.1990). A civil proceeding is related to a bankruptcy case if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae-\">the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have an -effect on the estate being administered-in bankruptcy. The proceeding need not necessarily be against the debtor or against the debt- or\u2019s property. An action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could'alter the debtor\u2019s rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action (either positively or negatively) and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankruptcy estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 788 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>its discretion by finding as frivolous Ghee\u2019s challenge to the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the RICO claims. It cannot be convincingly argued that there is a legal or factual basis for concluding that the bankruptcy court erred by finding that the RICO claims were not a core bankruptcy proceeding or related to a core proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">B. <em>Failure to state a claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citation onjitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. In addition, \u201cunsupported conclusions of law or of mixed fact and law\u201d are 'not sufficient to withstand a dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>McGinley v. Houston, </em>361 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Nevertheless, <em>\u201c[p]ro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that a challenge to the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision that Ghee failed to state a claim, in regards to his allegation that the fraudulent acts violated his discharge injunction, is frivolous. The only factual allegations in the complaint concerned an action against Ghee\u2019s wife, who was not a party to his bankruptcy, so attempts to collect a debt from her could not have violated Ghee\u2019s discharge injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">C. <em>Motion for reconsideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-12\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires a complaint to contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). The point is to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp., </em>550 U.S. at-, 127 S.Ct. at 1964 (citation omitted). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263. Nevertheless, a motion to alter or amend judgment cannot be used to raise a legal argument which could, or should, have been brought prior to the entry of the original judgment. <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 n. 69 (11th Cir.2000) (habeas context).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-16\">We conclude from the record that the district Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that an appeal of the denial of Ghee\u2019s motion for reconsideration is without arguable merit in fact or law. The appeal is frivolous because, in his motion for reconsideration, Ghee argued that sending him a post-discharge billing statement itself violated 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a), a claim Ghee did not raise in his complaint and a claim that focused on the appellees\u2019 allegedly illegal attempt to collect a debt from his wife, a non-debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-17\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ghee\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal from the decision of the bankruptcy court because each claim in the appeal was frivolous. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Ghee\u2019s motion to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"AaV\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
