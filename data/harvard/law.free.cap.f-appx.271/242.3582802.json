The procedural history of this case and the details of Daley\u2019s claims are well known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough order, and need not be discussed at length. Daley, a citizen of Jamaica, filed a \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his removal order and his continued detention. The District Court dismissed the petition. Daley filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). We agree with the District Court that it did not have jurisdiction over Daley\u2019s challenge to his removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As for Daley\u2019s challenge to his detention, he was still within the presumptively reasonable six-month post-removal period at the time of the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s October 29, 2007 order. Daley\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\">. On January 8, 2008, this Court denied Daley\u2019s petition for review of his removal order. <em>See Daley v. Attorney Gen., </em>261 Fed.Appx. 421 (3d Cir.2008). Thus, the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, rather than transfer the matter to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, was entirely appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
