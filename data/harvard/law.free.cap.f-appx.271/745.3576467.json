R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Defendant Victor Steaveson was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), in connection with his participation in a counterfeit check operation. Following the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, Steaveson filed an appeal challenging the propriety of his aggravated identity theft conviction. After briefing in this appeal was complete, but prior to oral argument, this court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Tatum, </em>518 F.3d 769 (10th Cir.2008), holding that counterfeit checks and account numbers printed on counterfeit checks are not \u201caccess devices\u201d within the meaning of that term as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1). The United States has now filed a motion conceding that, in light of <em>Tatum, </em>Steaveson was not charged with a cognizable federal offense. Specifically, the government concedes \u201cthat since counterfeit checks are not access devices for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, Steaveson should not have been charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and such charge could not be a predicate offense for aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).\u201d Motion for Remand at 2. As a result, the United States seeks a remand of Steaveson\u2019s ease with directions to vacate his convictions. After examining the record on appeal in this case, we agree with the government\u2019s assessment of <em>Tatum </em>and its effect upon Steaveson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Accordingly, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion and REMAND this case to the district court with directions to VACATE Steaveson\u2019s convictions and sentence and DISMISS the case against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-6\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
