We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-25\">In civil cases in which the United States is not a party, parties have thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if a party moves for an extension within thirty days after expiration of the original appeal period and the party has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A); <em>Washington v. Bum-gamer, </em>882 F.2d 899, 900-01 (4th Cir. 1989). Moreover, a district court may re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>open the time to file an appeal if it finds: (i) the moving party did not receive notice of the entry of judgment within twenty-one days of entry; (ii) the motion to reopen is filed within 180 days after the judgment is entered or within seven days after the movant receives notice of entry, whichever is earlier; and (in) no party would be prejudiced. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). The time period within which to file a notice of appeal is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Pannell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was entered on April 3, 2007. Pannell therefore had until May 3, 2007 to file his notice of appeal. Pannell\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed until August 16, 2007. Although Pannell\u2019s notice of appeal asks for another opportunity to appeal his case, Pannell did not timely move for an extension of time or for a reopening of the time to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decision process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
