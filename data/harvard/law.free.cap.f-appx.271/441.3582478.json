Zamora argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that sentence is not necessary to protect the public or to prevent him from committing future crimes because of his age, health, and family responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-23\">The district court committed no significant procedural error as it properly calculated the applicable guidelines range, allowed the parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Where, as here, the district court imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014- u.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Zamora has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion or that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
