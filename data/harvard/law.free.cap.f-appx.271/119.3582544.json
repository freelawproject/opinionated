HALL,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-19\">. The Honorable Janet C. Hall, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b143-27\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b143-28\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case. Guardian Music Corporation (\u201cGuardian\u201d) appeals from an August 9, 2006 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Scheindlin, J.). James W. Guercio Enterprises (\u201cGuercio\u201d) cross-appeals from the same judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-29\">In February 1969, Louis \u201cMoondog\u201d Hardin, a blind avant-garde composer, conveyed the right to copyright his compositions to Skiff Music Corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(\u201cSkiff\u2019), the purported predecessor to Guardian. That same year, Skiff entered into a Co-Publishing Agreement with Archimedes Music, a division of Guercio, under which Skiff would administer the copyrights to four of Hardin\u2019s compositions (the \u201cSplit Compositions\u201d), Archimedes would administer the copyrights to thirty of Hardin\u2019s compositions (the \u201cParticipating Compositions\u201d), and Skiff and Archimedes would each be entitled to half of the publisher\u2019s income generated by any of the compositions. The Agreement encompassed two groups of Hardin\u2019s works, referred to as the 1969 and 1971 compositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">On December 31,1997, the original term of the copyright to Hardin\u2019s 1969 works expired. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 304(a)(1)(A) (setting forth a twenty-eight-year original term for certain copyrights). In Spring 1999, a hip-hop musician named \u201cMr. Scruff\u2019 sampled, without authorization, Hardin\u2019s 1969 work \u201cLament\u201d in his song \u201cGet a Move On.\u201d An individual named Don Williams, who had been administering the Hardin compositions on behalf of Archimedes, obtained a fifty percent interest in the copyright for \u201cGet a Move On.\u201d Hardin died in September 1999, bequeathing his copyrights to his hem, Illona Goebel Sommer.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In 2003, Guardian sued for an accounting of the profits from the 1969 and 1971 compositions, and a constructive trust on Guardian\u2019s interest in those compositions. Guardian appeals the ruling of the district court that it is not entitled to profits from the renewal term of the 1969 copyrights. (The renewal term of the 1969 compositions vested on January 1, 1998.) Guercio cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to Guercio on Guardian\u2019s claim to the original term profits from both groups of compositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, in each case construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>White River Amusement Pub, Inc. v. Town of Hartford, </em>481 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir.2007). The renewal term of a copyright \u201cis not merely an extension of the original copyright term but a new estate ... clear of all rights, interests or licenses granted under the original copyright.\u201d <em>P.C. Films Corp. v. MGM/UA Home Video Inc., </em>138 F.3d 453, 456-57 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 304(a)(2)(B)(ii), 304(a)(3)(B). If the author of the copyrighted work is alive when the renewal term vests, he or she is entitled to the renewal rights, even if the rights to the original term had been conveyed to another party. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 304(a)(l)(C)(i). An author can convey his or her entitlement to a renewal term, but there is \u201ca presumption against the conveyance of renewal rights.\u201d <em>P.C. Films Corp., </em>138 F.3d at 457. This presumption may be rebutted only \u201cwhere the author includes language which expressly grants rights in renewals of copyright or extensions of copyright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Where a contract includes \u201cgeneral words of assignment,\u201d such as \u201cforever,\u201d \u201chereafter,\u201d or \u201cperpetually,\u201d these words can convey renewal rights if the parties had so intended. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The district court correctly dismissed Guardian\u2019s claim to renewal term profits from Hardin\u2019s 1969 compositions. Guardian contends that Hardin conveyed his renewal rights to Skiff and Archimedes in the 1969 Co-Publishing Agreement, but the Agreement does not contain language that expressly grants those rights, nor does it include \u201cgeneral words of assignment\u201d that would suggest any such grant. The Agreement provides that \u201c[t]he rights of the parties [Skiff and Archimedes] hereto in and to the [Split and Participating] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Compositions shall extend for the term of the copyright of the [Split and Participating] Compositions and any extensions or renewals thereof if same become available.\u201d We do not agree with Guardian that this language is ambiguous; rather, it clearly indicates that the terms of the Co-Publishing Agreement would apply <em>if, at some point in the future, </em>Hardin decided to convey his rights to any extensions or renewals of the copyright to Skiff and/or Archimedes. Neither does Hardin appear even to have been a party to the Agreement. We find that the terms of the Co-Publishing Agreement are clear, that nothing in the Agreement overcomes the \u201cstrong presumption against conveyance of renewal rights,\u201d and that we have no reason to consult extrinsic evidence of the intent of the parties. <em>See, e.g., Alexander &amp; Alexander Servs., Inc. v. These Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>136 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cIf the court finds that the contract is not ambiguous it should assign the plain and ordinary meaning to each term and interpret the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Guardian argues in the alternative that, regardless of whether Hardin intended to convey his renewal rights in the Co-Publishing Agreement, Archimedes actually administered at least one composition in the renewal term: \u201cLament.\u201d According to Guardian, some renewal term right had become \u201cavailable\u201d to Archimedes, and Archimedes was therefore required to share any resulting profits with Guardian. This argument also fails. The record indicates that Guercio never claimed, nor was granted, any entitlement to the renewal rights in the 1969 compositions, which had passed back to Hardin and then to his heir upon his death. Therefore, there were no renewal rights to share with Guardian under the Co-Publishing Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The district court also correctly denied summary judgment to Guercio on Guardian\u2019s claim to a share of profits from the original terms of the disputed copyrights. We agree that a genuine issue of material fact precluded judgment on Guer-cio\u2019s theory that Guardian had materially breached the Agreement. Finally, Guercio argues that it has no obligations to Guardian under the Co-Publishing Agreement because that Agreement was executed between Skiff and Guercio, and Guercio never agreed to any assignment of Skiffs rights and obligations under the Agreement to Guardian. Guercio has not met its burden of convincing us on this appeal that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue. Further, remand to the district court to reconsider this argument would not be warranted as the parties have already stipulated to the entry of a final judgment in favor of Guardian and against Guercio.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
