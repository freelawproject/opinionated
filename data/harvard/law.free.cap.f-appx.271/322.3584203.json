Garries pled guilty to a criminal information charging him with sexual abuse, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2242 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), and was sentenced to a term of twenty years imprisonment and a life term of supervised release. In this appeal, Garries contests a four-level adjustment for aggravated sexual abuse applied by the district court under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2A3.1(b)(l) (2006), and also argues that his life term of supervised release exceeded the statutory maximum. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">In his plea agreement, Garries waived appellate review of \u201cany issues that relate to the establishment of the advisory guideline range.... \u201d Our review of the record discloses that the district court advised him about the waiver provision at the guilty plea hearing, and that his waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 399-401 (4th Cir.2002). Further, under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(k) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007), for a violation of \u00a7 2242, \u201cthe authorized term of supervised release ... is any term of years not less than five, or life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court, but dismiss that portion of the appeal in which Garries contests the calculation of his advisory guideline range. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
