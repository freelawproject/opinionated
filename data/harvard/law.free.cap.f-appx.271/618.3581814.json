She contends that the Board erred in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>missing her appeal as one day late under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b) and (c). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Villasenor\u2019s notice of appeal was filed by her attorney 31 days after the mailing of the immigration judge\u2019s decision and therefore was untimely under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">She contends that the Board should have considered her appeal on its merits because the immigration judge erred in denying her motion to reopen, and the untimeliness of the appeal did not cause any prejudice. These arguments do not rise to the level of rare circumstances justifying an exception to the deadline for appeal. <em>See Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that equitable defenses do not apply to jurisdictional deadline).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
