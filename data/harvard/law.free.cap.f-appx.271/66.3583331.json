Brieant, <em>Judge), </em>entered on May 9, 2006, declining to resentence Nunez, who was convicted on a guilty plea of conspiring to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), following our <em>Crosby </em>remand, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the relevant procedural history, facts, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and we evaluate its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2006). We review for \u201creasonableness\u201d the decision of a district court declining to alter a sentence following <em>Crosby </em>remand. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Nunez first argues that the District Court should have granted him a three-level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) because he did not complete or substantially complete the substantive offense underlying the conspiracy charge. At the original sentencing, the District Court refused to grant this reduction finding that \u201cthe crime was accomplished fully ... and that the crime was complete when the coconspirator physically moved the money.\u201d In adhering to its sentence, the District Court found that, at the time of his arrest on April 15, 2003, Nunez had over one million dollars of drug proceeds in his home and automobile \u2014 money which Nunez had received from coconspirators earlier that day, transported, and intended to pass to another coconspirator as soon as possible. Recently, we considered and rejected Nunez\u2019s argument, holding that \u201cwhen a person accepts a transfer or delivery of funds, he has participated in the conclusion of that transfer or delivery, and has therefore conducted a transaction\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(2)-(3). <em>United States v. Gotti, </em>459 F.3d 296, 335 (2d Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Ciccone v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3001, 168 L.Ed.2d 726 (2007) (mem.). It is undisputed that Nunez accepted a transfer or delivery of funds. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Nunez conducted a money laundering transaction within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. Because he \u201ccompleted all the acts ... necessary ... for the successful completion of the substantive offense,\u201d he is not eligible for the reduction available under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2). The District Court did not err in refusing to grant such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">Nunez\u2019s second argument is that the District Court erred by increasing Nunez\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(l), based on Nunez\u2019s knowledge or belief that the funds were drug proceeds. The Guidelines provide for an increase when the defendant \u201cknew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote\u201d a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b). A District Court may find that the knowledge element of \u00a7 2Sl.l(b) is established if it \u201cis persuaded that the defendant consciously avoided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>learning that fact while aware of a high probability of its existence.\u201d <em>United States v. Finkelstein, </em>229 F.3d 90, 95-96 (2d Cir.2000). The District Court did not clearly err in finding that Nunez either knew or consciously avoided knowledge of the money\u2019s provenance. Nunez told the arresting agents that the money came from drugs and admitted on the record that \u201c[i]t doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see\u201d that the money came from drug-dealing and that he thought the money was drug money, but \u201cnever asked.\u201d Given these admissions, there was certainly enough evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Nunez was \u201caware of a high probability\u201d that he was laundering drug money but \u201cconsciously avoided learning that fact\u201d by refusing to ask where the money came from. <em>See Finkel-stein, </em>229 F.3d at 95-96; <em>see also United States v. Reyes, </em>302 F.3d 48, 54-55 (2d Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Nunez also argues that he served only a minimal or minor role in the conspiracy and should have received a mitigating role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The inquiry into a defendant\u2019s role \u201cdepends upon the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>United States v. Idowu, </em>74 F.3d 387, 397 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry is \u201chighly fact-specific.\u201d <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We find that it was not error for the District Court to deny a mitigating role reduction. Nunez was critical to the conspiracy to launder money. Despite Nunez\u2019s contention that he was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d who lacked \u201cknowledge and understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise,\u201d he expressed an awareness that the criminal enterprise was laundering drug money, and that his coconspir-ators were the type of people who \u201ckill families.\u201d Nunez knew the timing and location of drug shipments to New York, flew to Miami to learn how to launder money, and was entrusted with a huge sum of money. Given this information, the District Court did not need to \u201caccept [the] defendant\u2019s self-serving characterizations of his role in an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Shonubi, </em>998 F.2d 84, 90 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The final argument advanced by Nunez is that the District Court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) by giving a harsher sentence than is necessary. It is clear from the record, however, that the District Court considered the applicable Guidelines range of 87 to 108 months, the Presentence Investigation Report, Nunez\u2019s statement of remorse, and the statements and letters of counsel. On remand, the District Court made specific reference to the statutory criteria of Section 3553(a), finding that the sentence \u201csatisfies all the statutory criteria\u201d and was \u201creasonable.\u201d The District Court then adhered to its original sentence, where it found that the sentence of 98 months properly reflected the fact that this crime was a \u201cmainstream crime.\u201d We thus conclude that the District Court carefully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 19, 168 L.Ed.2d 795 (2007); <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127-28 (2d Cir.2008), and that the sentence was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences within the discretion of the District Court to impose, <em>see Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and find them without merit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
