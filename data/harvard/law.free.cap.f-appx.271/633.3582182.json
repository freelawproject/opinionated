R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b657-27\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-28\">Varanisese Waqa and her family are natives and citizens of Fiji. They petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing their appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying them applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Our jurisdiction is governed by, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002), and we dismiss in part, and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-29\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s finding that changed circumstances did not excuse the Waqas\u2019 untimely filed asylum application because it was based on disputed facts. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650, 656-57 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The record does not compel the conclusion that the Waqas\u2019 untimely filing due to the ignorance of the law should be excused because of extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that the Waqa family failed to show that it is more likely than not that they will be harmed on account of their political opinion, ethnicity, gender, and/or religion if removed to Fiji. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1185 (9th Cir. 2003) (no compelling evidence that persecution of applicant\u2019s group was so widespread that applicant faced a clear probability of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The Waqas\u2019 contention that their due process rights were violated because the IJ did not permit them to apply for asylum until January of 2002 is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Finally, the Waqas\u2019 due process contention regarding the BIA\u2019s previous reduction of voluntary departure, and erroneous country of removal are moot in light of the BIA\u2019s amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
