Doak, Texas prisoner # 938995, and Kevin Devon Haynes, Texas prisoner # 1175542, appeal the dismissal of their 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petitions as time barred. We previously granted Doak and Haynes certificates of appealability with respect to whether the district court was correct in finding that their state habeas applications were not \u201cfiled\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) as of the dates they were deposited in the prison mail system but on the dates they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>file-stamped by the state court. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Doak was convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14 and was sentenced to 65 years of imprisonment. Haynes was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment. Their convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, and after their state habeas applications were denied, they filed \u00a7 2254 petitions. Both petitions were dismissed as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Doak and Haynes each had one year from the dates their convictions became final to file their \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions, but the one-year time limit was tolled during the pendency of their state habeas applications. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d). Doak and Haynes contend that their state habeas applications were \u201cfiled\u201d so that the AEDPA was tolled under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) as of the dates they deposited them in the prison mail system. The respondent argues in reply that the applications were not \u201cfiled\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) until they were file-stamped in state court. The dates their state applications were \u201cfiled\u201d is significant in each case because Doak and Haynes met the AEDPA deadline under the interpretation they favor and missed it under the interpretation favored by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2254 petition on procedural grounds de novo. <em>Larry v. Dretke, </em>361 F.3d 890, 893 (5th Cir.2004). In both cases, the district court concluded, based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398 (5th Cir.1999), that Doak and Haynes \u201cfiled\u201d them \u00a7 2254 petitions for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) on the dates they were file-stamped by the state court. In <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>we \u201cdecline[d] to extend the mailbox rule to the determination of filing dates for state habeas applications.\u201d 184</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">F.3d at 402. In support of their argument that <em>Coleman </em>is no longer good law, Doak and Haynes point to the holding of the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Warner v. Glass, </em>135 S.W.3d 681 (Tex.2004), that \u201ca pro se inmate\u2019s claim under section 14.004 of the Inmate Litigation Act is deemed filed at the time the prison authorities duly receive the document to be mailed.\u201d 135 S.W.3d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">After Doak and Haynes were granted certificates of appealability, we rejected the interpretation that Doak and Haynes favor in <em>Howland v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 840 (5th Cir.2007), holding that the mailbox rule does not apply to state habeas applications in Texas. 507 F.3d at 843-45. State habeas applications in Texas are made pursuant to article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and are therefore not governed by the Texas Civil Procedure &amp; Remedies Code at issue in <em>Warner. Id.; see also Aranda v. District Clerk, </em>207 S.W.3d 785, 786 (Tex.Crim.App. 2006). In light of our holding in <em>Howland, </em>the mailbox rule does not apply to the state habeas applications filed by Doak and Haynes for purposes of tolling the AEDPA one-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>See Howland, </em>507 F.3d at 843-45. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal their \u00a7 2254 petitions as time barred. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
