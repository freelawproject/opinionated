The government has confessed error and supports Defendant\u2019s request that his sentence be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-21\">Two issues are raised in this appeal: whether the district court committed reversible error when it (i) denied Defendant safety-valve relief; and (ii) denied Defendant an additional one-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Both issues are subject to plain error review because they are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). The government concedes that Defendant has satisfied all criteria for plain error relief and supports his remand request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-22\">We accept the government\u2019s concession of reversible error under the particular facts and circumstances presented here. Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-18\">. The government supports Defendant's remand request on both issues but also maintains that the acceptance-of-responsibility issue is of no import. If resolution of this issue can have no sentencing impact, a showing that the error affected substantial rights\u2014 which is required to remedy plain error \u2014 is, at the very least, problematic. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). In the light of the government\u2019s agreement that remand is appropriate and because the record on this issue may benefit from further development, we accede to the parties\u2019s request on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
