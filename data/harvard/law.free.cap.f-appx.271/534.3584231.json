After his latest return, Bel-lo-Gobea was apprehended and pleaded guilty to being present in the United States without permission after removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Based on facts admitted in the plea agreement, the district court calculated a guidelines imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months. The court then sentenced Bello-Gobea to 46 months. Bello-Gobea filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyers move to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because they cannot discern any nonfrivolous ground for appeal. Bello-Go-bea did not accept our invitation to respond to his lawyers\u2019 submission. See Cir. R. 51(b). Limiting our review to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s supporting brief, <em>see United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002), we grant counsel\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">In their <em>Anders </em>submission, counsel first address whether Bello-Gobea might argue that his guilty plea was not voluntary and should be set aside because the plea colloquy did not fully conform to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. We have explained that lawyers making an <em>Anders </em>submission should not even explore a Rule 11 argument unless they \u201cknow after consulting their clients, and providing advice about the risks, that the defendant really wants to withdraw the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002). Here it appears that Bello-Gobea refused to commit to a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>when counsel broached the subject of his guilty plea, but there is no need for us to seek clarification, <em>cf. United States v. Torres, </em>482 F.3d 925, 925 (7th Cir.2007), because we agree with counsel that any Rule 11 argument would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Because Bello-Gobea did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, our review would be for plain error. <em>See United States v. Blalock, </em>321 F.3d 686, 688 (7th Cir.2003). And an argument that it was plain error for the district court to accept Bello-Gobea\u2019s plea would be frivolous because during the plea colloquy the court substantially complied with Rule 11. <em>See id. </em>at 688-89; <em>Schuh, </em>289 F.3d at 975. Counsel note minor omissions in the plea colloquy, but correctly explain that none would rise to the level of plain error. Bello-Gobea was not harmed when the court failed to determine on the record that his plea \u201cdid not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement)\u201d or when the court failed to inform him of its obligation to impose a special assessment. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Cr. P. 11(b)(2), ll(b)(l)(L). Both omissions were harmless error as the plea agreement specifically stated that \u201cno threats, promises, or representations have been made, nor agreements reached, other than those set forth in this Agreement, to cause defendant to plead guilty,\u201d and it properly informed Bello-Gobea that he would be subject to a $100 special assessment. <em>See United States v. Driver, </em>242 F.3d 767, 771 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Counsel also discuss whether Bello-Go-bea could raise any nonfrivolous challenge to his prison sentence and conclude that he could not. We agree. Any challenge to the guidelines range would be frivolous as the range calculated by the district court corresponded to the range projected in Bello-Gobea\u2019s plea agreement. And any challenge to the ultimate sentence, which was the lowest within-guidelines sentence available, would be similarly frivolous because of the presumption we apply on appeal to sentences within the guidelines. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gamar-Gonzalez, </em>469 F.3d 1109, 1110 (7th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">As counsel correctly explain, Bello-Go-bea has only one argument for a reduced sentence that is worth consideration \u2014 the allegedly substandard conditions of pretrial confinement. We have previously assumed that \u201cunusually harsh\u201d conditions can be grounds for a reduced sentence, <em>United States v. Ramirez-Gutierrez, </em>503 F.3d 643, 646 (7th Cir.2007), and the conditions to which Bello-Gobea claims he was subjected do seem harsh. In a sentencing memorandum, former counsel asserted without any evidentiary support that Bel-lo-Gobea had been beaten and tasered by prison guards. At his sentencing hearing, counsel explained \u2014 again, without any evidence \u2014 that other inmates had beaten Bel-lo-Gobea so severely that he was comatose for four days and suffered permanent hearing loss and a fractured skull. In response, the government produced reports from guards about the incident and argued that those reports showed Bello-Gobea to have been the aggressor. During his unsworn allocution, Bello-Gobea denied that he started the fight and counsel argued that the guards\u2019 reports in fact identified another inmate as the aggressor. (The reports were the only evidence discussed in relation to confinement conditions, but neither party ever introduced them into the record.) Counsel stated that under normal circumstances he would ask for a continuance to examine the reports, but in this case his client insisted on being sentenced immediately to prevent any delay in his transfer to a new facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The district court heard all of Bello-Gobea\u2019s allegations and explained that, even accepting them as true, the court saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>no basis for a reduced sentence. The court, therefore, gave meaningful consideration to Bello-Gobea\u2019s request for a lower sentence, <em>see United States v. Laufle, </em>433 F.3d 981, 987 (7th Cir.2006), so raising a reasonableness argument on appeal would indeed be frivolous. Even if we read the district court\u2019s ruling as based solely on the lack of evidentiary support for Bello-Gobea\u2019s allegations, there would still be no error giving rise to a nonfrivolous appeal. It was Bello-Gobea\u2019s burden to prove the harshness of his conditions of confinement because it was a mitigating factor that he raised, <em>see United States v. Tahzib, </em>513 F.3d 692, 695 (7th Cir.2008), but he did nothing but present unsworn statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
