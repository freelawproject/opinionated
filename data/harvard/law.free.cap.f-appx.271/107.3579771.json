Nan Qing Zhang, </em>No. A 78 282 661 (B.I.A. July 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conelusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Here, the BIA accurately noted that it had dismissed Zhang\u2019s appeal from an IJ\u2019s decision in 2004, and that Zhang did not file his second motion to reopen until 2007. Because Zhang filed that second motion well beyond the ninety-day filing deadline, the BIA properly found that it was both untimely and in excess of the numerical limitation for the filing of such motions. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In addition, the BIA properly found that Zhang failed to establish that he qualified for an exception to the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. To the extent that Zhang argues that the family planning policy will now apply to him in a manner in which it did not apply before he fathered two children in the United States, and that such a difference amounts to a change in country conditions, this argument is unavailing. Merely reframing his change in personal circumstances as a change in country conditions in China does not bring Zhang\u2019s motion within the exceptions for the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Further, the BIA appropriately found that the country conditions evidence proffered by Zhang did not demonstrate a \u201cmaterial change in country conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zhang submitted in support of his motion, <em>inter alia, </em>a statement from the Administrative Office of the National Population and Family Planning Committee concerning the Population and Family Planning Regulations of Fujian Province, dated March 2006, indicating that a Chinese national by the name of \u201cZheng, Yu Ye,\u201d who had children born abroad could be subjected to the family planning laws, and that those births could be considered \u201cillegal.\u201d Zhang also submitted a propaganda document from Chang Le City, Fujian Province, which states, \u201cOne child, IUD insertion; two children; sterilization,\u201d as well as his own affidavit asserting that villagers in his hometown had been forced to undergo sterilization after having a second child or pregnancy. He further presented excerpts from the State Department Country Reports from 2004 and 2005, stating that the Chinese government restricted the rights of families to choose the number of children they have, that those who violate the family planning policy were subjected to disciplinary measures, and that there were reports of forcible abortion and steri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>lization procedures, the \u201cmost egregious\u201d of which occurred in Shandong Province. In light of those documents, the BIA properly found that Zhang\u2019s background materials reflected \u201ccontinuing enforcement of China\u2019s population control policy, not a material change in country conditions.\u201d Thus, the BIA appropriately determined that the evidence submitted by Zhang failed to bring his case within an exception to the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Moreover, even assuming that the birth of Zhang\u2019s second child in the United States amounted to a violation of the family planning policy in his area of residence in China, the BIA properly found that Zhang had not persuasively shown that he would be forced to undergo sterilization. Zhang submitted, in support of his claim that he would be forcibly sterilized his own affidavit, to which the BIA appropriately gave very little weight, and other documents, none of which demonstrated that a policy of forced sterilization exists in Zhang\u2019s home province of Zhejiang. <em>See Matter of S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 258 (BIA 2007) (finding that documents not specifically related to the applicant or to her province were not material to her claim and did not meet the threshold for reopening). Zhang\u2019s claim that he would be forcibly sterilized if returned to China is simply too speculative. <em>See Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Lastly, as the Government correctly asserts, Zhang fails to raise in his brief to this Court any argument that he is entitled to file a successive asylum application, or that the BIA erred in declining to reopen his proceedings <em>sua s-ponte. </em>We therefore deem any such claims waived. <em>See Yueq-ing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of Zhang\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. In contrast to this Court's decision in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2006), there is no indication that the BIA failed to consider the documents Zhang submitted in support of his motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 115. Indeed, the BIA was not required to address specifically each of Zhang's documents when the record does not \"compellingly suggest\u201d that it did not \"take into account all of the evidence before [it].\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 337, n. 17 (2d Cir.2006). <em>But see Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.2007) (remanding where the BIA\u2019s decision did not indicate that it paid any attention to documents \"quite similar\u201d to the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
