Pearson challenges the ruling on two grounds. First, Pearson argues that the administrative law judge failed to state what weight he accorded the finding by the Veterans Administration that Pearson was totally disabled. Second, Pearson argues that the administrative law judge applied an erroneous legal standard to conclude that Pearson\u2019s alcohol abuse materially contributed to his mental impairments and barred him from receiving social security benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1440. The burden rests with the claimant to prove that he is disabled and entitled to Social Security benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a); <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-17\">The record supports the conclusion by the administrative law judge that, although Pearson received a total disability rating by the Veterans Administration, he did not qualify for Social Security benefits. <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 999 (11th Cir.1987). The Veterans Administration concluded that Pearson was totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>disabled due to a bipolar disorder, low back pain, and hypertension. The rating was awarded based on the finding by the Administration that Pearson had an \u201cimpairment of mind or body which [was] sufficient to render its impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.340(a)(1). This rating, although given \u201cgreat weight,\u201d was not binding on the administrative law judge. <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 921 (11th Cir.1984). The record establishes that the administrative law judge considered the rating in his decision and correctly explained that a claimant had to satisfy a more stringent standard to be found disabled under the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Substantial evidence supports the finding by the administrative law judge that Pearson\u2019s continuing alcohol abuse was a contributing factor to his disability. An applicant for Social Security benefits \u201cshall not be considered to be disabled ... if alcoholism ... would be a contributing factor material to the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the individual is disabled.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(C). Pearson had a history of alcohol abuse and was awarded disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income in 1996 based, in part, on his alcohol dependence. Pearson made statements to various medical personnel which established that he continued to drink through the early months of 2003. Pearson did not offer any evidence, other than his incredible testimony, to establish that he no longer abused alcohol. <em>See Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Although the Administrative Law Judge found that Pearson was disabled due to his major depression, the judge was required to \u201cdetermine whether\u201d Pearson\u2019s \u201calcoholism [was] a contributing factor material to the determination of [his] disability\u201d based on his history. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1535. Clinical psychologist Nancy Sack testified that Pearson\u2019s functioning noticeably improved when he was not under the influence of alcohol. Objective expert medical evidence established that Pearson could perform light physical tasks, complete most complex decisions and tasks, and interact with others. Pearson\u2019s statements that he read, cut his grass, and took daily walks during which he would visit with neighbors supported these conclusions. Substantial evidence supports the finding by the Administrative Law Judge that alcoholism was a contributing factor to Pearson\u2019s disability. <em>See Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">The denial of Pearson\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
