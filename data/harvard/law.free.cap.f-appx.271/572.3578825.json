We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Southern Oregon Barter Fair v. Jackson Cty., </em>372 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2004). A district court\u2019s decision to deny a request for additional discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 853 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">The district court properly determined that Mickey had no procedural due process right to a predeprivation hearing because the challenged search and seizure occurred in the course of a criminal investigation, and adequate postdeprivation remedies were available. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (holding no Fourteenth Amendment due process violation where \u201cpredeprivation process is impracticable\u201d provided that \u201ca meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available\u201d); <em>Raditch v. U.S., </em>929 F.2d 478, 481 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cAlthough <em>Hudson </em>involved \u00a7 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, the same due process principles apply to the federal government through the Fifth Amendment.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (providing a cause of action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the United States for the return of wrongfully seized property).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The district court properly denied Mickey\u2019s request for additional discovery because Mickey failed to show how the evidence he sought would preclude summary judgment. <em>See Margolis, </em>140 F.3d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
