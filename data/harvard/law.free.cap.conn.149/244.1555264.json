Leighton, Jr., who were then confined in the state prison at Wethersfield, were arrested on a bench warrant which was issued on that day by the Superior Court at the request of the state\u2019s attorney for Hartford County based on an information charging the defendants and others with conspiracy to convey narcotics, barbiturates and intoxicating liquors into the prison. The specific allegations of the two counts of conspiracy and other counts not involving the defendants are immaterial. On May 22, 1959, the defendants wrote identical letters, addressed to the state\u2019s attorney for Hartford County, in which they requested trial at the earliest possible date. The letters were delivered on May 22, 1959, to the warden of the prison. On May 25, 1959, he forwarded them, along with his own certificates, to the state\u2019s attorney by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The state\u2019s attorney received the letters and the warden\u2019s certificates on May 26, 1959. The defendants were brought to the Superior Court at Hartford on September 23, 1959, for the purpose of being put to plea and tried. Each defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information on the ground that he had not, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-139 and 54-140, been brought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>trial within 120 days after he caused a written request for final disposition of his case to be delivered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An amendment to \u00a7 54-139 by Public Acts 1961, No. 465, does not affect the present question. The court granted both motions and rendered judgment dismissing the information as to the defendants. The state, with the permission of the court, has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The only question presented is the date from which the 120 days begins to run. The state claims that the beginning date was the date on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>notice came into the possession of the state\u2019s attorney. The defendants claim that the period started with the prisoners\u2019 delivery of the requests for trial to the warden of the prison. No claim is made that the notice is insufficient by reason of the fact that no attempt was made to give it also to the court. We consider, therefore, only the requirement relating to delivery to the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The answer to the question involves the meaning of the words \u201chas caused to be delivered\u201d as used in \u00a7 54-139. This, in turn, necessitates a consideration of the entire enactment. <em>McAdams </em>v. <em>Barbieri, </em>143 Conn. 405, 418, 123 A.2d 182. Where the language is plain and unambiguous, as in this case, the intent of a statute is to be determined from its language. <em>Landry </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>138 Conn. 445, 447, 86 A.2d 70. In such a case, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it. <em>State ex rel. Cooley </em>v. <em>Kegley, </em>143 Conn. 679, 683, 124 A.2d 898; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 654, 116 A.2d 420. The words used in expressing the legislative intent are to be given their commonly approved meaning. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1; <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>144 Conn. 516, 522, 134 A.2d 351; <em>Spellacy </em>v. <em>American Life Ins. Assn., </em>144 Conn. 346, 354, 131 A.2d 834. It must also be presumed that the General Assembly had a purpose for every sentence, clause or phrase in the statute. <em>McAdams </em>v. <em>Barbieri, </em>supra, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to \u00a7 54-139 and find, significantly, that the portion of it which is pertinent to the present question is divided into subsections (a) and (b). Under subsection (a), the prisoner is to be brought to trial within 120 days \u201cafter he has caused to be delivered, to the prosecut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ing official of the county in which the indictment or information is pending and the appropriate court,\u201d written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for final disposition of his case. The certificate of the official who has the prisoner in custody must accompany the prisoner\u2019s request and must recite specified information relative to his confinement. Subsection (b) then specifies how the delivery is to be made, namely, by the prisoner\u2019s giving or sending his written notice and request to the warden or other official having custody of him, \u201cwho shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\u201d Thus, the statute does not contemplate a request for a disposition of the case sent directly by the prisoner to the prosecuting official and the court, but rather a request delivered in a particular way through the medium of the custodial official and accompanied by a certificate to be supplied by him after his receipt of the request. The prisoner\u2019s part in the proceeding is only to \u201ccause\u201d his request \u201cto be delivered\u201d in the manner particularized in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Under \u00a7 54-139, the act required to be done in order to start the running of the period of 120 days is the delivery of the prisoner\u2019s request, accompanied by his custodian\u2019s certificate, to the prosecuting official of the county and the appropriate court. Obviously, a prisoner confined in a penal or correctional institution could not be required to make personal delivery. The General Assembly has therefore provided that the prisoner initiate the request for a trial, has required further that his custodian supply information concerning the prisoner\u2019s confinement to the prosecuting official and the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and has then prescribed the procedure to effect the actual delivery of both. It is the completed delivery of both the request and the supplemental information which starts the running of the period of 120 days within which the prisoner must be brought to trial. Subsection (b) makes this clear in that the prisoner\u2019s written notice and request is required only to be \u201cgiven or sent\u201d to the custodial official, but the latter\u2019s transmittal must be \u201cby registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\u201d The return receipt furnishes ample means of fixing the date from which the 120 days is to be computed. No provision is made, however, for fixing the date on which the notice and request is \u201cgiven or sent\u201d by the prisoner to his custodian. The phrase \u201chas caused to be delivered\u201d is the equivalent of \u201chas delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The defendants suggest that to give this meaning to the statute permits the prisoner to be prejudiced should his custodian hold the notice and request unduly before transmitting it. This concern is more imaginary than real. The statute requires that the custodian \u201cpromptly forward\u201d the notice and request with his certificate. A writ of mandamus would compel compliance with that requirement. <em>State ex rel. Lacerenza </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>133 Conn. 530, 534, 52 A.2d 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendants were presented for trial within 120 days after the delivery to the state\u2019s attorney of their requests for a trial. <em>Austin, Nichols &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>100 Conn. 81, 84, 123 A. 32. Consequently, the court should have denied the motions to dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The fact that the notices involved here were delivered to the state\u2019s attorney but not to the court has repeatedly been alluded to. It was suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>in argument that it is the practice to treat such a notice as a valid notice under the statute. This impels us to observe that no practice, however uniform and extensive it may be, can control the explicit provisions of a statute. <em>Linsley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>13 Conn. 192, 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">There is error, the judgment dismissing the information as to the defendants is set aside and the case is remanded to he proceeded with according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> \u201cSee. 54-139. disposition op pending indictment or Information against prisoner, (a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correetional institution of this state and, during the continuance of the term of imprisonment, there is pending in this state any untried indictment or information against such prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred twenty days after he has caused to be delivered, to the prosecuting official of the county in which the indictment or information is pending and the appropriate court, written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for final disposition to be made of the indictment or information, provided, for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.
