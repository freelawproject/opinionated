Other errors assigned are considered as having been abandoned. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 167, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>327. Certain additions to the finding which are supported by the evidence and are material to a consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of error in the charge have been made. <em>Castaldo </em>v. <em>D\u2019Eramo, </em>140 Conn. 88, 93, 98 A.2d 664; Maltbie, op. cit. \u00a7 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claims of proof, as thus corrected, may be stated in summary as follows: About noontime on December 31, 1956, the plaintiff Patricia Domenick, driving her husband\u2019s Studebaker sedan in a westerly direction on North Main Street in Branford, was approaching the intersection with Ivy Street. Although the surface of the highway was covered with mud and water, the weather was clear and visibility was good. North Main Street consisted of two concrete lanes, each ten feet wide, and was substantially level. Double solid white lines in the middle of the street ran from about 100 feet east of the Ivy Street intersection through that intersection and beyond it. Five hundred feet east of the intersection there were clearly visible signs placed by the state traffic commission; one indicated the intersection, and another carried the legend \u201cNo Passing.\u201d When Patricia was 200 feet east of the intersection, she indicated by the mechanical signaling device on her car that she intended to make a left turn into Ivy Street. As she entered the intersection, she slowed down to five miles an hour. Behind her, a truck owned by the named defendant was being operated by its employee, the defendant Frederick Parris. Without warning, Parris crossed the double white lines into the left lane and attempted to pass the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile as it started to turn left into Ivy Street. The two vehicles collided and Patricia sustained serious personal injuries. The defendants\u2019 negligence was the proximate cause of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The defendants claimed to have proved the following: Extending in an easterly direction from a point 100 feet east of the intersection, there was a broken white line in the middle of North Main Street. Parris had started to pass the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile before he reached the double solid white lines which began, 100 feet east of the intersection, where the broken line ended. Patricia failed to keep a reasonable lookout to the rear before she turned into Ivy Street. She signaled her intention of making a left turn simultaneously with her turning and while the truck was alongside her automobile, so that her signal could not be seen by Parris. The left front of the plaintiffs\u2019 car struck the right rear of the truck as it was passing. The proximate cause of the collision was contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury specifically with respect to the statute, \u00a7 1386d of the 1955 Cumulative Supplement (presently General Statutes \u00a714-234), which authorized the state traffic commission to determine \u201cno-passing\u201d zones and required operators of motor vehicles to observe them. The complaint contained ten separate and distinct allegations of negligence, including allegations that Parris failed to obey the directions of the \u201cNo Passing\u201d sign and the white lines and that he drove the truck to the left side of the highway as he approached within 100 feet of the intersection. The court in its charge read all the allegations in the complaint which set forth the grounds of negligence claimed. It then charged that a violation of a statute prescribing certain conduct in the operation of a motor vehicle would constitute negligence which, if it proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, would be actionable negligence. After calling the jury\u2019s attention to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>statute relating to speed (then Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2407, presently General Statutes \u00a7 14-219) and the statute on reckless driving (then Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2408, presently General Statutes \u00a714-222), and after reading pertinent portions of those statutes to the jury, the court also called their attention to \u00a7 1385d of the 1955 Cumulative Supplement (presently General Statutes \u00a714-235), and read from that statute as follows: \u201cNo vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the highway . . . when approaching within one hundred feet of or crossing any intersection . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Under our rules, any party who intends to claim the benefit of a specific statute must file a written request to charge on the legal principle involved. Practice Book \u00a7 153; <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>148 Conn. 266, 269, 169 A.2d 888. The plaintiffs filed no request to charge on \u00a7 1386d or any other statute. If the plaintiffs had intended to claim the benefit of \u00a7 1386d, they should have filed, in due time, a request to charge which explained the meaning of the section and its application to the claims of proof. <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>supra. Section 1386d concerned the placing of \u201cno-passing\u201d signs and markings by the state traffic commission and required that they be obeyed. Prom the claims of proof, it appears to be conceded that Parris turned onto his left-hand side of the highway to pass the plaintiffs\u2019 car as both cars approached the intersection. In the absence of a specific request to charge, error cannot be predicated on the court\u2019s failure to charge on \u00a7 1386d. Under the circumstances, a charge which instructed the jury to consider the application of \u00a7 1385d, forbidding the operation of a motor vehicle on the left-hand side of the highway within 100 feet of an intersection or while the vehicle is passing through the intersection, was proper and adequate guidance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>this particular issue. <em>Borsoi </em>v. <em>Sparico, </em>141 Conn. 366, 372, 106 A.2d 170; <em>Steinecke </em>v. <em>Medalie, </em>139 Conn. 152, 157, 90 A.2d 875; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The plaintiffs claim error because the court, in its charge on contributory negligence, called the attention of the jury to statutory requirements governing the conduct of a motor vehicle operator at intersecting highways and in giving signals of an intention to make a turn. See Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7\u00a7 1393d, 1394d, 1395d (presently General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-241, 14-242, 14-244). The reason advanced by the plaintiffs is that these statutes were outside the scope of the pleadings. In a special defense of contributory negligence, the defendants alleged that Patricia failed to use the care of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances, failed to keep a proper lookout and \u201cfailed to operate the . . . automobile in such a manner as to prevent the same from coming into collision\u201d with the defendants\u2019 vehicle. The plaintiffs did not try to have this pleading made more specific. Practice Book \u00a7 59. Under these allegations and the supporting claims of proof, reference to the statutory law governing the operation of a motor vehicle turning left at an intersection was adapted to the issues and proper for the guidance of the jury. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 313, 315, 142 A.2d 135; <em>D\u2019Addario </em>v. <em>American Automobile Ins. Co., </em>142 Conn. 251, 254, 113 A.2d 361. It was not error for the court, suo motu, to charge on the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The plaintiffs complain that the court, in the last portion of the charge on contributory negligence, stated that if Patricia was chargeable with contributory negligence she could not recover, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>failed to add that, to prevent recovery, her negligence must be found to be a proximate cause of the injuries alleged. \u201cA charge must be read and considered in its entirety.\u201d <em>Salvatore </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>144 Conn. 437, 442, 133 A.2d 622. The matter of proximate cause and its relation to the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs were chargeable with contributory negligence had been adequately presented in earlier portions of the charge. See <em>Steinecke </em>v. <em>Medalie, </em>supra. There is no merit in an alleged error predicated on an isolated portion of a charge when the charge as a whole adequately covers the matter of which complaint is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The plaintiffs also claim error in the court\u2019s charge with respect to the inference to be drawn from their failure to produce Dr. Carpinella as a witness and from the production by the defendant of Dr. Shutkin as a witness. Dr. Carpinella was Patricia\u2019s personal physician. He had seen her very shortly after she suffered her alleged injuries. Dr. Shutkin, at her request, examined her eight days later. The rule stated in the charge did not conform to the rule set forth in <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 676, 165 A.2d 598, which was decided after the trial in the instant case. The charge, however, was more favorable to the plaintiffs than the <em>Secondino </em>rule would have been, and they have no ground for complaint. Furthermore, the verdict was a general one for the defendants, and we must presume that the jury did not reach the question of damages. <em>Mims </em>v. <em>Kingsley, </em>145 Conn. 7, 10, 138 A.2d 520; <em>Steinmetz </em>v. <em>Steinmetz, </em>127 Conn. 700, 705, 20 A.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
