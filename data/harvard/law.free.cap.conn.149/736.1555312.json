The present case involves property situated in the same Shorehaven Road section of Norwalk. A portion of the defendant\u2019s property adjoins the property of the defendant in the <em>Garbaty </em>case, and a number of the plaintiffs in the present case were plaintiffs in the <em>Garbaty </em>case. Here, as in the <em>Garbaty </em>case, the plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to restrain an alleged violation of the Norwalk zoning regulations, the pertinent portions of which appear in the <em>Garbaty </em>case. The defendant is a charitable, social and fraternal club the chief activity of which is not a service carried on as a business. The defendant owns two parcels of property in an AAA residence zone. One parcel is used as a parking lot and the other contains a ten-room house which was used as a dwelling until 1957. An order of nuns used the house for recreational activities in the summers of 1957, 1958 and 1959. The defendant leased the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>erty on October 15, 1959, and acquired title to it on February 16, 1960. The defendant has made no alterations in the house, but it has used the house as a club for the social and recreational activities of its members, and it intends to continue that use. The parking lot has been used in connection with the use of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The plaintiffs claim that our decision in the <em>Garbaty </em>ease is not conclusive of the issues here. They assert that the <em>Garbaty </em>case was erroneously decided, for the reason, among others, that \u00a7XII of the Norwalk zoning regulations (1929 as amended)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not called to our attention in that case and that, as a result, the meaning which we gave to \u00a7 III in that case, at page 382, has the effect of duplicating in \u00a7 III the requirements imposed by \u00a7 XII. The pertinent portion of \u00a7 III is printed in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The language of the <em>Garbaty </em>case, the plaintiffs say, means that both sections necessarily regulate housing. This argument is unsound. Section XII does not regulate housing, nor does it purport to direct the use of buildings. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>contrary, it deals with, the erection or alteration of buildings and with the size of lots. Section III, on the other hand, as indicated in the <em>Garbaty </em>case, deals with the use of a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The other arguments advanced for reaching a result contrary to that arrived at in the <em>Garbaty </em>ease were considered in that case, and we find no sound reason for any different conclusion in the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\"> \u201cSection XII.\u2014schedule limiting height and bulk of buildings and size of lot.
