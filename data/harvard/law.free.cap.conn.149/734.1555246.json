They seek to recover rents which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>they allege were paid to the defendant Dreamy Hollow Apartments Corporation and were collected from them by the defendants in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19-370 and 19-371 which are part of the Tenement House Act. The court sustained a demurrer by Dreamy Hollow Apartments Corporation to the complaint and rendered judgment for that defendant when the plaintiffs failed to plead over. The plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">At the outset, we are confronted with a question of jurisdiction which must first be determined, although it was not raised by the defendants. <em>Devine Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood, </em>145 Conn. 77, 79, 139 A.2d 60; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>145 Conn. 1, 6, 137 A.2d 759; <em>Bardes </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>141 Conn. 317, 318, 106 A.2d 160. Schedule A, attached to and made a part of the complaint, lists the amount of rent which each plaintiff seeks to recover. The amounts range from $162.50 to $1458. The total amount alleged to have been paid by all of the forty-two tenants is $35,131. The plaintiffs claim $45,000 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions in which the matter in demand exceeds $10,000, and concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Common Pleas of actions in which the matter in demand exceeds $5000 but does not exceed $10,000. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-10, 52-28. It follows that, unless the matter in demand in this case exceeds $5000, the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter, in which event we also lack jurisdiction and may act on our own motion to dismiss the action. <em>Masone </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>148 Conn. 551, 554, 172 A.2d 891; <em>Willard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>135 Conn. 303, 306, 63 A.2d 847; <em>Felletter </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>133 Conn. 277, 280, 50 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Generally, the matter in demand is determined by the amount of damages claimed in the complaint; <em>Atlantic Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Schoen, </em>118 Conn. 26, 28, 170 A. 478; but where several separate claims are joined in one suit, the jurisdiction of the court is ordinarily determined by the amount which may be demanded on each claim separately. <em>Fairfield Lumber &amp; Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>139 Conn. 141, 145, 90 A.2d 884. The most that could be demanded on any one claim in this case is $1458. This amount is insufficient to bring the action within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, and the attempt of the plaintiffs to aggregate their separate demands into a single ad damnum of more than $5000 will not confer jurisdiction on that court. The action should be erased from the docket for want of jurisdiction. <em>Liebeskind </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>142 Conn. 155, 159, 112 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
