Tried below before Hon. H. 0. Head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-15\">This suit was brought by the appellant, Mrs. Annie Williams, a widow, against appellee, in form of trespass to try title, and for damages. Plea of not guilty filed by defendant. The judgment was for defendant, and plaintiff appealed. The court filed conclusions of law and fact. There is no statement of facts. The court's findings are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-16\">\u201c1. I find that on the 2d day of May, 1882\" (the day of the alleged trespass), \u201cthe plaintiff Annie Williams was the owner in fee simple of the land in controvesy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-17\">\u201c 2. I find that on February 21, 1881, a suit was instituted in justice of the peace court, precinct Ho. 7, of Lamar County, Texas, in the name of John W. Williams and Annie Williams, the plaintiff herein, as plaintiffs, against one Thomas H. Moore as defendant, on an account for $128 \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-18\">(for which judgment was rendered for plaintiff against defendant on June 4, 1881, and all costs of suit, and against each party for the costs incurred by them), \u201cand that in same case David Allen and D. Maury were summoned as garnishees, the cases against them docketed separately, and that thereafter, on the 3d day of September, 1881, judgment was rendered in each of said garnishment cases dismissing the same by order of plaintiff's attorney, and rendering judgment against the plaintiff in each of said cases for all the costs therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-19\">\u201c3. I find that each of said suits and all proceedings therein, notwithstanding they all recite that plaintiff appeared, were in fact without the knowledge of plaintiff Annie Williams, and without authority from her or any legally authorized agent of hers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-20\">\u201c4. I find that on the 3d day of March, 1882, executions were regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>larly issued on each of said judgments for costs therein, and after regular levies and notices the land in controversy was sold thereunder for a valuable consideration, and defendant claims by regular chain of transfers under this sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">\u201c5. I conclude and find that said judgments and sale thereunder can not be collaterally attacked in this suit, and that the defendant is entitled to judgment herein for the land in controversy and all costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">The errors assigned are that the court erred in his conclusions of law in not rendering judgment for the plaintiff, and in holding that the judgment was binding upon Mrs. Williams, she having been made a party by fraud and without her knowledge or consent, and holding that the judgment could not be collaterally attacked by her.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-7\"><em>D.

Even where a part of the record\u2014the citation and its return\u2014shows that service could not have been had, the judgment of a justice of the peace reciting that the defendant wholly made default and that he \u201cwas duly served with process\u201d was held not impeached. The judgment being the final act of the court, its judicial finding imports absolute verity. Evidence of fraud <em>aliunde </em>the record can not be heard to dispute the judgment, even where the fraud is in obtaining jurisdiction. The following are some of the cases decided in this State holding the foregoing doctrines: Murchison v. White, 54 Texas, 78; Fleming v. Seeligson, 57 Texas, 524; Odle v. Frost, 59 Texas, 684; Watkins v. Da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>vis, 61 Texas, 414; Mikeska v. Blum, 63 Texas, 44; Treadway v. Eastburn, 57 Texas, 209; Long v. Brenneman, 59 Texas, 210. There are many other cases more or less in point which we need not cite.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Treadway v. Eastburn, <em>supra, </em>extends the doctrine to the limit that where the judgment recites that the party was served the fact can not be disputed by the return of the citation. This case was followed by the Commission of Appeals in Davis v. Robinson, 70 Texas, 394. The doctrine is not singular. Freem. on Judg., sec. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We have been cited by appellant to the case of Glass v. Smith, 66 Texas, 549, as holding a contrary doctrine. Smith recovered judgment in a Justice Court for a yoke of oxen, in which Glass, the defendant, acquiesced. <em>\u201c </em>Some person, without authority from Glass, without his knowledge and contrary to his wish, but in his name/\u2019 took the case to the District Court by certiorari, where Glass failing to appear, judgment was entered against him by default for the oxen, and on his failure to return them, for their value, $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Execution was issued and levied on land in another county, which was sold; then another execution was issued and levied on personal effects of Glass, who sued out an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the judgment. It was shown that Glass was authorized to believe that no adjudication would be had on the proceeding. The injunction was dissolved, and on appeal it was perpetuated, the court holding that the court not having jurisdiction of the person of Glass in the certiorari the judgment was a nullity. For aught that appears in the record there was no occasion to hold that the judgment was a nullity to sustain the injunction restraining its collection under the statute which requires such suits (on voidable judgments) to be brought within one year from the time of the rendition of the judgment, certain exceptions being named. Sayles* Civ. Stats., art. 2875, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Our opinion is the injunction was a direct proceeding between the original parties to vacafe the judgment and forever prevent its enforcement, in which case the opinion would not be inconsistent with other cases cited which refer only to collateral proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">But be this as it may, the judgment enjoined did not recite any appearance for Glass. In the case before us the judgments recite that plaintiff did appear, and that it was at her instance and the instance of her co-plaintiff that the suits were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">These judgments are controlled by the law as announced in Treadway v. Eastburn, <em>supra; </em>they <em>\u201c </em>import absolute verity,\u201d and are not subject to collateral attack. Many objections might be made to the principle by which we are controlled in making this decision; but it must be remembered that Mrs. Williams had the right to set aside these judgments by direct proceeding. She has not availed herself of this privilege, preferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>rather to treat the judgments as void, a conclusion which the law will not .sustain. The judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Adopted May 13, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
