The plaintiff recovered a judgment for $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The statement of facts contained in the record was stricken out at a previous term of this court on the motion of appellee, because it was filed after the adjournment of the term at which the trial was had without an order of the court allowing it to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition shows that defendant was at the date of plaintiff\u2019s injury an incorporated city under the general laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In the absence of a statement of facts we can consider but one question made by appellant. It is contended that the court should have charg\u00e9d the jury at defendant\u2019s request that defendant being a municipal corporation under the general laws of this State was not liable to plaintiff in this action. It would have been improper to so charge. Baugus v.
