The court erred in admitting in evidence over the objection of defendant the original petition filed in the Commissioners Court asking for the appointment of a sheep inspector. 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 557, 569.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-11\">2. The. original order of the Commissioners Court failing to show that the facts existed which would authorize the appointment of a sheep inspector for Lampasas County, and it not appearing from other evidence adduced that such facts existed at the time of said appointment, the order making said appointment was not admissible in evidence. Acts 1883, p. 42, sec. 1; Mitchell v. Runkle, 25 Texas Supp., 133; Thatcher v. Powell, 6 Wheat.,, 119; Freem. on Judg., sec. 123.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-12\">No brief on file for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-13\">HENRY, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">\u2014This suit was brought by appellee to recover fees claimed to be due him as inspector of sheep for Lampasas 'County.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">The Act of April 4, 1883, provides that \u201cwhenever it appears from the assessor\u2019s rolls that there are as many as 500 sheep owned and assessed for taxes in any county of this State, it shall be the duty of the Commissioners Court of said county, upon the application of one or more resident \u25a0owners of sheep of said county, to appoint an inspector of sheep,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">On the trial plaintiff was allowed to introduce in evidence a petition filed in the County Commissioners Court, which purported to have been signed by owners of sheep of said county, for the appointment of a sheep inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Defendant objected to the evidence on the ground that the execution nf the instrument by the signers had not been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">The plaintiff was permitted to read as evidence the order of the Commissioners Court appointing him sheep inspector and showing an approval .-of his bond as such inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>We do not think that the court committed an error in either of said rulings. It may be presumed in this suit that the court before it appointed an inspector ascertained that the facts existed to authorize such action by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It is insisted that the evidence did not sustain the judgment because it-failed to show that the sheep inspected were either owned by appellant or\u00edn his charge. The law provides that the inspector\u2019s fees shall be paid \u201cby the-owner or person in charge of the sheep inspected, and the inspector shall have a lien for his fee upon all sheep inspected by him and found to be diseased with scab.\u201d The evidence shows that from one-third to one-half of the flock inspected were afflicted with scab.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The court found as a conclusion of fact that plaintiff \u201cinspected 1333-head of sheep in the care, control, and management of the defendant.\u201d\" The evidence showed that the sheep were the separate property of the wife of the defendant. The defendant testified that he was not in charge of the sheep, but that one Lee had charge of them at the time of the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The provision of our law that \u201cduring the marriage the husband shall have the sole management\u201d of the wife\u2019s property sufficiently made defendant the person in charge of the sheep to render him liable for the inspection fees even if such liability did not otherwise exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">We find no error in the record for which we think the judgment should be reversed, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\n<em>Affirmed..</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Delivered May 16, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
