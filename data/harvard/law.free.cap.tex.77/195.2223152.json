The defendant in execution, who was the owner of the land when it was sold, subsequently sold and conveyed it to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">The court sustained exceptions to the petition on the ground that the interest of the defendant in execution was not assignable and that the plaintiff could not maintain a suit to set aside the execution sale as a purchaser from and the assignee of the defendant in execution.</p>\n<p id=\"AVe\">In this we think there was error. The equitable interest of the defendant in the land after its sale and his right to prosecute a suit to vacate the sale could be sold and conveyed to him. Railway v.
