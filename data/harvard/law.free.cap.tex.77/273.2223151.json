Upon inspection of the record we are of opinion that it sustains the suggestion of delay, and we proceed to dispose of the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Cameron, Castles &amp; Storey brought this suit against plaintiffs in error on a promissory note for $661.07, set out in the petition and made apart of it. The defendants answered by general demurrer and general denial. Judgment was rendered reciting that plaintiffs and defendants appeared by attorney, \u201cand the jury being waived the plaintiffs announced readyfor trial, and thereupon the defendants withdrew the answer by them heretofore filed in this cause and say nothing in bar of plaintiffs\u2019 action; wherefore it is considered that plaintiffs ought to recover their damages by occasion of the premises; and it appearing to the court that the cause of action is liquidated and proved by an instrument of writing, it is ordered that the clerk do assess the damages,\u201d etc.; and on the assessment of damages by the clerk the judgment was entered for the amount due on the note sued on according to its tenor and effect, viz., $833.16. The record contains no statement of facts or conclusions by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">The only assignment of error presented is: \u201cThe court erred in ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u2022dering judgment fof plaintiffs as on a cause of action liquidated and proven by a written instrument, when no such instrument was produced in court on the trial of this cause nor filed among the papers of this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The cause of action was described in the petition as a promissory note in writing, which was set out in the petition and made a part of it. It is stated in the judgment that \u201cit appearing to the court that the cause of action is liquidated and proved by an instrument in writing.\u201d We understand the court to mean by the expression \u201cit appearing to the court\u201d that it was proved or made evident. As against the mere declaration made in the assignment of error we must presume that the fact that the cause of action was liquidated and proved by an instrument in writing was proved or made to appear by legal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">If there could be any doubt, however, of the correctness of the conclusion just announced, the judgment must nevertheless be affirmed, for \u201cthe withdrawal of the defendant\u2019s answer amounts to a judgment <em>nihil elicit, </em>which is regarded as a species of judgment by confession, and carries with it more strongly the admission of the justice of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action (and will operate as a waiver of more errors) than a judgment by default. A judgment <em>nihil elicit </em>amounts to a confession of the 1 cause of action stated, or attempted to be stated, in the petition,\u2019 if the amount claimed can be ascertained by the proceedings had on a judgment by default\u2014that is, a writ of inquiry on an unliquidated demand, or by the clerk upon a liquidated demand, evidenced by a written instrument filed as part of the petition or sufficiently described to enable the clerk to make the computation of the amount due.\u201d Gilder v. McIntyre, 29 Texas, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">So it is clear that the withdrawal of the answer was a confession of the cause of action as stated in the petition, and no proof of it was therefore necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed with damages of 10 per cent on the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Adopted May 13, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
