The engine was cut loose from the train and moved south across the track of the Texas &amp; St. Louis Railway Company. At this time many passengers had been awaiting the arrival of the train \u2022of the latter company. When it arrived going south it halted at the depot platform, where part of the waiting passengers entered. It then passed across the track of plaintiff in error, going to a coal bin to coal up. From some cause the passengers left at the platform thought it best to go from the platform to the cars so as to enter them. The passengers were crossing when the engine of plaintiff in error, north of the Texas &amp; St. Louis Railway track, was cut loose and moved swiftly forward, crossing the track of the latter, passing through the crowd. Employes testified that the bell was ringing and the starting had been signaled by the whistle. This was contradicted. In this movement defendant in error was struck and injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">The opinion sufficiently states the other facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">The court, after stating the case instructed the jury: \u201cIt is the duty of the defendant company and its employes to ring the bell. . . blow the whistle on starting at a railroad crossing, and to keep a lookout for persons in danger from the movements of the engine, and to take and use such care and skill in handling the engine and to avoid inflicting injury as the mass of prudent persons in like business are accustomed to exercise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">\u201cIt is the duty of a person about to cross a railroad track to make use of his senses of sight and hearing in order to avoid a collision, and to use such care for his safety that ordinarily prudent men in such circumstances are accustomed to use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-8\">\u201cNegligence is the failure to do what a reasonable and prudent person would ordinarily have done under the circumstances of the situation, or doing what such a person under the circumstances would not have done. Negligence is the failure to perform a duty, and the duty is measured by the exigencies of the situation under investigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">\u201cKeeping these general definitions in mind, the jury will by preponderance in the evidence act upon the following special instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-10\">\u201cIf they find that at the time and place, as alleged in the petition, while the plaintiff was taking proper care of himself, through the negligence of the defendant company or of its employes he was run upon by the engine of defendant, and by such collision he received bodily injury, they will find for the plaintiff such damages, if any, as were the natural and proximate effect of such collision; including, if shown by the testimony, loss of time, physical and mental pain and suffering, medical bills and medicines, and lessened capacity to earn wages in his business, as may be shown by the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-11\">\u201cIf they should find that the defendant company and its employes were negligent in handling the engine, and that the collision, as alleged, was the cause of the injury, still if from the testimony the plaintiff him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>self was guilty of negligence in attempting to cross the track of the defendant, and that he saw or heard the approaching engine, or by the use of his senses by ordinary care could have seen or heard it, and so attempted to cross the track in immediate front of and near the approaching engine, and that such negligence contributed to the collision and consequent injury, then the jury will find for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-3\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $613.

It was error for the court to state to the jury what constituted diligence on the part of defendant company by stating that <em>\u201c </em>it is the duty of the defendant company and its servants and employes to ring the bell and blow the whistle on starting at a railroad crossing.\u201d Rorer on Rys., 1059.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\"><em>2. </em>To make the omission to ring the bell or blow the whistle negligence itself, there must be some difficulty in the way of the plaintiff seeing or hearing the approaching train or engine.

'</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The defendant in error with his family were at the town of Corsicana, Texas, waiting for the Texas &amp; St. Louis train to leave going south, and had been so waiting for an hour or more before that passenger train arrived from the north. When it arrived it pulled up to the depot and discharged its passengers, and then moved back across the track of the plaintiff in error (the two roads crossing at that point) to \u201ccoal up\u201d the engine. ' The defendant in error testifies \u201cthat while it was taking coal the rest of those waiting rushed across the Houston <em>&amp; </em>Texas Central Railway track, and I and my wife and children followed. When I got on the Houston <em>&amp; </em>Texas Central Railway track, with my baby in my arms, its engine caught me and my baby on the pilot, falling backwards.\u201d He further described his injuries, and testified that a great many persons were present, and it was between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock at night. \u201cHo warning was given whatever,\u201d he said, \u201cor notice of the engine\u2019s approach. Heard no bell or whistle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">There was other evidence to the effect that he was warned not to cross the track, one witness testifying that he told him the passenger train <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of the Texas &amp; St. Louis Railway, which had backed for the purpose of coaling, would return to the platform for passengers. There was proof also that there was no necessity for crossing the track of plaintiff in error to board the passenger train of the Texas &amp; St. Louis Railway Company. There was proof also that the signals were given of the approach of the engine, and that the headlight was shining brightly, and that there was nothing to prevent defendant in error from seeing the engine approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Plaintiff below recovered judgment for \u00a7&gt;613 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The first error relied on is that the court erred in giving the following charge, to-wit: \u201cIt is the duty of the defendant company and its servants and employes to ring the bell and blow the whistle on starting at a railroad crossing, and to keep a lookout for persons endangered from the movements of the engine, and to take and use such care and skill in handling the engine as to avoid inflicting injury as the most prudent in like business are accustomed to exercise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">There was error in the foregoing instruction. The statute (Rev. Stats., . art. <em>4232) </em>does not require the bell to be rung or the whistle to be blown \u201con starting at a railroad crossing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">There seems to be no controversy as to the fact that the accident resulting in appellee\u2019s injury occurred near a place where two lines of railroad cross each other. In approaching such crossing the engine is required to be \u201cbrought to a full stop.\u201d Railway v. York, 74 Texas, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">It is proper to say that the charge did not require the use of such care and skill to avoid inflicting injury as \u201cthe most prudent in like business are accustomed to exercise,\u201d but such as the mass of prudent persons in like business are accustomed to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">The next assignment is as follows: \u201c The court erred in not giving the following charge asked and refused: \u2018If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s ipjuries resulted from his attempting to.cross the railroad track immediately in front of an approaching locomotive engine propelled by the agents of defendant, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff William Brin to show affirmatively not only the want of ordinary care and caution on the part of the agents of defendant but the exercise of due care and caution on the part of plaintiff Brin; and if the jury find from the evidence that the negligence or want of due care or caution of the plaintiff, William Brin, caused the accident, or even contributed to produce the injury, or that it could have been avoided by the exercise of due care on the part of plaintiff Brin, then the plaintiff can not recover and you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">There was no error in refusing this, because the charge of the court we think sufficiently instructed the jury, in effect, that appellee could not recover if he contributed to his own injury by the want of care and prudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>For the error in the charge mentioned, we think the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Adopted May 6, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
