LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Appellant James Joseph Painter was dismissed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from his position as special agent for lying in a sworn statement. Appellant subsequently applied for a security position with a private employer. The employer sent a letter to the FBI requesting verification of past employment. The FBI\u2019s response listed \u201cthe periods of the plaintiff\u2019s employment as a clerk and a special agent of the FBI,\u201d and \u201creported [that] the plaintiff was employed until October 18, 1977, when his services were <em>terminated.\u201d See </em>Record on Appeal, p. 39 (declaration by Chief of Records Management Division, FBI) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Appellant then brought this suit claiming that he had been deprived of liberty and property without due process of law as required by the Fifth Amendment, seeking damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and requesting backpay, reinstatement, and declaratory relief. The district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s tort claim since he had not presented his claim for damages to the appropriate federal agency. 537 F.Supp. 232. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2675(a) (West 1981). The court dismissed appellant\u2019s due process \u201cproperty entitlement\u201d claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and ruled in the alternative that a summary judgment on this point also would be appropriate. Finally, the court entered a summary judgment against appellant on his due process \u201cliberty\u201d claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">On appeal, appellant asserts only the two due process claims. First, he contends that he was deprived of liberty when the FBI released information concerning his termination to a private employer. It is well established that falsely attacking one\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, and community standing may constitute a deprivation of liberty. <em>See Board of Regents of State College v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). However, the record discloses that only the <em>fact </em>of appellant\u2019s termination, and not the <em>circumstances </em>surrounding that termination, were disclosed to a private employer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, even had those circumstances been disclosed, appellant has not disputed the allegations upon which his termination was based.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court correctly noted that <em>Sims v. Fox, </em>505 F.2d 857 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975), governs; therefore, a summary judgment against appellant as to this claim was correct. <em>Id. </em>at 846 (government has not infringed liberty unless it <em>communicates untrue charges).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">Second, appellant contends that he was deprived of a property interest in his employment without due process of law. The Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">\u201cProperty interests ... are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqE\"><em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. We note that all positions in the FBI are excepted by statute from procedural protections afforded employees in the competitive civil service, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 536 (West 1966), and that by regulation excepted employees are expressly excluded from the scope of administrative rales providing procedural protections to civil service employees subjected to adverse employment action. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 771. Thus, there is no property interest created by statute or regulation in appellant\u2019s employment with the FBI. There is some dispute over whether a property interest in a position excepted from the civil service may nonetheless be created by informal rules and understandings. <em>Compare Ashton v. Civiletti, </em>613 F.2d 923 (D.C.Cir.1979), and <em>Paige v. Harris, </em>584 F.2d 178 (7th Cir.1978), <em>with Fiorentino v. United States, </em>607 F.2d 963 (Ct.Cl.1979), cert. <em>denied, </em>444 U.S. 1083, 100 S.Ct. 1039, 62 L.Ed.2d 768 (1980). We need not address this issue, however, as appellant has not alleged the existence of any past practices, employment handbooks, letters of appointment, or understandings from which an expectation of job tenure might arise. <em>Compare Ashton v. Civiletti, </em>613 F.2d at 928-30. In the absence of a legitimate expectation of entitlement to employment, Due Process attaches no conditions to the decision to discharge an employee. <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 569-70, 92 S.Ct. at 2705. As a matter of law, therefore, the defendants were entitled to judgment on this issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We thus affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1291', 1346, 1402, 1504, 2110, 2401, 2402, 2411, 2412, 2671-80 (West 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\">. The district court also dismissed the claims as to William Webster, as Director of the FBI, and the FBI itself. Appellant did not raise the propriety of these dismissals in this appeal, and we express no opinion in the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-19\">. Appellant has not rebutted the declaration to this effect by the FBI\u2019s Chief of the Records \u25a0 Management Division, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b330-20\">. Apparently, his only contention is that the subject of the statement in which he lied was not job related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b331-5\">. The district court dismissed this aspect of appellant\u2019s claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and ruled in the alternative that summary judgment also was appropriate. Because the district court in its discussion clearly went beyond the face of the pleadings, and in particular addressed the declaration by an officer of the FBI to the effect that the agent\u2019s manual contains no references to job tenure or security, we treat the district court\u2019s decision as one granting summary judgment against the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
