Jurisdiction was founded on the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, and under the general maritime law. Trial was before the district judge sitting in admiralty who rendered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and a Judgment in accord therewith, finding Penrod responsible for the injury to Ober.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-23\">On the day of his accident, plaintiff was working as a floorhand or roughneck for his employer, Penrod Drilling Company, on one of its submersible drilling vessels. The crew was \u201ccoming out of the hole,\u201d /.&amp;, withdrawing drill pipe from the drill site. Ober was working the \u201clead tongs\u201d \u2014 a large wrench-like device that is applied to disengage or unscrew two pieces of drill pipe. The driller controls how fast and hard the pull is on the handle of the tongs. The torque (force) exerted on the lead tongs is supposed to \u201cbreak\u201d (release) the tool joint so that other forces can then unscrew the two pieces of drill pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-24\">To counteract the torque of the lead tongs and permit them to break the joint, the pipe below the tool joint needs to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>held in position so that it will not rotate around with the lead tongs. The function of immobilizing the pipe below the joint still in the hole is accomplished with another wrench-like device, applied below the tool joint to be broken, called back-up tongs. Defendant\u2019s general safety rules required that breaking drill pipe be accomplished with both sets of tongs. Both sets of tongs were not being used, however, when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">It was under these circumstances that McNatt, the driller, with the plaintiff in full view, applied the power to the lead tongs in order to break them apart. McNatt gave no warnings prior to applying the power and when he did so, the handle of the lead tongs swung toward plaintiff, striking him with great force and causing his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">After careful study of the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law in this personal injury case pursuant to the Jones Act and the general maritime laws of the United States, we affirm the judgment of defendant\u2019s liability under the Jones Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of <em>Culver v. Slater Boat Co., </em>688 F.2d 280 (5th Cir.1982) (en <em>banc) </em>and <em>Byrd v. Reederei, </em>688 F.2d 324 (5th Cir. 1982) <em>(en banc), </em>however, we remand for reconsideration of the damages award in the amount of $393,588.67.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The clearly erroneous standard governs this Court\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s fact findings. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Noritake Co. v. M/V Hellenic Champion, </em>627 F.2d 724, 727-28 (5th Cir.1980). Under the Jones Act, a vessel owner is deemed negligent if he fails to exercise reasonable care to maintain a reasonably safe work environment. <em>See Allen </em>v. <em>Seacoast Products, Inc., </em>623 F.2d 355, 361 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Ivy v. Security Barge Lines, Inc., </em>585 F.2d 732 (5th Cir.1978), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>606 F.2d 524 (5th Cir.1979) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 956, 100 S.Ct. 2927, 64 L.Ed.2d 815 (1980); Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 (1975). A review of the record in this case does not leave this Court with the definite and firm conviction that the district court erred in its finding of Jones Act negligence. The fact that defendant permitted the lead tongs to swing recklessly, either by the driller\u2019s failure to use back-up tongs in violation of defendant\u2019s safety rule or by the driller\u2019s application of too much torque, was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding of a breach of Penrod\u2019s duty to furnish plaintiff with a reasonably safe place to work within Jones Act standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">On the issue of damages, this Court remands to the district court to reconsider its calculation of plaintiff\u2019s damages in light of the <em>Culver </em>and <em>Byrd </em>decisions. The record reveals that the parties were given an opportunity to introduce the evidence allowed by <em>Culver </em>and <em>Byrd.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court, however, applied the <em>Alaska </em>Rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in awarding damages. Since this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Culver, </em>although not precluding use of this rule, is quite critical of it,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we have decided to remand for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s decision to adopt this rule. On remand, the district court need only reconsider its choice of a method of calculation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of fact that plaintiff is capable of securing employment at $12,000 per year is upheld as not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">. Because we uphold the judgment on the basis of the district court\u2019s finding of negligence under the Jones Act, we do not consider the unseaworthiness finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. Plaintiff\u2019s economic expert gave testimony pertaining to likely wage increases due to inflation, productivity, and seniority. In so doing, he presented statistics on occupational wage increases and on average state wage increases. On cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s economic expert, defendant brought out the interest rate available on risk-free investments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b144-14\">. Under the <em>Alaska </em>Rule, inflation offsets the interest rate which can be earned on safe investments, <em>i.e., </em>inflation and the discount rate offset each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-15\">. In <em>Culver </em>this Court stated: \u201c[W]e are less than satisfied with the ... <em>Alaska </em>Rule,\u201d and \u201cthe <em>Feldman </em>[v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>524 F.2d 384] approach ... is clearly superior, and more economically sound, than ... the <em>Alaska </em>Rule.\u201d <em>Culver, </em>at 299, 302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b144-16\">. Plaintiff raises two other arguments on cross-appeal: (1) in determining future economic losses, it should be taken into consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that plaintiff must pay a certain percentage of his recovery to his attorney, and (2) plaintiff is entitled to an award for attorney\u2019s fees and for the mental anguish he suffered as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to discharge its maintenance and cure obligations in a timely fashion. The first argument basically proposes that the burden of paying plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees be borne by defendant. It is a well-established rule that legal expenses are not reimbursable in actions to recover damages for injuries caused by negligence under the Jones Act or unseaworthiness under general maritime law. With respect to plaintiffs second argument, the cases he cites do not support such an award on the basis of untimely payment alone. <em>See Vaughan </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>369 U.S. 527, 82 S.Ct. 997, 8 L.Ed.2d 88 (1962) (plaintiff was forced to hire a lawyer and go to court in order to obtain maintenance and cure); <em>Blanchard v. Cheramie, </em>485 F.2d 328 (5th Cir.1973) (upholding jury\u2019s decision not to award damages for suffering and attorney\u2019s fees for the vessel owner\u2019s refusal to pay maintenance and cure). In this case, Pen-rod\u2019s tardiness in payment cannot fairly be categorized as \u201ccallous,\u201d \u201crecalcitrant,\u201d \u201cwillful,\u201d and \u201cpersistent\u201d as described in <em>Vaughan.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
