We affirm, finding that the Secretary\u2019s decision that Cal\u00edais suffers from no \u201csevere\u201d or significant physical impairment is supported by substantial evidence, and that in absence of such significant impairment to perform basic work-related functions, a claimant is not considered disabled within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Cal\u00edais, born in 1926, reinjured his back in 1977. The medical evidence of the three doctors undoubtedly shows that Cal\u00edais is disabled from the performance of his usual occupation of manual labor in the oil fields, by reason of a chronic recurring lower back syndrome associated with a history of disc surgery. However, of the three physicians who examined or treated him, two of them were of the opinion that Cal\u00edais could perform light to sedentary work, while one of them felt that Cal\u00edais should not return to work until further diagnostic studies were performed (which Cal\u00edais has persistently declined to subject himself to).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">At the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Cal\u00edais testified that he suffers severe and persistent back pain. However, his admission at this hearing that slight medication was necessary for relief of his back pain (a few aspirin tablets every three or four days or so, when his back gives him too much trouble, R. II, pp. 24-25), tends to corroborate the opinion of an examining orthopedist that Cal\u00edais exhibited no clinical evidence of the symptoms of the lower back syndrome at the time of the examination and that there was normal flexion of the back without discomfort for the performance of light to sedentary type work that did not require prolonged standing, walking, or stopping, or lifting of loads in excess of 25 pounds on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">The claimant Cal\u00edais argues that the Secretary failed to sustain his burden of proving that appellant is capable of performing work that currently exists in the national economy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d). Further, he asserts that the ALJ: (1) ignored the medical reports, (2) gave undue weight to a short visual inspection of the claimant at the hearing, and (3) unjustifiably attributed little credibility to the appellant\u2019s testimony as to his pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">\u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401-02, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1477, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Oldham </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>660 F.2d 1078, 1083 (5th Cir.1981). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Old-ham, id. </em>However, \u201calthough the Secretary\u2019s decision must be supported by substantial evidence, the burden is upon the claimant to prove disability.\u201d Id. To establish a prima facie case of disability, the claimant must show that he can no longer perform his former work. The burden then shifts to the Secretary to show that there is other substantial gainful employment in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>Ferguson v. Schweiker, </em>641 F.2d 243, 246 and nn. 2, 3 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Fruge </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>631 F.2d 1244, 1246 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">In the instant case, the claimant met his burden of showing that he can no longer perform his former work. Nevertheless, the relevant medical evidence, specifically the reports of the physicians who examined Cal\u00edais, indicates that he does not suffer from an impairment severe enough to prevent him from engaging in light or sedentary employment. The medical evidence suggests that the injury to Cal\u00edais\u2019 back has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>not substantially affected his range of motion, which is within normal limits. Further, we cannot say that the ALJ erred in his credibility determination as to lack of disabling pain, based in part upon the claimant\u2019s testimony that he does not take the types and quantities of medication sufficient to lend credible support to his claim of constant pain. Based upon this evidence, and in part upon his credibility evaluation of the claimant, the ALJ found that the claimant does not have any impairment or impairments that would significantly limit his ability to perform basic work-related functions in light or sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The claimant contends that, nevertheless, the Secretary failed to sustain his burden of proving, such as by vocational testimony, that Cal\u00edais is capable of performing work that currently exists in the national economy. Under the applicable regulations then in effect, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1503(c) and 404.-1504,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relied upon by the ALJ, in the absence of a significant or \u201csevere\u201d impairment to perform basic work-related functions, a finding may be made that the individual is not under a disability as defined by the Act, without the necessity of vocational evidence. <em>See Perez v. Schweiker, </em>653 F.2d 997, 999 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">Thus, if the administrative finding of lack of significant impairment is supported by substantial evidence, the claimant has not proved his \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment\u201d, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c)(1)(A), the statutory test for a disability that entitles a claimant to benefits by reason thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">The record contains substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s factual determination that the claimant is not subject to any impairment that significantly limits his ability to perform sedentary or light labor. Although we might have reached a different conclusion, we as a reviewing court cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary. <em>See Millet v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 1199, 1201 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1503 (Nov. 28, 1978), then in effect, relevantly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u00a7 404.1503 Considerations in the sequential evaluation of disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">(a) <em>General. </em>In the determination of whether or not an impairment in a particular case constitutes a disability as defined in \u00a7 404.1501, consideration is given to all the pertinent facts of that case.
