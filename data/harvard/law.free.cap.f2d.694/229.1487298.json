We conclude that the court below did not abuse its discretion by failing to enhance the attorney\u2019s fee award because of the contingency fee arrangement between appellant and his attorney. Rather, the district court\u2019s balancing of that factor against other <em>Johnson </em>criteria and its conclusion that on balance these factors were \u201cneutral\u201d was within the scope of its discretion. We are also in agreement with the district court that the time devoted by an attorney to issues on which his client did not prevail may be excluded from the calculation of attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">In 1976 appellant, who was employed by the City of Tallahassee, was suspended from his job for five days for \u201cfigurative conduct, language, and statements to and before safety inspectors and other employees.\u201d Appellant was informed at the time that his behavior constituted a \u201cmajor offense\u201d under the City\u2019s personnel rules and regulations and that commission of a second offense within that category would result in his dismissal. In 1977, the City terminated his employment, informing him that the reasons for his dismissal were \u201cinsubordination and use of City vehicle for personal services.\u201d After receiving a more detailed description of the charges, appellant decided to challenge the City\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>to terminate him and requested a post-termination hearing. The hearing was scheduled for a date several months later, and eventually appellant cancelled the hearing. Thereafter, appellant brought this suit against two of his supervisors and the City of Tallahassee alleging violations of his first and fourteenth amendment rights. In pretrial and post-trial orders, the district court granted appellant part of the relief he requested. In a separate post-judgment order, the district court considered appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. The court determined that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was proper under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 because appellant was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of that provision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but awarded compensation \u201conly for those hours expended in pursuit of plaintiff\u2019s successful summary judgment motion and the final back-pay award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellant challenges the attorney\u2019s fee award as inadequate on two grounds. First, appellant argues that the district court erred by giving \u201cno apparent effect\u201d to factor six of the <em>Johnson </em>criteria: \u201cWhether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714, 718 (5th Cir.1974)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Appellant argues that the trial court should have increased the hourly rate to reflect the risk that, had appellant lost the suit, his attorney would not have been compensated at all. <em>Johnson </em>cannot be read as standing for the proposition that district courts must in all instances adjust the hourly rate upward where attorney and client have a contingent fee agreement rather than a time-based or fixed dollar fee arrangement. <em>Johnson </em>specifically requires district courts to <em>consider </em>each of the listed factors in making an attorney\u2019s fee determination. <em>Id. </em>at 720. It does not, however, compel them to adjust a fee upward or downward in every instance where one or another of the factors is found to be present; rather, it suggests a \u201cbalancing process\u201d in which the trial judge remains responsible for the discretionary functions of assessing the weight to be given each factor and the appropriate adjustments to make in the fee. <em>Id. </em>at 719-20. Moreover, although <em>Johnson </em>lists the fixed or contingent <em>fee </em>arrangement as one of the factors for consideration, it emphasizes in its discussion of that factor that the parties\u2019 agreements are not decisive. <em>See id. </em>at 718. The district court\u2019s opinion indicates that it gave little weight to the alleged contingency fee agreement in this case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, to the extent that factor did weigh in favor of increasing the fee, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>counterbalanced by several of the other <em>Johnson </em>factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The process engaged in by the district court of balancing the positive and negative tendencies of the different factors in determining reasonable compensation is fully consistent with <em>Johnson. </em>Moreover, we cannot say that the balance struck by the court below was an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Second, appellant argues that' the district court erred in limiting the fee award to compensation for work on successful issues. The Fifth Circuit has clearly approved the method of computing attorney\u2019s fees that limits compensation to \u201cwork performed on the issues on which [the attorney] was successful.\u201d <em>Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, </em>619 F.2d 391, 406 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>613 F.2d 112, 114 (5th Cir.1980). <em>See also Jones v. Diamond, </em>636 F.2d 1364, 1382 (5th Cir.1981) [en banc]. \u201cHowever, the mere fact that the litigants did not succeed in obtaining a judgment on all of the claims asserted does not mean that time spent pursuing these claims should automatically be disallowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, where evidence gathered in preparing an unsuccessful issue may also have been relevant to the successful claim, compensation should be provided for the time spent gathering that evidence, <em>Hardy v. Porter, supra. </em>In determining reasonable compensation, \u201cthe court must consider the relationship of the claims that resulted in judgment with the claims that were rejected and the contribution, if any, made to success by the investigation and prosecution of the entire case.\u201d <em>Jones v. Diamond, supra </em>at 1382. The issues involved in this case were fairly discrete, and the transcript of the hearing on the attorney\u2019s fees issue indicates that the trial judge viewed them as separable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the process of breaking down the time spent by an attorney and parceling it out to individual issues can never be easy. This case is no exception to the observation that in most cases attorney\u2019s fees awards \u201cwill be totally satisfactory to no one.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., supra, </em>488 F.2d at 720. Our review of the record convinces us, however, that the apportionment of hours calculated by the court below and the resulting fee award was more than fair to appellant and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-6\">. Appellees do not here challenge the district court\u2019s determination that appellant \u201cprevailed\u201d for purposes of entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. To be considered the \u201cprevailing party,\u201d litigants need not obtain favorable resolution of every issue raised, see <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 466-67 (5th Cir.1981), nor obtain all the relief they have requested, <em>e.g., Knighton v. Watkins, </em>616 F.2d 795, 799 (5th Cir.1980). Moreover, the Fifth Circuit has recognized that preliminary relief alone may serve to make a plaintiff the \u201cprevailing party\u201d where the relief so obtained was the primary relief sought. <em>See Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 2336, 68 L.Ed.2d 855 (1981), and cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. The Eleventh Circuit, in the en banc case of <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir., 1981) adopted as precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Although decided prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-559, \u00a7 2, 90 Stat. 2641, which authorized attorney\u2019s fees awards in Civil Rights Act suits, <em>Johnson </em>dealt with a similar attorney\u2019s fee provision in the federal employment discrimination legislation. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 706(k), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). The guidelines set forth in <em>Johnson </em>have since been applied by courts to attorney\u2019s fee awards under a wide range of statutes, not limited to the civil rights context. <em>See, e.g., Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>624 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.1980) (antitrust); <em>Matter of First Colonial Corp. of America, </em>544 F.2d 1291, 1298-99 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 1696, 52 L.Ed.2d 388 (1977) (bankruptcy); <em>Miller v. Mackey International, Inc., </em>515 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1975) (securities); <em>Ward v. Kelly, </em>515 F.2d 908, 912 (5th Cir.1975) (school desegregation); <em>Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976) (labor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. The court\u2019s specific discussion of factor six stated only that \u201c[a]lthough he is unable to locate the contract, plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that he believes the arrangement with plaintiff was for a 40 to 50 percent contingent fee or attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the court, which<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ever is greater. No money has been paid by plaintiff to his attorney in this lawsuit.\u201d This tentative statement together with the trial judge\u2019s remark at the attorney\u2019s fees hearing that no contingent fee agreement had been proven, see Transcript of Attorney\u2019s Fees Hearing at 51-52, suggest that the judge gave the contingency fee factor little weight because of lack of adequate proof. Such decision was justified since appellant had the burden of proving his entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, supra, </em>488 F.2d at 720.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">. The district court listed the contingency fee factor <em>(Johnson </em>factor 6) as one of a group of five factors that had \u201clittle appreciable impact on the fee analysis\u201d and were \u201con balance, neutral.\u201d The court\u2019s findings on three of those factors ((2) novelty and difficulty of issues; (4) preclusion of other employment; and (10) desirability of case) would have supported a decrease in the award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. At the hearing, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">I\u2019m not talking about a case where the issues are all scrambled in and the evidence as to one really flops into the other issue. I\u2019m not talking about those. Here in this case you seem to have either a bifurcated situation or one that there, in fact, could have been two lawsuits; one was a procedural due process, and the other was the issue of damages or justification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-13\">I think clearly the Court has discretion on when a party moves along after summary judgment and prevails on the remaining issues in the case____ [T]he legal result [would be] that the attorney would be entitled to be compensated for the time reasonably invested in pursuing the case to its end, because, in effect, at the end, plaintiff prevails on most of the issues in the case.... But here you prevailed on procedural due process, and the rest of the time was spent preparing for trial on the issue of damages, as I see it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">Transcript of Attorney\u2019s Fees Hearing at 60, 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
