ORS 475.992. There are four assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although our discussion is limited to the single question whether marijuana plants found and seized by sheriffs deputies should have been suppressed as being the fruit of an illegal entry onto defendants\u2019 property, we affirm the trial court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Defendants Steven and Roberta Illingworth are husband and wife and at the time in question lived on ten acres of land in rural Josephine County. On May 31, 1981, one of defendants\u2019 neighbors reported to officers of the Sheriffs Department that Steven had driven by in a yellow pickup and fired some type of firearm at him at about 2:00 p.m. that day. There were no other witnesses to the event. Approximately three hours later,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> two officers drove to defendants\u2019 residence. They parked in the driveway at a point near the house, about 25 feet from the back door. The pickup was not in sight. According to one of the investigating officers, because of the nature of the call they approached defendants\u2019 house \u201ccautiously.\u201d The officers had been told by Steven on other occasions that they were unwelcome on his property unless he called them or they had a warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deputy Klusmann also testified that: (1) he knew that Steven was a good shot with a handgun; (2) he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>knew that there were long-standing hard feelings between the neighbors and Steven; and (3) he had previously seen Steven driving a yellow pickup. Klusmann walked to the back door and, at a distance of four or five feet from the house, looked through a large kitchen window to see if anyone was watching him. It was then that he observed a small pot with \u201csix to ten two-inch marijuana plants in it.\u201d On discovering no one home, he left. On June 7, he obtained a search warrant for the residence and executed it that same day. During execution of the warrant, the marijuana, the subject of these indictments, was seized from a garden patch on defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Defendants argue that Klusmann\u2019s initial entry onto their property was unprivileged and violated their right to privacy, thereby tainting the officer\u2019s \u201cplain view\u201d observations of the marijuana in the residence. They rely heavily on their previous statements to the officers that they were unwelcome on their property unless they were invited or had a warrant. In addition, defendants contend that, because the officers were acting only on the accusation of a neighbor and their entry was made despite the absence of the pickup, there were no exigent circumstances and the entry, and the fruits therefrom, were illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Klusmann\u2019s sole purpose in going onto defendants\u2019 property was to investigate the reported shooting incident. There was no evidence that he had any suspicion that defendants were growing marijuana, nor was there any evidence that he was using the neighbor\u2019s allegations as a pretext to search the premises. His caution in approaching the house in the event of any possible gunplay and his immediate departure upon learning that no one was home are consistent with his stated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The circumstances of this case fit squarely within the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine as outlined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443, 91 S Ct 2022, 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971). Here, it is apparent that the officer had a \u201clegitimate reason for being present unconnected with a search directed against the accused,\u201d and that the discovery of the proscribed plants was clearly inadvertent. 403 US at 466. We conclude that the marijuana observed through an uncovered window from a place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>where the officer had a right to be was within \u201cplain view\u201d and formed a lawful basis for the issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Defendants\u2019 earlier directives to the officers stating the conditions under which they might enter their property do not and cannot rise to the level of a legal or constitutional bar precluding officers from performing their lawful investigatory duties. As the trial judge observed, to hold otherwise would be to allow a person to insulate himself from investigation of crimes by simply \u201cputting out a general advice to police officers not to go on the property.\u201d At most, such an edict would be nothing more than a hollow gesture.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\"> Defendants contend that the trial court erred: (1) when it failed to suppress marijuana plants, seeds and other evidence recovered from defendants\u2019 land and home, because the information presented in the affidavit of Officer Klusmann did not establish probable cause to search; (2) when it failed to suppress marijuana plants and other evidence seized from defendants\u2019 land and home, because the evidence was the fruit of an illegal entry onto defendants\u2019 property; (3) when it denied defendants\u2019 motion for acquittal on the grounds that there had been no evidence introduced to establish that marijuana was a schedule A drug; and (4) by admitting irrelevant evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> Defendants note that the officer\u2019s visit to their property occurred at 4:50 p.m. that same day and argue that the lapse of time removes any exigency. However, it is unknown when the officers were first told of the shooting and how long they were occupied in searching for an expended bullet or even how long it took to travel to defendants\u2019 residence. In any event, there is no evidence that they did not act promptly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> This request was first made more than three weeks previously. It followed a controversy concerning the shooting of a neighbor\u2019s pig. Defendant said that he made the request because of the officers\u2019 unprofessional conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
