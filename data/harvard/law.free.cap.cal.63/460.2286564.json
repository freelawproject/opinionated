And the court says that that rule is without exception. That case was approved and followed in the recent case of <em>Payne </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>54 Cal. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In the case now before us it does not appear that the injury which the plaintiff will sustain, if said railroad be constructed and operated in said street, will be different from, or even greater than that which the public at large will suffer if said railroad be constructed and operated in said street; and, upon the authority of the cases above cited, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Upon the other questions arising in this case we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Boss, J., McKee, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.
