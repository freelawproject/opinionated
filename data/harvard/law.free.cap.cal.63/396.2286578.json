The first, after stating that the property was situated in the city and county of San Francisco, State \u00f3f California, described it as follows: \u201c Gift Map No. 2, lots No. 398 to 405 inclusive,\u201d etc. The descriptive clause of the second deed was as follows: \u201c All lands and real estate belonging to the said party of the first part wherever the same may be situated, together,\u201d etc. This deed was executed in Illinois. <em>Meld, </em>1, that if there was a map of lands in San Francisco known as \u201c Gift Map No. 2,\u201d the description in the first deed is sufficient; and 2, that if the lands in controversy belonged to the grantor mentioned in the second deed, they passed by the execution of that deed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-11\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-12\">The facts are stated in the head note and opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-13\"><em>N.

We cannot say, therefore, that it is insufficient. <em>(Penry </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>52 Cal. 496.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Appellant also urges the second deed from Harvey to Lacey contains no description, and is void. The descriptive clause is,</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201call lands and real estate belonging to the said party of the first part, wherever the same may be situated, together,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">If the lands in controversy <em>belonged </em>to Harvey they passed by the deed last mentioned. <em>(Lick </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>3 Cal. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The testimony of Harvey\u2014if believed by the court below, and it would appear from the finding it was believed\u2014proved that defendant occupied with the consent of plaintiff's grantor, with an agreement on his part that he would surrender possession on demand. The demand was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Judgment and order denying new trial affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
