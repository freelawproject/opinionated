Mullany, </em>for Respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An8\">cited Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2969, 2972; <em>Waterman v. Grun, </em>59 Cal. 142; <em>Goodyear </em>v. <em>Williston, </em>42 Cal. 11</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b10-4\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Am\">The question here to be determined is whether a mortgagee of personal property, entitled by the terms of his mortgage to the immediate possession, can intervene in an action brought by a third person against the mortgagor for the specific property, where the plaintiff has taken possession at the commencement of the action, upon giving bond as provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">As between plaintiff and defendant the present is like the case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>62 Cal. 618.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">It seems to be held by the court below that intervenor\u2019s lien and right of possession was lost when he filed his petition, because, prior to that date <em>plaintiff </em>had removed the grain from the mortgagor\u2019s farm. But the chapter of the Civil Code which treats of mortgages of personal property (\u00a7\u00a7 2955, 2972), substitutes the record of the mortgage for the actual delivery and continued change of possession in case of other transfers required by \u00a7 3440. The purpose of the actual delivery, in the one case, and of the record or registry in the other, is to give notice to those who shall deal with the vendor or mortgagor, and \u00a7 2972 only provides that the lien of a mortgage on a growing crop shall cease when the crop is removed from the premises of the mortgagor\u2014as against <em>creditors </em>or innocent <em>purchasers </em>from the mortgagor. There is nothing in the letter of the Code which demands such construction of \u00a7 2972 as that the lien shall be lost as a consequence of the tortious removal of the crop by a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-8\">When the crop was removed by plaintiff intervenor was entitled to its immediate possession. True, defendant was in the actual possession, and was authorized to recover the property as against a trespasser who should remove it. While either the mortgagee entitled to the immediate possession, or the mortgagor in actual possession, would have been entitled to bring an action of trespass (or trover, or our statutory action) against one wrongfully interfering with the property, a recovery by one would be a bar to an action by the other. \u2022 So, here, the defendant and intervenor cannot <em>both </em>take judgment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>plaintiff for a recovery of the property, or its value. In this form of action all parties are actors, seeking affirmative relief. Who should have the property in dispute, or its value? The defendant is entitled to recover it from the plaintiff, but the intervenor is entitled to it both as against the plaintiff and defendant. It is a proper case for intervention. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b11-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remended for a new trial, with direction to the court below to allow such amendments to the pleadings, properly applied for, as may be just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
