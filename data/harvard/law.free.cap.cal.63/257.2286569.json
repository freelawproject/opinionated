This was clearly insufficient. That a minority of a board of supervisors, even though such minority be a majority of a quorum, can under any circumstances enact a valid order is a proposition, the public importance of which outreaches the necessities of the case at bar. Even in its broadest aspect it is believed to be not only without the support of legal principle, but in contravention of the positive requirements of section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure of this State. \u201cWords giving a joint authority to three or more public officers or other persons are construed as giving such authority to a majority of them, unless it is otherwise expressed in the act giving the authority.\u201d Here the authority is given to the board of supervisors, consisting of five members, without provision in the act giving such authority that any number less than the whole may exercise the authority given, and it is submitted that language will have lost its most useful function when the words, \u201c construed as giving authority to a <em>majority of them,\u201d </em>are held, as was done by the trial court, to mean a <em>minority of them,, </em>when such minority constitute a majority of a quorum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQi\">The board was exercising judicial functions. Judge Redfield on this subject observes: \u201c The proper distinction upon the subject seems to be that when the matter is of public concern, or of an executive.or ministerial character, the act of a majority of the board will suffice, although the others are not consulted. But where the function is judicial, involving the determination of some definite question, the whole body must be assembled and act together.\u201d (1 Redf. on Rail, p. 84, \u00a7 6; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>1 Coxe, 144, and cases cited; <em>King </em>v. <em>Wykes, </em>Andrew, 239; <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Prinn &amp; Delabere, </em>2 Black, 1017; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coghill, </em>47 Cal. 361; <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Rugar, </em>21 Wend. 178; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Parry, </em>4 Denio, 125; <em>Keeler </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>22 Barb. 400; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>23 Barb. 176; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>30 Barb. 344; <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>21 Wend. 211; <em>Talcott </em>v. <em>Blanding, </em>54 Cal. 290.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">The appointment of the respondent was invalid because unauthorized by law. The reasoning of the trial court, which deduces the power to fill a vacancy from the- power to appoint for a full term because the latter is the greater, is a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>instance of <em>non sequitur. </em>True, where there is no <em>term </em>fixed bylaw, the power of removal being incidental to the power of appointment, they may both be exercised at any time. There being no term, there can be no vacancy of the term to be filled. But when the term is fixed by law, and the mode and manner of filling it are prescribed, the mode and manner are the measure of the exercise of the power, and must be followed. Filling a vacancy is a distinct and separate function, in no way deducible from the former, but the subject-matter of distinct statutory provision, and most frequently exercised by a different tribunal. This power, if it existed in the board at all in the case at bar, existed by virtue of the provisions of subdivision 19 of section 4046 of the Political Code, enumerating the general permanent powers of the board. And the manner of its exercise is prescribed by section 4066.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-4\"><em>JB. W. </em>Dowser, <em>W.

But Dillon, in his work on \u201cMunicipal Corporations,\u201d says that if a board of village trustees consists of five members, and \u201c three only were present, they would constitute a quorum,\u201d and \u201c the votes of two, being a majority of the quorum, would be valid; certainly so where the three are all competent to act.\u201d (1 Dillon on Corporations, 3d ed., 279)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>In <em>Buell </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>16 Iowa, 284, Dillon, J., said: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u201c Three constituted a quorum. So far all is clear. Advancing in the argument, the first proposition I lay dovvn is, that a majority of the quorum, all being present, have the poAver to act, and to decide any question upon Avhich they can act. This proposition is clear upon the authorities. Thus in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Monday, </em>CoAAq). 538, Lord Mansfield, C. J., says: <em>\u2018 </em>When the assembly are duly met, I take it to be clear law that the corporate act may be done by a <em>majority </em>of those a\\4io have once regularly constituted the meeting.\u2019 To the same effect, 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 293: \u2018A majority of the quorum may decide.\u2019 (A. <em>&amp; </em>A. on Corp. \u00a7 501; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Insurance Co. </em>2 Doug. (Mich.) 124; <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>13 Met. 497; <em>In re Insurance Co. </em>22 Wend. 591; <em>Ex parte Wilcocks, </em>7 Cowen, 402; <em>Ex parte Wilcocks, </em>7 Cowen, 527, note a.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We are not aAvare of any case in Avhich the contrary has been held, and must regard the lavv as Avell settled that in a case like this the action of a quorum is the action of the board, and that a majority of the quorum present could do any act which a majority of the board if present might do.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We are therefore of the opinion that by the removal of the relator from the office a vacancy Avas created in it Avhich the board of supervisors Avas authorized to fill in the manner prescribed in sections 4046 and 4066 of the Political Code, and not otherAvise. The former section confers upon the board the poAver \u201c to fill by appointment all vacancies that may occur in county or township offices, except those of county judge and supervisors\u201d; and the latter provides that \u201cno appointment to fill a vacancy in office must be made by the board except upon petition, signed by at least thirty qualified electors of the county, if for a county office.\u201d The Iuav Avhich authorizes the appointment of a practicing physician for said Yuba County Hospital fixes the term for which he shall he appointed, provides for his salary, and prescribes his duties. That, certainly, is sufficient to create an office, which Bouvier defines to be \u201c a right to exercise a public function or employment, and to take the fees and emoluments belonging to it.\u201d And if an office, it is undoubtedly a county office.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">As the sections of the Political Code to Avhich vve referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>provide how all vacancies in county offices, with two exceptions, must be filled, and as this office is not within the exceptions, we think, in the absence of any provision in the statute which creates this office for filling a vacancy in it, that it cannot be filled \u201c except upon petition signed by at least thirty qualified electors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Ordered, that so much of the judgment appealed from as adjudges <em>\u201c </em>that the plaintiffs take nothing in this action,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>that the defendant C. C. Harrington is not a usurper of said office of practicing physician of the Yuba County Hospital, that he is entitled to the same \u201d and that he recover costs herein, is reversed; and that so much of said judgment as adjudg<em>es </em>that said Joseph Flint is not entitled to said office of practicing physician of the Yuba County Hospital \u201d is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Thornton, J., McKinstry, J., Ross, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
