The attorney for the defendant was present, and cross-examined the witnesses. Before the depositions were offered, it was shown that when they were taken the witnesses resided in the county of Alameda, and that they continued to reside there at the time of the trial. The action was brought and the trial had in the city and county of San Francisco. The depositions were admitted against the objection of the defendant to the sufficiency of the showing as to the absence of the witnesses. <em>Held, </em>that no error was committed in overruling the objection.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b375-11\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b375-12\">The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-13\"><em>L.

As mortgagee in possession he succeeded to the contract of his mortgagor with the plaintiff, and was bound by its terms. (\u00a7 822, Civ. Code.) The only interest which he acquired in the crop was the interest of the mortgagor under the contract. <em>(Wentworth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>53 Cal. 10.) That was an undivided interest in common with the plaintiff; he and the plaintiff were, therefore, tenants in common of the crop; and when he repudiated the relationship, and refused to deliver to the plaintiff her share of the crop, he was guilty of a conversion, and liable for the value of the plaintiff\u2019s share in the crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">There was no error in overruling the objections made to the admission of the depositions of witnesses for the plaintiff. The depositions had been taken under subdivision 2, section 2021, of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendant, by his attorney, had attended the taking of the same, and cross-examined the witnesses; and before reading the depositions in evidence, testimony was given tending to show that at the time of the trial the witnesses resided in another county, and were then absent from the county where the case was on trial. This was satisfactory to the court, and the ruling of the court as to the sufficiency of that testimony is not reviewable on appeal. Upon the testimony the depositions were admissible under section 2032 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Boss, J., and McKisstby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
