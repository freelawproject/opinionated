But the court finds that the injury was caused by the unskillfull, improper, and negligent manner in which the defendant constructed its road.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Conceding that the point urged, as to the relation of the plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>iff and the engineer is correct, it has no application to the facts as found. The plaintiff did not assume the risk arising from the unskillful, improper, and negligent manner in which <em>defendant\u2019s </em>road was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"ALA\">It is said that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain the findings as to the construction of the road above stated.
