This was the error of the lower court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-16\">Between a purchaser in good faith, and a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser under the recording acts, there is no distinction. (Grimstone v. <em>Carter, </em>24 Am. Dec. 230; <em>Withers </em>v. <em>Little, 56 </em>Cal. 370; <em>James </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>14 Am.

Smith &amp; Son, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-3\">The facts found by the court are sufficient to sustain the ultimate conclusion, that the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was the superior one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage having been first recorded, the presumption is that it was in fact prior j and, there being no fact to destroy that presumption, the law will draw its conclusion in accordance with it. This is a case, therefore, of the probative facts being all found, and comes within the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Hagar, </em>52 Cal. 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">The finding that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 said mortgage is a lien upon the premises described in the complaint prior and superior to the lien of the mortgage of the defendants Wise and Denigan,\u201d is a finding of fact. <em>(Frazier </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>52 Cal. <em>401.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">And it will be taken to support the judgment, although placed among the conclusions of law. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>42 Cal. 192.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ANC\">The action is to foreclose a mortgage executed by Buffandeau, deceased. With respect to the appellants (defendants Wise and Denigan), the allegation of the complaint is: \u201cThe defendants claim some right, title, interest, or estate in or to the said premises, <em>subsequent however, to said mortgage and subject thereto.\u201d </em>To this appellants answered: \u201c Defendants admit</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">that they have an interest in said premises by way of mortgage from E. B. Buffandeau, dated the 18th day of April, 1877, to secure a promissory note,\u201d etc. \u201cAnd they further allege they have no information or belief sufficient to enable them to answer the allegation of the complaint, that <em>the claims </em>of the defendants are subsequent, however, to said mortgage to plaintiffs and subject thereto, and so deny that their mortgage is subsequent or subject to the mortgage of said plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">It is said by respondents that the portion of the answer above quoted raises no issue. It is urged, in the first place, the defendants could not base a denial that their interest, in the mortgaged premises, was subsequent and subject to the lien of plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage, upon an alleged <em>ignorance </em>of the facts. It has been held, very often, that where the fact alleged is such as that its existence or non-existence must, from its nature, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>known to the opposing party, such party cannot be permitted to plead ignorance, or deny \u201cupon information and belief.\u201d In such cases the party alleging a matter as a fact is entitled to an explicit denial, or to an admission. <em>(Humphreys </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>9 Cal. 62; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Scott, 25 </em>Cal. 189; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>4 Sandf. 708; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>N. Y. Central Mills, </em>1 Abb. Pr. 188; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Palmer, 12 </em>How. Pr. 37; <em>Fales </em>v. <em>Hicks, 12 </em>How. Pr. 154; <em>Hance </em>v. <em>Rumming, 2 </em>Smith, E. D. 48; <em>Kelcham </em>v. <em>Zerega, </em>1 Smith, E. D. 553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">It is said by respondents, in the second place, that the answer is evasive; it is not an express denial of the fact alleged. It is insisted that the answer does not even deny knowledge of the verity or falsehood of the averment actually made, but sets up a supposititious averment, and then alleges defendants\u2019 ignorance with respect to <em>such </em>averment; that, while the complaint alleges any right, or title, or interest, or estate, which defendants may have in the premises, to be subject or subordinate to plaintiffs\u2019 lien, the answer only declares defendants to be ignorant of the truth of a pretended averment \u201cthat the <em>claims </em>of the defendants are subsequent,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Appellants, on the other hand, contend that the allegation of the <em>complaint </em>is insufficient to constitute a cause of action against them; that the allegation is, defendants \u201cclaim\u201d some right, title, interest, or estate subsequent, etc.; that is to say, that defendants <em>claim </em>that such interest as they have is subsequent and subject to plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">If the plaintiffs had objected to the form of the denial in the court below the defendants might have been compelled to admit or deny expressly the allegation that their interest (as mortgagees) was subsequent and subject to plaintiffs\u2019 lien. The plaintiffs\u2019 further objection to the <em>answer, </em>and the objection of appellants to the <em>complaint, </em>cannot be considered here. The answer is as broad as the complaint, and the complaint does not entirely fail to state a cause of action. Admitting that a complaint in foreclosure should allege that an asserted right of a third party in the mortgaged premises \u201cis subsequent and subject to\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 lien, there is here an attempt to state the fact, which, if inartificial or imperfect, should have been specially objected to by demurrer or otherwise. The court below <em>tried the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>issue </em>of priority, as to which both parties introduced evidence, found certain facts bearing upon such issue, and concluded, as matter of law, that the mortgage of defendants was subsequent and subject to the mortgage of plaintiffs. There is no bill of exceptions, and, so far as appears, there was no motion by either party for judgment upon the pleadings, nor was the attention of the court called, by any <em>special </em>objection or application, to defects in the complaint or answer. Under these circumstances the interests of justice cannot be subserved by giving effect to points first made in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Treating the pleadings as presenting the issue\u2014\u201cIs the defendants\u2019 mortgage subsequent and subject to plaintiffs\u2019 lien?\u201d \u2014 it remains to inquire whether the court found upon that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The District Court, amongst other facts, found that the mortgage to plaintiffs was executed and delivered April 18, 1877, and <em>recorded </em>the same day; that the mortgage to appellants was made and delivered April 18, 1877, and recorded April 26, 1877, In other words, that themortgages were made and delivered on the same day, but plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was first recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As \u201ca conclusion of law\u201d from these facts the court foimd plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage as a lien upon the premises described in the complaint prior and superior to the lien of the mortgage^ of the defendants Wise and Denigan aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">It is urged by respondents, the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage ivas first recorded creates the <em>presumption </em>that it was prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Even if the prior record of the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage created a presumption that their mortgage was first executed and delivered, such would not be a conclusive legal presumption, but a presumption which could be rebutted by satisfactory evidence. Hence the finding of the fact of previous record would not necessarily establish the plaintiffs\u2019 priority. Since <em>Coveny </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>49 Cal. 552, it has not been doubted that \u201c findings \u201d must be either of the ultimate facts, or of such probative facts as will enable the court to declare that the ultimate facts \u201cnecessarily result therefrom.\u201d The ultimate fact of priority of execution does not necessarily result from the finding of the prior registry of plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage. The plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage may have been first recorded and yet the appellants\u2019 mortgage been first executed and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Nevertheless, <em>it would seem, </em>that if the prior record of the mortgage created a presumption that it was executed and delivered before appellants\u2019 mortgage, or if the prior record even tended to prove plaintiffs\u2019 priority, the \u201cconclusion of law\u201d of the court below, \u201cthat plaintiffs\u2019 lien was prior and superior to the lien of defendants\u2019 mortgage,\u201d might be treated as a finding of the ultimate <em>fact </em>of plaintiffs\u2019 priority. Where, on the question of the ratification of a note, the findings embraced several facts tending to establish it, and then a conclusion from them that there had been a full ratification and confirmation, it was <em>held, </em>that such conclusion was the ultimate fact to be ascertained ; that it was none the less a finding of fact because it was stated as a conclusion. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>42 Cal. 180.) But unless the previous findings, in some degree, tend to prove the ultimate fact, it is manifest that the conclusion (as in this case) \u201c from the foregoing facts,\u201d must be treated as what it purports to be\u2014a conclusion of law from the facts previously recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Why should the fact that one of two instruments made on the same day was first recorded be considered to create any presumption that the instrument was executed and delivered at an earlier hour of the day than the other ? There is nothing in the nature of the mere fact of record which tends to prove the independent fact of prior execution and delivery. Nor is there any language in the statute which can be construed to make a prior record evidence of a prior execution. Sections 1213 and 1214 of the Civil Code read: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u2019 \u201cSee. 1213. Every conveyance of real property, acknowledged or proved, and certified and recorded as prescribed by law, from the time it is filed with the recorder for record, is constructive notice of the contents thereof to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201cSection 1214. Every conveyance of real property other than a lease for a term not exceeding one year is void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee of the same property, or any part thereof, in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Section 1213 declares that the filing for record of a conveyance, with the recorder, shall be constructive notice of <em>its contents </em>to \u201c subsequent purchasers and mortgagees,\u201d And 1214, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>conveyance, not- recorded, shall be void \u201c as against any subsequent purchaser, or mortgagee, .... in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">So far as the date of the execution of an instrument is concerned, the record of it, or a certified copy of its record, creates no other presumption than the production of the original would create, the presumption that it was made when it purports to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In the case before us, both mortgages were recorded on different days, both purport to have been made on the same day, and the court below found both were in fact executed and delivered on the same day. In the absence of a finding with respect to priority of delivery, we might presume, perhaps, the delivery of the two to have been contemporaneous. We certainly cannot presume the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was first executed and delivered because it was first recorded, nor does the fact it avus first recorded tend to prove its prior execution andcdelivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The decree cannot be alloAved to stand. Except that the court (the District Court) in Avhich the cause was tried has gone out of existence, Ave might remand the cause Avith directions that the court below, upon the evidence already taken and such further relevant evidence as might be introduced, find the facts necessary to a proper determination. But this course is uoav apparently impracticable. A new trial seems necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a neAV trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
