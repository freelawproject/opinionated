Wise and Denigen consented, and it was ordered that the property might remain in the possession of the receiver, specially reserving all rights. Subsequently the court ordered the property sold because of a perishable nature. Upon an order directed to the receiver to show cause why the property should not be restored, the court ordered that the property or its proceeds be returned and delivered to Wise <em>&amp; </em>Denigen. Petitioners prayed for a writ of review alleging that the court exceeded its jurisdiction. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the court had jurisdiction to order its restoration; (2) that the consent of Wise &amp; Denigen did not estop them from asserting their rights as they were specially reserved when consent was given.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\">Petition for writ of review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-9\"><em>Eyre &amp;' Frank, </em>for Petitioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfI\">cited <em>In re Marter, 11 </em>Nat.

In his counter-affidavit Wallace denied that Wise or his partner ever had possession of the property, and averred the same was in possession of the insolvent, and was taken from him. Upon the cross-affidavits the Superior Court ordered that the receiver forthwith return and deliver to Wise &amp; Denigen the property, describing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The court had <em>jurisdiebion to </em>order its restoration. If the receiver without previous order of the court took the property out of Wise\u2019s adverse possession, under such circumstances as that the court would have denied an application of the receiver ' (made prior to the actual taking) for leave to take possession, the court was certainly authorized to direct a return of the property..</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The rights of the parties were in no way affected by the consent order of August 13th. That order, by its express terms, reserved all the rights of\u2019Wise, and there is no principle of <em>estoppel </em>which could prevent him from subsequently asserting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Proceeding dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
