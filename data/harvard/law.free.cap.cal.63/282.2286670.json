Martin appealed and filed an undertaking to stay execution as provided by the statute, with J. W. Hager and John T. Hill as sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">The judgment was affirmed, and upon the coming down of the remittitur the plaintiff moved the court upon affidavits setting out the above facts, for an order that J. W. Hager and John T. Hill appear and show cause why judgment should not be entered against them as sureties for the amount of the judgment recovered against Martin. Hager moved to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that Hill had not appeared to answer the order, nor had he been served with notice. The court found that there had been an unsuccessful attempt to serve Hill, denied the motion, and after a trial upon an answer setting up several defenses rendered judgment against Hager.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-7\"><em>John G. </em>Burch, for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">The words used in the section 942 \u201cthat they are bound,\u201d and not that they \u201c <em>jointly </em>and <em>severally are bound,\u201d- </em>as also that \u201cjudgment may be entered .... against <em>the sureties,\u201d </em>and not against the <em>sureties or either </em>of them\u201d if taken either in \u201ctheir ordinary and popular sense,\u201d or that they were used in the law as such, and must be taken in their <em>technical sense </em>is conclusive that section 942 provided for a <em>\u201cjoint\u201d bond </em>only as construed by section 1644, Civil Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">The sureties received ho <em>benefit </em>from the <em>promise, </em>and. are not brought within the exception specified in section 1431, Civil Code, and under section 1659, Civil Code, they are not \u201cseverally,\u201d but <em>jointly </em>liable. So that no other than a <em>joint </em>j udgment can be entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-10\">The undertaking given in this action contains factors which are not provided for by section 942. At p. 40, folio 113, Trans., the sureties are made to say: \u201cWe, the undersigned,\u201d .... \u201cdo hereby <em>\u2018jointly and severally\u2019 </em>undertake and promise\u201d\u2014the words \u201cjointly and severally\u201d are interpolated upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the section; and at p. 41, folio 116, the words <em>\u201cand without notice to us or either of us,\u201d </em>are also interpolated upon or in addition to the conditions provided in section 942. The use of these latter words might he construed to authorize judgment against them \u201cor either of them,\u201d were it not for the fact that the words following immediately are <em>\u201cagainst the imdersigned sureties,\u201d plural, </em>using the language of the section providing for a \u201cjoint\u201d judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">Notwithstanding the undertaking executed uses the words \u201cjointly and severally\u201d as above stated, we understand this to be a <em>statutory bond, </em>and it is well settled by this Supreme Court that when such a bond is given pursuant to the requirements of a particular statute or section of law, the provisions of that statute or section are deemed in larv to have been incorporated into the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">It was said by this Supreme Court in <em>Heynemann </em>v. <em>Eder, </em>17 Cal. 433: \u201c Though not strictly an undertaking such as is contemplated by the statute, we think it should be construed in the same manner\u201d .... their \u201cagreement must be read in the light of the statute.\u201d Under this rule the \u201c interpolated \u201d words must be eliminated, and the bond left such as the Code (section 942) makes it and intended it to be, a \u201cjoint bond \u201d upon which.a \u201cjoint judgment\u201d alone, and not a several or joint and several judgment may be rendered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-7\"><em>Tully R. Wise, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">It has been decided over and over again that section 942 does authorize a judgment against the sureties upon motion. <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>54 Cal. 604; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Parnell, </em>57 Cal. 232; <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Santa Clara Mng. Assn. of Balt. </em>56 Cal. 178; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Orford, </em>56 Cal. 157.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">This motion is the same as a <em>scire facias. (Beall </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>16 Wall. 535; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>8 Minn. 262; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>1 Smedes &amp; M. 389; <em>White </em>v. <em>Prigmore, </em>29 Ark. 211; <em>Chippee </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>5 Mich. 59; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Parnell, </em>57 Cal. 232; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Orford, </em>6 Pac. C. L. J. 519; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>2 Black, 430; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dic. Verb, recognizance.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>It is <em>common </em>practice in United States courts to enter judgment against stipulators at the same time as against principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">Ho affidavit is necessary, but the case of <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>is followed exactly by direction of the court. As the proceedings were based on papers in the case on the record, that is all that was necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-6\">The parties can waive any legal or constitutional right, unless the law or Constitution expressly forbid it. <em>(Connelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Am. Rep. 34; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Leitch, </em>31 Am. Rep. 42; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>33 Am. Rep. 148; <em>State </em>v. <em>Worden, </em>33 Am. Rep. 27.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">The court compelled us to proceed against Dager alone, because he had been served with notice, and Hill had not. This was proper. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 579.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b291-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AezQ\">Martin, in appealing to this court from the judgment rendered against him, filed an undertaking with Dager and Hill as sureties. The judgment was affirmed, and on the going down of the remittitur the plaintiff moved, under section 942, Code of Civil Procedure, for judgment against the sureties. Hotice of the motion was served on Dager only. The court entered judgment against him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\"We think that it was error to render judgment under that section against one of the sureties only, no reason appearing why the other was not joined, except that he could not be found and served with notice. The section provides for a judgment <em>\u201c </em>against the sureties \u201d; and this being a statutory proceeding, the course pointed out by the statute must be strictly pursued. The terms of the bond did not, if it could have done so, authorize a variation from the provision of the statute; it authorized the entry of judgment \u201cagainst the undersigned sureties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
