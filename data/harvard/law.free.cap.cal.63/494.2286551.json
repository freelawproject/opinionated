The plaintiff examined the hay at the time of the sale, and there was a verbal delivery. A keeper was left in charge of the hay. A portion of it was subsequently removed, but the part in controversy remained in the barn until it was attached by a creditor of the vendor. The period between the sale and attachment was about three months. The barn continued in the possession and under the control of the vendor. The court below found that there was not an immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>delivery and an actual and continued change of possession. <em>Held, </em>that the finding was justified by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b501-4\">Pkactice on Appeal\u2014Modification of Judgment\u2014De Minimis.\u2014The evidence showed that the value of the property replevied did not exceed three hundred and sixty dollars, but the court found the value to be three hundred and seventy-five dollars. <em>Held, </em>that the judgment cannot be modified here so as to conform to the evidence, for it would then have no finding to support it; <em>and further, that </em>considering the amount involved the judgment ought not to be affirmed upon the maxim <em>de minimis, </em>etc.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b501-5\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of the county of Colusa, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">The action is replevin. The property in suit, alleged to be twenty-five tons of hay, more or less, was attached by a creditor of If. S. Merrill, brother of the plaintiff, but subsequently delivered by the sheriff to the defendant Hurlburt as assignee in insolvency of if. S. Merrill. The plaintiff claimed the property by virtue of a sale to him prior to Merrill\u2019s insolvency. The sale was attacked on the ground that there had been no delivery of the property with a continued change of possession. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the only evidence respecting the delivery and continued change of possession, showed that he had bought and paid for the property, and carried a portion- of it away, but left the remainder in the vendor\u2019s barn, where it remained until it was attached. The hay was loose, in one body, in the barn. The plaintiff* placed a man in charge of the property, but the barn continued in the possession and under the control of Merrill the vendor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-7\"><em>John T.

That the rule, as established by the adjudicated cases, requires no more than that the purchaser must have that possession which places him in that relation to the property which owners usually have to the like kind of property.

If the judgment was, in case a return of the property could not be had, that defendant should have judgment for a greater sum than the court found the value to be, Ave could modify the judgment here, so as to make it accord Avith the findings. But the judgment must be based upon the findings, and Ave cannot change the judgment in such manner as that it shall not be supported by the findings. Considering the amount involved in the action we cannot say Ave ought + affirm the judgment upon the maxim <em>de </em>minimis, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
