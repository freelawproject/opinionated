W. &amp; W. B. Tyler, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">The authorities are almost unanimous that a deed by a married woman improperly acknowledged is void. (1 Bish. Married Woman, \u00a7 589; <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>McCamly, </em>10 Paige, 342; <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>14 Binn. 84; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Bodkin, </em>25 Ind. 172; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Donley, </em>25 Tex. 737; <em>Willes </em>v. <em>Gattman, </em>53 Miss. 721; <em>Marriner </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>5 Gilm. 125; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>9 Cal. 13; <em>Ewald </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>32 Cal. 493; <em>McLeran </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>43 Cal. 467; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>13 Cal. 498; <em>Leonis </em>v. <em>Lazzarovich, </em>55 Cal 52, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-8\">If the deed is void, it certainly cannot be reformed as <em>against </em>Anna Ainsworth and her grantees, either at law or in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-9\">Besides the cases cited supra, the following are in point: <em>Leftwitch </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>7 W. Va. 569; <em>Hamar </em>v. <em>Medsker, </em>60 Ind. 413; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Davelly, </em>6 Wend. 1; <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>33 Ark. 432; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>4 Tex. 61; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Buckingham, </em>5 Day, 492; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>McKeen, </em>15 Me. 304; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>35 Ill. 362; <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Glenney, </em>27 Conn. 104; <em>Selover </em>v. <em>A.

St. 484; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wescott, </em>11 Conn. 129; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Peirsol, </em>1 Peters, 328; <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>Klock, </em>13 Barb. 50; <em>O'Ferrall </em>v. <em>Simplot, </em>4 Iowa, 381; Wilkinson v. Getty, 13 Iowa, 157; <em>Looney </em>v. Adamson, 48 Tex. 619; <em>Jourdan </em>v. <em>Jourdan, </em>9 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 268; 1 Bish. Married Women, \u00a7 591; <em>Landers </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>26 Cal. 408.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-5\">In all dealings with married women the maxim <em>caveat emptor </em>must be applied, and the doctrine of estoppel <em>in pais </em>does not apply. <em>(Morrison </em>v. Wilson, 13 Cal. 495.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b294-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A1c\">The certificate of acknowledgment Avas defective, in that it did not state that the notary, upon an examination Avithout the hearing of her husband, made the married woman acquainted with the contents of the instrument. Section 1186 of the Civil Code requires that such separate examination must embrace as AAmll the making her acquainted with the contents of the instrument as the acknoAAdedgment by her; and section 1191 gives the form of the certificate in very plain language. The court, therefore, did not err in sustaining defendants\u2019 objection to the admission of the mortgage in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">When the acknowledgment is properly made, but defectively certified, a party interested may haAre an action to correct the certificate. (\u00a7 1202, Civ. Code.) We see no objection to the joining this action with the action for foreclosure. The court should have permitted plaintiff to amend her complaint and prove, if she could, that the acknowledgment was actually taken in compliance Avith the statute, and have judgment correcting the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
