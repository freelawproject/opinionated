See Smith v. Beto, 467 F.2d 1374, 1375 (CA5 1972); Gerzin v. Beto, 459 F.2d 671 (CA5 1972). As best we can determine, however, the District Court did not hold an evidentiary hearing and had before it neither the state trial court record nor the state evidentiary hearing record. If so that court did not conduct the requisite independent inquiry into petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims. See Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Petitioner\u2019s application for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The order of the District Court denying appellant\u2019s habeas petition is vacated and the case is remanded for further consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-25\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this ease summarily. See Groendyke Transportation, Inc. v. Davis, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1158.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
