Citizens Casualty Company of New York, et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1091-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">Heron Green was indicted, tried be-\u201d fore a jury and convicted for violation of Title 21, U.S.C., \u00a7 841(a), knowingly and intentionally distributing and possessing with intent to \u25a0 distribute, a Schedule I narcotic drug controlled substance, 3.68 grams of heroin. He was sentenced to seven years confinement with a mandatory special parole term of three years to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">The sole contention advanced by Green\u2019s appeal is whether he was denied a fair trial when the district judge instructed the jury to disregard a portion of his counsel\u2019s closing argument. The questioned statement was made by the judge when defense counsel objected to a portion of the argument being made in closing by the prosecuting attorney. The incident was preceded by several occasions during the trial when defense counsel was admonished by the court for improper statements made in the jury\u2019s presence. On at least one such prior occasion counsel apologized to the court for his conduct. Our scrutiny of the record shows the trial judge to have been patient, courteous, attentive and responsive in his demeanor to both attorneys during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">The actual statement forming the basis for the assignment of error was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: There is nothing wrong with that, Mr. Coleman, you went way beyond this in your argument. I hate to have to make this statement to you, but you brought this on by your own objection here. You argued way outside the record and I am going to say it to you here, I am going to admonish the jury the things you said that are outside the record are not to be considered by them in this Court. Proceed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-14\">In the circumstances of this trial we think the court did not commit error prejudicial to the rights of the appellant. The admonition was properly given under the trial court\u2019s function of presiding over the trial and directing the course of trial proceedings so as to protect their impartiality. United States v. Jackson, 5 Cir. 1973, 470 F.2d 684, 687; United States v. Jenkins, 5 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 429, 434; Luttrell v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 462, 465-466.</p>\n<p id=\"Arqb\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
