An appellate court cannot set aside a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). And, as the Supreme Court said in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1200, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960), the clearly erroneous rule \u201capplies also to factu.,1 inferences from undisputed basic facts * * *.\u201d <em>See also </em>Weyl-Zulkerman &amp; Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 232 F.2d 214, 216 (9th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-22\">In this case the Tax Court majority found that Ford was carrying on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>trade or business of teaching before he left California and while he was in Norway. It also found that his studies in Norway maintained and improved his skills as a high-school teacher. Although reasonable minds can disagree with these findings \u2014 in fact, six judges of the Tax Court disagreed \u2014 we cannot say that the majority\u2019s findings were clearly . erroneous, and we cannot set them aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Accepting the facts as found by the Tax Court, then, we hold that Ford is entitled to a deduction under the rule announced in Furner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 393 F.2d 292 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
