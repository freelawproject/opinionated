The gist of appellants\u2019 contentions is that in order to obtain facts sufficient to constitute probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant, the ATF officers went to the very place which they sought to search under the authority of the warrant. The first \u201csearch\u201d without a warrant was illegal, they argue, because within a constitutionally protected area (the cur-tilage) ; therefore the evidence later seized under a search warrant, which depended upon the evidence uncovered in the prior illegal search for its validity, must be suppressed as the \u201cfruit\u201d of an illegal search. Because we believe there was no \u201csearch\u201d in the first instance, we affirm the judgments of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">In each instance ATF agents entered upon the premises of appellants, walked to within a few feet of their barns,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> detected the odor of fermenting mash or fruit and then proceeded to the magistrate to obtain a search warrant. While we agree that the barns in ques-tion are part of the curtilage, Walker v. United States, 225 F.2d 447 (5th Cir. 1955), we cannot agree, at least so long as the \u201copen fields\u201d doctrine of Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1925) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>a trespass does not, of itself, constitute an illegal search) is permitted to stand, that there has been a \u201csearch\u201d in violation of the fourth amendment. The ATF officer in neither instance entered into the barn itself, nor attempted to look inside to confirm his suspicions. <em>See </em>Taylor v. United States, 286 U.S. 1, 52 S.Ct. 466, 76 L.Ed. 951 (1931); Walker v. United States, 225 F.2d 447 (5th Cir. 1955); United States v. Mullin, 329 F.2d 295 (4th Cir. 1964). In <em>Taylor </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">Prohibition officers may rely on a distinctive odor as a physical fact indicative of possible crime; but its presence alone does not strip the owner of a building of constitutional guaranties against unreasonable search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">286 U.S. at 6, 52 S.Ct. at 467. <em>See also </em>Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is a bit disquieting that we must countenance federal snooping around farmers\u2019 barns as a legitimate investigative technique. There must surely be a better way than Hester-type trespass, but it is not readily discerned in light of the strict standards for the issuance of search warrants set out in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Where there is no entry upon -a constitutionally protected area, there can be no \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment. Appellants\u2019 reasonable expectations of privacy\u2014 while extending to their dwellings and the immediate area around them and even to the area occupied by outbuildings such as the barns in question, 25 C.J.S. Curtilage p. 84- \u2014 cannot, in light of <em>Hester, </em>be said to include the \u201copen fields\u201d around the barn. The words \u201cpersons, houses, papers and effects\u201d do not insulate the air around appellants\u2019 barns from the peculiar odor of fermenting fruit stored within.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\">. Brown and Jones appeal from separate trials involving incidents occurring at different times and places; however, the cases are so factually similar that they were argued together before the panel and are treated together in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. Brown\u2019s barn was sixty-three yards from his house. The agent advanced to within ten yards of the barn, at which point he detected the odor of fermenting apples coming from the barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">Jones\u2019 barn was located some two hundred yards from his \u2022 dwelling. The officer in this instance walked to within two or three feet of the barn, from which he not only smelled the distinctive odor of moonshine whiskey but also observed a plastic hose and electric wire coming from underground and leading into the barn\u2019s interior.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
