BROWN, Chief Judge, and RONEY and GEE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-18\">RONEY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b377-19\">We hold that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of defendant under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(a)(6) for knowingly and unlawfully misrepresenting his residence to a federally licensed firearms dealer in connection with his acquisition of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-20\">The indictment alleged that Mendoza \u201cdid knowingly and unlawfully exhibit a false and fictitious State of Texas Chauffeur\u2019s License which stated, among other things, that he was a resident of El Paso, Texas, when in truth and fact he was a resident of Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, and this false and fictitious identification was likely to deceive\u201d the licensed dealer with respect to the lawfulness of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-21\">There was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that Mendoza presented the driver\u2019s license as a representation of his residence at the time of the sale. The address on the license was a mailing address used by Mendoza. He was temporarily living at the address when the license was issued. He could be contacted by mail or telephone through the friend who was living at the address.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-22\">Mendoza, a truck driver, was admitted into the United States on June 8, 1970, as a resident alien. As a \u201clong haul\u201d truck driver, Mendoza spent most of his time traveling. Upon his return from a \u25a0trip, he would visit friends in El Paso, remain at the El Paso Truck Terminal, check into a motel, or visit his mother in Juarez, Mexico. He maintained no permanent living accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A careful review of the testimony of the licensed dealer fails to establish the critical fact which the Government needed to prove, <em>i. e. </em>that the license was presented by defendant to the dealer for the purpose of representing his residence as opposed to merely furnishing identification. After the witness identified the sales slip concerning the transaction, she testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">Q Did you, yourself, sell this weapon to Mr. Mendoza?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Q Are your initials on that? How can you identify that it was your sale ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">A By the writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">Q Okay. Now, do you remember selling a weapon to Raul Acosta Mendoza?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">A I remember the name. I don\u2019t remember the person himself, but I remember the name becasue we have to fill out a form, that they have to answer all of these questions and sign them, and so do I have to sign it too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">Q Is this the form, Mrs. Presburg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">A Yes, that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">Q And this is the form that Mr. Mendoza did fill out in your presence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">Q Could you please state the address that\u2019s shown on that form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">A 917% South Park Street, El Paso, Texas 79901.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-16\">Q Is there a signature on this form ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-17\">A Yes. Raul Mendoza.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-18\">Q Was there any identification presented to you concerning the purchase of this weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-19\">A Yes. He was identified to me by the Texas Drivers License 663 7053.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-20\">Q Now, Mrs. Presburg, would you look at the, on that form that is signed by Mr. Mendoza, the certification, could you please read that certification to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-21\">A You mean the questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-22\">Q Not the questions so much as the certification just below the questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-23\">A I hereby certify that the answers to the above are true and correct. I understand that a person who answers any of the above questions in the affirmative is prohibited by Federal law from purchasing and/or possessing a firearm. I also understand that the making of any false oral or written statement or the exhibiting of any false or misrepresented identification with respect to this transaction is a crime punishable as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">Q As the standard procedure when you sell a weapon, are there any questions that you ask?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-25\">A Yes, there are eight questions that they have to answer on this form. And I also ask them if they are Texas residents. ' They are not allowed to buy a firearm for resale purposes, as a gift or for transfer to anyone else unless they are also a resident of the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-26\">Q Is this your standard procedure?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-27\">A Yes. We have a form on the wall written in English and Spanish. They are bilaws stating to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-28\">Q I\u2019m sorry. On the wall \u2014 would you repeat that.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-29\">A We have on the wall a written card of the bilaws stating to that effect that they cannot transfer, give or sell to another person unless they are also a resident of the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-30\">Q Does this form also set out that \u2022they must be a resident to buy the weapon ?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-31\">A Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-32\">Q Did you then in fact sell to Mr. Mendoza the weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-33\">A Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-34\">Q And what was the amount of purchase ?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-35\">A $105 plus the tax of $5.25, making a total of $110.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-36\">The witness could not remember this transaction. She testified that the license was presented to her as identification. She did not testify that it was given as proof of residence. The witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>did not testify that she followed her standard procedure for this sale. There was no evidence that the license was produced in response to any request she may have made concerning his residence. There was no evidence that the defendant knew that the license was being used for the purpose of determining his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Without these critical facts, the proof fails to support the conviction under this indictment as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
