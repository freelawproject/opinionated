Some of the eggs from its breeder hens are sold commercially, others are sent to its hatchery. The resulting chicks are reared either as replacement breeders by Abbott, or as broilers by Abbott or by growers under contract to it. Title to all chicks remains in Abbott, which furnishes feed, medicine, etc., to the contract growers as well as to its own rearing operations. The growers provide poultry houses and daily care, and for their services they receive a fixed compensation per pound plus incentive payments. Abbott does not process the birds, but rather sells all broilers raised directly or indirectly by it to poultry plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">The bargaining unit consists of seventeen employees who mill and distribute about three-quarters of Abbott\u2019s feed and medicine requirements, which are produced at its feed mill on one of its farms; Abbott purchases the remaining quarter of these requirements. All products of the mill are consumed by Abbott, none are sold to anyone. Two of the seventeen are in-haul truck drivers bringing feedstuffs, vitamins and other ingredients to the mill. Seven operate the feed mill. Eight are out-haul drivers who take feed to Abbott\u2019s breeding operations, hatchery, broiler houses and contract growers.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Almost five years ago, in NLRB v. Strain Poultry Farms, Inc., 405 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir. 1969), this Court denied enforcement on a well-nigh identical fact situation and contention by the Board. The sole factual distinction is that in <em>Strain </em>it was the truck drivers delivering finished broilers to market who were sought to be organized.. Then, as now, the National Labor Relations Act provided \u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 . shall not include any individual employed as an agricultural laborer. . . . \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3). Then, as now, Congress had since 1946 added a rider to the NLRB\u2019s appropriation bill providing that no part of the appropriation should be used in connection with bargaining units composed of \u201cagricultural laborers\u201d as defined in Section 3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f). And then, as now, that section defined \u201cAgriculture\u201d as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-6\">\u201c . . .' farming in all its branches and among other things includes the raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry, and any practices (including forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">There, as here, the question was whether the poultry raiser was conducting a trucking operation (feed mill) on the side or whether the operation (mill) was part of the poultry raising venture; and the Board relied heavily if not primarily upon Maneja v. Waialua Agricultural Co., 349 U.S. 254, 75 S.Ct. 719, 99 L.Ed. 685 (1955), and NLRB v. Gass, 377 F.2d 438 (1st Cir., 1967), both of which we then found inapposite. Cited with approval in our opinion in <em>Strain, </em>however, is Mitchell v. Georgia Broiler Supply, Inc., 186 F.Supp. 341 (N.D.Ga., 1960), a decision on facts even closer to Abbott\u2019s than those in <em>Strain: </em>in <em>Georgia Broiler, </em>the question was whether employees who worked in just such a feed mill as Abbott\u2019s and hauled the feed to contract growers for Mitchell were agricultural employees. The Court held that the raising of poultry was within the primary definition of agriculture set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f) and that the feed production and hauling performed by these employees was incident to or in conjunction with the poultry raising venture as preparation of the birds for market.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Counsel for the Board points out that in <em>Strain </em>the truckers hauled the finished product to market, thus falling squarely within \u00a7 3(f)\u2019s definition as performing \u201cdelivery to market.\u201d This faintly distinguishes <em>Strain </em>on its facts but not its principles and ignores <em>Georgia Broiler, </em>which rests on \u201cpreparation for market.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Five years have passed since our <em>Strain </em>decision without' action by the Congress to disturb it. Our sister circuit has since reversed the Board decision in Victor Ryckebosch, Inc., 189 NLRB No. 8, on which the Regional Director in the instant case relied and by which he felt bound, citing and relying on <em>Strain </em>in its opinion. NLRB v. Victor Ryckebosch, Inc., 471 F.2d 20 (9th Cir., 1972). If anything favorable to this Board position has occurred during that period, we have not been advised of it. To enforce this Board order, it would be necessary for us either to overrule <em>Strain </em>or to distinguish withotit differentiating it. We adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
